Preface
On any given day, nearly all of us living in the contemporary United States face sit-
uations or engage in practices that have implications for personal privacy. We
speak on cellular phones in public places, we log on to networked computers that
monitor our activities, we purchase goods and services from companies that keep
personalized profiles of our buying habits, and we visit medical professionals who
retain important personal health information that we assume is kept secure and not
shared with others. These and many other everyday events raise intriguing ques-
tions and should prompt us to think seriously about the changing nature of privacy
in our information-saturated society. The Encyclopedia of Privacy is a timely,
authoritative reference work designed to offer both basic information and insight-
ful analyses of privacy and privacy-related topics and issues. This book is designed
with students and the general reader in mind, although professionals in a variety of
fields will also find it to be an invaluable quick-reference guide and source of a
number of provocative essays. 
By way of introduction to the topic, readers would do well to first consult two
“anchor” essays offered here: Professor Judith DeCew’s wide-ranging treatise on
the philosophical foundations of privacy and Professor Anita Allen’s insightful
entry on the definition of privacy. DeCew traces the deep roots of privacy in the
West, from Aristotle through the major political traditions, most of which have
assumed and theorized some form of distinction between the public and the pri-
vate. In the context of modern philosophical debates, DeCew sees several different
privacy “camps” that she characterizes as “reductionist,” “coherentist,” and “femi-
nist.” Reductionists deny that there is anything coherent or analytically distinctive
or useful about privacy, and generally assert that “privacy rights” are always over-
lapping with, and may be fully explained by, other property rights or rights to
bodily security. Alternatively, coherentists defend the fundamental value of pri-
vacy as, as some claim, helping to define our essence as human beings and to pro-
tect us against demeaning intrusions and affronts to human dignity. Finally, the
feminist critique reminds us that that there is a potential “dark side” to an unwaver-
ing defense of the special status of privacy rights, since these rights may actually
be detrimental to women and others by being used as a shield to mask and maintain
power, control, and abuse. What the feminist position illustrates is that the concept

of individualized “privacy rights” is a highly contested view that may in fact run
counter to other social and democratic values.
Professor Allen helps us to better understand and define privacy by distinguish-
ing physical privacy, informational privacy, decisional privacy, and proprietary
privacy. Allen offers a number of examples of each type of privacy, and the reader
will note that many of the entries in this volume fit these conceptual categories. But
Allen also introduces us to what might be called the “privacy paradox.” As she puts
it, “A nation of extensive privacy laws, with a history and culture of privacy pro-
tection driven by a concern for civil liberties and human rights, the United States is
also a nation in which people can be surprisingly indifferent to privacy and lax
about privacy protection.” We see this all around us; for example, citizens voice
their outrage when a government surveillance program comes to light but with the
same breath advocate the fingerprinting of welfare recipients. While some take a
stand against the adoption of a national identification card, others post intimate pic-
tures of themselves on the Internet. Consumers claim that they very much oppose
companies tracking their shopping habits, and then they routinely and voluntarily
offer personal information in the form of coupons, warranty cards, and contest reg-
istration forms. These and other examples suggest that the contemporary privacy
landscape is quite complex and defies simplistic and nostalgic interpretations that
would have us believe that personal privacy is something that flourished in the past
and is now being systematically destroyed.
This two-volume encyclopedia began with a commitment to try to capture some
of this complexity. It is the product of more than two years’ work and contains 226
entries ranging from brief technical explanations of various computer technologies
to lengthy essays, such as the two outlined above, exploring the philosophical, cul-
tural, and legal bases of our understandings and beliefs about privacy. How did I
decide which topics to include and which ones to leave aside? With the help of my
Advisory Editors, we began by building a global list of possible topics. We scoured
the texts, bibliographies, and indexes of hundreds of scholarly books and articles to
help us identify key concepts, events, legal cases and laws, organizations, techno-
logical developments, major figures, and ethical debates. After creating this
exhaustive list, and keeping in mind the idea that this book would be most useful to
the general reader rather than the specialist, I began the process of reducing the
number of entries to fit the parameters given to me by the publisher. I eliminated
overlap by collapsing topics and focused on, for example, only the court cases that
legal scholarship suggested were most vital. I also worked hard to make sure that
various “standpoints” were reflected in the final entries, especially with regard to
the social dimension of gender. 
Once a “working list” of entries was established, I began inviting experts and
researchers in a variety of fields—the social sciences, law, technology studies,
criminal justice, and others—to contribute entries. More than one hundred of some
of the most noted and accomplished scholars, technology experts, policy practitio-
ners, and privacy advocates representing an amazingly diverse group of perspec-
tives ultimately took up the challenge. In many cases, these individuals suggested
modifications to topics—for example, narrowing or widening the scope or propos-
ing changes to the length of an entry—while others offered the names of potential
contributors. This interactive and cooperative process not only helped me to refine

and improve this book, but it made the final product a truly collaborative effort.
The quality of the essays contributed by these individuals reflects not only the
breadth of scholarship in the field of privacy studies but also their own deep under-
standing of and nuanced approach to the issues at hand. In the end, I believe we
have “mapped” the privacy terrain with its most fundamental landmarks, which
will serve to guide novice researchers in their first excursion into the field.
Locating a topic of interest should be fairly easy. The entries are arranged in a
user-friendly, A-to-Z format. The text of each entry is written for the nonspecialist,
and jargon has been kept to a minimum. Each article explains the term, describes
its importance and relevance to privacy, and often includes concrete examples.
Each entry has been cross-referenced with other, related entries denoted by terms
that are highlighted in bold the first time they appear in a particular entry. Related
subjects that do not happen to be cited in the entry appear in a “See also” section
following many entries. Each entry is also followed by a number of “Suggested
Readings” that offer the user more detailed information on the topic. In addition,
some popular phrases or terms may be incorporated within larger entries. For
example, a reader searching for the computer-related term “cookies” is directed to
the more comprehensive entries “Computer” and “Internet.” 
The first volume begins with an “Alphabetical Listing of Entries” as well as a
“Topical List of Entries.” The latter list should help orient the reader to the major
themes and categories that frame the overall project. This is followed by a “Chro-
nology of Selected Privacy-Related Events,” which includes the dates when gov-
ernment acts became law, court decisions were decreed, and various organizations
were founded. Such a timeline helps establish a historical context and provides a
sense of the trajectory of historical developments. 
A detailed subject index for the entire encyclopedia appears in the last pages of
Volume 2. A more general “Resource Guide” also appears at the end of Volume 2
that includes a selected bibliography of key books on privacy, as well as a list of
relevant websites, organizations, and feature films and documentaries.


Acknowledgments
I have a good number of people to thank for their help on this project. My Advi-
sory Editors, David J. Brown, Susan E. Gallagher, and Jill Joline Myers, devoted
long hours to making this book happen, not only by helping me generate the list
of entries and finding reviewers, but also writing more than two dozen entries
themselves. Brian Zirkle, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of
Kansas, served as Developmental Assistant and, from the outset, brought his
thoughtful, generous, and ultimately indispensable assistance to the project. I
thank you all very much for your help, your cooperative spirit, and your good
cheer.
One of the benefits of embarking on a venture like this is interacting with and
learning from so many different people in a variety of fields. I extend my deep
gratitude to the more than one hundred scholars who offered their time, energy,
and expertise to this endeavor. Their eager willingness to participate and their
dedication to the field of privacy studies and to the public act of scholarship was
truly an inspiration to me. Clearly, this work would not exist without their collec-
tive help. Special thanks, in this regard, go to Anita Allen, Judi DeCew, Linda
Gurak, Doreen Starke-Meyerring, Gary Marx, and Tom Stacey for their major
contributions.
In addition, Maya Bernstein, Bob Gellman, and Dan Solove went beyond their
role as contributors and reviewed my entry list and/or suggested a number of
potential contributors. Matt Dwyer helped organize and edit many of the legal
cases included, which was a tremendous help. Shane McCall served as my
research assistant during the 2004–2005 academic year and skillfully managed to
fill my office with a massive number of books and articles on privacy. The
insightful and challenging students in my SOC600 Seminar in Surveillance and
Social Control in the spring of 2006 were a constant source of stimulation and
amazement. Thanks as well to Steven Ventrano, my former editor at Greenwood
Publishing, for inviting me to take on the project and for his sage advice. 
I have been fortunate enough to maintain an ongoing conversation about my
interest in issues of privacy and surveillance with a number of colleagues,
friends, and family members. They include Bob Antonio, Victor Bailey, Nancy
Baym, Bill Carswell, Dan Deavours, Ted Frederickson, Marilu Goodyear, Allan

A
Abortion
By the time American women reach the age of 45, about one in three will have
had an abortion. Despite its prevalence, the abortion experience is still relegated to
the private realm, while the abortion issue continues to generate a storm of protest
in the public sphere. To understand this paradox, one must consider the history of
abortion, as well as the ideology and tactics of the pro-choice and pro-life move-
ments. The fiercely polarized debate over abortion raises many difficult questions
about privacy: Should abortion have been constitutionally and rhetorically
grounded in the right to privacy? Can a minor have an abortion without parental
consent? If a married woman seeks to terminate a pregnancy, must she notify her
husband? Is the right to privacy meaningless if abortion services are inaccessible?
How do abortion clinics protect patient confidentiality, and can these medical
records be subpoenaed? Should anti-abortion activists be able to broadcast the
identities of abortion providers and patients, and what impact does this have? How
do women manage the stigma of abortion? Will the abortion pill someday enable
women to end unwanted pregnancies in the privacy of their own homes, and could
this depoliticize the issue? Finally, how will the recent changes to the Supreme
Court shape abortion policies and practices in the twenty-first century?
During the first half of the twentieth century, abortions were illegal, secretive,
and heavily stigmatized, but American women still found ways to get them. Work-
ing behind closed doors, some doctors sympathetically aided female patients who
were desperate to terminate unwanted pregnancies. In the 1950s and 1960s, women
of privilege were sometimes able to get approval from hospital committees for
“therapeutic” abortions, while poor women and women of color were more likely
to have to rely on self-induced or back-alley abortions, which were painful, life-
threatening, and even more covert. In public discourse, this subject was taboo. The
Sheri Finkbine case was the first to shine the national spotlight on abortion. During
her pregnancy in 1962, Finkbine had been given thalidomide, a tranquilizer that
was later discovered to produce severe birth defects. When she went public with
her story in order to warn others about the dangers of this drug, the hospital where
she was planning to go canceled her scheduled abortion, and she was forced to
travel to Sweden for the procedure. Two years later, a German measles outbreak in

the United States resulted in the births of over 20,000 congenitally abnormal
babies. Awareness of this situation drove thousands of women to terminate their
pregnancies, and it also prompted scrutiny of the restrictive abortion laws by both
the medical community and the public.
The 1960s brought technological advances in birth control, a sexual revolution,
and a climate that was ripe for social protest. During this decade, the second wave
of the feminist movement was instrumental in mobilizing support for abortion
rights since the abortion issue fit well with the feminist battle cry at the time: “The
Personal Is Political.” In the late 1960s, the National Abortion Rights Action
League (NARAL) appeared on the political scene, and in Chicago activists created
the legendary underground abortion network known as “Jane.” 
The Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) decision, which legalized abortion in 1973,
was in many ways a response to this changing social climate and to state-level efforts
to reform abortion laws. Some states, like New York, had already lifted their bans on
abortion. The case of Roe v. Wade involved a challenge to a Texas law, which made
abortion a criminal act unless a woman’s life was in danger. The Supreme Court
determined that the inferred right to privacy in the Constitution was “broad enough to
encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” Previ-
ously, the Court had used a similar rationale to strike down statutes prohibiting mar-
ried couples’ use of birth control (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 1965) and
criminalizing the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people (Eisenstadt v.
Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 1972). In Roe, the Court used a “strict scrutiny” standard, which
provides the highest level of constitutional protection for Americans’ most funda-
mental rights. However, the right to privacy for women’s decisions about pregnancy
was not absolute: the Roe decision stipulated that a state could claim a “compelling”
interest in preserving life once the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb. 
Framing abortion as a personal privacy issue for women has been advantageous for
the pro-choice movement. Signs at pro-choice rallies boldly proclaim these messages:
“Keep Your Laws Off My Body” and “U.S. Out of My Uterus.” Perhaps even more
resonant are the slogans that underscore the individual’s right to freedom, like “My
Body, My Choice.” The notion of self-determination is fundamental to the American
value system. In contrast, radical feminist claims for “abortion on demand” have
never been palatable for mainstream audiences. Feminist scholars and legal analysts
have debated the efficacy of grounding reproductive rights in privacy as opposed to
other possibilities such as the right to health care, the right to equal protection, or the
right to consent to bodily intrusion by a fetus. For example, philosophy professor and
founder of the National Network of Abortion Funds, Marlene Gerber Fried, sees the
rhetoric about abortion as a “private choice” as limited, isolating, and ironically
counter to the feminist claim that the personal is political.
The pro-life movement comes at this issue from an entirely different perspec-
tive. In this view, the right to privacy pales in comparison with the right to life.
Scholars like Kristin Luker, author of Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood,
explain that competing world-views are at the heart of the conflict over abortion.
For pro-life activists, abortion not only represents the destruction of human life, but
it also symbolizes a decline in traditional family values. The legalization of abor-
tion galvanized the pro-life opposition, as movement successes often do, and it
fueled a new era of clashes in judicial, political, and social arenas. Organizations

like the National Right to Life Committee and Operation Rescue (now called Oper-
ation Save America) emerged as fierce challengers. According to the National
Abortion Federation, which tracks legislative initiatives, 500 bills that would fur-
ther restrict abortion services were introduced in Congress in 2005, and 26 were
signed into law. The pro-life movement’s tenacity in pursuing restrictive legislation
and its tactical ingenuity have often forced the pro-choice movement into a defen-
sive posture. 
The legal precedent that was set in Roe has endured for over three decades, but
in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992), the Court
introduced a new standard that allows states to place restrictions on abortion prior
to fetal viability, provided that these do not constitute an “undue burden” to the
woman. As part of this decision, parental consent laws and waiting periods were
allowed, but requiring a woman to inform her husband was considered a substantial
obstacle and was therefore deemed unconstitutional. 
According to a 2005 Gallup Poll, 64 percent of Americans said they would be in
favor of a law requiring that the husband of a married woman be notified if the
woman decided to have an abortion. An even higher percentage favored parental
consent laws for minors. Opponents stress that most teens do involve a parent or
other trusted adult in the decision to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, and that
minors are allowed to make other confidential decisions about medical care. For
example, all 50 states grant minors the authority to approve the diagnosis and treat-
ment of sexually transmitted diseases. Currently, 34 states have some type of
parental involvement stipulation regarding the decision to terminate a pregnancy. In
Arkansas, for example, the minor must bring her parent or guardian, or provide that
person’s notarized signature as an indication of consent, to the clinic. Some states
allow minors to obtain a judicial bypass in recognition of the fact that some teens
may be victims of incest or subject to abuse if parents were to find out about the
pregnancy. There is evidence that parental consent laws increase the likelihood of
second-trimester procedures, but these laws may also lower rates of sexual activity,
pregnancy, and abortion for young women. 
Poor and rural women’s access to abortion has also been curtailed. With the cost
of a first-trimester surgical abortion averaging around $400, the cost of this proce-
dure is prohibitive for many women. In addition, 87 percent of U.S. counties lack
even a single abortion provider. In states like Wyoming, women must drive hun-
dreds of miles or travel to neighboring states for abortion services. Waiting periods
can be particularly taxing for women who have to travel out of state. Although
there has been a drop in the number of abortions in recent years, there is an insuffi-
cient geographic distribution of abortion providers. In large cities, the situation
may be different, In Detroit, for example, abortion clinic owners compete for
patients. Some try to gain a competitive edge by offering a more private, spa-like
atmosphere, complete with amenities like aromatherapy candles and relaxing
music.
This example contrasts dramatically with the emotionally charged battleground
outside many abortion clinics. The front lines of the abortion wars have been
chronicled extensively. In some places, pro-life activists assemble in peaceable
prayer vigils or offer sidewalk counseling and resources to women who are con-
flicted about their decision. In other places, women must run what they describe as

an intimidating gauntlet of protestors, where they are subjected to gruesome photo-
graphs of bloodied fetal parts, pleas of “Don’t kill your baby!” and even threats like
“God will punish you!” Members of Operation Save America, who participate in
blockades do so in an impassioned effort to compel women to turn away from what
the protesters see as the horrors of abortion. Although some women are able to
deflect anti-abortion accusations with hostility, others feel shaken, invaded, or tear-
ful. To offset this emotionally taxing journey, clinic workers may try to create a
safe space inside the clinic. This can be done with sympathetic reassurances or
with security measures like bulletproof glass. While some women feel more at ease
with these safeguards to protect their privacy, others perceive the lock-down system
as prisonlike and frightening.
Security systems are used to protect clinic workers and patients from sieges,
bombings, arson, anthrax, stalking, and violence. Many equate these acts perpe-
trated by the radical fringe of the anti-abortion movement with terrorism, although
those who have murdered abortion doctors see themselves as protecting the lives of
unborn babies. Two important victories for the pro-choice movement in this regard
came in 1994. The first was the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which
makes it a federal offense for any person to threaten, attempt to sabotage, or engage
in destructive acts against clinics, or to use violent behavior directed at clinic per-
sonnel with the purpose of blocking reproductive health services. The second was
Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, in which the Supreme Court ruled that a 36-
foot buffer zone protecting clinic entrances and a ban on disruptive noise do not
curtail the protestors’ rights to free speech: “The First Amendment does not
demand that patients at a medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to escape the
cacophony of political protests.” 
In addition to protesting against those seeking abortions, anti-abortion activists
have tried to increase the emotional costs for abortion providers. Protestors have
picketed outside providers’ homes, tracked them with binoculars and cameras, and
posted identifying information about them and their families. In 1995 the Ameri-
can Coalition of Life Activists (ACLA) distributed wanted posters for a dozen
abortion providers who they charged were “Guilty of Crimes Against Humanity.”
In 1997 Neal Horsley’s compendium Nuremberg Files website made headlines
because the names of abortion providers who had been murdered were struck out,
making it look very much like a hit list. Unlike handing out leaflets, posting infor-
mation on the Internet can reach millions of people in a matter of seconds. Such
activities affect the privacy rights that help protect abortion providers from harass-
ment and danger. At the state and local levels, laws, ordinances, and injunctions
have been sought to restrict these kinds of activities. The Driver’s Privacy Protec-
tion Act of 1994 made it more difficult to obtain personal information based on
names and license plates. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Fran-
cisco ruled in Planned Parenthood v. ACLA that the wanted posters were dissemi-
nated to intimidate doctors and constituted a “true threat” of violence. The
plaintiffs were awarded $109 million in damages. 
Anti-abortion activists also have made attempts to uncloak patient privacy.
Although it is difficult to estimate the extent to which these strategies are used,
there have been reports of women who have received abortions being tracked down
by phone calls, finding anti-abortion literature on their doorsteps, and having their

family members or acquaintances informed of their abortion decision. In 2001 a
woman in Illinois was taken from an abortion clinic to a hospital for the repair of a
cervical tear. As she was wheeled out to the ambulance, a protestor took her picture
and uploaded it to the Missionaries to the Unborn website, along with information
that had been obtained about her hospitalization, age, medical history, family, and
hometown. The patient sued the hospital for failing to protect her medical records,
as well as the anti-abortion activists for “publicly humiliating her.” In 2002 a web-
site called abortioncams.com was launched, with the explicit goal of shaming
“homicidal mothers” and deterring them from entering abortion clinics. Anti-
abortion activists have claimed that women going to clinics are using public streets,
and that the activists’ “journalistic” right to take pictures is protected by the First
Amendment. Opponents counter that women going to a clinic to obtain abortions is
not a newsworthy event, and that having their pictures taken is emotionally dis-
tressing to the women. 
To help protect patient privacy, some clinics enlist volunteers to escort patients.
Women’s faces can also be shielded from protestors with umbrellas, or clients can
be encouraged to use private entrances. Yellow-page advertisements for abortion
providers almost always mention confidentiality. Although the procedures for pro-
tecting privacy vary, options of one-on-one counseling, official notices of privacy
practices relating to medical records, and forms to indicate preferences regarding
follow-up contact may be available. Particularly in smaller communities, a woman
might worry about her car being seen in the clinic parking lot or her name being
called out in the waiting room. In larger clinics, women may feel they are “herded
like cattle” into an open recovery area, or there may be only a thin curtain prevent-
ing a woman from being exposed as she undergoes a pelvic exam or reacts with an
emotional display. Like providers, patients need privacy to protect them from pos-
sible retaliation. Privacy may also enable them to make decisions free from the
influence of others and to avoid being judged for their choices. 
The question of whether abortion is morally right or wrong continues to be
debated, and the public is sharply divided. According to a 2006 Gallup Poll, 53 per-
cent of Americans consider themselves to be pro-choice, while 42 percent consider
themselves to be pro-life. A strong, consistent, majority have supported a woman’s
right to an abortion under dire circumstances—in cases where the mother’s life is
in danger, when conception occurred during rape, or if genetic tests confirm fetal
abnormality—but fewer are supportive of abortion under any conditions. 
Consequently, women confide with great trepidation, often testing the waters
before revealing information. Abortion is usually a closely guarded secret because
it is still stigmatized and associated with sexual irresponsibility, although certainly
some women do not adopt that point of view. In Stigma: Notes on the Management
of Spoiled Identity, sociologist Erving Goffman explains that individuals can man-
age stigma by dividing up their social world, which entails sharing the discrediting
information with a relatively small group while concealing it from everyone else. A
woman who has an abortion may also try to pretend that everything is okay
because she does not want to burden others with the knowledge. Ultimately,
this code of silence isolates women from their support networks and renders
women who have had abortions invisible in our society. In 2002 approximately

6
Abortion
\
1.29 million abortions were performed in the United States, but personal stories
were available infrequently because the abortion experience is so very private. 
The abortion pill has the potential to make the abortion experience even more
private. Emergency contraception, also referred to as Plan B or the morning-after
pill, prevents implantation. It is effective for 72 hours after contraceptive failure or
unprotected sex. RU-486, which can be used within 49 days of conception, was
approved by the FDA in 2000. At the present time, this “medical abortion” typi-
cally involves multiple trips to a clinic. In the first visit, a woman takes mifepris-
tone to block progesterone, without which the lining of the uterus breaks down,
ending the pregnancy. This is followed by misoprostol, which causes the uterus to
contract and empty. In the final visit, the clinician uses a blood test or an ultrasound
to ensure that the abortion is complete. The reviews of this procedure are mixed.
Some women feel that it is less invasive, more natural, more like a miscarriage,
more humane, relatively easy, not terribly painful, and more private. Others report
considerable bleeding, cramping, nausea, and pain from passing the embryo. They
also express worries about expelling the material outside of a controlled clinical
setting. The drugs may also suppress the immune system and make women more
vulnerable to infections. Clinic workers have speculated about the potential of
medical abortion to diffuse anti-abortion demonstrations. 
Before he took office, President George W. Bush boldly stated, “I do not like
abortions. I will do everything in my power to restrict abortions.” Bush’s former
attorney general, John Ashcroft, in an effort to defend the federal “partial-birth”
abortion ban, sought sensitive medical records of more than a thousand women
who had received abortion care. His attorneys argued that “individuals no longer
possess a reasonable expectation their histories will remain completely confiden-
tial.” Bush’s long-awaited opportunity to nominate justices to the Supreme Court
finally came in 2005. The appointments of Chief Justice John Roberts and Judge
Samuel Alito have been accompanied by a surge in anti-abortion initiatives. In
March 2006 Republican Governor Mike Rounds of South Dakota signed a restric-
tive abortion ban, which is intended to be a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. As pro-
choice organizations mobilize supporters to prevent this law from taking effect,
similar abortion bans are pending in at least 10 other states. According to a poll
taken by the Pew Research Center in 2005, only 32 percent of Americans would
like to see Roe v. Wade overturned. But in an ABC News–Washington Post poll that
same year, 42 percent said they want to make abortion harder to get. At this historic
moment, Justice Harry A. Blackmun’s words in the dissenting opinion in Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services (1989) appear even more prophetic: “Women of this
Nation still retain the liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident and
very ominous, and a chill wind blows.”

Adoption
In historical terms, the legal institution of adoption in the United States is rela-
tively new. It was between the mid-1800s and the 1920s that the states began to
pass laws providing for the adoption of children. Before then children had been
adopted informally and in some instances by individual legislative acts, or they had
come to live with other families under indenture contracts or as a result of legisla-
tion authorizing charitable organizations to place children. Under these new adop-
tion statutes, initially the court records of adoptions were not subject to
confidentiality, and adopted children were not issued new birth certificates. Over
time, states began to issue new birth certificates and, gradually, to close adoption
records—to the public, to all parties to the adoption except for the adult adoptee,
and ultimately (in almost all the states by 1990) to the adult adopted individuals
themselves. 
The notion of privacy is a complex one in relation to adult adoptees’ access to
their own original birth certificates. Denying adult adoptees access preserves the
secrecy of the birth parent’s identity, but it also keeps information about the adop-
tee’s own birth and identity secret. Beginning in the late 1960s and the 1970s, a
movement to restore adult adoptees’ access to their records has been led by a coali-
tion of adoptees, birth parents, and adoptive parents. In response to this movement,
a number of states have opened to adult adoptees birth records that were not closed
at the time of their births, and have prospectively provided for such access in future
adoptions. A number of other states also have opened original birth records that
were closed at the time they were prepared. Mechanisms established in most of
these states to protect birth parents’ privacy consist of either “contact vetoes,”
which permit birth parents to choose whether they wish to be contacted by adop-
tees, or “disclosure vetoes,” which permit birth parents to prohibit the release of
identifying information. Many other states have considered but not enacted similar
“open records” legislation. Opponents of the legislation argue that it violates prom-
ises of confidentiality and denies the privacy of birth parents. In legal challenges to
the laws that have opened records, the courts have held that neither state law nor
the U.S. Constitution guarantees lifelong anonymity for birth parents.

Adoption
\
The 1930s were a key period in the history of adoption records. States then
began providing for the issuance of new birth certificates in which the adoptive par-
ents’ names were substituted for the birth parents’ names. Also during the 1930s
and early 1940s, many states enacted laws to make adoption records confidential.
Most of these laws restricted access to the parties to the proceedings. By the mid-
1940s more than half the states reportedly protected adoption court records from
public inspection. By 1955, according to legal commentators of the time, it had
become commonplace and noncontroversial to make the records available only by
court order, and to keep the original birth certificates available to adult adoptees but
make them accessible to others only by court order. 
Rapid changes in state laws continued, however, and by 1960 twenty-eight states
reported to the federal government that they made original birth certificates avail-
able only by court order, although in a number of those states access to court
records remained available to the parties of the proceedings. Twenty states reported
making original birth certificates available on demand to adult adoptees. Of those
states, four closed the birth records to adult adoptees as well as to the public in the
1960s, seven more did so in the 1970s, and another seven did so after 1979. Two
states, Alaska and Kansas, never closed the original birth records to adult adoptees.
In the period from the 1930s through the 1960s, the reasons proffered for clos-
ing adoption records were, first, to protect adoptees and their families from public
disclosure of the circumstances of the adoptee’s birth and, second, in adoptions in
which the adoptive parents and birth parents did not know one another, to protect
adoptees and their adoptive families from interference or harassment by birth par-
ents. Many commentators and courts later assumed that one important reason for
closing the records was to permanently conceal the identities of birth parents; how-
ever, in the legal, social service, and other social science literature of the time there
is virtually no discussion of the need to protect birth parents from adult adoptees
who might seek information about their original families. On the contrary, leading
legal and social service authorities in the 1940s and 1950s recommended that orig-
inal birth certificates remain available to adult adoptees. This was the recommenda-
tion, for example, of the United States Children’s Bureau, one of the most
influential national voices in adoption law and practice; it was echoed by the Amer-
ican Association of Registration Executives and in the first Uniform Adoption Act,
which was promoted in 1953 by the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws. The surrender documents that many birth mothers signed
required them to promise not to search out their children or their children’s adop-
tive families, and in many cases the adoptive parents retained documents that con-
tained the birth mother’s name. With respect to counseling birth mothers, the most
influential private child welfare organization, the Child Welfare League of Amer-
ica, advised adoption services providers to make it clear to birth mothers that they
have no right to any information about the children they placed for adoption. 
It is only possible to speculate as to why many states were closing birth records
to adult adoptees when the stated reasons for doing so related only to protection of
the adoptee and adoptive family, and when adoption services and adoption law
experts were recommending keeping original birth certificates available to adult
adoptees. The policy of closing records to adult adoptees appears to have been
associated with changing ideas about adoption rather than with remedying any

Adoption

problems that had arisen as a result of adult adoptee access. As records were closed
generally to the public and then to the parties, and as adoption increasingly came to
be seen as a perfect substitute for family formation via childbirth, it appears that
lifelong secrecy came to be regarded as an essential feature of adoptions in which
birth and adoptive parents are unknown to one another.
After World War II adoption became increasingly popular in an atmosphere that
strongly encouraged the establishment of traditional families and in which
nature—that is, genetic inheritance—was no longer viewed as more important than
nurture—or environment—in the development of children. Psychological literature
began to portray unmarried, expecting white women, at least, as having become
pregnant because of emotional problems. If these women placed their children for
adoption, they could avoid the powerful stigma attached to unwed motherhood, and
could be helped to become stable wives and mothers later on. In the process, infer-
tile couples would have an opportunity to form families. Adoption agencies
increasingly engaged in “matching” practices, attempting to carefully match
infants and adoptive parents on the basis of socioeconomic status and expected
intellectual capacity, as well as physical characteristics. If adoptive families were
truly to be no different from biological ones, then the sealing of records would
make their legal documentary existence identical. Closed records, of course, would
also shield adoption arrangements from later scrutiny, to the advantage of less-
than-scrupulous adoption providers.
As lifelong secrecy became viewed as a desirable if not essential feature of
adoption, adult adoptees who sought information about their birth families increas-
ingly were seen as emotionally disturbed and ungrateful, and even as posing a
threat to their birth parents. In opposition to such attitudes, and inspired in part by
several books by adoptees—including social worker Jean Paton, adoptees’ rights
advocate Florence Fisher, and psychologist Betty Jean Lifton—a nationwide advo-
cacy movement developed in the 1960s and early 1970s seeking greater openness
in adoption, including adult adoptee access to original birth certificates. In the fol-
lowing years, adoptees individually sought access to records, arguing in court, usu-
ally without success, that there was good cause for opening their records.
Collectively, adoptees argued in court, again usually unsuccessfully, that they had a
constitutional right to the information in their records. At the same time, studies
were showing that most birth parents either were willing or wished to be contacted
by the child or children they had relinquished. Other studies, professionals involved
in adoption, and national professional organizations began characterizing adoptees’
interest in their birth families as a normal and natural part of adoption. By the end
of the century, the movement for greater openness had led to the creation of hun-
dreds of mutual support organizations and search services for adoptees and birth
parents seeking information about or contact with one another.
In 1980 an advisory panel of the U.S. Children’s Bureau drafted a model state
adoption act under which adult adoptees would have access to both original birth
certificates and court records. After receiving negative comments on the draft, how-
ever, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare ultimately promulgated a
model law dealing only with the adoption of children with special needs. Instead of
opening adoption records, many states began establishing passive or active mutual
consent registries, or both, through which adoptees and birth relatives could

10
Adoption
\
exchange information or make contact. In passive registries both parties must regis-
ter and provide sufficiently detailed and accurate information to establish a match;
success rates for those using these registries are very low. In active registry systems
one party, most often the adult adoptee, can register and have an intermediary con-
duct a search for the birth parents.
Whether today’s adult adoptees are successful in their search for information
about birth relatives depends on factors such as the information the adoptive fami-
lies already have in their possession; the luck, experience, and resources adoptees
have in their search for birth relatives, often including the funds they have available
for hiring private assistance; and the states in which they were born and adopted. In
recent years, four states have opened to adult adoptees records that had been sealed
when they were adopted, one state has agreed to open records to adult adoptees
unless a birth parent has filed a disclosure veto, an additional number of states have
opened records prospectively and have opened records that were not closed at the
time the adoptions were made, and both Alaska and Kansas have continued to pro-
vide unrestricted access to original birth certificates by adult adoptees.
Tennessee was the first of the four states that in recent years have provided unre-
stricted access to adult adoptees. In 1995 Tennessee enacted legislation allowing
adoptees who are at least 21 years old to access their original birth certificates as
well as the court and agency records of their adoptions. Protection of the privacy of
birth parents whose children were born after the date records were closed is pro-
vided by a contact veto system (and a disclosure veto option for living birth parents
in cases of rape or incest). Birth parents and other specified birth relatives may reg-
ister their willingness or unwillingness to have contact, and contact initiated in vio-
lation of a contact veto is both a misdemeanor and grounds for a civil suit. In 1998
Oregon citizens voted in a ballot initiative for a state constitutional amendment
allowing adoptees 21 years of age and older to receive copies of their original birth
certificates upon request. Birth parents may file contact preference forms on which
they indicate whether they would like to be contacted and, if so, whether they
would prefer to be contacted through an intermediary. Alabama, in 2000, and most
recently New Hampshire, in 2004, also passed laws under which adult adoptees
may receive copies of their original birth certificates upon request. In both of those
states, birth parents may file contact preference forms to indicate whether they
wish to be contacted directly, whether they wish to be contacted through an inter-
mediary, or whether they would prefer not to be contacted but have an updated
medical form available to the adoptee. 
In Delaware, under a law that took effect in 1999, birth parents may file a disclo-
sure veto blocking the release of identifying information. The veto must be period-
ically renewed. When an adult who was adopted before the law was enacted
requests a copy of an original birth certificate, and there is no veto on file, the state
attempts to notify the birth parents. Sixty-five days after the request, if no veto has
been filed as a result of the state’s efforts, a copy is provided to the adoptee. Similar
options to the disclosure veto are available in the states that have opened records
prospectively. These states include Colorado, Hawaii, Maryland, Montana,
Nevada, Oklahoma, Washington, and Vermont. States that have re-opened some
records that were not sealed when the adoptions took place include Ohio, Michigan,
and Montana.

Adoption

Both Tennessee’s and Oregon’s laws providing adult adoptees with access to
records were challenged unsuccessfully in court. The parties challenging the Ten-
nessee law—two unnamed birth mothers, an adoptive couple, and a child-placing
agency—argued in federal court that the law violates the constitutional rights of
birth mothers to familial privacy, to reproductive privacy, and to the nondisclosure
of private information. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in
1997 held, first, that the law does not interfere with any constitutional right to
marry and bring up children or with any right individuals may have to either adopt
or give up children for adoption. Second, the court held that the right to give up a
child for adoption is not part of a constitutional right to reproductive privacy, and
that even if it were, such a right would not be unduly burdened by the law. Finally,
the court held that the Constitution does not include a general right to nondisclo-
sure of private information. 
The challengers then filed suit in state court, claiming that the law impairs the
vested rights of birth parents who surrendered children under prior law, and also
that it violates the right to privacy guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution. In its
1999 decision, the Supreme Court of Tennessee noted that early adoption statutes
had not sealed records, and that later amendments permitted disclosure to an adop-
tee if a court found that disclosure was in the adoptee’s and the public’s best inter-
est. The court concluded, therefore, that there had never been “an absolute
guarantee or even a reasonable expectation” that records were permanently sealed
(Doe v. Sundquist 1999, 925). The court explained that when courts made determi-
nations that records should be disclosed, there was no requirement that birth par-
ents be notified. In addition, the court held that under the Tennessee Constitution,
the law does not infringe on familial privacy rights related to marrying and having
children, does not interfere with the right to procreational privacy, and does not
implicate any right to nondisclosure of personal information. 
Similarly, the Oregon law was challenged in the state courts. In a 1999 decision
of the Oregon Court of Appeals, to which the Oregon Supreme Court denied
review, the court’s reasoning was similar to that of the Tennessee Supreme Court.
According to the court, Oregon adoption laws had never “prevented all dissemina-
tion of information concerning the identities of birth mothers. At no time in Ore-
gon’s history have the adoption laws required the consent of, or even notice to, a
birth mother on the opening of adoption records or sealed birth certificates” (Does v.
State 1999, 832). The court further noted that under Oregon law, the decision to
seal the original certificate was within the discretion not of birth parents but of the
adoptive parents, the adoptee, or the court granting the adoption. The court con-
cluded that earlier state law had not indicated any intent to enter into a statutory
contract with birth mothers to prevent disclosure of their identities and, therefore,
the new law does not impair obligations of contract in violation of the Oregon Con-
stitution. If employees of private entities or even state agents misrepresent state
law, the court said, they cannot bind the state to arrangements in contravention of
state law.
Rejecting the challengers’ additional claims that the law violates state and fed-
eral constitutional rights to privacy, the Oregon court noted that adoption had been
unknown at common law, that early adoption statutes had no provisions for protect-
ing the identity of birth mothers, and that there is neither a fundamental right to

12

\
place a child for adoption nor a correlative right to place a child for adoption under
circumstances that guarantee her anonymity. Unlike a unilateral decision to prevent
pregnancy or not to carry a pregnancy to term, placing a child for adoption
“requires, at a minimum, a willing birth mother, a willing adoptive parent, and the
active oversight and approval of the state” (see Does v. State 1999, 836).

Airborne surveillance and intelligence
A technique employed principally by large state or corporate actors, the collec-
tion by airborne devices of electromagnetic (EM) signals and emissions from the
earth’s surface or atmosphere has existed for over 140 years. Insofar as privacy can
be equated with the ability to conceal or control one’s communications and infor-
mation about oneself, the relevance of airborne surveillance and intelligence to
issues of privacy is twofold. First, in many ways, EM emissions are regarded as
passing through public space, and so the information they contain is generally con-
sidered outside the realm of privacy. Technological innovation and industry com-
mercialization, however, have complicated this situation through their expansion of
the detail, scope, and applications of airborne surveillance. Second, privacy and
security are typically regarded as being in opposition, such that trade-offs are
depicted as necessary to achieve a balance between the conflicting interests of state
security and individual privacy. Telephones may be wiretapped, for example, if
law enforcement officers suspect they might be used in planning terrorist activities.
In contrast, airborne surveillance marks a circumstance wherein security is made
analogous to privacy: the ability of states and organizations to conceal and control
their communications or information about themselves can be significantly eroded
through airborne surveillance.
Airborne platforms offer a number of surveillance advantages, including an
unobstructed, panoramic view of the earth’s surface (even of hostile or difficult-to-
reach regions), better atmospheric clarity, reduced EM noise, and the relative safety
and inconspicuousness afforded by high altitude. Most recently, unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) have offered the possibility of robotic or remote control, thereby
placing no humans at risk. As early as the end of the eighteenth century, the French
employed observers in balloons to help direct artillery fire against distant enemies.
Beginning hardly more than a decade after the development of the daguerreotype in

Airborne surveillance and intelligence
\
13
1839, and continuing through the present, groups have collected photographs (both
secretly and overtly) from balloons, dirigibles, kites, aircraft, rockets, and most
recently, orbital satellites. This activity—usually referred to as remote sensing—
has been highly refined since first proposed for survey applications in the 1850s;
today it is a highly specialized technical discipline and a growing commercial
enterprise. 
The advent of radio communication in the early 1900s opened up the possibility
of broadcast signal interception, and today informative electromagnetic signals of
many types are readily intercepted by airborne platforms, a technical practice
referred to as signals intelligence, or SIGINT. Not only communications signals,
but emissions associated with aircraft and ship operations, weapons control radars,
and nuclear detonations are routinely monitored. Principally a tool of government
intelligence organizations, SIGINT powerfully shaped international relations in the
twentieth century (as did remote sensing), and its use marks a regime in which
issues of “privacy” arise primarily in the guise of “state security.”
Airborne surveillance systems are divided into two broad categories, active and
passive. Active systems rely on the “illumination” of a subject or “target” by a
transmitting source—a laser or radar beam, for example—and the reception of the
reflected portion of that source’s transmissions. Examples of this type include the
U.S. military’s AWACS aircraft and the Canadian RadarSAT satellite. Passive sys-
tems (which include the majority of airborne surveillance systems) depend either
on emissions from the subject itself—the infrared emissions from human bodies,
for example, or signals from a radio device such as a cellular telephone—or on
“natural” illumination (i.e., the sun, moon, or EM radiation from the target’s sur-
roundings). In some instances, particularly in the realm of international policy, air-
borne surveillance may be restricted on the basis of whether it is done actively or
passively, since active transmissions are effectively treated as an intrusion, while
passive emissions are considered in the public domain. This understanding is not
unequivocal, however. U.S. courts have typically held that emissions that escape
from within private buildings and residences—excessive thermal emissions associ-
ated with the cultivation of illegal crops, for example—are private property, and
their interception without a warrant (even from outside the building) can constitute
illegal search and seizure.
A number of developments in airborne remote sensing have brought its privacy
implications to the fore in recent years. First, innovations in electronics and electro-
optics have improved system resolution (the ability to resolve detail and distinguish
fine differences in color or brightness), shortened processing time, and extended
system coverage around the clock and around the globe. These improvements have
enabled a broad variety of previously infeasible applications, both military and
civil. Aside from surveilling or planning the movements of troops and equipment,
remote sensing has been successfully employed in the monitoring of refugee
flows, weapons proliferation, famine, genocide, and other humanitarian disasters,
as well as in the support of law enforcement, mapping and surveying, journalism,
environmental health assessment, verification of environmental treaty compliance,
forest fire control, detection of toxic releases, inventory of natural resources, natu-
ral disaster mitigation, urban planning and development, resource prospecting, and
scientific research. This proliferation of civil applications has increased pressure on

14
Air travel
\
state governments to privatize the industry and has fostered a growing commerce in
airborne and satellite imagery.
In another parallel with information technologies (IT) generally, the exchange of
aerial image data has intensified, thanks largely to the growth of digital technolo-
gies and the Internet. While a far sight from the Orwellian scenario in which any-
one who can afford it can continuously monitor the daily movement and activities
of specific individuals, the online stores of several commercial imagery providers
have hawked aerial images “of one’s own house” since the beginning of the
twenty-first century. As outlined in President Truman’s 1955 “Open Skies” doc-
trine (intended to promote “mutual transparency” between the United States and
the Soviet Union), legal distinctions between the “airspace” over a nation as sover-
eign territory and “low earth orbit” as an international commons not unlike the
open ocean has placed satellite-borne surveillance systems on a unique regulatory
landscape. It is by virtue of international policies built on that doctrine that the
TIROS weather satellites, the Landsat system for earth observation, and today’s
commercial high-resolution satellites (IKONOS and Quickbird, for example) have
been able to provide increasingly detailed imagery irrespective of which nation
controls the imaged terrain. The shifts fostered by airborne surveillance—the shift
toward transparency and disclosure as political objectives, the shift toward an open
market for aerial images and other data—are noteworthy less because of the chal-
lenges they imply for individual privacy than because of the analogous challenges
they raise for state and corporate privacy.

Air travel
Air travel privacy has underpinnings in several constitutional protections and various
court decisions, including those related to freedom of association, interstate travel, and
the right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. In the heavily regulated air
transportation industry, however, increased security measures have limited passengers’
expectations of privacy in airports and on airplanes. Furthermore, while aviation secu-
rity has traditionally focused on the physical screening of people and baggage, passen-
gers’ personal information is increasingly a focal point for security measures.
Before the 1960s, security measures for domestic air travel were relatively cur-
sory. After several hijackings around the world in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
however, the Federal Aviation Administration required that all passengers and

luggage must be searched prior to flight. Airports began using magnetometers, or
metal detectors, to physically screen passengers for concealed metal weapons. When
the constitutionality of magnetometer searches was challenged, numerous courts
determined that the government’s interest in requiring such searches justified the
invasion of passengers’ privacy.
The United States government began using “watch lists” to prescreen passen-
gers in the early 1990s. These lists contain information about people known or
thought to pose a risk to aviation security. An individual whose name appears on
the “no fly” list is not permitted to board an airplane. People on the “selectee” list
must undergo additional screening before they are permitted to fly. Some people
with names similar to those on watch lists have experienced delays and extensive
screening during air travel.
Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States and other
countries have worked to establish new and effective forms of aviation security. The
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an agency within the Department of
Homeland Security, is specifically tasked with assessing threats to domestic air trans-
portation. Since 9/11, the agency has instituted numerous aviation security measures,
such as requiring passengers to show photo identification to board an airplane. The
United States has also begun developing methods of advanced passenger prescreen-
ing. Shortly after the terrorist attacks, the TSA proposed the creation of a comprehen-
sive prescreening system that would use passengers’ personal information to verify
their identities and to make threat assessments. The proposal was abandoned in 2004
because of privacy and other concerns, and the agency began developing a second
prescreening system that would rely heavily on government watch lists. 
The government and private sector are also exploring the utility of a “trusted traveler”
system, in which travelers would volunteer personal information and biometric iden-
tifiers such as fingerprints and iris scans. The government would compare these data
to information maintained in public and private databases to assess each passenger’s risk
level. If cleared, the passenger would be permitted to go through shorter lines at airport
security checkpoints and possibly be subject to less intense physical screening.

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organiza-
tion that works to protect and uphold the United States’ Bill of Rights. Traditionally,

16
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
\
the organization has focused primarily on guaranteeing individuals’ rights to free
expression, equal protection under the law, due process, and privacy. 
The ACLU was officially formed in 1920 by a group of social activists that
included Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, and Albert DeSilver. The organization
grew out of the movement to protect conscientious objection and free speech dur-
ing World War I. Since then, the ACLU has held a consistent, prominent position in
the discussion of constitutional rights and their relation to contemporary issues.
Throughout its history, the organization has taken strong public stances on a variety
of civil liberty issues, including those related to school prayer, obscene materials,
abortion, drug decriminalization, public demonstration, and privacy invasion.
After extensive growth during the opening years of this century, the ACLU now
claims more than 400,000 members in state and local chapters nationwide. It is
headquartered in New York City, with a sizable national legislative office in Wash-
ington, D.C. However, most of the organization’s work is conducted by its state and
local affiliates, of which there are over 50. Annual dues and contributions from
members provide the ACLU’s primary financial support, although it also receives
some grants from private foundations and individuals. The ACLU does not receive
government funding. Additionally, the organization is politically unaligned; it does
not officially support or oppose political candidates or ideologies. It operates under
the belief that everyone’s rights are threatened if one person’s rights are not pro-
tected. As a result of maintaining this absolutist approach to civil liberties, the
organization has drawn criticism for defending such controversial groups as Nazis,
Communists, and the Ku Klux Klan. 
In its work to protect civil liberties, the ACLU pursues a variety of initiatives,
including community-based activism and legislative lobbying. Still, its most prom-
inent and effective efforts have been in the nation’s courts, as the organization reg-
ularly takes on cases in which civil liberties are possibly threatened. The
organization handles close to 6000 such court cases each year, and it appears
before the United States Supreme Court more than any other group outside of the
federal government. In those civil liberty cases where it is not directly involved,
the ACLU also frequently submits amicus curiae briefs in support of its position.
The ACLU has at times referred to itself as “the nation’s largest law firm,” a
claim that is supported by the organization’s national network of local offices and
its corps of nearly 5000 affiliated attorneys. 
These extensive legal resources have been key to the organization’s development
and to its success in the courtroom. With them, the ACLU has influenced a variety
of notable court decisions. For instance, the organization provided defense counsel
in such landmark cases as Stromberg v. California (symbolic speech), Engel v.
Vitale (school prayer), Brandenburg v. Ohio (inflammatory speech), Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School District (student rights), Edwards v. Aguil-
lard (science education), and Cruzan v. Director of the Missouri Department of
Health (right to die). The ACLU also provided amicus curiae briefs in key deci-
sions including Hirabayashi v. United States (wartime internment), Brown v. Board
of Education (school segregation), Gideon v. Wainwright (right to counsel), and
Miranda v. Arizona (police interrogation). 
The ACLU has also been active in the movement to preserve and protect indi-
vidual privacy. As might be expected, their most notable effects in this area have

17
been recorded in a number of Supreme Court decisions. Perhaps most notably, the
ACLU represented the defendant the 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut decision that
struck down a state ban on contraceptive use. In the decision, the Court cited “mar-
ital privacy” and acknowledged that although not clearly stated in the Constitution,
privacy was protected by “several fundamental constitutional guarantees.” Addi-
tional cases related to reproductive rights, including United States vs. Vuitch
(1971), Eisenstadt v. Baird (1971), Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), and
Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), further defined this position. The ACLU has success-
fully protected privacy rights in other contexts as well. For instance, Chandler v.
Miller (1997) cited the Fourth Amendment in invalidating a Georgia state statute
that required political candidates to submit to urine tests.
Taken together, these decisions have helped further define and clarify privacy
rights under the law. However, privacy remains a primary focus of the ACLU. In
the early years of this century, the ACLU has become increasingly concerned with
the growth of a “surveillance society” in which corporate and governmental orga-
nizations pose new threats to personal information and privacy. The organization’s
“Technology and Liberty Project,” for instance, currently focuses on a myriad of
privacy issues. As part of this project, the ACLU has challenged the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept
and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), Internet censorship,
and breaches of online anonymity.

Anonymity
Historically, the concept of anonymity was associated with a state of nameless-
ness. Being an anonym afforded certain advantages. It enabled the nameless to speak
without fear of reprisal, or to engage in acts of charity or other forms of benevolence.
At the same time, it made possible wrongdoing without accountability. 
With the advent of computer-based communications networks, there has been a
resurgence of interest in the nature and value of certain types of anonymity. The
range of techniques by which individuals are able to operate incognito creates a
virtual laboratory for experimenting with the social construction of identity. How-
ever, as the Internet’s surveillance potential becomes better understood and
exploited, the measure of anonymity shifts from its historical focus on names to a
broader investigation of a range of personal identifiers that can be linked to an indi-
vidual. These include date of birth, marital status, Social Security number, pass-
port information, property ownership, vehicle registration, driver’s license number,
facial characteristics, height, e-mail address, place of business, phone number,
credit card history, iris shape, fingerprints, retinal image, employment record,
blood chemistry, roadway usage, gait pattern, consumer purchases, Internet search
history, Internet protocol address, and other identifiers. Unbeknownst to many, the
increasing ability to link these identifiers to an individual has resulted in a dimin-
ished ability to maintain anonymity, resulting in applications for subpoenas and
court orders requiring third parties to disclose identifying information for the

18
Anonymity
\
purposes of private lawsuits or police investigation. In light of the numerous possi-
ble identifiers in an information age, anonymity is perhaps best understood as a
state of disconnection between one’s self and one’s identifiers; a state in which data
cannot be associated with a particular individual, either from the data itself, or by
combining it with other data. The value of anonymity, as philosopher Helen Nis-
senbaum observes, lies not in the capacity to be unnamed, but in the possibility of
acting or participating while remaining unreachable. 
Anonymity’s characteristic of “unreachability” provides one means of achieving
what legal scholar Alan Westin has defined as self-directed informational privacy:
people who are able to disconnect their identities from their actions are better able
to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them
is communicated to others. Although it does not offer seclusion in the usual spatial
sense, being anonymous affords a kind of isolation. Whereas credit card payments
create traceable transactions, allowing a consumer’s activities to be tracked and a
data profile to be created, anonymous payments preserve privacy. 
Historically, the value of anonymity has had less to do with its privacy-enhancing
potential than its political purpose. Anonymity has always been a crucial thread in
the fabric of democracy. Anonymous voting ensured that citizens were free actors,
that their political participation would remain uninfluenced by the tyranny of the
majority or by undue pressure from other powerful groups. The Federalist Papers,
a series of newspaper articles that became a bedrock of U.S. constitutional thought,
although not truly anonymous, were written pseudonymously, using a fabricated
name to cloak the identities of their authors while still allowing a mediated form of
attribution. The same strategy was later employed by nineteenth-century female
novelists to prevent gender discrimination from influencing how their work was
received.
Now, as then, anonymity enables people to discuss taboo subjects with others.
Whether face-to-face in a self-help group, or peer-to-peer in an online chat, sexual
abuse, addiction, and disease are regularly confronted and sometimes overcome
anonymously. For many persons, the mere assurance of anonymity is what embold-
ens them to participate in the first place. Alternatively, anonymity also enables
unlawful associations and antisocial behavior, causing one U.S. Supreme Court
justice to refer to anonymity as the “refuge of scoundrels.” 
Because anonymity can yield good or bad outcomes, some perceive a conflict
regarding its value and role in democratic societies. In the United States, political
anonymity is a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to freedom of
expression and freedom of association. But the right to anonymous communica-
tion is not immutable; it must be balanced against state interests in protecting peo-
ple’s reputations, in fighting fraud and crime, and in safeguarding national security.
Whereas few would disagree that anonymous voting is desirable and anonymous
criminal activity is undesirable, between these extremes lies a sea of uncertainty. 
As the Internet continues to evolve, anonymity’s future abounds with question
marks. The information trade has turned “dataveillance” into big business. Cyber-
crime legislation and the expanding ability of law enforcement agencies to collect
personal information and intercept electronic communications has been proposed
or enacted in many jurisdictions, and the demands for identification for everything
from air travel to building entry are on the rise. At the same time, blogs, chat

rooms, instant messaging and a number of other online environments provide
exciting new venues for social and political participation that permit and even
encourage individuals to conceal their actual identities. Millions of people using
them have made clear their desire to withhold disclosure of their identities for a
variety of legitimate social purposes, inspiring a number of cryptographers to
develop systems of provable anonymity. The extent to which such applications will
be permitted or adopted by governments or markets in the twenty-first century
remains uncertain. Their potential uses and broader questions concerning the
importance and impact of anonymity in a networked society are under investigation
by a growing number of academics and privacy advocates.

Anti-wiretap statutes
In its narrowest sense, wiretapping refers to interception of telephonic voice
communications. This method of eavesdropping has been around for as long as the
telephone itself and has always been strictly regulated. As communications meth-
ods became more sophisticated, wiretapping methods followed suit, and laws regu-
lating wiretapping had to be updated to cover cellular phones and electronic
communications such as e-mail, fax transmissions, and digital-display pagers.
Anti-wiretapping laws can be split into two categories: first, laws that prevent pri-
vate citizens from intercepting another’s telecommunications; and second, laws
that restrict law enforcement officials from doing the same. 
The first category of laws is relatively straightforward: under federal law, it is ille-
gal for any third party to intercept any telephonic or electronic communication
between other individuals. However, if one of the parties to the conversation records
or consents to the recording of the conversation, the interception of the communica-
tion is generally not barred under federal law, as long as the communication is not
being intercepted for the purpose of committing a criminal or tortious act. This prac-
tice is also permissible under many state laws, but at least 11 states prohibit recording
a conversation even if one of the parties consents to the recording.
Laws regulating law enforcement wiretaps are a bit more complicated and more
controversial. By far the most important federal statute is Title III of the Omnibus
Crime and Control Act of 1968. This law states that an order authorizing law
enforcement wiretaps (known as a “Title III order”) will be issued only if the gov-
ernment can demonstrate (1) probable cause to believe that the interception will
reveal evidence of one of a limited list of predicate crimes, with the suspected crime
named in the application; (2) probable cause that the communication facility is being
used in committing the crime; (3) normal investigative procedures have been tried
and failed, are unlikely to succeed, or are dangerous; and (4) the surveillance will be

\
conducted in a way that minimizes the interception of irrelevant communications.
Every Title III request must be authorized by a United States Attorney. This is a rel-
atively high burden on law enforcement: in order to obtain a standard search war-
rant, the government need only show probable cause that a crime has occurred.
Law enforcement officials are routinely able to meet this burden, however; in 2004,
for example, no state or federal judge denied a law enforcement request for wiretap
authorization (Administrative Office of the United States Courts, 2004). 
Title III has undergone two significant amendments since its passage. In 1986,
Title III was amended by the Electronic Communication Privacy Act (ECPA),
which extended the Title III restrictions to digital and electronic telecommunication.
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools
Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT
Act) eased some restrictions on wiretapping. For example, the PATRIOT Act allows
law enforcement agents to apply for “roving wiretaps,” which permit agents to trace
calls not just in the jurisdiction in which the authorization was ordered but anywhere
in the United States. It also extended the “pen/trap” rule from telephonic to electronic
communications. During 2004, there were 1710 intercepts conducted in the United
States, an increase of 19 percent over the previous year. The vast majority of these
intercepts (76 percent) were pursuant to drug investigations. 
Other forms of wiretapping are less invasive because they do not involve inter-
cepting the substance of the communication; thus, they are not as strictly regulated
by law. For example, Title III restrictions apply only to intercepting the content of
the message, and do not apply to intercepting the incoming or outgoing address of
the communication. In the context of telephonic communications, this is com-
monly known as “tracing” the origin or destination of a call; law enforcement
agents use a pen/trap device to determine the number a call is going to or the
number that a call came from. In the context of electronic communications, such
as e-mail, this might involve intercepting the “To” and “From” line of the message,
rather than the entire message. In other words, for telephonic intercepts, a different
device is used to trace a call, whereas for electronic communications, the same
method is used to intercept the addresses and to intercept the communication, but
the law enforcement agent only looks at the address lines.
Despite this difference, the legal standard for intercepting “addressing” informa-
tion is the same irrespective of the type of communication that is intercepted. In
order to receive authorization to intercept this information, the government must
show that “the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing investiga-
tion.” This is a far lower standard than is required under Title III, and even lower
than is required for a traditional search under the Fourth Amendment. (The
Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to a wiretap
that only intercepts addressing information.) Furthermore, if law enforcement
officers fail to follow these requirements, the evidence can still be used against the
suspect at trial, although the officers could be subject to criminal and civil liability
if a court determines that the law enforcement officials did not act in good faith.
There are also separate rules for so-called stored communications: e-mails or
voice mails that are stored on a remote server. As with using phone traces and
intercepting e-mail addresses, recovering stored communications from third par-
ties is not considered a “search” under the Fourth Amendment, so there are no

\
21
constitutional restrictions on such surveillance. However, federal law creates differ-
ent legal standards based on the type of communication being sought; for example, a
warrant is generally required to recover unopened e-mail, while a subpoena with
notice to the party is sufficient to recover opened e-mail or subscriber information.
Finally, there is the question of audio and video surveillance—the practice of
installing a hidden microphone or camera in a home or office and recording sus-
pects’ words and/or actions. Technically, these forms of surveillance are not wire-
tapping, because they do not involve intercepting electronic signals sent over the
telecommunications network. They are, however, strictly regulated by the federal
government; in fact, they are governed by the same strict standards as wiretapping.
Audio surveillance (commonly known as “bugging”) is expressly covered by Title
III, and although video surveillance is not, courts have held that the Fourth Amend-
ment places the same high restrictions on video surveillance as Title III places on
wiretapping.

Assisted reproductive technologies
Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are medical interventions that help
single people and infertile couples have children by increasing the likelihood of
conceiving naturally or by creating embryos ex utero (outside the womb) for
implantation into the mother or surrogate. Examples of ART include fertility drug
treatment, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and intracytoplasmic
sperm injections (ICSI). ART may also involve prenatal testing and preimplanta-
tion genetic diagnosis (PIG) to help parents select embryos that are free of inher-
ited diseases. Gametes (sperm or eggs) or embryos may be frozen and stored for
later use in ART; therefore, the disposition of excess gametes or embryos may also
impact privacy considerations.
In 1890 Justice Louis D. Brandeis described privacy as “the right to be let
alone.” This definition is pertinent to ART since parents often want to be left alone
by sperm and egg donors, separated couples might want surplus embryos to be left
alone rather than implanted, and sperm and egg donors want to protect their ano-
nymity. The First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution as well as
case law have established that issues related to reproduction, sexuality, and family
are private, and that government should limit its intrusions in these areas. However,

22

\
the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law noted that, while ART as
employed by married couples with their own gametes will likely be protected under
the federal Constitution, noncoital reproduction including surrogacy and reproduc-
tive cloning may not be. Nonetheless, the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Health
Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 mandate the
confidentiality of private, personally identifiable information.
Various parties may be involved in ART, each with privacy rights and each with
expectations that information about identity and health will remain confidential.
First, there are the individuals and couples who wish to become parents. Through
ART, they may become biological parents or they may parent children who are not
genetically related. Second, there are sperm and egg donors, some of whom are
known to prospective parents and some of whom are anonymous. Third, there are
surrogate mothers. Fourth, there are the children born using ART.
Gamete donation is either directed, in which case the donor knows the recipient,
or anonymous, in which case the donor does not. In both cases, the parents seeking
donor assistance with ART may stipulate that they or their children be left alone.
For example, a co-worker or friend might volunteer to donate sperm with the
understanding that his identity should remain private unless the parents later want
to reveal it. Similarly, parents may not want the circumstances of conception
revealed to other family members or to the child for fear the child will reject the
nongenetic parent(s). 
Many egg and sperm donors prefer to remain anonymous. They want to help
infertile couples but do not yet want to become parents; therefore, their identities
are withheld from prospective parents as well as from any biological offspring.
When sperm and egg donors choose to remain anonymous, certain private informa-
tion, such as health status and some genetic information, is disclosed so that pro-
spective parents can make an informed choice about conception, but the donor’s
identity is not disclosed. Still, some children want to learn the identity of their bio-
logical parent(s). In addition to personal reasons, there may be compelling medical
reasons to seek out a donor, such as the need for a biological relative’s bone mar-
row. Several countries have laws or policies that support a child’s access to donor
information or identity, including Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden,
and the United Kingdom (Ethics Committee 2004, 528). A bill in Canada’s parlia-
ment would allow 18-year-old children to access nonidentifiable health informa-
tion, and a donor may authorize release of his or her identity to children. In order to
protect the privacy of anonymous donors, sperm banks and fertility clinics should
discuss these policies with donors prior to donation because identifying an anony-
mous donor for any reason jeopardizes the donor’s privacy. 
Children born using ART also have the right to be left alone by sperm or egg
donors. Normally it is up to the parents to decide whether or not to disclose the
circumstances of their conception, including the identity of known donors. Also,
as preconception and preimplantation genetic testing become available, parents
who select for certain genetic characteristics or select against for nonlethal dis-
eases may face later objections from their children, either that the testing itself
revealed information that the adult child would reasonably want to remain private
(such as carrier status for cystic fibrosis) or that the testing itself is a violation of
“fetal privacy.”

When, if ever, can the anonymous donor’s right to privacy be overridden? When
the donor, parents, and child all consent, then disclosure by sperm bank or fertility
clinic is permitted. Many sperm banks test donors for HIV infection, which means
that some sensitive health information that might have been unknown to the donor
is revealed in the process of sperm donation and shared with prospective parents. It
is ethically justified to test all gamete donors for HIV and other sexually transmit-
ted diseases to protect the offspring and the women who will become pregnant
using donated gametes. The identity of an HIV-infected potential donor normally
remains confidential, but the safety and health of women and newborns may legiti-
mately override some privacy concerns. Discrimination and stigmatization are
likely to ensue if the patient’s identity is revealed, however, so the patient’s name
should only be revealed to a limited number of authorized individuals and only for
compelling patient safety and public health reasons. HIV testing is recommended,
not mandated, for all couples who wish to have biological children. It is not man-
dated in part because such a mandate could not be enforced except in the context of
ART, which could be seen as discrimination against infertile people.
Issues of privacy are compounded when HIV-positive individuals want to
become biological parents. Ethically, the risk of transmission must be balanced
against the desire to be biological parents. ART may be employed to decrease the
risk of transmission. Following education and counseling, HIV-discordant couples
may be able to use intracytoplasmic sperm injections, where one sperm without the
virus is injected into a harvested egg and IVF is employed. HIV-positive pregnant
women and their newborns can also be treated with antiretroviral drugs to decrease
transmission. 
There are special privacy issues that arise with deceased sperm donors. The
main question is who may use extracted and frozen sperm for the purpose of repro-
duction. Some argue that without the deceased man’s prior consent, postmortem
“reproduction” should be prohibited. Others believe that surviving family mem-
bers, particularly spouses, have proprietary right to use sperm for procreation with-
out previous consent from the deceased donor.
ART raises the question of who is the legally and ethically responsible parent in
disputes concerning frozen embryos and donated gametes. One legal scholar writes
that “if courts resolve frozen preembryo disputes that involve non-gamete providers
based on the constitutional right to privacy, then they should find that the constitu-
tional right to privacy encompasses the interests of both gamete and non-gamete pro-
viders. Individuals who create preembryos with the intent to become a parent have
made an intimate decision involving procreation, marriage, and family life that
falls squarely within the right to privacy” (Dillon 2003, 625). Normally, privacy
rights protect citizens from intrusion into family affairs, but intrafamilial disputes
may raise questions about custody. In the case of In re Buzzanca, a California
appeals court determined that a divorced couple whose child was conceived
using anonymous sperm and egg donation and a surrogate mother were the legal
parents, reasoning that it was their intention to become parents—not their biological
relationship to the child—that was legally important. Kass v. Kass involved a
woman who, in the course of divorce proceedings, sought sole custody of five fro-
zen preembryos created through the couple’s IVF treatment. The New York Court
of Appeals ruled that the preembryos did not implicate “a woman’s right to privacy

\
or bodily integrity before implantation”; therefore, the contract signed by Mr. and
Mrs. Kass prior to cryopreservation was binding. It stipulated that unused preem-
bryos should be donated for research. These disputes raise complicated issues
about who constitutes family: biological or “intentional” parents or both? 
Protecting the privacy of those involved in ART helps to prevent discrimination
and stigmatization and upholds constitutional privacy protections; however, an
individual’s right to privacy may be overridden, especially in cases where divorced
or separated families must discern who has custody when biological and nonbio-
logical parents are involved.

suggests otherwise, the Court later confirmed that this decision made public figures
essentially the same as public officials within the meaning of the First Amendment in
relation to an action against libel. In other words, the First Amendment (and the Four-
teenth Amendment as applied to the states) prohibits either public officials or public
figures from recovering damages for libel unless they prove actual malice or reckless
disregard for the truth. In Walker/Butts, the Supreme Court established a guideline to
determine the presence of actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth.
Libel law had earlier substantially changed paths when the Supreme Court issued
its decision in New York Times v. Sullivan (1964). That landmark decision established
that the First Amendment (and the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to the states)
prohibited a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood
relating to the official’s conduct in his or her official capacity. The Court carved out
one qualification by which a defamatory falsehood could lead to damages: actual
malice, or reckless disregard for the truth. The definition given for actual malice was
with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it
was false.

With this decision as a base, the Court issued its opinion in Walker/Butts. The
Court first addressed the factual background of Butts. In that case, the Saturday
Evening Post published an article about Wallace Butts, who at the time of publica-
tion was the athletic director at the University of Georgia. The article alleged that
Butts aided in a conspiracy to “fix” a college football game between the University
of Georgia and the University of Alabama that had been played in 1962. Before
serving as athletic director, Butts had served as a football coach; at the time of pub-
lication of the article, he was negotiating a contract with a professional football
team. In short, he was a well-known public figure. The article was undeniably
aimed at harming Butts, and he sued for an enormous sum in compensatory and
punitive damages. 
In Walker, the facts were different. That suit arose out of the circulation of a
news report giving an eyewitness account of a riot on the campus of the University
of Mississippi in 1962. The report declared that Walker, a retired military leader,
incited and led the violent crowd against federal marshals sent there to contain the
riot. It also suggested that Walker encouraged the use of violence and informed the
protesters how to buffer the effects of tear gas. Like Butts, Walker sued for an enor-
mous sum in compensatory and punitive damages.
Beginning its analysis of the constitutional arguments before it, the Court initially
noted that the media is comprised of businesses that seek to turn a profit: “Like other
enterprises that inflict damage in the course of performing a service highly useful to
the public . . . they must pay the freight; and injured persons should not be relegated
[to remedies that] make collection of their claims difficult or impossible unless strong
policy considerations demand.” Thus, the Court had to strike a balance between pre-
serving a strong and open media, and protecting the sanctity of individuals’ reputa-
tions and integrity in the face of untruthful and defamatory statements. The Court
pointed out that the First Amendment protections are not without limit; this is con-
firmed by the validity of statutes on federal securities regulation, mail fraud, and
common law actions against deceit and misrepresentation. 
The Court was reluctant to simply draw the line at falsity. As it did in prior
cases, it suggested that “falsity alone should not strip protections from the pub-
lisher.” The Court reiterated that some error in the public debate is inevitable, and
that asking a jury to decide what is the meaning of “true” might “effectively insti-
tute a system of censorship.” Instead, the Court focused on the element of conduct
“to resolve the antithesis between civil libel actions and the freedom of speech and
press.”
The Court then proceeded to define its constitutional standard for assessing lia-
bility for defamation against public figures such as Butts and Walker. Ultimately, it
concluded that “a ‘public figure’ who is not a public official may also recover dam-
ages for a defamatory falsehood whose substance makes substantial danger to rep-
utation apparent, on a showing of highly unreasonable conduct constituting an
extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily
adhered to by responsible publishers.” The Court emphasized that this standard
only applies to actions involving public figures or matters of public interest.
Having set the standard, the Court then applied it to the facts of the cases of both
Butts and Walker. As to Butts, the Court emphasized that the article about him was
not “hot news” that urgently needed to be published. The article’s editors had

26

\
ample time to investigate the facts and confirm their validity. The evidence revealed
that there was an obvious lack of foundation for the story, and that the publisher
had failed to meet even the most elementary standards of professional journalism,
as the court had defined the standard. Butts was accordingly entitled to collect
money damages for the publisher’s defamatory statements.
Despite this finding, the Court reached an opposite result when assessing the
factual background of Walker’s case. Far from finding “actual malice,” the trial
court in that case had found that the evidence did not support anything beyond ordi-
nary negligence. Also, the article in this case required immediate publication, in
contrast to the relaxed time frame in the case of Butts. The factual background in
this case was also “internally consistent” and overall reasonable. Therefore, the
Court refused to find any actionable defamation. Walker was accordingly not enti-
tled to recover damages from the Associated Press.

Authentication
Authentication, in its most general form, is a process for gaining confidence that
something is, in fact, what it appears to be. In everyday life, people continually
authenticate people, objects, and other entities around them by consciously or sub-
consciously assessing clues that provide evidence of authenticity.
In communication and transaction settings, authentication is typically under-
stood as the process of confirming a claimed identity. This involves two steps: first
a user must present a user identifier (such as “John Doe” or “Employee 13579”)
that uniquely represents the user in the verifier’s context. The second step, identity
authentication, involves verifying that the presenter of the user identifier is autho-
rized to do so—that the presenter is the user to whom the user identifier has been
assigned.
Single-factor identity authentication ascertains that the presenter possesses
something associated with the presented user identifier that is not generally acces-
sible. This can be something the user knows (such as a password or a crypto-
graphic key), something the user has (such as a smart card), or something the user
is (i.e., a user biometric identifier). Each of these three single-factor authentica-
tion methods has limitations: what the user knows may be guessed, forgotten, or
shared with others; what the user has may be costly, faulty, lost, stolen, or repli-
cated; and what the user is cannot be revoked, does not permit privacy, and requires

\
27
human involvement. To strengthen the process of identity authentication, several
single-factor methods may be combined, resulting in multi-factor authentication.
When authenticating claimed identities, verifiers implicitly place trust in the
authenticity of the clues themselves. In cases where verifiers are effectively agents
or proxies of the user, users can be trusted with creating their own identifiers and
using their own authentication method. For example, a self-generated username
and password suffice to protect access to one’s own computer. In many communi-
cation and transaction systems, however, the security interests of verifiers and users
are not aligned. In these cases, verifiers require clues that originate from trusted
parties, also referred to as issuers, in order to gain confidence in the authenticity of
presented user identifiers. Kerberos tickets and X.509 identity certificates are well-
known examples of certified user identifiers that are issued by trusted parties; these
certified identifiers contain cryptographic authenticity marks that are hard to forge. 
When the same certified user identifiers are relied on by multiple verifiers, both
users and verifiers must place tremendous trust in the issuer, which houses the
power to trace, profile, and impersonate any user. For example, all user interactions
with verifiers can be inescapably traced and linked on the basis of the X.509 iden-
tity certificates that they use. Identity authentication and privacy are not competing
interests that need to be balanced, however. Advances in modern cryptography
allow for the creation of certified user identifiers that provide users and verifiers
with all the privacy and security benefits of noncertified, self-generated identifiers. 
More generally, modern authentication techniques such as digital credentials
enable issuers to certify user identifiers (and, more generally, identity assertions) in
such a manner that no tracing, linking, and impersonation powers arise in them.

Automatic teller machine
The automatic or automated teller machine (ATM) enables bank customers to
perform banking services without the assistance of a bank employee. The most
basic task an ATM performs is enabling a customer to withdraw cash from the
customer’s bank account. Other banking services that may be added to the
ATM’s primary function include account balance updates and money transfers.
Recently, ATMs have been configured to vend postage stamps and prepaid
mobile phone minutes. The evolution of the ATM from cash dispenser to multi-
purpose necessity of modern life was facilitated greatly by a fully integrated
multibank network. 

28

Barclays Bank in Enfield Town in north London set up the world’s inaugural ATM
on June 27, 1965. Although John Shepherd-Barron receives consideration as the inven-
tor of this particular installation, the ATM’s evolution into a modern cash dispenser was
assisted by many inventors. In 1939 Luther George Simjian registered patents for an
early incarnation of an ATM. While they are not the original inventors of the device,
Don Wetzel and two fellow engineers registered a patent on June 4, 1973, for the first
machine that is considered to be a modern and successful cash machine. In 1969 the
Rockville Centre branch of Chemical Bank installed the first ATM in the United Sates.
The first generation of the cash machine was off-line and dispensed prepack-
aged bundles of cash in a fixed denomination. At first, banks did not employ a
computer network to stay in contact with ATMs. Since funds were not withdrawn
automatically from a customer’s account, ATM rights were not issued to all bank
customers. Rather, banks were very selective about those to whom ATM cards
were distributed (e.g., credit card holders with good banking history). To ensure
that the bank customer withdrawing money from the machine was the authorized
user, ATM cards had to be different from credit cards so account information could
be included. (At this time, credit cards were void of information-laden magnetic
strips.) The personal identification number (PIN) the user enters was compared to
the PIN stored on the ATM card’s magnetic strip. 
While the PIN concept is still relatively unchanged with regard to ATM usage,
technology has served as a catalyst for increased security safeguards. Customers
continue to insert a plastic card with a magnetic stripe into the ATM and confirm
they are the authorized user by entering a numeric password or code (PIN) that is
at least four digits in length. Typically, if a user enters the incorrect PIN three times
consecutively, the machine does not return the card to the individual as an effort to
thwart unauthorized persons from deducing the proper passcode by conjecture. In
addition to the standard magnetic striped plastic card, some ATMs use smart cards
to store customer data, and a new generation of machines may include biometric
identifiers such as iris of the human eye or fingerprint scanning. This means that
the biometric information would have to be stored in databases by the bank or
another organization, thereby raising concerns about privacy and security. 
The ability to connect a bank’s network to an ATM is a modern-day conve-
nience. This communications network provides the foundation for the entire ATM
system: the approval of a transaction by the authorizing (or card issuing) institu-
tion. This advancement allows travelers to withdraw money from ATMs outside
their hometowns and even home countries.
ATMs contain secure cryptoprocessors, on which the integrity of the machine
relies. ATMs are able to connect directly via a dial-up modem using a telephone
line. Currently, more and more ATMs take advantage of high-speed Internet con-
nections, thus decreasing the amount of time devoted to a transaction. 
For security purposes, the United States requires encryption by law. Prior to
2005, ATM dealings were typically encrypted with Data Encryption Standard
(DES). Starting in 2005, most transactions require using Triple DES (TDES) as the
encryption method. While the algorithm is thought to be secure, the risk of attack is
always present. There is some speculation that TDES is archaic and needs to be
replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the encryption standard of
the United States government.

Regarding ATMs and theft, banks are held responsible when a customer’s
money is stolen. However, there have been many difficult-to-verify accounts of
banks making it exceedingly challenging to recoup even a portion of the lost funds.
There are situations of fraud where a bank unwittingly has committed the fraud.
Bank fraud occurs at ATMs if the bank accidentally supplies the machine with the
incorrect bills. Consequently, the ATM would dispense far more cash to each
authorized user than had been requested. First-time users of incorrectly stocked
machines are rarely prosecuted. A user who repeatedly frequents the overgenerous
ATM, however, is usually tried. Banks accuse their customers of fraud because of
the presence of “phantom withdrawals” from ATMs. In this situation, the customer
states that the withdrawal of funds never occurred, but the bank’s records indicate
that such a transaction took place. A renowned cryptography researcher, Ross
Anderson, has uncovered errors in banking security by investigating numerous
instances of this phenomenon.
Initial safeguarding of ATMs against theft concentrated on creating a cash dis-
penser that was impervious to attempted hackings: a safe that also functioned as a
cash dispenser. ATMs were commonly located in the sides of buildings for walk-up
service as well as for drive-through convenience. This type of protection strategy
led to numerous ram-raiding attempts by thieves. The nomenclature of this style of
assault refers to the tactics used by thieves to crack open the safe by literally ram-
ming into it. 
As time went on, the typical location and installation of ATMs changed, largely
as a result of the institution of dye marking packets and the use of smoke bombs
attached to money bundles housed inside the ATM. It is far more common to find a
free-standing ATM in a retail store as opposed its wall-mounted predecessor. Tech-
nological advances also paved the way for the use of numerous security cameras,
so that the ATM as well as the area around the ATM can be monitored. As an addi-
tional security measure, some free-standing ATMs located inside retail establish-
ments only dispense written tickets, and users must then redeem the tickets for cash
from a store employee.
By the early years of the twenty-first century, criminal activity involving ATMs
was commonly classified into two categories based on the amount of technological
prowess displayed by the perpetrator. In the decidedly low-tech method, a lookout
observes the victim entering his or her PIN into the nearby ATM. As the victim
moves away from the surveillance cameras, the lookout’s accomplice then steals
the victim’s ATM card. Short of the convenience in locating potential victims, this
method offers virtually no other benefits to the criminals. In addition, this criminal
activity is equivalent in risk and penalty to other violent crimes. Aided by the low
cost and high availability of wireless cameras and magnetic card readers, the high-
tech mode of criminal operation is growing in popularity. The criminal installs a
card reader on top of the ATM’s existing real card reader. The wireless camera
allows the perpetrator surreptitiously to gain the user’s PIN. This type of high-tech
criminal activity poses a comparatively smaller risk to the thieves. Banks are striv-
ing to create effective stops for the latter fraud category by working to make the
external features of ATMs tamper evident in order to prevent the use of piggy-
backed card readers and wireless camera surveillance. In addition, many banks are
now using smart cards that cannot by read by nonauthenticated devices. Although

the ATM has been hailed as one of the top 100 ideas of the twentieth century, secu-
rity and privacy aspects of the ATM continue to be an issue.

Automobile
The automobile poses a unique challenge for both police and the driving public
within the framework of constitutional protections, especially Fourth Amend-
ment rights. Unlike a fixed dwelling or home, a car can be moved at will. This
mobility increases the possibility of criminals evading police and destroying
incriminating evidence. Issues involved in an automobile search also pose impor-
tant questions about whether some restrictions of privacy rights are necessary in
order to promote greater security against foreign and domestic dangers. The auto-
mobile and other moving vehicles, such as the truck used by Timothy McVeigh to
blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, can be
real threats. The car search issue is significant for the driving public because of the
increasing powers of intrusion by the police and the reduced expectations of pri-
vacy exemplified by police checkpoints on roads. 
In Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925), the Supreme Court provided the
first definitive rationale for warrantless searches and seizures of automobiles, focusing
on the differences between a fixed dwelling and a movable vehicle. However, the lee-
way allowed in Carroll did not exempt the police from respecting Fourth Amendment
rights. The court was clear in its intentions that police must have probable cause for
believing a vehicle was carrying contraband goods; otherwise, persons lawfully using
the highways would be subject to inconvenience and the indignity of such a search. By
emphasizing probable cause, the court provided a constitutional rationale for police and
law enforcement officials to stop the vehicle and conduct a search.
Historically, the Court has expanded the powers of the police to conduct warrantless
car searches. Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42 (1970) reaffirmed the Court’s posi-
tion that warrantless searches of cars and their contents are permissible. The Court also
expanded car searches by allowing the police to stop and question persons traveling in
their automobiles based on anonymous tips. If police find evidence that establishes sus-
picion of criminal activity, such evidence can be used against the driver and other per-
sons in the automobile (Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 1990). The expansion of
warrantless car searches impacts all drivers on American highways, especially drivers
entering the United States from Canada or Mexico. Police and law enforcement offi-
cials have more intrusive powers at the border, and may conduct more intrusive car
searches in order to prevent contraband from entering the United Sates (see, for
example, United States v. Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. 149, 2004).
More intrusive car searches would appear to represent a further erosion of
Fourth Amendment protections provided in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 US 643 (1961),

Automobile
\
31
which established the exclusionary rule that allows illegally seized evidence to be
excluded in criminal court proceedings. Critics of Mapp believe the exclusionary
rule went too far by blocking police arrests that should have been made. By 1984,
the Supreme Court did allow evidence to be used in criminal cases that did not con-
form to the requirements of the exclusionary rule (United States v. Leon, 468 U.S.
897). The Court established the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule,
whereby the police may gain evidence by reliance on a warrant that police believe
to be valid, even if it is subsequently found to be invalid.
A rollback of car searches is unlikely. Domestic and international concerns
appear to make the American public more willing to give the police more leeway,
which serves to limit Fourth Amendment protections against searches and seizures
and rights to privacy. The initial passage and renewal of the Uniting and Strength-
ening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) by the United States Con-
gress illustrates that national policymakers are willing to legislate further restric-
tions on these civil liberties. The September 11, 2001, attack and destruction of the
twin towers of the World Trade Center heightened fears of terrorist attacks and
added to the urgency of demands for remedies. Increased concerns about terrorism
and the public focus on crime-control efforts have combined to enlarge the scope of
permissible police behavior in searching vehicles. 
Police checkpoints illustrate this increasing toleration of intrusive police activ-
ity. The checkpoint is significant in car searches because the individual can arrive
at the checkpoint with no prior suspicion of wrongdoing by police, and yet be
subjected to a car search, as illustrated in New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106 (1986)
and United States v. Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. 149 (2004), both of which
affirmed that police may search one’s car without prior suspicion. At check-
points, police often discover alcohol intoxication or find contraband in vehicles
that can be used as evidence in court proceedings against the driver. The automo-
bile, because it is not a fixed building, will continue to test how far the police can
intrude on Fourth Amendment protections and the right to privacy, as well as
what limitations people are willing to accept in order to live in a more secure
society.

Automobile search
A car search, simply put, is the intrusion into the interior of an automobile by
an agent of the government. From a privacy standpoint, the question is whether
owners and occupants of automobiles have a reasonable expectation of privacy in
automobiles under the Constitution. While it is easy to state what a car search is, it
is significantly more difficult to delineate the issues related to privacy and car own-
ership or occupancy. Briefly, the concerns relate to the following: searches with
warrants and searches in the absence of a warrant; searches when the car is occu-
pied and when it is not; searches of open areas in the car and searches of closed or
locked areas of the car; searches of containers found in the car; and searches of the
driver of the car and of passengers in the car. The situation is further complicated
when the question of the government’s right to stop a car is raised.
The courts have long recognized that citizens do not surrender all the protections
of the Fourth Amendment by entering an automobile. The Supreme Court first
required that persons in a car must have a “constitutionally protected reasonable
expectation of privacy” before there could be any constitutional violation in Katz v.
United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). By its very physical characteristics, a car
offers less privacy than does a home. The Supreme Court noted in Cardwell v.
Lewis, 417 U.S. 583 (1974) that “a car has little capacity for escaping public scru-
tiny. It travels public thoroughfares where both its occupants and its contents are in
plain view.” Further, the courts have noted that since a multitude of state laws and
regulations govern the ownership, maintenance, and operation of automobiles,
drivers should expect that the state, in enforcing those laws and regulations, will
intrude to some extent upon a driver’s privacy.
While it is not possible to delineate the entire history of privacy in an automobile,
or other vehicle, here, there are some basic principles that must be addressed. When
discussing the basis for any right or expectation of privacy in an automobile, the
foundation is found in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which states, in
part, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects
against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants
shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particu-
larly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” 
It is also important to understand that generally, a search warrant is an order
obtained by the government from an independent judge upon showing there is
probable cause to invade someone’s privacy. Ordinarily, the probable cause will be
the belief that evidence of a crime, or a person to be arrested, will be found in the
area to be searched. A warrant must list with specificity the area to be searched, the
items to be seized, or the person to be arrested. While the person whose privacy is
invaded usually has no prior opportunity to challenge a search warrant, before evi-
dence seized as a result of issuance of the warrant can be used in court, the person
can challenge the warrant’s validity. All of the requirements for a search warrant to
be issued for a home must also be met for a search warrant to be issued for a car.
Despite the language of the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court has created a
number of exceptions when searches and seizures of evidence or persons are permit-
ted without a warrant. For example, in exigent circumstances when police officers
have a good faith belief that evidence will be destroyed, criminals will escape, or the
safety of the officers require it, warrantless searches will be allowed. The moveable

Automobile search
\
33
nature of cars and trucks creates the kind of exigent circumstances the courts have
historically relied upon to authorize government’s warrantless actions.
The history of cases dealing with privacy in automobiles has not been even. The
Supreme Court has taken various twists and turns in its efforts to balance the needs
of law enforcement and the privacy concerns of citizens. Logically, one of the first
questions to be asked about searching cars is whether police can stop the vehicles. 
Before 1976, the courts in this country were divided on whether officers could
randomly stop cars without having a reasonable suspicion that a violation of the
law was occurring. The Supreme Court considered Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S.
648 (1976) in order to resolve the conflict. In that case, an officer testified that he
had nothing else to do, so he randomly stopped the defendant’s car to check the
driver’s license and registration. Upon approaching the car, he smelled marijuana,
and when he reached the car, he could see a bag of marijuana on the floor. The
driver was subsequently arrested. In affirming the Delaware courts’ suppression of
the evidence seized during the random stop, the Supreme Court held that “the mar-
ginal contribution to roadway safety possibly resulting from a system of spot
checks cannot justify subjecting every occupant of every vehicle on the roads to a
seizure—limited in magnitude compared to other intrusions but nonetheless consti-
tutionally cognizable—at the unbridled discretion of law enforcement officials.”
Stopping multiple cars at road blocks, however, is a different question. In United
States v. Ortiz, 422 U.S. 891 (1975), the Supreme Court first ruled that searching cars
during routine traffic checkpoint stops was a violation of Fourth Amendment rights.
A year later, the Court ruled that checkpoint stops were acceptable. In United States
v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976), the Court approved use of Border Patrol
checkpoint operations to inquire about occupants’ citizenship status. The practice
required slowing all oncoming traffic “to a virtual, if not a complete, halt” at a high-
way roadblock, and sending vehicles selected by Border Patrol agents to another area
for a more thorough inspection. Recognizing that the governmental interest involved
was the same as that furthered by roving-patrol stops, the Court nonetheless sustained
the constitutionality of the Border Patrol’s checkpoint operations. 
The Court reaffirmed sobriety checkpoint stops in Michigan Dept. of State
Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990) when the need to protect lives and property
trumped the need to protect drivers’ Fourth Amendment rights. The courts have
also upheld pretextual stops in cases where officers find some alternative reason to
stop a car when they really want to search it. For example, in Whren v. United
States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996), undercover officers wanted to stop a car with young
occupants on the belief they were involved in drug activities. They followed the
car, driven by a youthful driver, and after the driver turned without signaling,
the officers approached the car when it was stopped at a traffic light and
instructed the driver to put the car in park. At the same time, one officer saw two
bags of marijuana in the driver’s hands. The trial court refused to suppress the
drugs seized. In affirming that ruling, the Supreme Court noted, “Not only have we
never held, outside the context of inventory search or administrative inspection . . .
that an officer’s motive invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the Fourth
Amendment; but we have repeatedly held and asserted the contrary.” 
When talking about a car search pursuant to a warrant, all the general rules gov-
erning search warrants apply. In the case of warrantless searches, once a car is

34
Automobile search
\
stopped, however, the road is much less defined. The seminal Supreme Court case
authorizing a warrantless search of a car was Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132
(1925). The case resulted from the stop and search of a notorious bootlegger’s car
between Detroit and Grand Rapids, Michigan, during prohibition. The Court relied
on an officer’s probable cause to believe there was contraband in the suspect auto-
mobile in order to justify the stop and subsequent seizure of both the car and the
liquor found in the car. 
One of the more logical circumstances under which a warrantless search of a car
is acceptable is the “plain view” exception. Simply, if contraband is plainly visible
to an officer once the car is stopped, the officer has the right to seize it, and it will
be admitted into evidence at trial. For example, in Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U.S.
1 (1980), the court refused to block the admission of wrenches and stolen items
that were discovered by an officer looking into a car window after he had stopped
the driver for speeding. The court held simply that there was probable cause to
seize the items without a warrant. 
Similarly, items found in a car during a Terry search are also admissible
although Terry searches are conducted without a warrant. In Terry v. Ohio, 392
U.S. 1 (1968), the Court upheld an officer’s right to search pedestrians for weapons
if there was an articulable suspicion of criminal activity justifying a stop of the
pedestrian. The Terry rationale, the need to protect the officer’s safety, has been
applied to car searches as well. 
The Court was quick to apply Terry to specific automobile situations. For exam-
ple in Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143 (1972), it held that police, acting on an
informant’s tip, could reach into the passenger compartment of an automobile to
remove a gun from a driver’s waistband even where the gun was not apparent to
police from outside the car, and the police knew of its existence only because of the
tip. That decision rested, in part, on the Court’s concern about the danger for police
officers in traffic stop and automobile situations.
The Court again recognized that investigative detentions involving suspects in
vehicles were especially fraught with danger to police officers in Pennsylvania v.
Mimms, 434 U.S. 106 (1977). There, the Court held that police may order persons
out of a car during a stop for a traffic violation and may frisk those persons for
weapons if there is a reasonable belief that those persons are armed and dangerous.
Consider Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983). In that case, although the driver
was outside the car, an officer had searched the interior of the car after seeing a
hunting knife on the floor. During the search, marijuana was found, and the driver
was charged with possession. In the Michigan ruling, the Court looked to New York v.
Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981) to expand the Terry search concept. In discussing
searches incident to arrest, the Belton decision explained that the concept of
“within a person’s immediate control” had not been successfully defined. Thus, to
provide a “workable rule,” the Court held that “articles inside the relatively narrow
compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact generally, even
if not inevitably, within ‘the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to
grab a weapon’ . . . .” Applying the rules governing search incident to arrest, the
Belton decision also ruled police could examine the contents of any open or closed
container found within the passenger compartment, “for if the passenger compart-
ment is within the reach of the arrestee, so will containers in it be within his reach.”

As noted, search incident to arrest is another of the justifications approved by
the Supreme Court for searching a car without a warrant. The search incident to
arrest doctrine was clarified in United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973).
There, the Court directed that “in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search
of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth
Amendment, but is also a ‘reasonable’ search under that Amendment.” While a
search incident to arrest was initially limited by the courts, as seen in Belton, it is a
doctrine that has expanded over time. Indeed, in Thornton v. United States, 541
U.S. 615 (2004), the court allowed a search of the interior of a car even though the
driver had stepped out of the car before he was arrested. Police may also search a
vehicle and its contents without a warrant in the course of conducting an “inventory
search” following a lawful arrest or vehicle seizure. 
It had been a long-standing rule that in carrying out a warrantless search of a car,
police are generally prohibited from searching the passengers in the car. This, too,
is a barrier that has fallen over time. If officers have a reasonable suspicion that
passengers may be armed, passengers may be subjected to a Terry-style search.
Further, if while searching the car, officers find sufficient evidence to provide prob-
able cause to arrest passengers, they may conduct a search incident to arrest.
There have been cases in which a car search led to the arrest of the car’s occu-
pants, rather than the arrest of the passengers justifying a search. In Maryland v.
Pringle, 540 U.S. 366 (2003), the Supreme Court approved the arrest of three auto-
mobile passengers after investigating officers found $763 and five baggies of
cocaine in the car, and all three occupants denied any knowledge of the drugs or
cash. The car had been stopped for speeding. After giving the driver a verbal warn-
ing, the officer asked for and received permission to search the car. The Court held
that “an entirely reasonable inference from these facts [is] that any or all three of
the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the
cocaine. Thus a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause [to
arrest all three].”
The powers of police to conduct searches of containers in cars have expanded
over time, along with the other powers discussed here. In 1977, the Supreme Court
decided United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1, and held that a warrantless search
of a footlocker stored in the open trunk of a defendant’s car was a violation of the
defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights. The evidence, a large quantity of marijuana,
was not admissible. 
Three years later, the Supreme Court did a complete turnaround and allowed a
thorough search of a car and sealed containers within the car when there was prob-
able cause to believe the car, or the containers, contained drugs or other contra-
band. In United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798 (1982), the Court reviewed the Carroll
decision to find that, historically, warrantless searches of cars were appropriate to
seize contraband in transit. It was a small step for the Court to find that containers
within the car should be subject to the same search to achieve the same goal. It
ruled that “the rationale justifying a warrantless search of an automobile that is
believed to be transporting contraband arguably applies with equal force to any
movable container that is believed to be carrying an illicit substance.”
The Court then noted that its decision was a direct contradiction of the holding
in Chadwick, but then relied on Carroll to rule that “when a legitimate search is

36

\
under way, and when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined, nice
distinctions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the case of a home, or
between glove compartments, upholstered seats, trunks, and wrapped packages, in
the case of a vehicle, must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient com-
pletion of the task at hand . . . . This rule applies equally to all containers, as indeed
we believe it must.”

Background checks
Background checks are investigations into the character or history of an individ-
ual. They are performed by government and private-sector employers, by purchas-
ers of corporations who are performing due diligence checks on the acquired
corporation’s leaders, by insurance companies and other litigants who wish to
investigate individuals making claims, by charitable organizations who are seeking
volunteers, and sometimes by family members or friends who are suspicious of the
individual’s love interest. A number of factors have contributed to a dramatic
increase in background checks, including fears of terrorism and workplace vio-
lence, liability for employee negligence, risks associated with hiring litigious
employees, employee fraud and embezzlement, the possibility of volunteers abus-
ing the elderly or children, and the low cost and high speed with which electronic
public records databases can be searched.
Background checks vary greatly in procedure and scope, depending on the pur-
pose for which the check is performed. A background check for a national security
position can cost $10,000, involve polygraph testing and an in-depth exploration of
the applicant’s associations, and focus on past or current behavior that could sub-
ject the applicant to extortion.
Regular employment background checks are much less expensive, ranging from
a simple electronic records search that can cost less than $50 to in-depth vetting for
corporate executives, which can run into thousands of dollars. Regular employment
background checks focus on criminal convictions and arrests, past litigations, a his-
tory of insurance or worker’s compensation claims, driving record, credit card and
other debt, drug and alcohol use (which may be explored using urine analysis or
hair or blood testing), medical problems, and military history. They can involve
interviews with neighbors and other associates, and verification of educational sta-
tus and of prior employment. Because of concerns about employee theft, major
employers have created cooperative anti-shoplifting databases that may be queried
to see whether an applicant has ever been accused of dishonesty without actually
being charged with a crime. In the retail and service sector, background checks
often are combined with “personality tests” designed to gauge an individual’s atti-
tudes toward workplace organization, work ethic, and honesty.
\

In the employment context, background checks are governed by the federal Fair
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and by state regulations. The FCRA requires
employers to obtain consent from the employee before engaging in a background
check, specifies procedures to prevent stale and inaccurate information from being
provided to the employer, and gives the employee the right to an “adverse action”
notice if the check is used to deny employment. The Federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission bars employers from relying solely on criminal convic-
tion information; the nature of the conviction must be relevant to the job, or there
must be some independent, sound business reason for taking action against the
individual. State laws impose further restrictions, in some cases including prohibi-
tions on the use of derogatory information more than seven years old or arrest data
that did not result in a conviction.
Outside the employment context, investigating the background of another may
not be subject to any kind of regulation. For instance, charitable organizations may
investigate prospective volunteers to avoid risks of elder or child abuse. Sometimes
individuals suspicious of a friend’s or family member’s personal activities will ini-
tiate a background check. These unregulated checks can amount to cursory scans of
public records databases or more involved inquiries, including illegal “asset
searches” performed by investigators who trick banks and other organizations into
revealing the subject’s financial status.

Banking and financial records
Most individuals have high expectations of privacy with regard to their banking
records and other financial information. People generally do not expect informa-
tion about their bank accounts, credit card transactions, and other financial mat-
ters to be shared with outside parties without their permission. The shift from cash
to checks and to debit and credit cards has made paying for goods and services
more convenient, but it has resulted in vast amounts of data stored automatically in
computers and databases, and it raises the potential for databases to be linked in
order to share and combine information obtained from different sources. The result
can be a detailed compilation of information about an individual’s saving, spend-
ing, and even travel habits.

Banking and financial records
\
39
One of the problems created by the presence of financial information in data-
bases is the increased risk of identity fraud or theft (assuming another person’s
identity for financial gain). As more personally identifiable information becomes
available, it becomes easier for criminals to access details that were previously
considered private. A second problem is government access to bank and financial
records that individuals would prefer to keep secret. The possibility of government
surveillance of financial activities threatens some of our fundamental freedoms. 
Several federal laws have been enacted to protect banking and financial privacy
in the United States, although they all have important exceptions that allow infor-
mation to be shared with government authorities and private-sector entities for var-
ious purposes.
The Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) creates a right of privacy with
respect to an individual’s bank records. It was enacted in response to the Supreme
Court’s decision in United States v. Miller (1976), where the Court found that bank
customers had no legal right to privacy in their banking transactions. The Court
concluded that when individuals voluntarily share or develop records in the ordi-
nary course of a business relationship with another entity (as in a bank-customer
relationship), they have relinquished their expectation of privacy and therefore
have no constitutional protection against government access to such records.
Congress enacted the RFPA in response to the Miller decision. The RFPA bars
federal government agencies from obtaining records from a financial institution
unless the customer authorizes access; a valid summons, subpoena, or search war-
rant has been prepared; or there is an appropriate written request from a govern-
ment official who is authorized to obtain the records. Moreover, the government
agency must give individuals notice and an opportunity to object before any disclo-
sures can be made. The RFPA governs only disclosures to the federal government
and its officers, agents, and departments; it does not govern the sharing of informa-
tion with private businesses or with state governments. As for the sharing of finan-
cial information in the private sector, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the
Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and discussed later, provide some protection for individ-
uals. State laws may provide similar protection against access by state government
officials and agencies.
The RFPA has many exceptions. The most noteworthy is the Bank Secrecy Act
(BSA), which requires federally insured banks to retain records and create reports
that could be useful in tax, criminal, or regulatory investigations. The law was
passed to address concerns that the shift from paper to computerized records would
make law enforcement in relation to white-collar crime more complicated. The
BSA not only allows banks and other financial institutions (including gambling
casinos and dealers in precious metals) to disclose financial records to the federal
government in certain circumstances; it actually requires them to report the trans-
actions. Moreover, when banks report information to the federal government pursu-
ant to the BSA, they are required not to disclose to their customers that reports have
been filed about them. 
Among other transactions, the law requires the reporting of deposits or with-
drawals of more than $10,000 in cash in one day, or the purchase of money orders,
cashier’s checks, traveler’s checks and similar instruments involving more than

40
Banking and financial records
\
$3000 of cash. The bank must report the individual’s name, address, and occupa-
tion, as well as other information about the transaction in a “currency transaction
report” to the Internal Revenue Service. For transactions exceeding $5,000 into or
out of the United States, the amount, date, and identity of the recipient must be
reported. Moreover, if it appears that the customer is taking action to evade the
reporting requirement, the bank must file a “suspicious activity report” explaining
the activity. All of these reports are electronically filed and are immediately avail-
able to United States Attorneys and law enforcement agencies throughout the
country. Financial institutions face heavy penalties if they do not comply. The BSA
was strengthened in 2001 by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Provid-
ing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of
2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), which gave government authorities increased access
to bank records in an effort to track financial transactions that could identify terrorists.
The purpose of the BSA is to aid law enforcement in policing money launder-
ing, tax evasion, embezzlement, drug dealing, and other criminal behavior. A sin-
gle report about a customer is usually of no concern to authorities, but multiple
reports may signal a need for further investigation. Businesses that routinely deal in
large amounts of cash, such as bars and restaurants, can be exempted from having
their deposits and withdrawals monitored, although such an exemption is not rou-
tinely granted.
The BSA covers banks, retailers, gasoline companies, and other issuers of credit
cards; traveler’s check issuers; the U.S. Postal Service; securities dealers; and casi-
nos. In addition to the mandatory disclosure of the transactions discussed previ-
ously, certain financial information is not protected by the RFPA and therefore can
be disclosed to government officials without customer consent; these include dis-
closures that do not identify a customer personally, disclosures in connection with
the financial institution’s own interests (such as the perfection of security interests
and information relating to federal government loans), disclosures relating to bank
regulatory supervision, disclosures authorized under other federal laws, and emer-
gency disclosures to federal agencies with foreign intelligence or other national
security functions.
With respect to the private sector, the GLBA imposes limits on the collection
and sharing of information in the financial services industry. The GLBA grew out
of a movement to reform the financial services industry and eliminate the historical
separation of banks, brokerage companies, and insurers. After the collapse of the
banking industry in the Great Depression, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act,
which prohibited national and state banks from affiliating with securities invest-
ment companies. In 1956 Congress passed the Bank Holding Company Act, which
prohibited banks from owning non-bank companies in general. The Bank Holding
Company Act was amended in 1982 to prohibit banks from engaging in insurance
underwriting activities. As the financial services industry evolved in the 1980s and
1990s, however, Congress repealed these prohibitions in the GLBA, and banks
were once again allowed to engage in a wide range of financial services activities,
including insurance and securities investments.
Congress perceived significant privacy risks in allowing banks, brokerage firms,
and insurers to merge or affiliate, so it included in the GLBA a series of provisions
designed to limit the sharing of customer information. Another motivating force

Banking and financial records
\
41
was the adoption of the European Data Protection Directive in 1995. The direc-
tive applies to any entity that maintains personal information on EU citizens. This
means that U.S. companies must ensure that information on EU citizens is treated
in accordance with the privacy standards in effect in Europe. Congress fashioned
the privacy protections of the GLBA with the intention that compliance with the
GLBA would also mean compliance with the EU rules. 
The privacy protections in the GLBA are far from absolute, however. The GLBA
sets no limits on the type of information that financial services companies can col-
lect and retain on individuals. Individuals who interact with a financial services
company must understand that virtually all information that the business can
uncover about them can be stored in a database. Moreover, the GLBA expressly
authorizes banks, insurers, investment companies, and other financial services
organizations that are affiliated with each other, through common ownership or
otherwise, to share personal financial information without the customer’s permis-
sion. An affiliate is a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with another company. Although affiliates must tell customers that they are
sharing this information, individuals cannot block the sharing of information
among affiliated institutions. Because large conglomerates of affiliated entities
dominate the financial services industry, sharing of personal information without
customer consent is routine.
Customers can choose to opt out of any disclosure arrangement involving the
sharing of their personal data between a conglomerate and a non-affiliated third
party. A non-affiliated company is one that is unrelated to the financial services
company possessing personal information about the customer. Non-affiliates may
include companies that want the information in order to compile mailing lists for
their own marketing purposes. 
Individuals must read the privacy policy of the financial institution to learn how to
exercise their opt-in and opt-out rights.The GLBA does not require consent from the
customer before any data can be distributed to others. To opt out, the customer usually
has to call a toll-free number or mail in a response card indicating the consumer’s opt-
out choice. Even if customers take the initiative and exercise their limited opt-out
rights, they must trust the financial services company to honor the request and maintain
adequate security procedures to prevent unauthorized sharing and access. 
Financial institutions cannot disclose customer account numbers or access codes
to a non-affiliated third party for use in marketing activities. Thus, even if custom-
ers do not opt out of an information sharing arrangement with non-affiliates, credit
card and debit card numbers, PINs, and account passwords cannot be sold.
The GLBA also requires financial services companies to develop systems to
ensure that customer information is secure against “hacking” and other unautho-
rized access. The law also prohibits certain kinds of “pretexting,” the practice of
collecting personal information under false pretenses. Pretexters pose as law
enforcement officials, social workers, potential employers, bank personnel, or
other parties and create convincing stories in order to elicit information from
unsuspecting businesses and consumers. The GLBA criminalizes the use of fraudu-
lent statements to solicit financial information. 
To apprise customers of the privacy practices of a business, the GLBA
requires financial institutions to provide customers with notices that explain how

42
Banking and financial records
\
the company handles personal information and shares it with others. The notice
must be clear and conspicuous and must accurately describe the firm’s privacy
practices. It must explain, in general terms, what information the company collects,
with what other companies it shares the information, and how it safeguards its data-
bases. The notice must be given to customers by mail or through another in-person
method of communication. Acceptable ways of communicating this information
depend on the type of business. For example, an online lender may post its privacy
policy on its website and require that the customer acknowledge its receipt before
applying for a loan. The dissemination of privacy notices or privacy policies in the
financial services industry is now commonplace.
The GLBA exempts several categories of transactions from its privacy protec-
tions. Financial institutions can disclose customer information with credit reporting
agencies, government regulatory agencies, and a company that is purchasing the
business. They can also share information with outside firms that provide essential
services, such as data processing, check printing, or mortgage servicing, and with
firms that agree to jointly market the company’s products and services. These
exceptions allow much information to be shared without consumer knowledge or
consent. 
The GLBA applies only to “nonpublic” personal information—data that cannot
be obtained from sources in the public domain. Most of the information about cus-
tomers in a financial institution’s database is nonpublic, but information that is
publicly available, such as a mortgage loan recorded in the public records, is not
covered by the GLBA. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which protects the privacy of consumer
information held by credit bureaus, also governs certain transactions involving
banks and other financial institutions. Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies
(credit bureaus) can release the credit reports of consumers to financial institutions
when individuals apply for credit, open bank accounts, or initiate other financial
transactions. When a financial company obtains a credit report, it may want to
share the report with an affiliated business. Under the FCRA, the credit report can-
not be shared with affiliates unless the consumer has first been notified and given
the opportunity to opt out. This is similar to the opt-out right under the GLBA, and
the opt-out notice is likely to be included in the privacy policy delivered to the cus-
tomer under the GLBA. However, unlike the case with the GLBA, consumers who
exercise their opt-out rights under the FCRA can prevent the sharing of information
among affiliates, but only information obtained from a credit report that has been
issued by a credit reporting agency.

Bank Secrecy Act
The United States Congress enacted the Currency and Foreign Transactions
Reporting Act, more commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act, in 1970. This leg-
islation requires banks and other financial institutions to report information on their
customers to the federal government. This information is to be collected and trans-
mitted, without the knowledge or consent of customers, whenever the financial
institution detected “suspicious activity.” Financial institutions are required to
report transactions over $10,000 in cash to the Treasury Department by means of
the Currency Transaction Report. Once this information is filed, it becomes avail-
able to most law enforcement agencies through the Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network (FinCEN) of the Treasury Department. Information posted on FinCEN
can be accessed by law enforcement agencies without a requirement of probable
cause. This means that there is no need for a judge to issue a search warrant, court
order, or subpoena for this information. 
The original intent of the Bank Secrecy Act was to identify the source and dollar
amount of any transaction consisting of currency or other monetary instruments
coming into or leaving the United States. The purpose of having financial institu-
tions track these transactions was to create an audit trail with the Treasury Depart-
ment to allow the apprehension and prosecution of individuals involved in the act
of money laundering or tax evasion. Although the act left the responsibility of
reporting these types of suspicious activities with the individual financial institu-
tions, subsequent legislation created additional regulation with regard to these
activities. 
The Money Laundering Control Act was passed in 1986 to provide for crimi-
nal prosecution of those employees of financial institutions who aid in the laun-
dering of money. Penalties can be imposed on employees who either assist in the
act of laundering money or circumvent the reporting procedures by creating sev-
eral smaller transactions that avoid the reporting requirements set by the Bank
Secrecy Act. These penalties were strengthened by additional legislation in 1992
and 1994 requiring all financial institutions to institute polices designed to edu-
cate their employees with the goal of achieving full compliance with the legisla-
tion. Due to different interpretations by different financial institutions, it was
recognized in 1996 that there was a need to standardize the information col-
lected. This resulted in the creation of the Suspicious Activity Report, to be used
by all U.S. financial institutions. This report is filed any time a financial institu-
tion believes that a transaction has been made that violates U.S. law or is just sus-
picious in nature.
In reaction to the events of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the Uniting
and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to

44
Bank Secrecy Act
\
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act). Title III
of the act, called the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-
Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, added the most power to the Bank Secrecy Act
since its inception in 1970. Financing of terrorist activities could be fought by such
measures as prohibiting financial institutions in the United States from doing busi-
ness with foreign shell banks, improving cooperation and information sharing
among institutions, and creating more rigorous customer identification procedures. 
With the modifications made to the original Bank Secrecy Act, the number of
federal and state law enforcement agencies utilizing the reports generated about
suspicious activity has increased tremendously. These agencies include the U.S.
Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comp-
troller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, and several international orga-
nizations, to name just a few. However, the role of gatekeeper of this information
remains with FinCEN. FinCEN has been given the authority to post regulations and
interpretive guidance and to pursue civil cases against violators as necessary. Fin-
CEN relies on the federal banking agencies to examine banks within their areas of
responsibility for compliance with the policies and procedures set up under the
Bank Secrecy Act and subsequent legislation. 
Since the inception of the Bank Secrecy Act the reasons for gathering informa-
tion on financial transactions have changed, although the overall process has
remained constant. In the War on Drugs, information gathered through this act has
assisted in identifying, detaining, and prosecuting individuals involved in money
laundering. In conjunction with the Drug Enforcement Agency, and with the coop-
eration of foreign governments, many individuals involved in narcotics trafficking
have been identified and their networks destabilized. Now, amidst the “War on Ter-
ror,” the focus remains on the flow of money to groups who wish to harm others,
albeit in a different way.
However, drug dealers and terrorists are not the only focus of law enforcement
efforts utilizing this information sharing capacity. Corrupt businesses, politicians,
and others seeking to benefit from fraudulently exploiting others also use money
laundering. Such entities and individuals can adversely affect the securities mar-
kets, as shareholders are essentially being robbed of their assets without their
knowledge. This can make their stock worthless and cause the markets to tumble. 
Whether by preventing criminals from funneling funds to terrorists and drug
dealers or preventing corrupt business people and politicians or other individuals
from defrauding citizens and shareholders, the goal of this legislation is to help
maintain trust in the financial markets of the United States. By monitoring informa-
tion on who is making large monetary transactions and combining that information
with other sources, the Department of the Treasury can track criminal activity and
protect the general population.

Bar code readers and scanners
A bar code scanner was first used in 1974, when a pack of Wrigley’s chewing
gum was scanned in an Ohio supermarket. Since then this technology has prolifer-
ated to include over 300 different bar codes now used for inventory control, track-
ing of hospital patients, prescription drug labels, library checkout, and even DNA
coding. The privacy issues relating to bar codes pertain to what information is col-
lected and to what uses this information is put. 
The basic technology in bar code scanning involves an electromagnetic laser
scanner that produces a beam of light. The light is shone on a bar code tag that con-
sists of lines and spaces of varying thickness and printed in different combinations.
The bar code is a linear binary code of 1s and 0s. The light hits the bar code and is
reflected by the white portions of the code while being absorbed by the black lines.
The reflected portion is sensed by a detector in the scanner, which converts it to an
electrical signal. This signal is then translated into the binary language of the com-
puter, a string of 0s and 1s. A computer, either on-site or central, matches the code
to the item name. The main benefits of bar codes are speed and efficiency. For
instance, entering 12 characters of data on a keyboard takes 6 seconds whereas
scanning a 12-character bar code takes 0.3 second.
The first bar coding system was the Universal Product Code (UPC). This coding
is now ubiquitous in retail markets. The information from bar codes is used by
retail managers to monitor customer purchases and respond instantly to changes in
demand. In some cases information on purchases is electronically transmitted to
the distributor, who uses it to instantly restock products. The bar code also allows
stores to track customer buying patterns when it is coupled with the demographic
information associated with supermarket loyalty cards. 
The basic bar code, like the Universal Product Code, is vertically redundant,
meaning that information is repeated vertically. Newer bar code technologies
include two-dimensional codes that store information along the height as well as
the length of the symbol. The 2-D symbol can be read with a handheld moving-
beam scanner by sweeping the horizontal beam down the symbol and can include
an expanded amount of information. This technology was originally designed for
items with space limitations but has expanded to include applications where the
ability to encode a portable database makes it attractive to businesses. For example,
storing name, address, and demographic information on direct mail business reply
cards allows businesses to immediately access demographic information rather
than check it against a larger database.
Two-dimensional bar codes are now used on driver’s licenses in about 30 states.
Included in the information on these codes is not only what is listed on the front of
the driver’s license, but also biometric identifiers. For example, a Georgia license
stores two digital fingerprints as well as the person’s signature. A Tennessee
driver’s license stores a facial recognition template. Kentucky recently has embed-
ded a black-and-white electronic version of the driver’s photograph in the bar code.

This information can be accessed by private individuals who purchase the appro-
priate bar code scanner. For example, bars and convenience stores use this technol-
ogy to monitor age for alcohol sales and also to capture customer information not
only for marketing purposes but also for denying sales to disagreeable patrons. Pri-
vacy rights activists charge that the information encoded on the driver’s license cre-
ates a de facto national identity card that can be registered in many databases. 
There are instances where the information from bar codes has had significant
consequences. The government of the German Federal Republic in the 1970s used
bar code technology to check civil servants’ political leanings by tracking their bor-
rowing of politically questionable books from the public library. This simple cata-
loging technique thus has become an instrument of governmental control, a
development that has contemporary relevance in the United States in conjunction
with the provisions of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
(USA PATRIOT Act). Bar codes in this context have the potential to undermine
civil liberties and the right to privacy.
The newest generation of bar code is the radio frequency identification tag
(RFID). This tag contains tiny computer chips linked to a small antenna. Devices
called readers detect information from these tags using radio wave transmitters
when the tag moves into the range of the reader. This technology is being devel-
oped for retail use as well as for government documents such as passports and ele-
mentary school ID cards. Privacy activists worry that because this type of
technology allows signals to be read from hundreds of feet rather than being
scanned at the point of the card, personal information is much more vulnerable and
the surveillance capacity of computer chips is broadened as they are brought into
individual residences. The amount of information that can be stored on these chips
is much greater compared with conventional bar codes.

Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001)
During contentious collective-bargaining negotiations between a Pennsylvania
high school teachers’ union and the local school board, Bartnicki, the chief union
negotiator, and Kane, the union president, had a conversation on a cellular tele-
phone that was intercepted and recorded by an unidentified person. A nonbinding
arbitration proposal, generally favorable to the teachers, had all but settled the dis-
pute, when Vopper, a radio commentator critical of the unions, played the tape of
the intercepted conversation on a segment of his public affairs talk show dedicated
to covering the settlement. The tape was subsequently aired on another station and
its content was published in the local newspapers. In the recorded conversation, Bart-
nicki and Kane discussed the timing of a proposed strike, the difficulties created by

Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001)
\
47
public comment on the negotiations, and the need for a dramatic response to the
school board’s intransigence. 
Bartnicki and Kane filed suit against Vopper and other members of the media. It
was discovered that Vopper obtained the tape from Jack Yocum, the head of a local
taxpayers’ association opposed to the union’s demands. Yocum testified that he dis-
covered the tape in his mailbox. When he played it, he recognized the voices of
Bartnicki and Kane. He played it for the school board and then delivered it to Vop-
per, as well as to other individuals and media representatives. Both parties sought
summary judgment. Bartnicki alleged that each of the defendants who aired or
published the contents of the tape “knew or had reason to know” that the recording
of the private phone conversation had been obtained in violation of both federal and
state anti-wiretap statutes. Bartnicki sought actual damages, statutory damages,
punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. The defendants argued that there was no
violation because (1) if the interception was illegal, the defendants had nothing to
do with the it; (2) the conversation might have been intercepted inadvertently, not
illegally, and therefore the defendant’s actions were not unlawful; and (3) if the
defendants had violated the statute by disclosing the conversations, the disclosures
were protected under the First Amendment and the defendants were not liable for
damages. The district court found that the defendants had clearly violated the stat-
ute; they “knew or had reason to know” that the information was obtained through
an illegal interception. Actual involvement in the illegal interception was not
required. However, whether the interception was inadvertent was a disputed fact, so
summary judgment was denied. The court did, however, grant a motion for an
interlocutory appeal, which sought an answer to the following questions of law:
“(1) whether the imposition of liability on the media defendants under the [wiretap-
ping] statutes solely for broadcasting the newsworthy tape on [Vopper’s] radio
news/public affairs program, when the tape was illegally intercepted and recorded
by unknown persons who were not agents of [the] defendants, violates the First
amendment; and (2) whether imposition of liability under the [anti-wiretapping]
statutes on Defendant Yocum solely for providing the anonymously intercepted
and recorded tape to the media violates the First Amendment.” 
All parties agree that the wiretapping statutes are content-neutral laws of general
applicability. They do not seek to discriminate against any particular speech con-
tent or single out a particular viewpoint; they seek to protect privacy. A content-
neutral regulation is subject to the “intermediate scrutiny standard”; that is, it will
be sustained under a First Amendment challenge if it advances important govern-
mental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden
substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests. The Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit determined that under this standard, the wiretapping
statutes were invalid because they deterred significantly more speech than neces-
sary to protect the privacy interests at stake. Bartnicki appealed.
The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. It accepted the following find-
ings of facts: (1) The conversation was intercepted illegally (i.e., in violation of the
wiretapping statutes). (2) The defendants violated the wiretapping statutes because
they knew or should have known that the conversation was intercepted illegally. (3)
The defendants played no part in the interception itself; they obtained the informa-
tion from the tapes lawfully, even though someone else unlawfully intercepted the

\
information. (4) The subject matter of the conversation was a matter of public con-
cern. The Court also accepted that (5) the wiretapping statutes were content-neutral
laws of general applicability and that intermediate scrutiny was the appropriate stan-
dard to apply. The Court was required to determine only whether the application of
these statutes, under these particular facts, violated the First Amendment. 
The Court began its analysis of this question by setting out general principles of
law from previous cases. Smith v. Daily Mail held that “state action to punish the
publication of truthful information seldom can satisfy constitutional standards.”
Florida Star v. B.J.F. held that “if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful informa-
tion about a matter of public significance then state officials may not constitution-
ally punish publication of the information absent a need . . . of the highest order.”
New York Times v. United States upheld the publication of documents of great pub-
lic importance stolen by a third party, focusing primarily on the character of docu-
ments’ contents and the consequences of the disclosure. That case, however, did
not resolve the issue here: whether the government may punish not only unlawful
acquisition of information, but the ensuing publication as well. The Court noted
that it had carefully tried to avoid categorical holding of whether publication of
truthful information may ever be punished under the First Amendment. 
The government argued that two important interests are served by the statute:
preventing disclosure deters parties from intercepting private communications, and
it minimizes the harm to persons whose private communications have been ille-
gally intercepted. The Court took these up in turn. It opined that the interest of
deterrence is insufficient to justify punishing disclosures in this case. The defen-
dants published lawfully obtained information of public interest by someone who
was not involved in the initial illegality. While illegal interceptors are usually
known, and usually disclose intercepted communications for public praise or finan-
cial reward, imposing sanctions on the media in this case will not deter unidentified
scanners from such antisocial conduct. The Court found, however, that the govern-
ment’s interest in minimizing harm to the invasion of privacy was a considerably
stronger argument. The wiretapping statutes encourage uninhibited exchange of
ideas and information among private parties, and fear of public disclosure might
have a chilling effect on speech. Therefore, the statutes may be applied in most
cases without violating the First Amendment, in order to prevent disclosures of
trade secrets or domestic gossip. However, in this case, enforcement of the statute
imposes sanctions on the publication of truthful information of public concern,
implicating the core purposes of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court held,
relying on the general proposition that freedom of expression upon public ques-
tions is secured by the First Amendment, that privacy concerns must give way in
publishing matters of public importance.
Justice Breyer, joined by Justice O’Connor, concurred in the opinion and agreed
with the narrow holding limited to these special circumstances: radio broadcasters
engaged in no unlawful act aside from the broadcasting itself, and the information
involved a matter of unusual public concern, namely, a threat of harm to others.
The concurrence went on to explain why the majority’s opinion should not be read
as signifying a broad constitutional immunity to the media. 
Justices Scalia and Thomas joined Chief Justice Rehnquist in his dissent. The dis-
sent expressed concern over the loss of privacy signified by the majority’s opinion. It

faulted the majority for limiting the holding to “matters of public concern” without
defining that amorphous term. It argued that the majority opinion diminishes the
First Amendment rather than enhances it because the opinion will have the effect of
chilling the speech of citizens who increasingly rely on electronic technology—
cellular telephones and electronic mail—to communicate. The dissent found fault
with the majority’s reliance on the line of cases it referred to. Further, it disagreed
with the majority view that Bartnicki and Kane, by discussing a matter of public
importance, somehow were contributing to a public debate and that their privacy
interests were subordinate to the disclosure of these statements. The dissent argued
that the right to privacy, at its narrowest, must include the right to be free from
surreptitious eavesdropping and the involuntary broadcast of cellular telephone
conversations.

Bauer v. Kincaid, 759 F. Supp. 575 (1991)
Traci Bauer was the editor-in-chief of the Southwest Standard, a newspaper for
Southwest Missouri State University students. She brought an action against
Southwest Missouri State University when it refused to release information about
criminal occurrences that were committed on the SMSU campus. She claimed that
under the Missouri Open Records Act (MORA), the university was obligated to
provide all of the information that it collected and maintained regarding criminal
activity. The act requires that all public governmental bodies provide all public
records upon request for the purpose of ensuring that all public meetings would be
conducted openly and subject to public examination. It also was intended to pro-
vide a record of the decisions that each public official made and to make it avail-
able to the public for examination. The act was to be interpreted literally and,
unless otherwise protected by law, there could be no exception as to what records
were available for general viewing and copying.
The defendants, the Southwest Missouri State University Board of Regents,
among others, claimed that under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA), the school was prohibited from providing the requested documents.
FERPA requires that federal funds be withheld from any educational agency that
releases records regarding any student without the student’s consent. They also

50
Bauer v. Kincaid, 759 F. Supp. 575 (1991)
\
claimed that SMSU’s Safety and Security Department, which maintained the
requested files, was not a public governmental body and therefore was not subject
to the regulations under MORA. 
Using MORA’s definition of “governmental body,” the district court deemed
that the Board of Regents was obligated to surrender the records to the Southwest
Standard. The university’s claim that the records were maintained by the Safety
and Security Department was simply an attempt to shield the university from the
requirements under MORA. Even if SMSU’s Safety and Security Department was
not considered a public governmental body, it was under the command of the uni-
versity’s Board of Regents; therefore, the records were subject to MORA. The
court ruled that it was unreasonable to believe that the university’s Board of
Regents did not have any authority or legal control over the Safety and Security
Department. 
The court specifically responded to the assertion that the university was not
required to provide the requested records because it was protected under FERPA.
The defendants claimed that “directory information” was the only information that
FERPA allowed to be released to the public. The court ruled that FERPA did not
provide exemption to the university from the Open Records Act because the infor-
mation requested was not information that FERPA intended to protect. The protec-
tion provided under FERPA covered information that students were required to
divulge on applications for admission as well as information on a student’s aca-
demic progress at the university. There is no mention in the act of the protection of
criminal investigation or incident reports conducted under the jurisdiction of the
university. 
Even if the reports were covered by the act, this would not prohibit the univer-
sity from releasing them. The act’s purpose is to impose penalties on educational
entities that release information described in the act. The act does not impose a law
that bars schools from releasing information; instead, it allows federal funds to be
withheld from schools whose policies permit the release of information. The court
ruled that because the information was not directly protected under FERPA, and
because the act itself is not binding law, the university was not exempt from the
Open Records Act. 
The District Court of Missouri ordered the release of all records held by South-
west Missouri State University regarding criminal occurrences on the campus on
the grounds that the Board of Regents was a governmental body and therefore was
in violation of MORA. Furthermore, the court dismissed the university’s argument
that FERPA exempted it from producing the requested information because the act
was not intended to protect the kind of information being sought by the newspaper.

Big Brother
“Big Brother” is a fictional character in George Orwell’s novel Nineteen Eighty-
Four. In the book Orwell, the pen name of the English writer Eric Blair (1903–
1950), depicts a dystopian futuristic society deprived of privacy, freedom, and history
and controlled with the use of totalitarianism, terror, and dehumanizing practices.
These practices include a variety of ubiquitous physical and mental surveillance
techniques that penetrate every aspect of the society. It is through surveillance that
privacy is obliterated and people are reduced to numbers. A phrase that appears
throughout the text, “Big Brother Is Watching You,” symbolizes the apocalyptic
relationship between a dehumanizing system of surveillance serving the needs of
the oligarchic political regime, and the distruction of personal privacy.
The main protagonist, Winston Smith, introduces us to the society, where pri-
vate and public locales are continuously monitored by devices referred as “tele-
screens.” Whether positioned in an apartment, a house, an office, or an open public
space, the telescreens can always watch you. What’s more, the telescreens are not
merely recording cameras, but they are also the medium for instructing individuals
on what they must do on a daily basis: wake up at a certain time, exercise more vig-
orously in the morning, or report to a particular state-run Ministry. In addition, the
telescreens are technically capable of detecting subtle changes in an individual’s
words, facial expressions, intensity of breathing, or even the heartbeat. If any of
those basic factors are not satisfactory to the state inquisitors, whom Orwell
pointedly calls the “Thought Police,” the targeted individual may be imprisoned,
tortured, or, if confessing to nonexistent crimes against the state and the party,
put to death and erased from all records. Big Brother’s picture is displayed all
over Oceania: he is the embodiment of the party, the system, and the state. His
presence is encountered on public buildings, in the restrooms, above the bed. “Big
Brother Is Watching You,” asserts Orwell, adding, “Even from the coin [his] eyes
pursued you. On coins, on stamps, on the cover of books, on banners, on posters,
and on the wrapping of a cigarette packet—everywhere. Always the eyes watching
you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or
out of doors, in the bath or bed—no escape. Nothing was your own except the few
cubic centimeters inside your skull.”
Yet even within the people’s minds, privacy is significantly reduced. An individ-
ual’s thought process is continuously intruded on by state-imposed rituals such as the
“Two-Minute Hate,” a practice where individuals stare and yell at the telescreens
showing “prominent” enemies of the state. There is also “Doublethink,” the prac-
tice of holding two opposing thoughts at the same time and accepting both of them,
the altering of commonsense conclusions (e.g., 3 + 2 = 4), and the perpetual search
for the “internal” and “external enemies” amidst the never-ending state of war.
These daily exercises reinforce the fear and mistrust among the population, justifying

52
Big Brother
\
surveillance as necessary and defining privacy as obsolete, unpatriotic, and poten-
tially incriminating. 
If one’s privacy could at least be legally defined, defended, and asserted in a
court of law, the reassertion of basic human rights would be possible. However, “in
Oceania there is no law,” so the actions and behaviors that the state’s apparatchik
machinery monitors are never legally regulated. As a result, every individual’s act
or behavior is potentially criminal and severely punishable. 
Can individuals at least think of privacy in Nineteen Eighty-Four? Can they for-
mulate simple thoughts of what it means to have privacy? Even that possibility is
tragically decimated in the course of the novel because the vernacular that could
express and formulate these thoughts is systematically destroyed. The English lan-
guage, referred to as “Oldspeak,” is systematically replaced with a language
referred to as “Newspeak” in which words are reduced to codes without meanings.
The result is a society of individuals who are without the capacity to think, or even
to contemplate any alternative since there are no words to express such a scenario.
While having a lunch with one of the contributors to the latest “Newspeak” dictio-
nary, Winston Smith is told, “Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to
narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime [contempla-
tion of a crime] literally impossible because there will be no words in which to
express it.” 
But even without the spoken language, an individual must be able to remember
the past, to verify the memories of what it means to be a human, to retain a sense of
what it meant to have privacy, based on written records. But alas, not so in Oceania,
says Orwell. The entire society is constructed around perpetual falsification,
manipulation, adjustment, and surveillance. Who is fighting with whom in the
ongoing war changes depending on the alliance at any given time. The records
change too, creating the “verifiable” illusion that the past corresponds to the
present, whatever that present is determined to be. A person in Oceania does not
simply die after incarceration, trauma, torture, confession, and humiliation, but
rather is “vaporized” both physically and from all records that would testify as to
his or her existence. As one of the protagonists explains to Winston Smith, the
entire process of controlling and monitoring the population depends on the simple
maxim “who controls the past, controls the future.” For Winston Smith, however,
“the past was dead, the future was unimaginable.”
Even family and kinship relationships are scrutinized and controlled. The kids
report their parents to the police. Sex is understood to be “dirty” and as having
value only as a purely reproductive act. The most intimate conversations between
spouses dealing with love, the future, sex, and other such subjects are self-
censored. “The family has become an extension of the Thought Police. It [became]
a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by
informers who know him intimately.” For Winston Smith, this is one of the most
devastating developments: without intimacy and privacy, even the sense of tragedy
is beyond the realm of human experience, for, as he perceives, “tragedy belonged
to the ancient time, a time where there was still privacy.” 
Orwell’s novel unambiguously connects the practice of surveillance and the
obliteration of privacy to some technological aspects of modernity. The leaders of
previous eras were simply not equipped to enslave populations at the level the

Biometric identifiers
\
53
Orwellian society does. Newspaper, film, television, and other technical advances
of the modern era, in the hands of a lawless, dictatorial regime, suddenly became
surveillance tools canceling the possibility of a private life.
Yet Orwell sees modern phenomena such as class rebellion and rationality based
on the fundamental principles of the Enlightenment as the only way out of the
totalitarian nightmare. The Proles—constituting the majority of the population in
Oceania, kept under loose control by the authorities and ostracized through pov-
erty, disease, and ignorance—is the only group capable of effectively rebelling
against the Party if only it could regain the consciousness of its own strength, if
only the Proles were to understand that they are “the only remaining humans.”
Moreover, if individuals were to unequivocally reestablish the right to assert the
basic premises of the everyday truth, the rest would follow and the dictatorship
would fall—none of which happens in the novel.
George Orwell died in 1950. More than a half century after his death, Nineteen
Eighty-Four is still read as fiction, but its message is feared as the tantalizing
account of a world we do not want to wake up to, or recognize around us.

Biometric identifiers
Biometric identification, or biometrics, is the practice of using physical informa-
tion to link individuals to databases or to other stored identity information. “Bio-
metric” literally means “bodily measurement” and is increasingly being touted as a
solution to security problems in the post-9/11 world. Proponents claim that biomet-
rics has the potential to simultaneously enhance security and privacy. At the same
time, biometrics raises Orwellian concerns about facilitating the growth of a “sur-
veillance society.”
Early prison records often recorded an individual’s height and other physical
characteristics, and photographs could also be considered a form of biometric
information. Perhaps the first full-fledged biometric (called “anthropometric” at
the time) identification system was the criminal identification system devised by
Paris police official Alphonse Bertillon around 1883. Bertillon applied the tools of
anthropometry to the problem of criminal record keeping. His system used 11 precise
bodily measurements (such as head length and width, foot length, and even ear

54
Biometric identifiers
\
length), detailed physiognomic description, and meticulous notation of “peculiar
marks” such as tattoos, birthmarks, and scars. All of this information was entered
on index cards, which were filed according to a classification system based on the
anthropometric measurements. “Bertillonage,” as it was called, thus contained
many of the key features we now think of as constituting a biometric identification
system. It was a database of records that were retrievable according to biometric
information alone (as opposed to requiring a correct name to be submitted).
A number of different physical attributes have been proposed or used for bio-
metric identification. The most common biometric identifiers are the face, finger-
prints, iris, anthropometrics, hand geometry, voice, and signature. Less common
biometrics include the retina, veins in the palm, skull x-ray, tattoos (voluntary or
required), gait, body odor, ear shape, skin reflectance, body heat patterns, lip
motion, and keystroke dynamics.
James Wayman has proposed that biometric applications be categorized accord-
ing to how they fall along several dimensions. The user may be cooperative (an
employee) or noncooperative (a criminal). The biometric system may be overt
(known to the subject) or covert. Users may be more or less well habituated to
using the system. The system may be attended (by an operator) or unattended. The
use environment may be standard or extreme. The system may be controlled by a
public or private entity. And the system architecture may be open (compatible with
other systems) or closed.
Biometric applications may usefully be sorted into two categories. In verifica-
tion, a user’s claim to be a particular individual is verified. In identification, an
individual not claiming particular identity—or whose claim is questionable—has
his or her identity determined by comparison of biometric information with that
stored in a database.
Potential or existing applications of biometrics include criminal record keeping,
immigration control, document security (for driver’s licenses, passports, etc.), voter
authentication, protection of access to entitlements or other government payments,
creation of databases of political asylum seekers and refugees, medical record
keeping, banking (including its use on ATM cards), shopping (including its use on
smart cards), workplace monitoring, controlling access to secure areas, guarding
access to personal property such as an automobile or a laptop computer, and sur-
veillance of airports or other public spaces to identify wanted individuals or poten-
tial terrorists. For many of these applications, biometrics is a potential replacement
for less secure methods of authenticating identity, such as identification cards or
numbers and “secret knowledge,” such as passwords or personally identifiable
information such as one’s mother’s maiden name. There is, in addition, a growing
field of “e-world” biometric applications, including such areas as e-commerce.
Biometric identification raises a number of privacy issues. Civil libertarians tend
to view biometrics with suspicion. It is seen as having the potential to facilitate the
rise of a surveillance society, and possibly even totalitarianism. Covert biometrics,
such as face recognition, invokes privacy debates about whether citizens have any
reasonable expectation of privacy for readily visible biometric information. These
same arguments apply to “shed” biometric information, such as fingerprints or
DNA. Other criticisms address biometrics’ inherent reduction of the person to
stored information as somehow dehumanizing, raising objecting on human rights

or even, with reference to the Book of Revelation, religious grounds. (Another
religion-based privacy issue is whether women who wear burkhas must unveil their
faces for driver’s license photographs.) Additional concerns include whether the
biometric profile contains information that might be abused by the government,
such as heredity, race, ethnicity, gender, or behavioral characteristics.
Other experts have argued that biometrics has the potential to enhance both pri-
vacy and security. They argue that replacing insecure identification technologies
such as identification cards, passwords, and “secret knowledge” with more secure
biometric identifiers, which are more difficult to forge or steal, puts individuals’
information more securely in their control. Although biometric markers are cer-
tainly difficult to forge or steal, there have been reports concerning such potential
abuses as creating a rubber mold of another person’s fingerprint pattern. Both real
and fictional scenarios exist concerning the “stealing” of biometric information by
forcibly removing the relevant body part(s). A potential counter-measure to this is
requiring the sensor to detect a certain amount of heat.
Given its enormous potential, biometrics is certain to be an important focus of
privacy issues for years to come.

Birth certificate
Birth certificates in the United States, which are issued by the states, have two
different sections, and each section involves different privacy concerns. The first
section, the legal record of the birth, is always available to the adult whose birth it
registers; access by other persons varies widely from state to state, ranging from
a short list of specified relatives to the public at large. The second section of the
certificate—which records health and medical information about the parents, the
birth, and the infant—is used only for data collection and analysis, under regula-
tions that protect the privacy of the registrants and their parents.
It was only in the first half of the twentieth century that birth registration in the
United States became both standardized and nearly universal. In colonial times a
number of the colonies passed laws requiring government officials to record births
and other vital events, but even with the passage of additional regulations over
time, these laws and the systems they established were not highly effective. Until

56
Birth certificate
\
the early 1800s birth certificates were used only for legal and historical purposes,
not for the additional public purpose of collecting and analyzing health and demo-
graphic data. Birth registration evidently was not a priority in a nation experiencing
a high volume of both immigration and internal migration. In the mid-1800s, how-
ever, a growing emphasis on the importance of vital statistics for public health pur-
poses led the American Medical Association (AMA) to urge the states to collect
vital statistics. By 1859 eight states had established birth registration systems, and
after the Civil War more states followed, although under-registration of births con-
tinued to be widespread. 
Because birth registration was so inadequate, efforts before 1900 to collect data
on births focused on the decennial census. After 1900 efforts to obtain birth statis-
tics shifted from the census, which proved unsatisfactory for the purpose, to the
ultimately more promising source of birth registration by state and local govern-
ments. To develop standards for registration legislation and practices, the Bureau of
the Census, which was established as a permanent office in 1902, worked with the
American Public Health Association (APHA). In addition to issuing such stan-
dards, the bureau in 1903 published a recommended standard birth certificate,
which has been followed by 12 revised versions, the latest in 2003. The bureau in
1907, working with the AMA, the APHA, and other organizations, also developed
and recommended to the states a model vital statistics law. Four versions of the
model law have been issued since then, the latest in 1992. 
At first, the Bureau of the Census made great progress in the registration of
deaths, but in 1915 it established a national “birth-registration area,” a group of 10
states and the District of Columbia in which birth registration was the most com-
plete and therefore the most reliable source of statistics. Significant efforts to
improve birth registration at this time resulted in part from an increasing desire to
collect statistics that could be used to help reduce infant mortality. In addition, birth
certificates were becoming more important to individuals for uses such as estab-
lishing age for entering school and obtaining work permits. Ten additional states
were found to have sufficiently complete birth registration systems as of 1917 and
were admitted to the birth-registration area. By 1933 every state was included. Dur-
ing the 1940s birth certificates became increasingly important to individuals for
establishing citizenship for jobs in defense, applying for food ration books, and
qualifying for military family allowances. From 1935 to 1948, the estimated preva-
lence of birth registration rose from 90.7 to 95.5 percent. 
Today the responsibility for collecting and publishing birth-related and other
vital statistics is vested in the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a part
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is part of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The states generally match the
federal government’s recommended standard certificate. The demographic infor-
mation on the birth certificates is provided by mothers at the time of birth, while
the medical and health information is drawn from medical records. Typically, the
certificates are filed with a local registrar, who in turn files the records with the
state vital statistics office. The state office, which maintains files of and issues cop-
ies of the certificates, transmits the data to the NCHS for analysis and publication. 
The top portion of the 2003 U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, which is the for-
mal title of the legal record of birth, includes the child’s name, sex, and time and place

Birth certificate
\
57
of birth. It also includes the mother’s current legal name, her name prior to her first
marriage, the date and place of her birth, and her residence. In addition, it includes the
father’s current legal name and the date and place of his birth. (A section for adminis-
trative use includes such information as the mother’s mailing address, whether the
mother was married at the time of the “birth, conception, or any time between,” the
mother’s and father’s Social Security numbers, and whether a Social Security num-
ber was requested for the child.) A medical professional’s or hospital administrator’s
signature is required. Copies of this portion are used extensively for employment pur-
poses; for obtaining other documents, such as driver’s licenses, passports, and Social
Security cards; for enrolling children in school; for determining eligibility for public
benefits; and for confirming age eligibility for sports and other activities. 
The federal government recommends that states provide limited confidentiality
with regard to the record of birth by restricting access for 100 years after the birth to
close relatives and others who have a legitimate need for the information. Restricting
access also decreases the possibility of identity theft by fraudulent use of the certifi-
cates. A certified copy of the legal record portion, according to the provisions of the
most recent Model State Vital Statistics Act and Regulations, is to be considered the
same as the original and is to be provided upon application to the person whose birth
it registers; or the person’s spouse, child, parent, or guardian; or any of these persons’
authorized representatives. Relatives doing genealogical research may obtain copies
if the registrant is deceased. Other persons may be authorized to obtain copies if they
demonstrate that the copies are needed to determine or protect their personal or prop-
erty rights, and a state may designate regulations that further define who may obtain a
copy. Governmental agencies may be provided copies solely for use in conducting
official duties, and a court of competent jurisdiction may authorize inspection of the
record. When individuals apply for a copy, the state registrar or local custodian may
require identification or a sworn statement. The record becomes public 100 years
after the date of the birth. Stricter controls than these, and more uniformity among the
states, will likely be sought in the future as a result of increasing concern about iden-
tity fraud and international terrorism.
In many states, law and practice now differ to a greater or lesser degree from the
federal recommendations. In a number of states, members of the public can view or
purchase an uncertified, informational copy of a birth certificate if they know the
name and the birth date of the person whose birth it records. Such public access
was available in 14 states according to an HHS Inspector General’s report pub-
lished in 2000. With regard to the security of birth certificates in states with
restricted access, this report noted that proof of identification was required for
“walk-in requests” for copies in only 30 states in the state’s main office and in only
19 states in local offices; proof of identification was required for requests by mail
in only 11 states and by local offices in only 7 states. 
Among the states with restricted access, there is considerable variety in the par-
ticulars of their restrictions. Relatives who may obtain copies range from the regis-
trant’s parents only to a list that includes, in addition to the parents, the children,
siblings, half-siblings, stepparents, stepchildren, grandparents, great-grandparents,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Some states permit greater access if the
registrant is deceased and the person applying for the certificate submits proof of
the death. Some states permit greater access when the applicant is conducting

58
Birth control
\
genealogical research. Although a number of states have adopted the rule that birth
certificates become public after 100 years, many states do not allow certificates
ever to become public, whereas others have adopted shorter or longer periods—
such as 50, 75, or 125 years—before the certificates become public records. A few
states impose special restrictions for access when birth certificates indicate that the
child was born to unmarried parents. 
The portion of the certificate containing health and medical information was
made a separate section in the 1949 revision of the standard certificate, which also
placed the information about the child’s legitimacy in this more confidential sec-
tion. Labeled “Information for Medical and Health Purposes Only,” the current ver-
sion of this section includes 29 questions, many with a checklist of possible
answers. For the mother and father, the information includes education, race, and
type of Hispanic origin. Other questions concern the facility where the birth
occurred; the attendant at the birth; and many details about the mother’s pregnancy
and prenatal care, the delivery, and the condition of the newborn. 
The current model federal law and regulations require that when information
that identifies individuals is disclosed to researchers, all disclosures must be made
pursuant to agreements that protect the confidentiality of the information. There are
no restrictions, however, on the release of information that does not identify indi-
viduals. As is the case with the legal record portion of the certificate, government
officials may be furnished with the information for use in conducting their official
duties, but this information is not subject to subpoena or court order and is not
admissible in court. Although the specific laws and procedures that the states have
adopted vary considerably, the laws of all the states are designed to protect the con-
fidentiality of this health and medical information.

Birth control
Birth control, a term coined by Margaret Sanger in the early 1900s, refers to the
use of contraception to prevent pregnancy. Decisions about whether or not to use
birth control, and what kind, seem to be individual issues and yet have a very pub-
lic dimension. American’s beloved “right to privacy” has its judicial roots in issues

Birth control
\
59
of reproductive rights and birth control. In 1881 the Michigan Supreme Court ruled
that a woman “had a legal right to the privacy of her apartment” when she was in
labor, after she sued her physician for allowing a jeweler to attend the birth. Fur-
thermore, the “right to be let alone” became judicially constituted in 1965 in the
historic case of Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965). Prior to that, the
dissemination of birth control was illegal. 
Birth control, in various forms, has existed for centuries. However, technologi-
cal advances in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries pushed the issue into
the public sphere. Prior to the nineteenth century, white American women averaged
seven births over a lifetime. By 1900 this rate had dropped to three and a half births
as a result of increasing medical information regarding conception and contracep-
tion. Information about birth control was considered inappropriate, and temperance
and anti-vice groups advocated the prohibition of such materials and any associ-
ated information. In 1873 their attempts met with some success when Congress
passed the Comstock Law. This law declared all information and devices associ-
ated with birth control to be obscene and classified the dissemination of birth con-
trol information or products via the federal mail as criminal. Anthony Comstock,
head of the New York Anti-Vice League, became a special federal agent responsi-
ble for preventing the distribution of such “obscene” materials. Additionally, Com-
stock’s efforts resulted in the passage of anti-contraception laws in 22 states, with
the most repressive ones in Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
In 1914 Margaret Sanger began publication of The Woman Rebel, a monthly
feminist magazine devoted to the dissemination of information about birth control
methods, many from France. Later, in 1916, Sanger opened the nation’s first birth
control clinic in New York City. She recognized the need for immigrant and work-
ing women to control their fertility. Sanger was prosecuted for violating New
York’s version of the Comstock Law and served 30 days in a federal workhouse.
She was also prosecuted for sending contraception to a doctor via the mail. A fed-
eral district court ruled that the provision of contraception that promotes the health
or saves the life of a doctor’s patient is not covered by the Comstock Law. Sanger’s
advocacy for women’s reproductive rights ultimately led to the founding of the
American Birth Control League (ABCL) in 1921, which became the Planned Par-
enthood Federation of America in 1943 and which continues to advocate for repro-
ductive rights today. Sanger’s efforts with Planned Parenthood supported research
that led to the creation of the birth control pill in the 1950s. 
Debates over birth control dissemination continued into the 1960s. In 1961
Estelle Griswold and Dr. Lee Buxton, a physician and professor at Yale Medical
School, were arrested for providing medical advice and instruction related to con-
traception to married couples in Connecticut. Their conviction was overturned in
Griswold v. Connecticut, in which the Supreme Court ruled that Connecticut laws
prohibiting the instruction or use of contraception by married couples violated a
constitutional right to privacy. 
In the early 1960s, 28 states still had laws that made it illegal for married cou-
ples to use contraception. However, in 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson approved
an annual budget of $20 million for contraceptive programs, suggesting a growing
public acceptance of “family planning.” The revolutionary development of the pill
is often associated with a shift in popular sentiment regarding birth control. These

60
Birth control
\
developments paved the way for a more expansive application of the right to pri-
vacy with regard to birth control. In 1972 the Supreme Court ruled in Eisenstadt v.
Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) that the same privacy protections described in Gris-
wold must be extended to nonmarried women, thus allowing them access to birth
control as well. 
Tubal sterilization, a permanent form of birth control, became more widespread
in the 1960s. Previously, many women desiring sterilization had to meet strict
requirements; yet as of 1914 more than 10 states had laws limiting the reproductive
options for women deemed socially inadequate, and by 1924 more than 3000
American women had been forcibly sterilized. Many Native American women and
other women of color, particularly those on welfare, were encouraged or coerced to
undergo this procedure throughout the twentieth century. Today, tubal sterilization
is the most popular form of contraception in the United States.
The early 1970s brought additional gains in reproductive freedom as three states
repealed their anti-abortion laws and Congress deleted parts of the Comstock Law
relating to contraception and abortion. During this time, groups such as the Amer-
ican Medical Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National
Organization of Women publicly support the legalization of abortion. In 1973, a 7-
2 ruling legalized abortion in the landmark case Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).
The majority found that a woman’s right to privacy included the right to unregu-
lated abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. At the same time, Congress
passed a bill prohibiting the use of Medicaid funds for abortions, unless the
mother’s life was in danger. 
Cost remains a barrier to access to reproductive control. For example, although
some American insurance companies are covering the prescription costs for the
impotency drug Viagra, only 21 states have contraceptive equity laws that require
all FDA-approved birth control to be covered by health plans. From 1980 to 2003,
federal funding for clinics providing birth control to low-income women fell nearly
two-thirds in constant dollars. 
The last decades of the twentieth century saw an increase in reproductive tech-
nology to assist fertility as well as continued debate over the roles of birth control
and abortion in American society. Birth control pills have become the most com-
mon drug used by women of childbearing age; and the emergency contraceptive
pill (“Plan B” or “the morning-after pill”), which prevents a fertilized egg from
developing if taken within 72 hours after intercourse, was approved for use in the
United States in 1998. The widespread use of such contraceptive is estimated to
prevent nearly 1.7 million unintended pregnancies and 800,000 abortions annually.
However, 40 years after Griswold, American women’s access to birth control is
again being threatened. Some pharmacists around the nation are refusing to dis-
pense monthly birth control pills or emergency contraception. Four states have
laws that allow pharmacists to refuse to fill such prescriptions on moral or religious
grounds.
Even in contemporary American society, with some forms of birth control avail-
able at the local drug store or gas station, reports indicate that nearly half of all
pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Access to birth control remains
complex and the legality of birth control continues to be contested. Some current
Republican politicians, including the third-highest-ranking member of the Senate,

Blood testing
\
61
Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, argue that Americans have no guaranteed right to
privacy, and therefore individual states should have the ability to outlaw birth con-
trol as they deem fit. The politics of technology, as well as the moral and political
climate, influence attempts to limit or challenge reproductive control. Since the late
1880s proponents of birth control have understood it as a central issue behind
women’s equality in society. In their view, safe and reliable contraception is a pre-
requisite for women to control their bodies and their lives. Thus, it is important to
understand that attempts to control women’s reproduction are related to the prevail-
ing social and political climate. 
Some women are afforded greater privacy in matters of reproductive control,
while others are subjected to limited opportunities. Without access to readily avail-
able and legal birth control, American women could expect an average of 12 preg-
nancies in their lifetimes. Moreover, access to reliable contraception allows women
the opportunity to make other informed choices, such as those relating to employ-
ment and education. If reproductive freedom is understood as leading to better
parenting and citizenship, then access to contraception is an issue of personal
autonomy as well as social responsibility.

Blood testing
Blood testing is commonly used to detect or “screen for” a wide variety of dis-
eases either present or potential. It is used both in health care settings and in the crim-
inal justice system. When blood tests are used for DNA typing as the basis for
constructing databases used in criminal investigations, or for detecting behaviors
such as substance use, they obviously raise privacy issues similar to those raised by
urine analysis to test for drugs of abuse. Unlike urine tests, blood tests can reveal a
person’s current degree of intoxication. The approximate time of drug ingestion can
by ascertained by computing the ratio of drug metabolites in the blood to the pres-
ence of the drug itself. For these reasons many states permit law enforcement to draw
blood in cases of suspected driving under the influence (DUI) if the individual under
suspicion refuses to submit to urine testing or a breathalyzer test. In Schmerber v.
California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966), a case involving a police officer who ordered a
treating physician to conduct a test for blood alcohol level, the U.S. Supreme Court
held that the blood testing did not violate the Fifth Amendment guarantee against
self-incrimination even if results were later used as evidence in a drunk driving con-
viction. Subsequently the courts have considered blood tests to be legal searches,
although any state-compelled blood testing program raises privacy issues due to the
Fourth Amendment’s clear guarantee against government intrusion. 
Public health and safety objectives have occasioned large-scale government
intrusions into private life. The “greater good” argument is often invoked to justify

62
Blood testing
\
the claim that social responsibility outweighs individual privacy rights in the con-
text of infectious diseases and viral transmission. Syphilis was once a widely
feared disease for which there was a relatively accurate and simple blood test.
Although gonorrhea was four times as prevalent in the population, there was no
straightforward blood test by which it could be diagnosed. The first mass blood
testing campaign in the United States occurred within the context of the New Deal,
with the launch of a federal public health campaign to contain venereal disease that
focused on syphilis. The U.S. Public Health Service began to devote a significant
portion of the budget allocated to it by the Social Security Act of 1935 to detecting
and treating venereal disease. The U.S. Congress enacted the National Venereal
Disease Control Act in 1938, which led to a national infrastructure consisting of
3000 treatment clinics as of 1940. (These clinics were later converted to family
planning clinics once the concern about VD had subsided.) 
The blood testing campaign against syphilis was conducted in an era when pri-
vacy and confidentiality were not legally protected. The number of Wasserman
blood tests administered for detecting syphilis climbed nearly 300 percent from
1936 to 1940. The city of Chicago tested over 30 percent of its population begin-
ning in 1937, capturing 10,000 to 12,000 individuals a day in its “Wasserman drag-
net.” Although these programs likely produced a high number of false positives, the
results were used in many cases to deny or delay marriage. Over half of the states
had enacted laws prohibiting marriage between infected individuals by 1938.
States also began requiring prenatal blood testing for all pregnant women in
1938 to prevent congenital infection of infants. These laws resulted in reduced
infant mortality rates even prior to the use of antibiotics. They also occasioned a
large-scale expansion of government surveillance into formerly private matters.
Public health organizations invented techniques to extract information about all
sexual contacts from those who tested positive for syphilis. Case workers invented
a term, “shoe leather epidemiology,” to describe how they tracked down those indi-
viduals to inform them and bring them in for testing and treatment. 
Premarital syphilis testing was instituted by the states, beginning with Con-
necticut in 1935, but prevalence rates were lower than anticipated. Couples
crossed state lines to marry, or they went to physicians reputed to keep the test
results confidential. Despite the ineffectiveness of these laws, as evidenced by
the low percentage of positive results, many states did not repeal them until the
1970s. A second wave of repeal followed in states where such laws were still on
the books: California did not repeal its premarital blood testing law until 1994,
and Georgia only did so as recently as 2003. Reasons for repeal included lack of
cost-effectiveness and the fact that few cases of syphilis came to light through
premarital testing, due to its higher prevalence among groups not seeking to
marry or who were legally barred from marriage. The initial assumption behind
premarital blood testing was that it would reach the affected population and bring
those who tested positive in for treatment. However, this proved not to be the
case, and it constitutes a historical lesson that can be extended to human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing. The concern is that mandatory testing
will in fact deter individuals from seeking treatment.
Blood banks began testing for HIV in 1985 using an initial screen for the pres-
ence of HIV antibodies called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A

Blood testing
\
63
positive screen must be followed by a Western blot, which is a confirmatory test.
Blood banks did not, however, notify individuals of their serostatus, as their main
goal was to ensure that the blood supply was not infected. The main focus of the
debate over state-compelled HIV testing has been mandatory testing. Given the
stigma attached to HIV, which was initially seen as a phenomenon associated with
the gay population in the United States, there has been much more scrutiny of
state-mandated HIV testing than there was for syphilis testing. The drive to require
premarital HIV testing was unsuccessful in the United States: only two states, Illi-
nois and Louisiana, enacted mandatory premarital HIV testing laws, and each has
since repealed them. Given the higher rates of heterosexual HIV transmission in
the Third World, some governments in south and southeast Asia began to require
mandatory premarital HIV testing in the opening years of the twenty-first century. 
Mandatory HIV testing has been upheld by the U.S. courts for certain groups.
The U.S. Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act (1990), encour-
aging states to provide mandatory HIV testing of sex offenders and to make their
serostatus known to their victims. Newborns are a second group in which manda-
tory testing has been permitted. New York and Connecticut both require expedited
HIV testing of newborns and notification of their mothers when the serostatus of
the mother is unknown. Prenatal HIV testing remains voluntary. Both circum-
stances in which mandatory HIV testing is applied also involve privacy issues that
the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet considered, although it has ruled that the “spe-
cial needs” exception to the Fourth Amendment applies to compulsory urine test-
ing of certain populations of workers. Urine tests were considered “reasonable”
infringements on the privacy of groups associated with “diminished expectation of
privacy” in National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 669 (1989).
Similar exceptions may extend to mandatory government blood testing and DNA
testing. The privacy question involved in the mandatory collection of blood sam-
ples for DNA testing is the extent to which prisoners forfeit their Fourth Amend-
ment rights. Some courts have interpreted this forfeiture expansively, others more
restrictively. 
Another privacy question concerns disclosures of information that includes the
results of blood testing. The U.S. Congress passed the Genetic Information Non-
discrimination Act of 2003 (S. 1053) in an attempt to prevent genetic discrimina-
tion in hiring, firing, and training, as well as insurance discrimination on the basis
of results of genetic testing. The concern with maintaining the confidentiality of
medical records extends to genetic test results. There are many more mechanisms
for protecting individual privacy and guaranteeing the confidentiality of blood test
results today. Built-in exceptions to the privacy rules of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) allow disclosure of certain
kinds of information to public health authorities, such as history of disease or
injury, child abuse, birth, death, and the conduct of public health surveillance,
investigation, or intervention programs.

When does the mere description of one’s action not impinge the basic interest of
any other person? This traditional Millian notion of a self-regarding or private
action has had the most difficult time in the American courts. Although the U.S.
Supreme Court did say in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), that a woman’s right
to obtain an abortion was such an action, at least within the first two trimesters
(with the woman’s physician playing a significant decision-making role only in the
second trimester), in Bowers v. Hardwick the Court let stand a Georgia sodomy
statute that made certain adult consensual homosexual sex acts a crime, even if per-
formed behind closed doors in the home. The effect of the case was to hold outside
constitutional privacy protection matters of same-sex sexual intimacy among con-
senting adults for the reason that they simply were not thought to be private. 
The case involved the unchallenged legal entry of a Georgia police officer into
the home of Michel Hardwick on the evening of August 3, 1982. There the officer
found Hardwick and another adult male engaged in an act of oral sodomy in Hard-
wick’s bedroom. Hardwick was subsequently charged with violating O.G.C.A.
ß16-6-2 (1984), a Georgia criminal statute that made it a crime to engage in sod-
omy with another person (male or female), even in one’s home, punishable by not
less than 1 and up to 20 years in prison. The Georgia statute stated that “[a] person
commits the offense of sodomy when he or she performs or submits to any sexual
act involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another.” The
statute did not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual sodomy. The case
went to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the statute was challenged on Fourteenth
Amendment substantive due process grounds, which in this case were privacy
grounds.
The Supreme Court, in upholding the statute, distinguished that portion of the
statute pertaining to homosexual sodomy from the remainder of the act, which
addressed heterosexual sodomy. Specifically, the Court, referring to the portion of
the statute making homosexual sodomy a crime, ruled, per Justice White, that its
prior case law did not put adult consensual homosexual sodomy in the home
beyond state proscription. The basis of the Court’s rationale was that “[n]o connec-
tion between family, marriage, or procreation on the one hand and homosexual
activity on the other [was] demonstrated.” Nor did the Court’s prior privacy cases
protect any form of private sexual conduct between consenting adults. In effect, the
Court said that the privacy of an act is determined by whether such a connection is
shown. Absent such a demonstration, no privacy is at stake. 
It is important to understand that the Court did not find that the state had a more
compelling interest than upholding privacy to protect in this case; rather, the Court
saw no privacy interest at all. And although sodomy statutes are seldom prose-
cuted, the effect of the Bowers holding was an unintended justification of state laws
that discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation in matters of employment,
housing, public accommodations, parenting, marriage, foster care, and military

Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986)
\

service. Here the rationale came to be that if the underlying conduct that defined
the discriminated class could be made criminal, little could be said that would per-
suade courts that the class might deserve a heightened degree of protection from
discrimination.
When the Supreme Court decided Bowers, no American privacy case was
directly on point in dealing with homosexual sodomy. However, the American Law
Institute, a think tank of legal scholars, had by this time put forth a Model Penal
Code, which a number of states had already adopted, that removed same-sex sod-
omy from the list of crimes. The Court’s failure to assign credence to the code’s
adoption combined with the breadth afforded to privacy protection in several of its
own prior decisions makes the Court’s proffered rationale in Bowers untenable.
Indeed, it suggests a deep-seated cultural prejudice against homosexuals on the part
of some of the justices who participated in the decision. This was particularly clear
from Justice Burger’s concurring opinion: “Decisions of individuals relating to
homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history
of Western civilization. Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in the
Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards.”
Interestingly, the set of privacy principles that could have decided this case—
and no doubt would have, had the prejudices implicit in the above-quoted passages
not existed—have their foundation in three different areas of the law: Fourth
Amendment, tort, and constitutional liberty.
In the Fourth Amendment, the privacy principle protects persons, information,
and places against unreasonable searches and seizures. What makes a search unrea-
sonable is the presence of a reasonable expectation of privacy coupled with the
absence of a search warrant based on probable cause that a crime was about to
take place. This right to privacy of information and protection of places like the
home was specifically aimed at preventing the government’s pursuit of a criminal
investigation from becoming a mere fishing expedition for possible criminal activ-
ity. A perhaps antiquated example of this rule would be the person in a glass-walled
telephone booth who has a reasonable expectation of not being overheard, but no
such expectation of not being seen.
In contrast to the Fourth Amendment privacy principle was the development of
the privacy tort in civil law. Here the issue, as described in a famous law review
article from the turn of the last century, was protecting against unreasonable inva-
sions into personal affairs by the press and other persons. Professor William
Prosser describes this tort as involving four separate concerns: (1) intrusion upon
the plaintiff’s seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs; (2) public disclosure
of embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff; (3) publicity that places the plain-
tiff in a false light in the public eye; and (4) appropriation, for the defendant’s
advantage, of the plaintiff’s name or likeness.
Like the Fourth Amendment, the civil law privacy tort was to serve as a means of
protecting information and places. However, this tort is directed against other persons
rather than against the government. In this way, privacy law became, in addition to a
protection against certain governmental intrusions, a safeguard of individual person-
hood and autonomy from the prying eyes of others. These were not the only sources
of privacy protection that had been recognized prior to the Court’s decision in Bow-
ers, however. Beginning in the 1960s, with Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479

66
Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986)
\
(1965), the Supreme Court began to set out constitutional privacy law jurisprudence
based on a liberty right to engage in private actions.
In Griswold, the Court upheld the constitutional privacy rights of a married cou-
ple to use contraceptives and of physicians to advise their use against a state law
that prohibited both. In Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), the Court
extended that right to include unmarried persons. In Carey v. Population Services
International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977), the Court extended the right still further, strik-
ing down a law that made it a crime to distribute contraceptives to minors. In Roe v.
Wade, the Court extended constitutional privacy protections to a mother’s choice to
have an abortion, noting that the fetus was not a person under the law.
The Supreme Court’s jurisprudence in this area was not confined to physical
activity that was arguably self-regarding. The Court had also upheld, in Stanley v.
Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969), the right of a person to possess “obscene matter” in
the home. In that case too the Court stated, “This right to receive information and
ideas, regardless of their social worth, is fundamental to our free society. Moreover,
in the context of this case—a prosecution for mere possession of printed or filmed
matter in the privacy of a person’s own home—that right takes on an added dimen-
sion. For also fundamental is the right to be free, except in very limited circum-
stances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one’s privacy.”
All the precedent that might suggest the contrary—the fact that the Court had
previously recognized a constitutional privacy right of married persons, unmarried
persons, and minors to obtain contraceptives and receive physician advice on their
use; a women’s right to obtain an abortion with no recognized interest in an unborn
fetus in the first two trimesters of a pregnancy; and the right to possess obscene
materials in the home—indicates its decision in Bowers to be mistaken. The Court
refused to find constitutional privacy protection for two consenting adults to
engage in same-sex sodomy in the home. It is true that prior to Bowers, two
cases—one New York Court of Appeals case, People v. Onofre, 415 N.E.2d 936
(N.Y. 1980), and a Virginia federal district court case, Doe v. Commonwealth’s
Attorney, 403 F. Supp. 1199 (E.D. Va. 1975), aff’d mem., 425 U.S. 901 (1976)—
had gone in opposite directions on whether a fundamental right to privacy covers
and protects such activities. But it is also true that five years before Bowers was
decided, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) had found, in a case similar
to Bowers arising in Ireland, that the Irish statutory prosecution violated the privacy
guarantee of the European Convention on Human Rights. According to many legal
scholars, the Supreme Court’s failure in Bowers to acknowledge the ECHR case
reflects the parochial attitude of some of the justices that the Court still has diffi-
culty managing. 
Bowers was thus not a “very hard” case at the time the Supreme Court decided it
because the Court had a sufficient indication of society’s political morality both
from its own past privacy decisions and based on what was happening elsewhere in
the Western world to render a decision against such statutes based on their self-
regarding nature, although it chose not to do so. Nor should the decision be dis-
missed on the ground that the courts have long recognized government’s right to
prohibit certain seemingly self-regarding behaviors such as the private use of recre-
ational drugs in the home. In this case, one might argue that a compelling state
interest exists to prevent the harmful effects of such drugs on society, which cannot

Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886)
\
67
be reasonably addressed absent a blanket proscription on their possession. A simi-
lar argument might be made for prohibiting prostitution on the basis of protecting
poor women from exploitation. No such similar interest existed in Bowers, how-
ever. For the only interest that stands out there is the protection of traditional
morality. But that interest would open the door to much subjectivity when no other
harm can be shown. Consequently, it is fair to say that at the time when the Court
heard the case of Bowers v. Hardwick, its own constitutional jurisprudence had
already been sufficiently developed to afford protection to Michael Hardwick. 
The same precursory precedent that was available to the Court in Bowers was
also available to guide the Court’s more recent decision in Lawrence v. Texas, 539
U.S. 558 (2003), which overruled Bowers. The only difference, other than that
society itself had become more tolerant of gay and lesbian people, was that now the
Court would render a proper decision that was consistent with its own constitu-
tional precedent.

Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886)
Boyd v. United States is a landmark case in the development of privacy protec-
tions, establishing a relationship between the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the
United States Constitution. In Boyd the Supreme Court ruled that the seizure or com-
pulsory production of a person’s personal papers to be used as evidence against that
person is the same as compelling self-incrimination. Ultimately, this broad interpreta-
tion of the amendments was severely limited by subsequent Supreme Court cases.
E. A. Boyd & Sons, an importing company, was accused of importing 35 cases
of plate glass into New York City without paying a duty required under an 1874
customs act. The two partners in Boyd attempted to import the 35 cases to furnish

68
Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886)
\
glass needed in the construction of a government building. The glass specified was
foreign glass. The partners understood that if part or all of the glass was furnished
from the partnership’s existing duty-paid inventory, it could be replaced by duty-
free imports. Pursuant to this arrangement, 29 cases of glass were imported duty
free. The partners then claimed they were entitled to the duty-free entry of an addi-
tional 35 cases, which were soon to arrive. The forfeiture action concerned these 35
cases.
The case as filed was civil in nature, but the Supreme Court ruled that the 1874
customs act, which allowed the imposition of both fines and prison sentences, was
essentially criminal in nature. Boyd was accused of committing fraud under that
act. To prove his case, the prosecuting attorney needed Boyd’s records of a previ-
ous shipment involving 29 cases of plate glass. The district attorney obtained an
order from the district judge requiring Boyd to produce the invoice for the 29 cases.
Boyd produced the invoice and was found guilty, and the government seized the 35
cases of plate glass. Although he complied with the order, Boyd complained and
appealed, arguing his constitutional rights were denied. The Supreme Court ruled
in the partners’ favor.
In reaching its decision, the Court spent significant time analyzing the origins of
the 1874 act at issue. That act was an amendment of an 1867 act that itself was an
amendment of an 1863 act. The original amendments of the act allowed “[t]he dis-
trict judge, on complaint and affidavit that any fraud on the revenue had been com-
mitted by any person interested or engaged in the importation of merchandise, to
issue his warrant to the marshal to enter any premises where any invoices, books,
or papers were deposited relating to such merchandise, and to take possession of
such books and papers.” The Court noted that the act “was the first legislation of
the kind” ever enacted. It was “adopted at a period of great national excitement
[during the Civil War], when the powers of the government were subjected to a
severe strain to protect the national existence.” In 1874 the act was amended to
allow the Court to order the defendant in the action to produce the books or papers.
The first step in the Court’s consideration of Boyd’s argument was to find that the
requirement that Boyd produce documents in response to a court order was still a
“search and seizure” and fell “within the scope of the fourth amendment.” The more
difficult question for the Court was whether the search was “an ‘unreasonable search
and seizure’ within the meaning of the fourth amendment of the constitution.”
The Court distinguished searches for “stolen or forfeited goods” and “seizure of
a man’s private books and papers for the purpose of obtaining information therein
contained.” The simple answer: “In one case, the government is entitled to the pos-
session of the property; in the other it is not,” the Court ruled. Using a historical
approach, the Court examined the use of “writs of assistance” in England and the
colonies before the American Revolution. Basically, a writ of assistance allowed a
revenue officer collecting taxes for the crown to search any home or building for
smuggled goods. Colonists, who were smuggling a wide variety of goods to avoid
taxes imposed by the king, hated the practice. The Court noted that in 1761 Boston
patriot James Otis called the writs “the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the
most destructive of English liberty and the fundamental principles of law, that ever
was found in an English law book, since they placed ‘the liberty of every man in
the hands of every petty officer.’” The Supreme Court noted that Otis’s comments

Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886)
\
69
occurred during a debate that was “perhaps the most prominent event which inau-
gurated the resistance of the colonies to the oppressions of the mother country.” In
other words, opposition to the writs, and the searches they allowed, was a funda-
mental cause of the Revolutionary War.
To show the impropriety of the legislation under consideration in the case, the
Supreme Court then discussed two cases that essentially resulted in the end of gen-
eral warrants in Britain. General warrants, like writs of assistance, allowed officers
to seize persons or papers and, more specifically, were frequently issued to allow
searches of private homes for books or papers that could be used to convict the
home owner of libel. 
The first case was that of John Wilkes, publisher of the North Briton, a newspa-
per that frequently denounced the crown and was considered “heinously libelous.”
In April 1763 Wilkes published an article in his paper lambasting the king for a
message presented in Parliament. After that, Lord Halifax, the British secretary of
state, issued a general warrant and Wilkes’s home was searched. Wilkes was
arrested and temporarily imprisoned in the Tower of London. After charges were
dismissed, Wilkes sued for trespass. He won. The officer who searched Wilkes’s
home was ordered to pay £1000 and Halifax was ordered to pay £4000.
The second case was Entick v. Carrington and Three Other King’s Messengers,
decided in 1765. Lord Halifax had again issued a general warrant, and the resulting
search of John Entick’s home found no libelous materials. In concluding his deci-
sion, Lord Camden noted, “It is very certain that the law obligeth no man to accuse
himself; because the necessary means of compelling self-accusation, falling upon
the innocent as well as the guilty, would be both cruel and unjust; and it should
seem, that search for evidence is disallowed upon the same principle. There too the
innocent would be confounded with the guilty.”
The importance of these old English cases for the Supreme Court lay not in
the holdings alone but in the fact that “every American statesman, during our rev-
olutionary and formative period as a nation, was undoubtedly familiar” with the
principles expressed in those decisions. In other words, when the Founding Fathers
incorporated the right against self-incrimination into the Constitution, they were
incorporating the principles that had been decided in British courts almost two
decades before the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were drafted. The Court con-
cluded that the drafters of the Constitution would never have approved of the series
of statutes under consideration in Boyd: “The struggles against arbitrary power in
which they had been engaged for more than 20 years would have been too deeply
engraved in their memories to have allowed them to approve of such insidious dis-
guises of the old grievance which they had so deeply abhorred.”
For the Supreme Court, the critical questions addressed by British courts in the
cited cases were at the very foundation of the concepts of “constitutional liberty
and security.” Following its review of that history, the Court concluded that “any
forcible and compulsory extortion of a man’s own testimony, or of his private
papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime, or to forfeit his goods”
should be condemned.
The next step in the Court’s analysis was to consider the statutory history leading
up to the customs act of 1867. The Court found that the first congress, in creating the
Judiciary Act of 1789, granted courts the power to compel persons to turn over books

70
Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886)
\
or documents in their possession, provided such documents would have been ordered
to be produced under the “ordinary rules of chancery.” The Court then noted, “Now it
is elementary knowledge that one cardinal rule of the court of chancery is never to
decree a discovery which might tend to convict the party of a crime, or to forfeit his
property. And any compulsory discovery by extorting the party’s oath, or compelling
the production of his private books and papers, to convict him of crime, or to forfeit
his property, is contrary to the principles of a free government.”
Then the court examined the language of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to
the constitution:
We have already noticed the intimate relation between the two amendments.
They throw great light on each other. For the “unreasonable searches and seizures”
condemned in the fourth amendment are almost always made for the purpose of
compelling a man to give evidence against himself, which in criminal cases is con-
demned in the fifth amendment; and compelling a man “in a criminal case to be a
witness against himself,” which is condemned in the fifth amendment, throws light
on the question as to what is an “unreasonable search and seizure” within the
meaning of the fourth amendment.
The Court concluded there simply is no rational difference between the “seizure
of a man’s private books and papers to be used in evidence against him” and “com-
pelling him to be a witness against himself.” The Court then warned that in order to
protect against the erosion of “constitutional provisions for the security of person
and property,” the courts must liberally construe those freedoms rather than apply a
strict construction that “deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual
depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance.”
Several of the Boyd Court’s holdings have not stood the test of time. Perhaps the
most critical shortcoming is the failure of subsequent courts to follow the recom-
mendation that protections of liberties be liberally construed. 
Specifically, the application of the Fourth Amendment to subpoenas was lim-
ited by Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 (1906). Purely evidentiary (but “nontestimo-
nial”) materials, as well as contraband and fruits and instrumentalities of crime,
may now be searched for and seized under proper circumstances (Warden v. Hay-
den, 387 U.S. 294 (1967)). Also, the Supreme Court has eliminated the idea that
“testimonial” evidence may never be seized and used in court (see Katz v. United
States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), establishing a reasonable expectation of privacy
test for admission of tape-recorded conversations; and Osborn v. United States,
385 U.S. 323 (1966), on admissibility of tape-recorded conversation between
attorney and client).
It is also clear that the Fifth Amendment does not independently prohibit the
compelling of every sort of incriminating evidence but applies only when the
accused is compelled to make a testimonial communication that is incriminating.
The courts have therefore declined to extend the protection of the privilege to the
provision of blood samples (Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 763–764
(1966)), handwriting exemplars (Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 265–267
(1967)), or voice exemplars (United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 222–223 (1967))
or to the donning of a blouse worn by the perpetrator (Holt v. United States, 218
U.S. 245 (1910)). Furthermore, despite Boyd, neither a partnership nor the individual

Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886)
\
71
partners are shielded from the compelled provision of partnership records on self-
incrimination grounds (Bellis v. United States, 417 U.S. 85 (1974)). 
The conclusion in Boyd that a person may not be forced to produce private papers
has nonetheless often appeared as dictum in later Supreme Court decisions. To the
extent, however, that the rule against compelling the production of private papers
rested on the proposition that seizures of or subpoenas for “mere evidence,” includ-
ing documents, violated the Fourth Amendment and therefore also transgressed the
Fifth, the foundations for the rule have been washed away. In consequence, the prohi-
bition against forcing the production of private papers has long been a rule searching
for a rationale consistent with the proscriptions of the Fifth Amendment against com-
pelling a person to give “testimony” that is self-incriminating. 
The Supreme Court has noted that the act of producing evidence in response to a
subpoena has communicative aspects of its own, wholly unrelated to the contents
of the papers produced. Compliance tacitly concedes the papers’ existence and
their possession or control by some party. It could also indicate a party’s belief that
the papers are those sought (Curcio v. United States, 354 U.S. 118, 125 (1957)).
Elements of compulsion are present, but the more difficult question is whether the
“tacit averments” of the party are both “testimonial” and “incriminating” under the
Fifth Amendment.
It is unlikely that admitting the existence and possession of papers will rise to
the level of testimony afforded protection under the Fifth Amendment. When the
existence and location of the papers are a foregone conclusion, a party adds little or
nothing to the sum total of the government’s information by conceding that he in
fact has the papers. Under these circumstances, by enforcement of the summons
“no constitutional rights are touched. The question is not of testimony but of sur-
render” (In re Harris, 221 U.S. 274, 279 (1911)). 
The historical and statutory history relied on by the Supreme Court in Boyd have
great appeal to those concerned with finding privacy rights in the Constitution. But
with subsequent Supreme Court rulings on specific evidentiary questions and with
the denial of any convergence between the Forth and Fifth constitutional amend-
ments, the holding in Boyd has effectively been reversed.

Brandeis, Louis D. (1856–1941)
Louis Dembitz Brandeis was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on November 13,
1856. His family was from Prague. Brandeis excelled in his studies in high school
and then at school in Dresden. Brandeis attended Harvard Law School and gradu-
ated at the top of his class in 1877. He became a successful lawyer in Boston and a
leading advocate of social and political reform. President Woodrow Wilson named
Brandeis to the Supreme Court in 1916. Following a contentious battle, he became
the first Jewish member of the Supreme Court. He retired from the Court in 1939
and died in 1941. 
No person in the United States has had a greater influence on the development
of privacy law than Louis Brandeis. This is all the more remarkable in view of the
fact that Brandeis published only a single article on privacy (which was rejected by
the first court that considered his argument) and a single judicial opinion (which
appeared as a dissent and was largely ignored for almost 40 years). But today that
article, “The Right to Privacy,” and the dissent in Olmstead v. United States, 277
U.S. 438 (1928), are routinely cited by scholars, judges, policymakers, and privacy
advocates all around the world.
“The Right to Privacy” appeared in the Harvard Law Review in 1890. Brandeis
and his co-author and close friend, Samuel Warren, argued forcefully that the com-
mon law should evolve in response to new technology and new business practices
to recognize a new right: “the right to be let alone.” Significantly, the authors
focused on the injury caused by private persons and not by government since tort
law is generally concerned with private wrongdoing.
By many accounts, the article is one of the most influential in American law. It
is also a model for legal scholarship. Brandeis and Warren described an emerging
social challenge. They discussed how current law failed to provide adequate pro-
tection. They examined similar claims in other jurisdictions, including courts in
England and France, and they set out an argument for a new approach that eventu-
ally transformed law in the United States. The article is purposeful, ambitious,
timely in its publication, and timeless in its ongoing influence.
The Brandeis-Warren article also considered possible limitations on the claim of
a right to privacy. They said first that the right to privacy “does not prohibit any
publication of matter which is of public or general interest.” This important qualifi-
cation anticipated that the claim of privacy would, at times, come into conflict with
freedom of the press and the public’s right to know. Brandeis and Warren also sug-
gested that limitations included communications that would otherwise be privi-
leged (such as communications in legislative or judicial proceedings), oral
communications, or information that has been published by the individual or with
his or her consent. Brandeis and Warren said that truth would not provide a
defense—an important distinction from the law of defamation—nor would the
absence of malice.
A New York state court first considered the argument for the Brandeis-Warren
tort in the 1902 case of Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co., 171 N.Y. 538, 64

Brandeis, Louis D. (1856–1941)

N.E. 442. In that case, a company displayed the image of a young woman on an
advertising flyer without her consent. She claimed that her privacy was violated.
Although the court rejected her argument, it did say that a legislative body could
establish law preventing the use of a person’s picture or name for advertising pur-
poses without that person’s general consent. The following year, the New York
state legislature passed such a law. Two years later, a Georgia court considered a
case similar to the one in New York and held instead for the plaintiff. Georgia thus
became the first state to recognize a common law tort action for privacy invasion.
Claims under the common law tort of privacy continued in state courts through-
out much of the twentieth century. Legal scholars outside the United States
described the tort as the “American tort,” in part because the common law courts of
Britain had rejected similar claims.
In 1960 Dean Prosser examined over 300 privacy tort cases and concluded
that they fell into four categories: public disclosure of privacy facts, intrusion
upon seclusion, false light, and appropriation. Prosser’s taxonomy became a pop-
ular way to describe the privacy right first set out by Brandeis and Warren,
although some legal scholars suggested that the original formulation relied on a
unified concept of human dignity that could not easily be divided into separate
categories.
Throughout the latter part of the twentieth century, the common law tort of pri-
vacy increasingly confronted challenges from media organizations claiming that
the right to privacy infringed on the public’s right to know. Nonetheless, state
courts continued to adopt the legal theory. In 1998 the Minnesota Supreme Court
recognized the privacy tort in Lake v. Wal-Mart, 582 N.W.2d 231 (1998). The case
is significant also because it arose from the unapproved publication of photo-
graphs, which several legal scholars believe was the reason for the original article.
Another sign of the ongoing vitality of the Brandeis-Warren article is that it was
cited in Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001), a case involving the disclosure
of a private telephone conversation, by the Court majority, the justices in concur-
rence, and even those in dissent. Although the justices could not agree as to the
outcome of the case before them, they all seemed to agree that it was important to
cite Brandeis in their opinions.
The dissent of Justice Brandeis in Olmstead is the cornerstone of modern privacy
law. In that case, which concerned the investigation of a popular bootlegger during
prohibition, the Supreme Court was asked to determine whether the Fourth Amend-
ment search warrant requirement applied to the interception of a telephone commu-
nication. Much of the evidence in the case was obtained by wiretapping.
The Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Taft, held that because no physical
intrusion upon a protected space had occurred, there was no search and therefore
no warrant was required. Justice Taft noted that Congress could establish privacy
protection for telecommunications by legislation if it chose to do so. Justice
Holmes wrote in dissent that the wiretap by federal officials, which violated state
law, was a “dirty business.” But it was the dissent of Justice Brandeis that came to
shape modern-day privacy law.
Brandeis said first that the application of the Constitution required considering not
only what “has been, but of what may be.” Brandeis said that because the privacy of
mail communications was already protected and because tapping into a telephone

74
Brandeis, Louis D. (1856–1941)
\
communication is an intrusion far greater than tampering with the mails, the Consti-
tution should recognize the protection of this new form of communication.
Brandeis concluded, in one of the most widely cited phrases of modern privacy
law, that the right of privacy is “the most comprehensive of rights and the right
most valued by civilized men.” The gender-specific reference, although not surpris-
ing, was unfortunate. Feminist scholars would later criticize Brandeis for harboring
a paternalistic view.
It is often claimed that the Brandeis dissent in Olmstead was adopted by the
Supreme Court in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), another case involv-
ing a telephone interception and the question of whether a warrant was required. It
is true that the Court relied on the Olmstead dissent to reach its conclusion that a
search had occurred and that a warrant should have been required. However, the
“reasonable expectation of privacy” test, introduced by Justice Harlan in a con-
currence in that case, took the law down the path of trying to determine whether
there was an expectation of privacy based not only on one’s subjective expectation
but also on a socially objective expectation. Not surprisingly, as technology
advanced, courts became less willing to recognize an expectation of privacy as
objectively reasonable.
It seems unlikely that Brandeis would have endorsed this view of the Fourth
Amendment. His opinion in Olmstead relied in part on a nineteenth-century case,
Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886), that flatly prohibited the government
from securing access to certain types of information. Brandeis viewed the Fourth
Amendment limitation on searches as closely interwoven with the Fifth Amend-
ment prohibition of government incursions into the person. It is an approach to pri-
vacy that does not simply establish procedures to regulate government conduct but
sets certain aspects of the person beyond the reach of government.
A German constitutional court embraced this view of privacy in 2004. That
court found that federal wiretapping laws infringed upon the guarantees of human
dignity and the inviolability of the home. The court held that an absolute area of
intimacy where citizens can communicate privately without fear of government
surveillance protects certain communications.
Brandeis’s defense of the First Amendment and his contribution to modern First
Amendment doctrine is also noteworthy as critics of privacy often charge that pri-
vacy and the First Amendment are at odds. With Justice Holmes, Brandeis set forth
a robust view of the First Amendment that was later embraced by the Supreme
Court in such cases as Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), and Brandenburg v.
Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969). The Brandeis opinion in Whitney v. California, 274
U.S. 357 (1927), is considered one of the most eloquent expressions of First
Amendment values in all of American law. In that opinion, Brandeis set forth a
broad view of the right to protest, the right to assemble, and the right to challenge
government as essential to the functioning of an effective democracy. At other
times, Brandeis set forward expansive views of open government and the broad
dissemination of public information, and he argued for greater public participation
in government decisionmaking.
Louis Brandeis engaged in many of the popular legal and social causes that
emerged in the United States in the early twentieth century. Associated with the
progressive movement, the founding of the state of Israel, and many social and

political reform efforts, Brandeis embraced a view of law as a public service and a
means of social change. He supported the New Deal programs of the Roosevelt
administration but also argued against concentration of power in the government
and the private sector. Brandeis campaigned for workers’ rights, for consumer pro-
tection, against corruption in government and and against persistent poverty. 
Brandeis’s expertise as a lawyer as well as his views about American govern-
ment also influenced the modern privacy movement. Perhaps in response to the
growing formalism in American law following the adoption of Langdell’s scientific
approach to legal education, Brandeis prepared a brief in a case concerning work-
ing conditions that relied almost exclusively on empirical data gathered from
experts in social science. Instead of presenting legal arguments about the appropri-
ate scope of liberty of contract, Brandeis chose to present evidence on the impact of
long hours for working women. The Brandeis Brief, as it came to be known,
became a critical tool for litigators and political reformers. Modern-day privacy
advocacy organizations, such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center
(EPIC), often have followed the model of the Brandeis Brief in their cases. For
example, in Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District, 542 U.S. 177 (2004), EPIC submitted
an amicus brief to the Supreme Court that included detailed reports on computer
databases that would be accessible to police officers if a Nevada state law compel-
ling the disclosure of personal identity was upheld.
Brandeis was also a fierce defender of federalism. In New State Ice v. Liebmann,
285 U.S. 262 (1932), Brandeis defended state regulation of business activity, argu-
ing that the states were “laboratories of democracy.” Brandeis’s views of federal-
ism came to the aid of modern-day privacy advocates when those who opposed
state regulation of commercial data brokers argued for federal preemption that
would limit the ability of the states to safeguard privacy. Privacy advocates, arguing
as Brandeis did many years earlier, supported the regulatory “experimentation” of
the states 
As lawyer, social reformer, and jurist, Louis Brandeis was one of the most influ-
ential Americans of the twentieth century. Although privacy was never a central
focus of Brandeis’s work, his contributions to the development of the law of pri-
vacy, his innovative work as a lawyer, and his basic regard for the rights of the indi-
vidual in a modern, industrial democracy provided the foundation for many future
privacy efforts.
In recognition of his contributions, the organization Privacy International
bestows the Brandeis Award to “those have done exemplary work to protect and
champion privacy.”

C
Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984
The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (CCPA) dictates the privacy
practices of cable companies. Under the act, default privacy protections are mini-
mal. For example, although customers must sometimes give consent for their cable
companies to collect personally identifiable information, consent is easily
obtained and is often not required. First, nothing in the act prevents a cable com-
pany from obtaining the required consent via the standard cable agreement or via
another standardized process such as a “click-through” agreement on the com-
pany’s website. Second, even without such consent, cable operators may collect
such information in order to “obtain information necessary to render a cable ser-
vice or other service provided by the cable operator to the subscriber” or to “detect
unauthorized reception of cable communications.”
Personally identifiable information may include account information such as
name, address, electronic mail address, telephone number, driver’s license num-
ber, Social Security number, bank account number, and other account informa-
tion. It may also include information regarding your viewing habits, for example,
how much time you spend watching programs, which menu screens you use most
often, and which pay-per-view programs you order. Under the CCPA, personally
identifiable information does not include “any record of aggregate data which does
not identify particular persons.” At least one court has ruled that personally identi-
fiable information also does not include information stored in the cable converter
box. As technology advances and as cable companies are able to offer ever more
sophisticated program options, the amount of personal information collected by
cable companies may become enormous.
Beyond collection of personal information, cable companies also have wide latitude
in disclosing personal information. Even if a customer does not consent, cable com-
panies can disclose that customer’s personally identifiable information if it is “neces-
sary to render, or conduct a legitimate business activity related to a cable service or
other service provided by the cable operator to the subscriber.” Thus, cable operators
may disclose customers’ personal information to third parties such as marketing com-
panies, collection agencies, and companies that specialize in warehousing personal
\

Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984
\
information and creating personal profiles; indeed, this “legitimate business activity”
exception means that personal information can be disclosed to almost anyone. More-
over, because of the legitimate business activity provision, cable companies are per-
mitted to combine customers’ personal information with personal information
obtained from third parties to construct enhanced databases and customer profiles.
Cable companies are required to give customers privacy notices and privacy
policy statements at the time a customer enters into a cable agreement. After this, a
privacy policy must also be sent to each customer at least once a year. The policy
must inform the customer of what personal information is collected by the cable
company, how this information will be used, what the disclosure practices of the
company are, how long the customer’s personal information will be retained,
instructions on how and where to access the personal information that the cable
company has collected, and the limitations on the company’s legal collection of
and disclosure of personal information.
If a third party requests a cable subscriber’s personally identifiable information
pursuant to a court order, the cable company must notify the subscriber. If a gov-
ernmental entity requests such personal information pursuant to a court order, that
entity must show by clear and convincing evidence that the customer is reasonably
suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information would be mate-
rial evidence in the case; in addition, the customer must be given the right to appear
in court and contest any claims made in support of the court order. However, this
notice requirement has been deemed inapplicable if the cable operator provides
both Internet access and cable access to the customer, because the Electronic
Communication Policy Act of 1986 bars companies that provide electronic com-
munications services from notifying customers that their personal information has
been requested by a governmental entity via a court order.
A cable customer has the right to access all the personally identifiable informa-
tion that the cable operator has collected on the customer at a convenient place des-
ignated by the cable company. If the customer finds errors in his or her personal
information, the customer must be given a reasonable opportunity to correct any
errors. Personally identifiable information must be destroyed by the cable company
if the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected,
and if there are no pending requests or court orders for such information. The
CCPA allows aggrieved customers to collect actual damages, which cannot be less
than $100 per day of a violation or $1000—whichever is higher. The court may
also award punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable litigation
costs. Finally, the act permits states and franchising authorities to enact or enforce
laws consistent with the act.

Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433 (1973)
Dombrowski was a member of the Chicago police force and owned a 1960
Dodge automobile. On September 9, 1969, Dombrowski visited West Bend, Wis-
consin, located over a hundred miles northwest of Chicago. He visited two taverns
near West Bend that evening and in the early morning of the next. Around noon of
the second day, Dombrowski’s car became disabled, and he had it towed to his
brother’s farm. He then borrowed his brother’s car and drove back to Chicago.
Once back in Chicago, Dombrowski rented a Thunderbird at the airport around
midnight, and drove back to his brother’s farm, where a tenant witnessed the Thun-
derbird pull alongside of the Dombrowski’s Oldsmobile at 4 a.m. On the morning
of September 11, Dombrowski purchased two towels from a nearby department
store. That evening he ate and drank heavily in a restaurant for over three hours,
and then he attempted to return to his brother’s farm. On his way, Dombrowski had
an accident and smashed the rented Thunderbird into a bridge abutment. A passing
motorist saw Dombrowski and gave him a ride back to town, where Dombrowski
called the police. The police picked Dombrowski up at a tavern and took him to the
scene of the accident. On their way, the officers determined Dombrowski to be
drunk since he offered three different stories of how the accident happened.
When the police arrived at the scene, they took several measurements relevant to
the accident. Dombrowski informed the officers he was a Chicago law enforcement
officer. At the time, the Wisconsin officers believed that Chicago police officers
were required to carry their service revolvers at all times. Therefore, before the tow
truck arrived, the officers searched Dombrowski as well as the front seat and glove
compartment of the car for his service revolver, but did not find it. The car was
towed to a private garage in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, and no guard was posted at the
garage. Dombrowski was interviewed at the West Bend police station and subse-
quently arrested for drunk driving. Later, because his condition was not improving,
Dombrowski was taken to a local hospital where he lapsed into a coma and was
placed under guard for observation.
One of the Wisconsin police officers, an Officer Weiss, returned to look for the
service revolver in the car, following the standard procedure of the West Bend
police department. In his search of the vehicle, Weiss discovered blood in the car
and several items in the trunk, including a nightstick with Dombrowski’s name on
it, two pairs of trousers, a raincoat, a towel, and a floor mat with fresh blood on it.
When confronted with these items and with the assistance of counsel, Dombrowski
informed the officers that he believed there was a body to be found at the north end
of his brother’s farm.
Upon investigation, officers found the half-dressed decedent’s body near the dis-
abled Dodge on the farm. Looking through one of the windows of the vehicle, the
officers observed a pillowcase, the backseat, and a briefcase covered in blood. The
officers returned with search warrants and orders to impound both of the vehi-
cles. The laboratory discovered and seized the front and back seats, a sock covered

\
in blood, a rear floor mat partially covered with blood, the briefcase, and a front floor
mat. The return of the warrant was filed, but it failed to list the sock and floor mat as
having been seized.
The issue presented in this case concerns whether the warrantless search of the
Thunderbird violated Dombrowski’s Fourth Amendment rights, and whether the
seizure of the sock and floor mat was invalid, having not been listed in the war-
rant’s return. In the decision, the Supreme Court made several key distinctions
regarding the search of the wrecked Thunderbird. The Court admitted that gener-
ally there is a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding a vehicle, but in cer-
tain circumstances, that expectation is trumped by public concern. Moreover, cars
are ambulatory and often noncriminal conduct will bring officers in plain view of
evidence, fruits, or instrumentalities of a crime or contraband. The Court pointed
out two important factual findings in this case that support its reasoning. First, the
Thunderbird represented a nuisance since it had been left on a public highway, and
Dombrowski had been unable to make arrangements to move the vehicle. The car
was not adjacent to a dwelling or momentarily unoccupied on a street, and there-
fore there was no reasonable expectation of privacy. Secondly, it was standard pro-
cedure to check a vehicle for a revolver in order to protect public safety. It was
constitutionally reasonable to believe that someone could happen upon the revolver
and retrieve it. Therefore, the police officer took action designed to protect the
safety of the general public, and not to intrude on Dombrowski’s rights. The Court
then reasoned that the seizure of the sock and floor mat from the Dodge was not
invalid, because the Dodge automobile was the item particularly described in the
warrant as the subject of the search. Therefore, it was not significant that the items
were not listed in the warrant return, and the warrant was valid at the time the arti-
cles were discovered.

protected expectation of privacy is based on two levels of inquiry. The first is
whether a person has demonstrated an expectation of privacy, and the second is
whether society will accept that expectation as reasonable. Although these appear
to be straightforward standards, cases such as California v. Ciraolo illustrate the
complexities involved in the analysis of the Fourth Amendment.
In this case, the respondent, Ciraolo, had marijuana growing in his back yard,
which was protected from sight at ground level by a 10-foot-high inner fence and a
6-foot-high outer fence. The home itself was directly in front of the yard and pro-
vided one edge of the fence’s perimeter. This tall barrier, however, was no match
for the Santa Clara, California, police department. After receiving an anonymous
tip reporting the respondent’s illegal activity, the police department dispatched two
officers, both of whom were trained in marijuana identification, to fly over the
respondent’s property in a private plane. The officers, flying at an altitude of 1,000
feet, within publicly navigable airspace, identified and photographed the marijuana
growing on the respondent’s property. In addition, they photographed the outside of
the respondent’s house as well as other homes and yards in the surrounding region.
One of the officers filed an affidavit on the basis of the anonymous tip and his
naked-eye observations. He attached the photograph of the respondent’s home and
surrounding area to the affidavit and obtained a search warrant. As a result of the
search, 73 plants were seized from the respondent’s property.
The respondent pleaded guilty to cultivating marijuana after the trial court
denied his plea to withhold the evidence of the search. The California Court of
Appeals, however, reversed the trial court’s decision to deny the respondent’s
motion. It ruled that the aerial observation of the respondent’s yard, which occurred
without a warrant, violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States. Finally, in May of 1986, the Supreme Court granted a writ of certio-
rari and again reversed the appellate court’s verdict. It ruled that the respondent’s
motion to withhold the evidence was properly denied, and that there had been no
violation of the Fourth Amendment.
To properly apply the Fourth Amendment, it was necessary for the Court to
first decide whether the respondent, Ciraolo, clearly had attempted to demon-
strate his expectation of privacy with respect to his property. None of the courts
disagreed that the fences surrounding the yard were obvious evidence that the
respondent had demonstrated this expectation. The Supreme Court, however,
addressed the second question, which was whether his expectation of privacy was
reasonable. Although the respondent’s yard was considered to be part of his
home, and the respondent had an expectation of privacy in his home, the Court
determined that this did not restrict all police surveillance. While the respondent
took measures to prohibit views of his property from ground level, the officers
who observed the illegal cultivation of marijuana were in a public area that hap-
pened to be in the air, and they possessed every legal right to be there. Therefore,
according the Court, the respondent knowingly exposed his property to public
sight. In addition, anyone who flew above the respondent’s yard and happened to
look down could have viewed what the officers viewed. Therefore, the Court
ruled that for the respondent to hold the expectation that his yard was protected
from all observation was not an expectation that society was willing to accept as
reasonable.

82
California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207 (1986)
\
In his dissent, Justice Powell referred to the period of the Fourth Amendment’s
passage and the original intention of the framers of the Constitution to protect citi-
zens’ right to security and freedom from surveillance. Powell pointed out that scien-
tific and technological advances had made it possible for police officials to devise
strategies for surveillance that did not constitute physical intrusion on privacy. Thus,
the Fourth Amendment gives individuals the right to be in their homes and in the
areas directly surrounding their homes, free from any governmental intrusions, yet
does not protect these same individuals from intrusions made possible with modern
technology. In this instance, police officers observed the respondent’s activities by
means of a private airplane, a product of modern technology. Powell questioned why
this method of surveillance was permitted without a warrant, yet, if the officials had
climbed a tree or the respondent’s fence in order to view the yard, the Court would
have deemed this method of search as unreasonable.
The Court’s inquiry as to whether society would view the respondent’s expecta-
tion to privacy as reasonable was also flawed in Powell’s opinion. The Court held
that the respondent could not expect privacy from aerial observations taken from
public airspace, and that society would not recognize this expectation as reasonable
either. Powell observed that commercial flights are not taken with the purpose of
observing one specific home and one specific person’s activities, as was the case
for the officers flying above the respondent’s home. At most, people aboard a pub-
lic aircraft may have only seconds to view what is going on below them as they
pass over, and the chances of them connecting what they see to any one specific
person are slim to none. Therefore, contrary to the majority opinion, the respondent
did not knowingly expose his property to governmental surveillance any more than
any other person who had not constructed a roof to cover his yard.
Overall, Powell found it difficult to imagine that society would permit individu-
als to be subjected to this type of police surveillance of their homes and yards with-
out a warrant and concluded that there should be some recognition of a violation of
the Fourth Amendment in this case.

Camfield v. City of Oklahoma City, 248 F.3d 1214 (2001)
\

Camfield v. City of Oklahoma City, 248 F.3d 1214 (2001)
In Camfield v. City of Oklahoma City, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals adjudi-
cated a videotape renter’s contention that an official policy to remove a famous for-
eign film from public access violated numerous constitutional protections and
provisions. At issue was the policy by the Oklahoma City Police Department to
confiscate the Academy Award–winning film The Tin Drum from the public fol-
lowing a state judge’s decision that the video violated Oklahoma’s child pornogra-
phy statute. The state court judge’s controversial decision was made ex parte,
which means that no parties to the case were present or allowed to make argu-
ments. Because the statute was amended amid the proceedings, the Supreme Court
held that the renter’s challenge to Oklahoma’s child pornography statute was moot.
However, the Court did rule that the police department’s policy of complete
removal of the foreign film without a prior adversarial hearing did impose an
unconstitutional prior restraint under the First Amendment (and the Fourteenth
Amendment as applied to the states).
The facts of the case were highly touted at the time. Michael Camfield, who was
heavily involved with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), had his copy
of the movie taken from his apartment by three Oklahoma City Police Department
officers. He sued the city of Oklahoma City, several members of the Oklahoma
City Police Department, and two state prosecutors under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging
violations of his First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
The Tin Drum, a German film, received the 1979 Academy Award for best for-
eign language film, among numerous other awards and acclaim. The Court recalled
an earlier interpretation of the film “as a complex allegorical fantasy intended to
symbolize the rise of Nazism and the corresponding decline of morality in Nazi
Germany.” At the time of the case, the movie had been circulating in the public
domain for over 20 years and had been widely discussed in academic articles in
books devoted to film.
In 1997, a citizen complained to the Oklahoma City Police Department that The
Tin Drum contained child pornography. The police obtained a copy of the movie
and submitted it to a state judge to receive a judicial ruling on the matter. The judge
confirmed the allegation that the movie contained child pornography as defined by
the Oklahoma child pornography statute, although his opinion was given orally and
not as a formal written opinion.
Upon the judge’s oral ruling, the Oklahoma City Police Department instituted a
policy to remove the objectionable film from public access. Police officers visited
numerous video stores throughout Oklahoma City and obtained copies of the tape.
They also requested and received the names and addresses of people who were
renting the movie at that time. One of those customers in possession of a rental tape
was Michael Camfield, the development director of the ACLU of Oklahoma. Upon
hearing of the recent controversy over The Tin Drum, he was watching the film to
devise rebuttal strategies for his organization “when the officers knocked on his
door.” Mr. Camfield handed over the tape to the police officers, contributing to a
total of nine voluntary surrenders of tapes to the Oklahoma City police. Those nine
renters later requested that their tapes be returned, but the Oklahoma City Police
Department refused their requests.

While Mr. Camfield’s legal challenge to the Oklahoma City Police Depart-
ment’s policy of removing the tape was being addressed, the Oklahoma state legis-
lature narrowed its definition of child pornography within its child pornography
statute. Thus, the statute no longer criminalized material involving a minor who
was merely “portrayed, depicted, or represented as engaged in” sexual acts. The
Supreme Court found that this substantial narrowing of the statute made Mr. Cam-
field’s challenge to the statute moot. As the Court explained, a challenge is moot
when there is no longer “a live case or controversy” as required by Article III of the
United States Constitution.
Mr. Camfield’s challenge to the Oklahoma City Police Department’s policy of
removing the tape, however, remained intact. Although the legislature narrowed the
statute after the tapes were removed, this did not change the state of affairs at the
time the police officers had removed the tapes from public domain without an
adversarial judicial hearing. The Court held that the policy of having video renters
voluntarily surrender their copies of the tape “imposed an unconstitutional prior
restraint on speech” under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Deciding
whether the tape included images of child pornography at the time of the policy
was a legal determination that required an adversarial hearing. Thus, because no
such hearing involving arguments by both sides had occurred, the policy was
deemed unconstitutional. This violation, however, was limited to the First and
Fourteenth Amendments. The Court rejected Mr. Camfield’s Fourth Amendment
claim because he failed to demonstrate either a search or a seizure.

Carnivore
Carnivore, also referred to as the Carnivore Diagnostic Tool or the Carnivore
Electronic Communication Collection System, is the name of a series of suites of
software developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for authorized
collection of electronic data for law enforcement purposes. It is an example of
packet-sniffing software. Carnivore was designed by the FBI to intercept and copy
data packets to and from suspects at the site of an Internet service provider (ISP)
with the cooperation of the ISP. The term “Carnivore” is also commonly used to
describe the successors to that series of software, even though the FBI dropped the
name Carnivore in 2001 to adopt the more neutral name of DCS1000 to describe

Carnivore
\
85
the intercept suite. Unlike furtively employed and developed tools, Carnivore has
been openly discussed by the FBI on its website and by other U.S. government
institutions. For example, it has been subject to congressional review, and there was
even an appraisal of the software under the auspices of the Department of Justice
carried out by the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute.
With the advent of widespread public use of the Internet as a communications
network, it became clear to the FBI that for law enforcement purposes agents
would have to use tools to intercept network data traffic in much the same way that
phone taps are used to gather evidence of criminal activity. This need for data-
intercept tools led to the development of Carnivore’s predecessors during the
1990s.
The FBI is reputed to have developed its first packet capture system in the mid-
1990s, but little is publicly known about this first system. The second incarnation,
Omnivore, was developed in 1997 for the Solaris x86 platform at a cost of around
$900,000. It was designed to give government agencies the ability to capture Inter-
net traffic based on users’ identities and to print captured electronic mail in real
time. In addition, Omnivore was configured to save the captured e-mail to an 8 mm
tape backup. Through a project named Phiple Troenix, the FBI developed Carni-
vore to replace Omnivore. This redevelopment was driven by the need for a more
modern system that could be run on personal computers, and this project led to the
development of the Carnivore suite at a cost of $800,000 to run on the Microsoft
Windows NT operating system.
From Omnivore to DSC1000, the Carnivore-type systems seem to have operated
in fundamentally the same way. A system is installed in the machine room of an
ISP under the administration of an FBI agent. All the Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) data (the way in which information is coded
and packaged to communicate on the Internet) traveling past the Carnivore inser-
tion point are captured as a copy of the data stream. There is not an interruption of
the data; rather, the data are merely mirrored as they flow past. As the TCP/IP data
are captured, they are written to a buffer in order to temporarily store the copies of
the packet data, typically to a shared memory area of the system. As the memory
area begins to fill, the Carnivore software sifts through the information collected,
applying user-defined filters to the buffered packet data. Thus, if Carnivore were
configured to collect all e-mails to mperry@uwo.ca, all the packet data to that
address would be written from the buffer to a more permanent storage medium
(such as a Zip drive or hard drive), while all other data would be flushed from the
buffer. In essence the system replicates all the traffic passing the insertion point but
discards anything that does not meet the search criteria. However, Carnivore is
more configurable than simply being able to search for an e-mail address, for it can
be set to capture sets of data based on fixed or dynamic Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses, and can collect all the packets to and from a particular address, or, in
“pen-mode,” only the to/from header information. Thus, not only e-mails but also
the web pages browsed, the file transfer protocol, or indeed any transfers from a
particular computer or suspect can be captured by the system.
In recent years, the FBI seems to have begun to move away from using its own
software to using commercially available software. Taking into account the ongo-
ing support and development costs of a home-grown system in a rapidly developing

86
Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925)
\
environment, it may be that using a commercial system that can be tailored for a
particular enforcement purpose is more effective. The FBI’s Carnivore/DCS1000
report to Congress at the end of 2003 states that during that year the agency
deployed surveillance software eight times but did not deploy Carnivore or
DCS1000 at all.
There are a number of commercial packet analysis packages available, such as
EtherPeek, Ethertest, and Ethereal. These are often employed by network techni-
cians in order to detect network problems and determine network performance.
They can also be used in the same way as Carnivore to capture packet data infor-
mation, and other law enforcement agencies have used EtherPeek. The main weak-
ness with this type of software is that the use of a simple encryption package can
defeat content collection, and this has led to the development of keystroke logging
software such as Magic Lantern. By inserting a key logging program onto the com-
puter of a suspect, such as by the use of a Trojan horse, which is a surreptitiously
installed computer program, enforcement agencies can record the keys typed by the
computer user. However, the use of IP masking, IP spoofing, anonymizing proxy
servers, and other security techniques, which are all perfectly legal and have legiti-
mate uses, can prevent the easy identification of the target suspect. As with many
other areas of computer security, it is essentially an “arms race” between those who
wish to obfuscate their data, for legitimate or illicit reasons, and those who seek to
use code to uncover the data transmissions and content of others, which may also
be legal or illegal.
The history of Carnivore and its successors illustrates that legitimately deployed
law enforcement tools that copy targeted digital transmissions have a useful role to
play in the law enforcement environment, and they will continue to be used,
whether developed by enforcement agencies themselves or by private companies
that offer off-the-shelf packages that allow government entities to tailor programs
meet their objectives.

Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925)
The National Prohibition Act, also known as the Volstead Act, was passed by
Congress in 1919 and prohibited the manufacturing, transportation, and sale of
alcoholic beverages. On January 16, 1920, the Volstead Act came into force as the
Eighteenth Amendment, later repealed in 1933 by the Twenty-first Amendment.
George Carroll and John Kiro were indicted and convicted for transporting
intoxicating spirituous liquor in an automobile in the amount of 68 quarts of whis-
key and gin in violation of the National Prohibition Act. Carroll and Kiro con-
tended that the search of their automobile and the discovery of the alcohol was the

Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925)
\
87
product of an illegal search and seizure in violation of their Fourth Amendment
rights.
On September 21, 1921, three men, Carroll, Kiro, and Kruska entered an apart-
ment in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and met three undercover federal prohibition
agents, Cronewett, Scully, and Thayer. Cronewett, using an alias, was introduced to
Carroll and Kiro, and stated he wanted to buy three cases of whiskey. Carroll and
Kiro stated that they had to go east of Grand Rapids to obtain the alcohol and
would be back in about an hour. After the time had passed, Kruska returned in an
Oldsmobile roadster, the registration number of which Cronewett noted, and stated
they could not get the alcohol that night but would return the following day to
deliver it. The sellers never returned.
Cronewett and his colleagues maintained patrol on the road between Grand Rap-
ids and Detroit, looking for violators of the National Prohibition Act as part of their
regular duties. On October 6, 1921, Carroll and Kiro passed Cronewett and Scully,
who were breaking for lunch, in the same Oldsmobile Roadster the agents had
noticed a month prior. The agents engaged in a pursuit, but lost the men in East
Lansing. More than two months later, on December 15, 1921, Carroll and Kiro
again passed the agents. This time the agents were able to catch the two men east of
Grand Rapids. Upon stopping them, the agents searched the roadster and found 68
bottles of liquor behind the upholstery of the seats. The two men were arrested.
The question before the Supreme Court was whether the search and seizure of
the alcohol in this case violated Carroll and Kiro’s Fourth Amendment rights.
Chief Justice Taft delivered the opinion of the Court, including an extensive review
of statutory and case law. These references demonstrated that the guaranty of the
Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizures had long recognized a
distinction between the search of a home or structure and that of a vehicle or ship.
The distinction is based on the practicability of obtaining a search warrant. The
Court demonstrated that it was easier to obtain a warrant for a structure, whereas it
was not practicable to secure a warrant for a moveable object like a vehicle,
because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in
which the warrant must be sought.
Next the Court determined under what circumstances a warrantless search of a
vehicle might be made. The majority stated that it would be intolerable and unrea-
sonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on the
chance of finding liquor, and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways
to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search. Those entitled to use the public
highways have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless proba-
ble cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal mer-
chandise is known to a competent official who is authorized to make searches. In
this case, the agents had probable cause or reasonable basis to believe that Caroll
and Kiro were transporting alcohol. They appeared in the same vehicle that they
had used in October; were followed into a neighborhood notorious for manufactur-
ing and importing illegal spirits; and, had been seen on different occasions making
the trip between Detroit and Grand Rapids. It was clear, according to the Court,
that in this case the officers had justification for the search and seizure. The facts
and circumstances within their knowledge and the trustworthy information were
sufficient in themselves to establish a reasonable belief that liquor was being

\
transported in the automobile which they had stopped and searched. Therefore, in
this case, Carroll and Kiro’s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated. The
search and seizure of the vehicle were warranted by the inherent mobility of the
vehicle and by the probable cause the officers had that the two men were transport-
ing alcohol.

Cellular telephone
The privacy issues surrounding cellular telephones (alternatively, “cell phones,”
“wireless,” or “mobile phones”) are in some ways simply the union of the issues of
telephony and radio communications generally. While enabling long-distance voice
communication and data transfer, these antecedent technologies simultaneously
opened up the potential for eavesdropping, particularly by state law enforcement and
intelligence-gathering organizations. However, the inherent mobility of the cellular
phone has both complicated these issues and introduced new ones. Since their earliest
deployment in the 1980s, cell phones and their supporting infrastructure have prolif-
erated around the globe, making them the most common personally carried electronic
device. Their impact on communication has powerfully reshaped social mores and
the boundaries between public and private space, so that today cell phones are iconic
of the tension intrinsic to mobile communications: an almost constant connection to a
pervasive information network, favoring individuated, electronically mediated expe-
rience over physically proximate social interaction. Cell phones (and related devices
such as personal digital assistants, or PDAs) are and will continue to be pivotal indi-
cators of the interdependence of privacy norms and information technology.
The broad adoption of cell phones by the consumer market (and the privacy
implications therein) depended on the solution of three crucial technical chal-
lenges: portability, bandwidth limitations, and integration with existing telephone
networks. As with many information technologies generally, innovations in elec-
tronics manufacturing—in particular chip microminiaturization and the gradual
increase in power density of small, dry-cell batteries—allowed cell phones to be

reduced to an easily portable size. While previous generations of “mobile” radio
communication equipment could be moved or even mounted in vehicles, in general
they were far too unwieldy to be carried personally and were limited in range. Just
as importantly, however, fixed telephones relied on wires and offered duplex com-
munication (i.e., simultaneous transmission and reception). For a radio-based sys-
tem, this meant two frequencies or channels were required per user (one to
transmit, one to receive), and as the density of users in a given area increased, so
did the demand for available channels (or bandwidth). This issue was solved
through the development of cellular networks, whereby a geographic region was
segregated into cells, each having its own central relay tower and using a range of
radio channels distinct from adjacent cells. The arrangement allowed for the reuse
of channels within nonadjacent cells, and more than two decades of new cell estab-
lishment and further innovations in digital signal processing have sought to match
commercial providers’ call-handling capacity with increasing consumer demand.
Finally, despite significant differences in the underlying technology, cellular sys-
tems had to be integrated with existing telephone networks, both technically and
culturally. For example, users had to be able to call fixed phones from cell phones
(and vice versa), and the phones themselves had to have a familiar “user interface”
(that is, their operation had to strongly resemble that of fixed phones).
As a direct descendant of previous telecommunication technologies, cell phones
have inherited from them their fundamental privacy challenges, significant advances
in signal encryption notwithstanding. In the nineteenth century, the signaling and com-
munication demands of railroads, steam-powered ocean vessels, the news media, and
big business brought the dawn of the telecommunications era: the telegraph and Morse
Code in the 1840s and 1850s; the telephone and telephone exchanges in the 1870s and
1880s; and “wireless,” or radio, after the turn of the century. While these developments
significantly extended the physical distance over which instantaneous communication
could occur, they also incurred the possibility of electronic eavesdropping or wiretap-
ping (in the cases of telegraphy and telephony) or broadcast interception (in the case
of radio). Early on, communications security was primarily a concern of large state
and commercial users engaged in business or intelligence gathering, but as telecom-
munications proliferated and became culturally accepted in private residences, surveil-
lance of citizens by the state became an attractive possibility to law enforcement
agencies. In recent decades, the growing value of contact information as a commodity
(e.g., for telemarketing or fundraising) has made the privacy status of telephone num-
bers (including cell phone numbers) an important controversy.
The true innovation of the cell phone from the users’ perspective—communications
mobility—has opened new, explicitly spatial dimensions in privacy discussion. Cell
phone technology is commonly described as having gone through three generations:
analog cellular or “first generation” systems, digital or “second generation” systems,
and multimedia or “third generation” systems. Beginning with the first generation, cell
phones have reshaped the culturally negotiated boundary between public and private
space. Once a somewhat intimate practice restricted to the home, office, or phone
booth, telephone conversation has moved into subways, grocery stores, and many other
public venues. Requests to curb cell phone use are often made explicitly to preserve the
character of previously well-defined social spaces, protecting privacy and limiting dis-
traction in hospitals, theaters, classrooms, and other places.

Cellular telephone
\
Newer generations of cell phones have compounded this spatial reconfiguration
by integrating other technologies. Ostensibly required to ensure seamless switching
between cells, a cell phone’s location can be determined using a number of tech-
niques (such as a global positioning system (GPS), for example), with or without
the user’s knowledge. While this offers clear advantages for some relatively benign
applications (e.g., the automatic localization of emergency callers), the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other agencies have recently lobbied to have
such information available for surveillance and also incorporated into permanent
phone records for law enforcement purposes. Along with other “location-aware”
technologies, this has resulted in an entirely new privacy regime: that of locational
privacy (i.e., the right to limit knowledge of a person’s specific whereabouts). Chal-
lenging the public/private boundary even further, third-generation cell phones have
integrated digital cameras or video recorders, allowing instant image collection and
transmission. The significant privacy concerns introduced with closed-circuit tele-
vision and other imaging systems are extended via this ubiquitous personal device,
making “public spaces” just as often surveilled spaces.
Communications mobility yields several other shifts in the landscape of pri-
vacy concern. When restricted to the home, telephones were largely a household
property, and their use by children and young adults was administered by the
older adults of the household. Today, cell phones and accounts are typically
considered individual property and often get distributed to children by parents
concerned with their safety. On the one hand, this has made it more difficult to
constrain what information children give out over the phone; on the other, it con-
tributes to the broad sublimation of constant parental surveillance, a distinct shift
in privacy norms. In another example, the poor quality and coverage of telephone
and other ground lines in developing countries has made cell phones an enor-
mously popular alternative, creating differentials in the acceptance and prolifera-
tion of cell phone use (and in culturally inflected understandings of “privacy”).
Also, the integration of identification technologies such as caller ID (more com-
mon to cell phones than to fixed phones) has incrementally eroded the privacy of
a previously anonymous act, while the very recent availability of inexpensive,
limited-time “disposable cell phones” provides a counter example of privacy
enhancement. As the digital information employed by cell phones is expanded,
standardized, and more fluidly exchanged (e.g., through technologies such as
Voice-Over-Internet Protocol, or VoIP), these small devices will continue to have
broad and varied privacy implications.

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
The Central Intelligence Agency is part of the American intelligence commu-
nity, which is led by the director of national intelligence. Primarily, the CIA is
responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting information about foreign gov-
ernments, corporations, individuals, and multinational or para-national groups to
U.S. government agencies and branches. The CIA describes its mission as being
“the eyes and ears of the nation.” The second aspect of the mission of the CIA is to
furnish relevant and objective analysis of international intelligence. The third
aspect of the agency’s mission is to be the government’s “hidden hand” in conduct-
ing covert action to preempt threats to U.S. security or to achieve national policy
objectives. Those covert operations are conducted at the direction of the president
under the supervision of the director of the CIA.
After World War II and in the face of the increasing threat of Communism and
the beginning of the Cold War, the U.S. Congress created the Central Intelligence
Agency as the successor to the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), which ceased to
exist in October 1945. The CIA came into existence with the signing of the
National Security Act of 1947. While the CIA is charged with the task of collecting
intelligence, it has no police power, no power of subpoena, no law enforcement
powers, and no internal security functions within the United States. Its focus on
foreign governments, businesses, and individuals places its activity outside the
United States, since Congress created the agency to protect the privacy and security
of U.S. citizens. The areas that are of greatest importance in the work of the CIA
include international organized crime, narcotics trafficking, counterterrorism,
counterintelligence, nuclear nonproliferation, the environment, and arms control
intelligence.
The agency is organized into several departments, the most notable of which are
the Directorate of Intelligence, which analyzes intelligence from all sources on key
foreign issues; the National Clandestine Service, which undertakes covert collec-
tion of foreign intelligence; and the Directorate of Science and Technology, which
creates and applies new technology to collect intelligence.
The standard euphemism for the CIA is the “other government agency.” That
veiled reference is used when the CIA is involved in a situation but the United
States cannot confirm the CIA’s involvement. Other colloquial names for the CIA
are “the Agency” and, most commonly, “the Company.” People who work for the
CIA are often called “spooks” or “spies,” as are persons who work for other intelli-
gence agencies throughout the world. Because the headquarters of the CIA is
located in Langley, Virginia, which was open farmland when the agency was
formed and the headquarters was constructed, employees of the agency are often
called “Virginia farm boys.”
Documentation indicates that at the time of the CIA’s creation in 1947, many
former Nazi operatives were recruited to be agents. In return, those operatives were
promised immunity from prosecution for war crimes committed during World War
II (Operation Paperclip). In 1949 Congress passed a law that essentially allowed

92
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
\
the CIA to operate in complete secrecy and without the limitations generally
applied to the use of federal funds. That law also created a program that permitted
defectors from other countries and persons considered essential to national security
to be admitted to the United States without going through the normal immigration
processes, to be provided with new identities, and to be provided financial support.
Within that Congressionally sanctioned secrecy, the CIA began the first “struc-
tured behavioral control program” in the early 1950s. At the time, there was little
involvement or oversight of the CIA’s activities by other government agencies.
That was generally explained on the basis of the need to maintain secrecy to protect
the agents, sources, and methods employed by the agency. The CIA was also trying
to match the capabilities of the KGB, the agency of Russian spies, in an effort to
keep ahead of the Communist group. The early 1950s was also a time of rapid
expansion of the reach of the agency.
Throughout the Cold War and under the Communist threat, the CIA was allowed
to carry out its operations without much oversight or interference until the early
1970s. The eruption of the Watergate scandal and the efforts of Congress to exer-
cise its oversight power over the executive branch of the government began to
expose the activities of the CIA. When Watergate became a national issue, Presi-
dent Nixon tried unsuccessfully to have the CIA convince the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) that an investigation of Watergate would reveal too much
about the involvement of the CIA in such past activities as the Bay of Pigs invasion.
At about the same time, James Schlesinger, who was then director of central intelli-
gence, authorized a series of reports that brought to light vast wrongdoing by the
CIA. Those reports were often referred to as “the family jewels.” The general pub-
lic probably would have known nothing of that sordid history had not a New York
Times reporter published a story documenting the involvement of the CIA in the
assassination of certain foreign leaders. The story also revealed that the CIA had
been keeping files on thousands of American citizens who had been involved in the
peace movement during the Vietnam War and those opposing nuclear proliferation.
In light of those revelations, by 1975, after intensive Senate and House investi-
gations, the CIA was prohibited from future assassinations of foreign leaders, and
the agency was notified that a prohibition against spying on Americans would be
enforced. That trend has been reversed, however. After the September 11, 2001,
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, many restrictions on the tac-
tics of the CIA were removed. At the same time, the Intelligence Reform and Ter-
rorism Prevention Act of 2004 instituted a number of changes in the structure of
the government’s management of domestic and foreign intelligence.
Over the past 60 years or so, the CIA has conducted a number of operations that
have become quite famous. Those that have reached public awareness include:
• A mind-control program called MKULTRA that was conducted in the
United States in the 1950s and 1960s;
• A “false flag” operation in Italy designed to discredit leftist groups by
conducting terrorist operations for which they would be blamed;
• Numerous efforts in Eastern Europe to limit the scope of Soviet influence;
• The overthrow of the Mossadegh government in Iran in 1953;

\
93
• The overthrow of the democratically elected government of Guatemala in 1954;
• The Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961;
• Efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro, head of state in Cuba;
• Involvement in a secret war in Laos between 1962 and 1975;
• Involvement in the Nicaragua “contra” conspiracy and sale and trafficking
of cocaine; and,
• Involvement in the coup in Chile in 1973.
The CIA and its activities, particularly its covert activities, have been the source
of controversy since the agency’s creation. The CIA is criticized for breaking the
laws of other nations, attempting assassinations, and disseminating propaganda.
More recently, a great deal of public attention and ensuing controversy have sur-
rounded accusations of torture against prisoners and the existence of secret prisons
in foreign countries to which prisoners are taken in circumvention of American
legal restrictions and Geneva Convention restrictions against the use of torture.
However, the defenders of those practices believe that they are necessary to protect
national security.
Historically, the CIA has abrogated the privacy of foreign citizens to protect the
privacy and security of U.S. citizens. Recently, many critics and many American
citizens have voiced the opinion that the lack of controls on the intelligence gath-
ered by the CIA, the FBI, and other intelligence agencies abrogates the right to pri-
vacy that is constitutionally guaranteed to American citizens. Key issues in the
debate over the authority to violate personal privacy concern racial or ethnic profil-
ing, wiretapping, monitoring of personal communications via cellular telephones,
access to personal records that show the reading habits of private citizens, monitor-
ing of electronic mail and other Internet use, monitoring of personal movement
via the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the use of radio frequency identi-
fication (RFID) chips to track the movement of pets, personal goods, and items
shipped, among others.
In addition, questions on the legality of spying on American citizens who are not
under investigation for a crime, and without a court order or search warrant, are
arising. If there are no controls over spying against Americans or foreigners, there
is also no control over the type of information collected or the way it is used.
Although many Americans have been willing to relinquish certain rights to privacy
in the post-9/11 climate of concern for national security, it has not been established
that those same Americans are willing to relinquish all personal rights in favor of
uncontrolled access by government agencies.
Some argue in favor of controls, noting that an attack by terrorists or another
government requires months of planning, which would provide ample opportunity
for government agencies to obtain the necessary warrants before initiating spying
or surveillance activity. They point to a larger concern that, without warrants
defining the information that can be obtained or the means by which it can be
obtained, it becomes possible for any government agency to collect any kind of
information on any individual residing within the United States.
The CIA, which serves as the “eyes and ears of the nation,” is in danger, accord-
ing to some, of turning its surveillance activities on U.S. citizens. The current

debate over the scope and limitations of CIA power, especially in this age of elec-
tronic snooping, may well define the agency’s role in American government for the
coming decades.

Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)
In 1998 Congress passed the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15
U.S.C. §§6501–6505 (COPPA), in response to a 1998 Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) report that described the widespread collection and use of personally iden-
tifiable information of children without their parents’ knowledge or consent. The
FTC was charged with enforcing the act and issuing COPPA rules. The final
COPPA Rule was issued in 1999 and became effective in April 2000.
COPPA aims to protect the personal information of children (persons under the
age of 13) online. The final COPPA rule requires parental consent before a com-
mercial website or an online service directed at children (or a website or online ser-
vice that has knowledge that it collects personal information from children)
collects, uses, or discloses personal information about a child. The COPPA rule
also requires that websites and online services “establish and maintain reasonable
procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal infor-
mation collected from children.” In addition, entities subject to this act must allow
parents to access any personal information on their child and delete it or opt out of
future collection, and such entities must limit their collection of children’s personal
information to that which is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Fur-
thermore, site operators cannot condition participation in an online activity upon
the disclosure of more personal information than is necessary to participate in that
activity. COPPA also requires that websites subject to the act must post a privacy
policy informing parents of their privacy practices and the contact information for
each operator of the website. The required privacy policy must be linked to a con-
spicuous place on the website’s homepage and on any page on which a child is
asked to provide personal information.
COPPA does not apply to Internet service providers or nonprofit entities, but it
does apply to domestic websites and foreign websites directed at children in the
United States. The types of personal information that are regulated by COPPA
include a child’s full name, physical address, electronic mail address, Social Secu-
rity number, telephone number, and a persistent identifier—such as a cookie—
that is combined with personal information. COPPA includes a “safe harbor”

Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969)
\
95
provision that allows entities and industry groups to request FTC approval of
self-regulatory guidelines.
Violators of the act may be subject to an injunction and civil penalties of up to
$11,000 per violation. Although the FTC has enforcement authority for COPPA,
the commission has brought few cases under the act. However, the FTC has issued
warning letters to dozens of website operators. In addition to FTC enforcement,
COPPA empowers states and select federal agencies to enforce the act within their
jurisdictions.
Many criticisms have been leveled at COPPA. Some critics argue that the vari-
ous parental consent mechanisms outlined by the FTC are too cumbersome, too
slow, and too expensive. Furthermore, these critics argue, the parental consent
mechanisms are inadequate to protect children’s privacy because children can sim-
ply fabricate information to access sites, and sites can evade COPPA regulation by
stating that they do not sell products to children. Other critics have argued that
defining a child as a person under the age of 13 is arbitrary and unjustified, inas-
much as children over the age of 13 may also need online privacy protection.
Finally, some commentators have argued that COPPA may not pass constitutional
muster because requiring children to divulge personal information or verify that
they are entitled to access information as a condition to accessing the information
results in the chilling of speech and, thus, a violation of the First Amendment. Sim-
ilarly, critics argue that the forced relinquishment of the right to anonymous com-
munication may run afoul of the First Amendment.

Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969)
One afternoon in 1965, three police officers arrived at Chimel’s California home
with a warrant authorizing them to arrest Chimel for the burglary of a coin shop.
Chimel’s wife ushered them in, where they waited for 10 or 15 minutes before
Chimel arrived home from work. When he arrived, one of the officers handed him
the arrest warrant and asked if they could look around. Chimel objected, but the
officer advised him that on the basis of the lawful arrest they would nevertheless
conduct a search. The officers did not have a search warrant.
Accompanied by Chimel’s wife, the officers searched the entire three-bedroom
house, including the attic, the garage, and a workshop. In two of the rooms, the
officers had Chimel’s wife open drawers and physically move contents so that they
“might view any items that would have come from the burglary.” The officers
seized a number of items: primarily coins, but also several medals, tokens, and
other objects. The entire search took between 45 minutes and an hour. At Chimel’s
trial, these items were admitted as evidence against him over his objection that they

96
Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969)
\
had been unconstitutionally seized. He was convicted, and the conviction was
affirmed by both the California Court of Appeals and the California Supreme
Court. Both courts conceded that the arrest warrant was invalid because it was set
forth in conclusory terms, but that because the officers had procured it in good faith
and their actions were based on probable cause, the arrest was nevertheless lawful.
Therefore, the courts found that the search incident to the valid arrest was justified.
The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari; it accepted the California
courts’ findings that the arrest was valid, and it considered only whether the war-
rantless search of Chimel’s house could be constitutionally justified as a search
incident to that arrest. In its decision, the Supreme Court reversed the California
Supreme Court. The Court began its analysis by reciting the progression of case
law leading from the limited suggestion found in the dicta of Weeks v. United
States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914), which upheld the search of the person incident to a
lawful arrest, to the expansive holdings of Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145
(1947).
Both Harris and United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56 (1950), extended the
search incident to the surroundings within the person’s possession or control. It
was upon these cases that the state had relied in its argument that the search was
lawful. The dubious progression of these cases led the Supreme Court to find that
the doctrine as pronounced in Rabinowitz could withstand neither historical nor
rational analysis. The warrant requirement serves a high function, protecting pri-
vacy from government invasion as guaranteed in the Fourth Amendment. The
Court affirmed that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer
to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might
seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect an escape. It is also reasonable, the
court held, for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the
arrestee’s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction. The area into
which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items is also
governed by a like rule: a gun on a table or in a drawer in front of the arrestee. The
court explicitly overruled Harris and Rabinowitz, however, to the extent that those
cases allowed officers to engage in warrantless searches not justified by probable
cause. Here, the search went far beyond Chimel’s person and the area from within
which he might have obtained a weapon or some piece of evidence that could have
incriminated him. The Court held that this search was unlawful and reversed
Chimel’s convictions.
Mr. Justice Harlan concurred in the opinion but questioned the Court’s overrul-
ing of Harris and Rabinowitz, expressing concern about the workability of the
expanded warrant system inherent in the majority’s opinion. Justice White, joined
by Justice Black, dissented. The dissent expressed concern that Fourth Amendment
jurisprudence was changing all too rapidly, and that it would be unwise to abandon
the latest rulings in this area. Like the concurrence, the dissent argued that the hold-
ing in this case, and the explicit overruling of Harris and Rabinowitz, would unrea-
sonably require police to leave the scene of an arrest in order to obtain a search
warrant when they may already have probable cause. It argued that Chimel’s life
and privacy had already been disrupted by the arrest; the officers’ subsequent
search of his premises was a “relatively minor intrusion.” The dissent held with the
most recent cases: once probable cause exists, the fact that there is no warrant does

not make a search incident to a lawful arrest unreasonable or unlawful, and the dis-
sent did not limit this holding, as did the majority, to a search only of the person
and the immediate and accessible surroundings.

Civil liberties. See Constitutional protections
Civil service laws
Civil service laws dominate public employment in the United States. The princi-
ples of selection based on merit and of the personal accountability of government
employees on which these laws rest may conflict with personal privacy. Therefore,
courts and government officials have struggled to accommodate civil service laws
with personal privacy.
Based in part of reforms in New York state, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1883
created the modern federal civil service. Civil service in the federal government and
in the states rests on selection by competitive examination and on protections for
career employees from arbitrary personnel actions. Civil service laws implicate
issues regarding the protection of the personal privacy of public employees. Some
concerns about privacy arise from the selection of public employees. For example,
the interests of the public employer in hiring some categories of public employees,
such as police officers, may outweigh the privacy interests of employees. Private
information sought could include medical and psychological information; polygraph
tests; financial information; and information regarding drinking, gambling, and arrest
records, including those of relatives. In some instances, the interests of the public
employer in the selection of categories of public employees can outweigh even strong
interests in privacy.
Selection procedures often require inquiry into the past conduct of persons seek-
ing government employment, conduct that reflects on their honesty, integrity, and
qualifications. This inquiry requires the cooperation of persons with information
about these candidates. Privacy provisions, however, such as those in the Privacy
Act of 1974, give persons access to records about themselves. Such access reduces
the likelihood that third persons will candidly respond to inquiries. Therefore, the

98
Civil service laws
\
Privacy Act of 1974 contains an exemption from its access provisions for investiga-
tory material compiled for the purpose of determining the suitability, eligibility,
and qualifications for civilian federal employment. This exemption, however, only
protects a confidential source providing information under an express promise of
confidentiality.
Some concerns about privacy arise from the principle of personal accountability
in civil service laws. Civil service laws hold employees accountable through the
investigation and punishment of misconduct and poor performance. Such account-
ability implicates personal privacy. For example, the constitutional protection
against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to government employees.
Depending upon the circumstances, a public employee may have a reasonable
expectation of privacy regarding the workplace. The Supreme Court, however, has
dispensed with the requirement of a warrant based on probable cause in public
employment. Instead, the Court decided that all work-related searches of public
employers need only meet the standard of reasonable under all the circumstances.
Moreover, the Supreme Court permits some searches without a suspicion of
wrongdoing by a specific public employee. For example, the Court has approved
random drug testing of categories of employees whose use of illegal drugs pose
particular risks. Examples of such categories of employees include customs
employees seeking transfer or promotion to positions involving drug interdiction,
employees carrying firearms, guards, police, employees flying or maintaining air-
craft, chemical and nuclear workers, firefighters, and motor vehicle operators.
Statutory provisions, like the Privacy Act of 1974, may affect the conduct of
investigations of federal employees. The act provides that to “the extent practica-
ble,” information be acquired from the subject of an inquiry. This requirement
encourages managers to seek information from employees first. In some cases,
however, it is not practicable to do so because the inquiry would alert employees to
an ongoing investigation.
Because the Privacy Act of 1974 gives persons the right to access and review
records regarding them, this right may influence civil service investigations.
Although access and review help guarantee the accuracy of government informa-
tion identified with a particular person, these rights may also give employees pre-
mature access to investigative files and may identify witnesses. The exemptions to
the act temper interference with civil service discipline. Exemptions to the right of
access and review regarding criminal investigations or regarding information com-
piled in the reasonable anticipation of “a civil action or civil proceedings” are
likely to apply to many civil service investigations.
Accountability may require dissemination to the public of information regarding
the misconduct, performance, and punishment of public employees. Particularly
when the misconduct is egregious or places the public at risk, disclosures assure the
public of the integrity and effectiveness of the civil service. This assurance sup-
ports public confidence and trust in the operations of government. These disclo-
sures, however, may also threaten privacy.

Clinton-Lewinsky scandal
The Clinton-Lewinsky scandal dominated news headlines in the United States,
with reverberations heard around the world, throughout the second term of Presi-
dent William J. Clinton. The scandal centered on a consensual, sexual affair involv-
ing the president and a young White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Facts
about the affair were made public in the course of Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr’s far-reaching inquiry into what began as accusations of financial impropri-
eties in the Whitewater land deal. Starr’s probe culminated in a vote on December
19, 1999, by the U.S. House of Representatives to approve two articles of impeach-
ment against the president on charges that included perjury and obstruction of jus-
tice in connection with Clinton’s efforts to suppress information about his
relationship with Lewinsky. The events surrounding the revelation of the Clinton-
Lewinsky affair elicited widespread concern about dwindling privacy protections
for public figures and private citizens in the contemporary United States. Fre-
quently likened to a form of “new McCarthyism,” the Starr probe in particular
came to emblematize the pathologies of a society that no longer respects the right
to privacy. The media was also widely condemned for what many considered to be
excessive coverage of the details pertaining to a private affair.
The origins of the scandal lie in two other legal imbroglios that dogged Clinton
throughout his presidency: the investigation of the Whitewater land deal and the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. In 1994, during Clinton’s first term in
office, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske, Jr., as independent
counsel to investigate the financial dealings of the Whitewater property company.
The president and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were accused of colluding
with their friends and business partners, James and Susan McDougal, to reap prof-
its, tax breaks, and financial favors from the deal. The Clintons denied any wrong-
doing, emphasizing throughout the investigation that they had in fact lost money on
the Whitewater venture.
In August 1994, Fiske was replaced as special prosecutor by Kenneth Starr, a
well-known conservative who had served as the solicitor general for the Justice
Department under President George H. W. Bush. At about this time, a former
Arkansas state employee named Paula Jones filed a sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton, charging that in 1991 he had ordered a pair of Arkansas state
troopers to escort her to a hotel room where then-governor Clinton had made
unwelcome sexual advances. Jones claimed that she filed her suit in an effort to
salvage her reputation after conservative journalist David Brock had published an
article naming Jones as a participant in one of Clinton’s many extramarital affairs.
Meanwhile, in July 1995, 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky joined the White House
staff as an unpaid intern, and in November 1995 she took a paid position at the White

\
House Office of Legislative Affairs. Two days later, a sexual relationship between the
President and. Lewinsky began during the government furlough. According to later
testimony, the affair continued intermittently for the next 18 months.
In May 1996 the first Whitewater trial ended, and both of the McDougals were
convicted of fraud. A month later, a Senate hearing on Whitewater ended inconclu-
sively. Shortly thereafter, Starr announced that he would step down, but four days
later he suddenly changed his mind and decided to continue his investigations. It
soon became clear that Starr had shifted the focus of his investigation from a con-
cern with financial affairs to an interest in intimate ones. Following on the heels of
a story published in Newsweek magazine detailing the president’s alleged sexual
advances toward White House staffer Kathleen Willey, Lewinsky was subpoenaed
in December 1997 by lawyers for Paula Jones; in a sworn affidavit, Lewinsky
denied having an affair with the president. Soon thereafter, Lewinsky confidante
Linda Tripp turned over to Starr over 20 hours of taped telephone conversations
with the unwitting Lewinsky that contained admissions of Lewinsky’s sexual rela-
tions with the president. In January 1998, Matt Drudge published Lewinsky’s name
on his website, as well as a report that Newsweek had obtained the Tripp-Lewinsky
tapes but had pulled a story about them under pressure from Starr, who feared it
would jeopardize his investigation. On January 21, 1998, following a Washington
Post report on his relationship with Lewinsky, Clinton told a television interviewer
that “there is no improper relationship.” One week later, before an invited media
audience at the White House, Clinton insisted, “I want you to listen to me. I did not
have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.”
Several months later, Lewinsky’s lawyers struck an immunity deal with Starr, in
which she agreed to provide “full and truthful testimony” in exchange for full immunity
from prosecution. For the next 15 days, Lewinsky was questioned by the grand jury.
Shortly thereafter, the president was asked to provide a blood sample for DNA testing
to determine if it was a match with semen stains found on a blue dress Monica Lewinsky
had kept in her closet following a sexual encounter with the president. Two weeks later,
President Clinton admitted to the grand jury that he had had “inappropriate intimate
contact” with Ms. Lewinsky, although he continued to hold that his earlier statements
had been accurate, explaining at one point that his answer to the question about the
nature of his relationship with Lewinsky “depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.”
In September 1998, Starr submitted his report to Congress, and despite its
graphic sexual content, the report was immediately posted on the congressional
website, with particularly salacious portions reprinted in newspapers and on web-
sites around the world. One month later, the House of Representatives voted to hold
an impeachment inquiry. In November Clinton settled the Jones lawsuit for
$850,000 without acknowledging guilt. In December, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee approved four articles of impeachment. The full House approved two of the
articles, and Clinton became only the second sitting president in the history of the
United States to be impeached. The Senate trial began in January 1999, and a
month later the President was acquitted.
The Clinton-Lewinsky scandal spawned widespread reconsideration of the
meaning and extent of privacy rights in the contemporary United States. Through-
out the ordeal, many suggested that the real scandal lay not in the fact that the pres-
ident had had an extramarital affair, but rather in the invasion of the president’s

Clipper and Capstone chips
\
101
privacy by the independent counsel’s office and the media. While scandals are
nothing new in U.S. politics—nor is the tendency for presidents from Jefferson to
Kennedy to stray from the terms of the marital oath—the Clinton-Lewinsky scan-
dal set a new standard in terms of the public’s sense of its right to know personal
details about public figures.
In the wake of the scandal, no clear consensus emerged about who to blame for
the breakdown of respect for the principle of privacy. Special Prosecutor Starr was
frequently chastised in the media for his tactics, which included the subpoena of
records of sale from a local Washington, D.C., bookstore and the reliance on meth-
ods of intimidation in interrogating Lewinsky. Such seeming abuses of prosecuto-
rial discretion led to calls for a repeal of the statute authorizing special prosecutors,
as well as demands to curtail prosecutorial discretion in an investigation of sexual
harassment charges.
The media was charged with violating privacy as the scandal unfolded. The
president’s affair with Lewinsky dominated headlines in the mainstream media for
an extended period, leading to complaints that journalists had abdicated their
responsibility to guard the public interest. The scandal also raised concerns about
the growing influence of alternative and nontraditional media, including web-based
news sites such as the Drudge Report and AM-frequency talk radio stations, which
appeared to hold themselves to lower standards of verification and professional
comportment when gathering and reporting the news than had been expected of
more traditional news outlets.
Throughout the scandal, the feminist movement was frequently identified as a
cause of the breakdown of privacy norms in the United States, with second-wave
feminism’s embrace of the motto “the personal is political” held culpable for the
corrosion of the boundary between public and private. At the same time, many
self-described feminists rose to Clinton’s defense, urging chastened members of
the movement to rethink the meaning and limits of the imperative to politicize
the personal, and to dedicate themselves to re-conceptualizing privacy rather than
abandoning the ideal altogether.

Clipper and Capstone chips
On April 16, 1993, just a few months after President William J. Clinton took
office, the White House proposed the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) for the

102
Clipper and Capstone chips
\
encryption of voice, fax, and computer information transmitted over circuit-
switched telephone systems. EES was to be used for the protection of sensitive but
unclassified information. The standard, which was nominally a National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) effort, included a tamper-proof hardware
encryption chip (Clipper) and a key-escrow system. Each hardware chip would
have its own key; these keys were to be split and registered at birth—escrowed—
with two agencies of the U.S. government (NIST and the Department of Treasury
Automated Systems Division were the initial escrow agencies). In other words, this
was an encryption system in which the federal government held the private keys.
Keys would be released to law enforcement agents armed with proper authoriza-
tion. This would enable law enforcement to decrypt intercepted communications.
A more advanced chip, Capstone, included additional cryptographic components
for authentication and integrity checking: Clipper plus a public-key key exchange
algorithm, the Secure Hashing Algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard, a high-
speed exponentiation engine, and a random number generator.
EES—or Clipper, as it came to be known—is a method for encrypting voice and
fax communications that enables easy decryption for legally authorized wiretaps.
Such a description badly misses the point. In 1993 the world was on the verge of a
communications revolution. Protocols for easy access and display of information
on the Internet had been developed and were being deployed. This network had
been opened for commercial traffic. The World Wide Web was about to burst forth.
In very short order, the Internet was transformed from a medium used primarily for
scientific communications to a major player in world economic activity. The
Escrowed Encryption Standard, which provided a government backdoor into
encrypted communications, was proposed at a crucial moment.
The Clipper program was voluntary, but there were many objections anyway. In
particular, there was public concern that the U.S. government might seek to prevent
the use of non-escrowed systems. In response, the White House stated that there was
no intent to require key escrow. Executive Branch activities belied that statement. The
U.S. Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), first pro-
posed in 1992 and eventually passed in 1994, required that digitally switched tele-
phone networks be built according to wiretapping standards determined by the U.S.
Department of Justice. In 1992 National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft described
the digital-telephony bill as a “beachhead [that] we can exploit for the encryption fix.”
The government posited that Clipper was an encryption system providing both
security and privacy, while enabling government access under legal authorization;
however, there were immediate objections to the government’s key-escrow pro-
posal. Of the 320 letters submitted to NIST regarding the Clipper proposal, all but a
handful were negative. Civil liberties organizations expressed concerns about
threats to privacy. Computer security experts observed that the establishment of
escrow agencies was a dangerous concentration of resources, and thus that Clipper
diminished rather than increased security. Business, unhappy with export controls
on encryption, did not find EES a useful substitute. Nonetheless, in 1994 EES
became an official federal information processing standard.
The Escrowed Encryption Standard specifies the use of Skipjack, an encryption
algorithm developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), and the creation of
a Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) to be implemented on a tamper-proof

Clipper and Capstone chips
\
103
hardware device. Skipjack uses 80-bit keys, and initially specifics of the algorithm
were not made public. Each Clipper chip has an 80-bit device-unique key used by
the escrow system.
When two participants with Clipper-enabled telephones establish a connection,
they set up a “session key” for that communication, including a phone call and a
fax transmission. This session key is used to encrypt the communication. This key
is passed to the Clipper chip of the device doing the communicating, which
encrypts it using the chip’s device-unique key. This information is combined with
the chip’s identifier and other information to form the LEAF, or Law Enforcement
Access Field, and is shipped to the other participant’s device. The system is set up
so that only if the LEAF decrypts properly can encrypted communications begin.
The communication is encrypted with the session key; because the two participants
know the key, they can communicate securely. An eavesdropper would need the
device keys in order to decrypt the communication. Given the setup of the system,
law enforcement would have access to the keys under authorization.
In a strong algorithm, each additional bit of key length increases the security by
a factor of two, so unless the government’s backdoor escrowed keys were used for
decryption, data encrypted using Skipjack was nominally 224—or 16 million—
times more secure than data encrypted using the Data Encryption Standard, the
1977 federal standard for protecting secure but unclassified data. The increased
security was one reason the government hoped for a strong positive reaction to
EES. This was not to be. Just months after EES was made into a standard, Matt
Blaze, a researcher at AT&T, discovered a way to defeat law enforcement access to
the keys during a Clipper-enabled communication (Blaze’s attack did not defeat the
EES encryption, just law enforcement access to the encryption keys). The attack
was easy to program and demonstrated that Clipper did not fulfill the government’s
claims of secure communications and easy government access (under proper legal
authorization).
Two years after the approval of EES, only AT&T was producing secure telephones
with Clipper chips. The company found few purchasers. U.S. business was not inter-
ested. Neither were foreign companies: the issue of law enforcement access to keys
for devices used outside the U.S. had never been fully worked out, and this contrib-
uted to foreign unease about Clipper. U.S. law enforcement bought some Clipper-
enabled phones but was not particularly enamored of the product. Despite extensive
U.S. government efforts to encourage other nations to adopt an escrowed approach
for encrypted civilian communications, there was little buy-in from abroad. Few
wanted secure communications with the U.S. government holding the keys.
Key escrow was part of a larger effort by the U.S. government to slow civilian
deployment of strong encryption. By the end of the 1990s, however, the U.S. gov-
ernment changed its direction. Seeing important advantages to the deployment of
strong cryptography throughout civilian infrastructure, the Clinton administration
simplified export-control laws and embraced the use of non-escrowed encryption
in the civilian sector, including the adoption of the Advanced Encryption Standard,
a strong, symmetric-key algorithm that replaced the aging—and much weaker—
Data Encryption Standard.

Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) is a federal
law passed in 1994 that creates a legal duty for all private telecommunications carri-
ers to ensure that all their equipment and networks have the capability to conduct
wiretaps if ordered to do so by the appropriate law enforcement agencies. The law
does not change the limitations and restrictions on wiretapping procedures origi-
nally set out in 1968 by Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act
and subsequently amended by other statutes, such as the Electronic Communica-
tion Privacy Act of 1986 and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Pro-
viding Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act
of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act). CALEA is codified at 47 U.S.C. 1001–1010.
CALEA is a significant milestone in the evolution of the relationship between
law enforcement agencies conducting wiretaps and the telecommunications indus-
try carrying out the communications the agencies seek to intercept. In this context,
a “wiretap” is defined as an interception of a communication’s content as well as
pen registers and trap-and-trace devices that seek to trace the destination of outgo-
ing and incoming calls. In 1969, immediately after Congress set out the rules gov-
erning wiretapping procedures, a telecommunications company refused to assist
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in conducting a wiretapping operation.
This refusal was upheld by a federal appellate court, and a few months later, Con-
gress amended the federal wiretapping statute to require all telecommunications
companies to assist law enforcement with any legal wiretapping activity. The new
amendment did not create any duty for these private companies to change or
upgrade their equipment or networks, primarily because the existing technology
used by the telecommunications companies at the time was able to adequately meet
the needs of law enforcement officials when they sought to conduct wiretaps.
This began to change during the revolution in telecommunications technology in
the 1980s and early 1990s, a revolution that included the gradual switch from ana-
log to digital telephony and the dramatic increase in the use of cellular telephones.
These emerging technologies posed new challenges to law enforcement agencies
seeking to wiretap telephone communications. For example, many cellular phone
networks had a limited capacity to conduct multiple wiretaps at the same time,
while speed dialing and voice-dialing features sometimes made it impossible to
trace the number that had been dialed. In response, Congress passed CALEA,
which required telecommunications companies to retrofit all of their equipment
and networks to ensure that the companies could, upon request, isolate and deliver
to law enforcement the content of communications as well as the destinations and
origins of all phone calls for a target telephone. The law also authorized payments

Communications Decency Act (CDA)
\
105
to the private companies to reimburse them for the costs of these upgrades, and the
companies were given four years to comply with the CALEA requirements.
On August 5, 2005, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued
new rules expanding CALEA’s reach to include certain broadband and voice-over
Internet Protocol (IP) services, even though such networks fall outside the tradi-
tional definition of “telecommunication carrier.” The FCC argued that these net-
works were increasingly being used as replacements for local telephone usage, and
so CALEA requirements had to be imposed in order to maintain the ability of law
enforcement to conduct effective wiretaps. This move was not without controversy,
as numerous privacy groups claimed that CALEA did not and should not be used to
cover Internet communications.

Communications Decency Act (CDA)
The Communications Decency Act (CDA) was Title V of the United States
Telecommunication Act of 1996. As passed by Congress, Title V affected the
Internet and online communications in two significant ways. First, it attempted to
regulate both indecency and obscenity in cyberspace that could be available to chil-
dren. Second, Section 230 of the act declared that operators of Internet services
were not to be construed as publishers, and thus were legally liable for the words of
third parties who used their services.
The CDA imposed broadcast-style content regulations on the open, decentral-
ized Internet and severely restricted the First Amendment rights of all Ameri-
cans. There was strong opposition to this legislation because it threatened the
very existence of the Internet as a means for free expression, education, and
political discourse.
The most controversial portions of the CDA were those relating to indecency
and obscenity on the Internet. The relevant sections of the act were introduced as a
response to fears that Internet pornography was on the rise. Indecency in television
and radio broadcasting had already been regulated by the Federal Communications
Commission: broadcasting of offensive speech was restricted to certain hours of
the day, when minors were supposedly least likely to be exposed. Violators could
be fined and potentially lose their licenses. The Internet, however, had only
recently been opened to commercial interests by the 1992 amendment to the
National Science Foundation Act and thus was not addressed by many previous
laws. The CDA, which affected the Internet and cable television, marked the first
attempt to expand regulation to this new sphere.
The CDA prohibited posting “indecent” or “patently offensive” materials in a
public forum on the Internet, including web pages, newsgroups, chat rooms, and
online discussion lists. The CDA, however, was not about child pornography,
obscenity, or using the Internet to stalk children since these activities were already
illegal under current law. Free speech advocates, however, worked diligently and

106
Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II) and Secure Flight
\
successfully to overturn the portion relating to indecent, but not obscene, speech.
They argued that speech protected under the First Amendment, such as printed
novels or the use of the “seven dirty words,” would suddenly become unlawful
when posted to the Internet. Critics also claimed the bill would have a chilling
effect on the availability of medical information.
In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 12, 1996, a panel of federal judges
blocked part of the CDA, saying it would infringe upon the free speech rights of
adults. On July 29 a U.S. federal court struck down as too broad the portion of the
CDA intended to protect children from indecent speech. A year later, on June 26,
1997, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court’s decision in Reno v. American
Civil Liberties Union, stating that the portion concerned was an unconstitutional
abridgement of the First Amendment right to free speech because it did not permit
parents to decide for themselves what material was acceptable for their children,
extended to noncommercial speech, and did not define “patently offensive,” a term
with no prior legal standing.

Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II)
and Secure Flight
The Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II) was devel-
oped by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) to allow the comparison of airline passenger names with
names in private- and public-sector databases to assess the level of risk a passenger
might pose. The program’s goals bore a strong resemblance to the Multi-State
Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange Program (MATRIX), which is run by a
private company and sponsored by many states, but CAPPS II served the more lim-
ited mission of supporting airline security. When privacy and effectiveness issues
were widely raised, former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge announced
his intention to dismantle the program in July 2004. The program was dismantled,
reinvented, revised, and reintroduced as Secure Flight in September 2004.
The Secure Flight program embodies the layered strategy employed by DHS
to secure air traffic safety by using several levels of security to protect air passen-
gers. The Secure Flight program includes use of federal air marshals, federal
flight deck officers, and a streamlined version of the CAPPS II database-comparison
methodology. The CAPPS II component of the program requires TSA to conduct
preflight comparisons of airline passenger information with federal government
watch lists. 
With Secure Flight, passenger name records from domestic flights are compared
to names maintained by the terrorist screening database in the newly named Office

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986
\
107
of Transportation Vetting and Credentialing (DHS/TSA 2004). This database
includes the “no-fly” and “selectee” lists of persons known or suspected to be
engaged in terrorist activity. Secure Flight compares these two lists for the exclu-
sive purpose of identifying suspected terrorists. Information on passengers is dis-
seminated on a strictly need-to-know basis. A redress mechanism for alleged abuse
is included within the program. Further, no Privacy Act of 1974 exemptions are
invoked under the revamped program, and passenger name records are released to
individuals who request them. Homeland Security has embraced these precautions
and changes in order to address the privacy concerns that befell the CAPPS II and
MATRIX Programs.

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986
Information technology has become very valuable to businesses and government
alike. Interconnectivity allows different computers to communicate over a seam-
less web, sending packets of data that comprise databases and files. However, many
companies are losing millions of dollars through unauthorized access, interception,
and fraudulent dissemination of proprietary information. Such unauthorized access
can lead to computer fraud and a variety of other computer crimes, commonly
referred to as “hacking.” The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC 1030
(CFA), criminalizes unauthorized access into or theft of protected computer data
and thus helps preserve rights to privacy.
Companies use various security devices to protect their ability to collect, store,
retrieve, and disseminate information. Companies also use computers to collect
and maintain personally identifiable information about their customers in order
to verify identities, such as Social Security numbers, home phone numbers, fin-
gerprints, and voiceprints. The positive effect of collecting personal data is that it
reduces infringement and computer abuse. The negative effect is that such informa-
tion cannot only reveal the identities of persons, but it can also track individuals’
activities and habits.
Service providers, such as Internet service providers (ISP), telephone compa-
nies, and cable companies, maintain and often sell proprietary information about
subscribers and customers. Such information includes bank account numbers,
driving records, criminal background, employment history, and credit history, all of
which can be sold to third parties without the knowledge or consent of subscribers
and customers. Much of this information is collected as part of legitimate business
activity and stored in centralized computers; it is often more expensive to delete
these pieces of information than to maintain them.

108
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986
\
There is a growing concern about dissemination of private facts about persons to
third parties and the ability to develop profiles of persons through compilation of
information retained in computer databases. Previously, this information was
decentralized and posed little risk. Today, however, as industries converge or data
services are outsourced to private companies, much of this information is stored on
centralized computers and more readily accessible by law enforcement for a variety
of reasons.
The CFA covers computer espionage, theft of specific types of information,
computer trespass, computer fraud, damage to a protected computer, trafficking in
passwords, and computer extortion. The act has broad coverage and is designed to
prevent access to classified national defense or foreign relations information, finan-
cial information or consumer-reporting agency records, information on a computer
operated on behalf of the United States, and any computer used in interstate or for-
eign commerce.
There are four general elements necessary to establish a violation under this act.
First, there must be unauthorized access. Unauthorized access includes someone
who steals another’s identity to hack into a protected computer. It can also include
access by someone who would otherwise have authority to access a computer net-
work, but who exceeds that authority. Second, the perpetrator must intend to hack
into the system or to gain access. Intent to harm or cause damage is not required for
prosecution under the act. Third, the perpetrator must access a protected computer.
Protected computers include all government computers, computers operated on
behalf of the government, computers used in interstate or foreign commerce or
communications, financial institution computers, and foreign computers. In short,
almost any computer is covered under the act. Finally, the perpetrator’s actions
must cause some damage. The damage element can be satisfied if the actions
impair the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or affect informa-
tion such that costs exceeds $5000 in one year; impair medical records, regardless
of the value; cause physical injury to a person, regardless of value; or threaten pub-
lic health and safety.
The statute was first tested in United States v. Morris, 928 F.2d 504 (1991), 502
U.S. 817 (1991). Robert Tappan Morris was a computer programmer with autho-
rized access to government computers who introduced a software worm into the
system that spread to and damaged computers at numerous installations, including
leading universities, military sites, and medical research facilities. In response to a
defense that Morris was authorized but merely exceeded his authority, the Supreme
Court held that the scienter or “intentional” requirement of the statute applied only
to the access—the corresponding damage, however unintentional, still satisfied the
statute.
In 1996 the act was amended to codify the rule. Today, a person is liable under
the statute who (1) knowingly engages in conduct that intentionally causes damage,
(2) engages in intentional access that recklessly causes damage or (3) engages in
intentional access that causes damage. The statute applies to unauthorized access
as well as to instances in which someone exceeds his or her authority.
After September 11, 2001, Congress passed the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) in part in order to expand the law

Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988

enforcement and investigative tools available under CFA. Specifically, the act was
designed to include “cyberterrorism” offenses that might threaten public health or
safety, and authorized the U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI), and other agencies already empowered under CFA to investigate com-
puter fraud. In addition, under the revisions, the length of punishments was
increased up to 20 years, and the term “damage” was broadened to mean “any
impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or informa-
tion.” However, under the revised statute, damage that resulted from “the negligent
design or manufacture of computer hardware, computer software, or firmware”
was no longer actionable.
Under the revised CFA, the damage element requiring a minimum of a $5,000
loss impairment can “include any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost
of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the
data, program, system, or other information to its conditions prior to the offense,
and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred by an
individual or corporation because of interruption of service.” Subsequent cases
have used these broader standards to assess culpability in civil cases to limit access
to data or systems, such as commercial espionage as well as hacking into a city’s
emergency communication system or a hotel and airline communication systems.

Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988
The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (CMPPA)
amended the Privacy Act of 1974 by adding provisions that federal agencies must
implement when performing computerized comparisons of certain collections of
administrative records. Such a comparison seeks to identify an individual who
appears on two lists but should not, or who, appearing on one list, should not
appear on a second.
Computer matching first came to public attention in 1977 following an initia-
tive called “Project Match,” in which the then Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare (HEW) compared recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Chil-
dren (the major federal welfare program) with federal payroll records, intending to
identify individuals improperly collecting both welfare payments and a govern-
ment paycheck. Although the comparison yielded 33,000 “raw hits,” only 35 con-
victions resulted, all for minor offenses with less than $2000 in fines. The program
was criticized not only for its lack of financial gain compared to the costs, but also
because it caused some payments to be interrupted based solely on a raw hit, with-
out verification by a human being or due process controls.

110
Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988
\
These concerns continued throughout the 1980s, and the CMPPA was enacted
to address some of them. However, CMPPA does not prohibit any particular type
of matching program. Instead, it adds procedural safeguards for matches that
seek to establish or verify an individual’s eligibility for federal benefit or loan
programs, recoup payments or delinquent debts arising from these programs, or
compare federal personnel or payroll systems with other federal or state records.
The CMPPA does not: cover matches designed to produce aggregate statistical
data; support research where the results will not be used to make adverse deci-
sions about the subjects; advance a criminal investigation of a named subject,
foreign counterintelligence purpose, or background investigation for a security
clearance; conduct tax administration; or, perform routine personnel administra-
tion. In addition, it does not cover matches where an agency uses only its own
records.
As a statute amending the Privacy Act, CMPPA only applies to systems of
records as defined by that act: collections of records about U.S. citizens or legal,
permanent resident aliens, in the custody of a federal agency, connected to an iden-
tifier of the individual, and retrieved by that identifier. The major provisions of the
CMPPA require an agency to: conclude an agreement with a partner matching
agency describing the records that will be matched and the procedures to be fol-
lowed before, during, and after the match; analyze the costs and benefits of match-
ing programs; publish notice of new matching programs in the Federal Register;
include individual notices to potential subjects of a match at the time of collecting
information; conduct independent verification of “hits;” and, notify individuals and
provide them the opportunity to refute any adverse information before denying or
terminating a benefit or loan. The CMPPA also requires agencies participating in
matching programs to set up data integrity boards to oversee the programs, and
assigns the Office of Management and Budget to provide guidance, assistance, and
oversight to the other federal agencies.
In 1990, Congress enacted Computer Matching and Privacy Protection amend-
ments to clarify details of the due process provisions of the original CMPPA. These
amendments permit an agency to substitute its own due process and independent
verification procedures following computer matching if its procedures are similar
and were in existence and working well prior to passage of CMPPA. For example,
a program that provides monthly payments to beneficiaries and has been relying on
an advance-notice period shorter than the 30 days required by CMPPA would be
permitted to take adverse action after the shorter period in order to avoid making
overpayments.

Computers
Most computer users entrust their respective computers with vast amounts of very
sensitive and personally identifiable information. Even if such computers are
never connected to any network, such as the Internet or even a local network, they
retain that sensitive information long after the user thinks that it was deleted. When a
computer is connected to a network, be it the Internet or some internal corporate or
other network, it is as if there were a person sitting right behind the user, taking pre-
cise notes of everything that the user does with the networked workstation.
Computer hard disks contain mirrors of people’s lives. Electronic mail, love let-
ters, tax returns, and privileged communication with lawyers are all saved in the
computer for the user’s benefit and, unless the user take measures to protect his or
her privacy, for the benefit of anyone who steals the computer or of any computer
forensics investigator. In a business setting, proprietary information, marketing
plans, and lists of current and prospective clients constitute every commercial busi-
ness’s lifeblood. If these fall into competitors’ hands, the commercial entity will
likely go bankrupt; if it is a publicly held company, its stockholders will claim neg-
ligence and will rightly sue. Similarly, in a medical setting, healthcare profession-
als are legally required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996 (HIPPA) to safeguard the confidentiality of patient data under pen-
alty of jail time in many cases. Government users of computers are similarly
required to ensure that the data entrusted to them cannot fall into unauthorized
hands.
Despite all the foregoing, the reality of life is that laptops do get forgotten in
taxicabs and airplanes, and almost all computers are eventually sold, donated, recy-
cled, or thrown in the trash. At a minimum, computers regularly get sent to repair
shops, almost invariably with their hard disks in place. What about the sensitive
data in those hard disks? Law enforcement has been quite successful in promulgat-
ing the self-serving fiction that only criminals with something to hide would have
an interest in ensuring that sensitive data in their computers are rendered inaccessi-
ble by all others. In fact, quite the opposite is true: individuals and organizations
can be held legally liable for failing to ensure that sensitive data cannot be accessed
by third parties. It is technically impossible to hide data from all except law enforc-
ers; as such, one must either hide it from all or from nobody. Given the legal obli-
gations of businesses, individuals, and professionals to prevent unauthorized
disclosure of sensitive data, a computer user must hide sensitive data from all.
Achieving this result is very difficult.
And if that were not difficult enough, computer users and owners have to
worry about new vulnerabilities introduced by the fact that most new computers,
especially laptops, come with an already enabled wireless connectivity known as
“Wi-Fi.” In the default, unmodified mode, as soon as such a laptop is turned on, it
dutifully searches for and tries to establish communications with any commercial
or private Wi-Fi “access point.” A rogue access point nearby can then connect with
such a laptop and access all its files. Similarly, if any Wi-Fi–enabled laptop user

112
Computers
\
connects to the Internet through a legitimate access point at an airport, coffee shop,
or hotel, all communications can be readily intercepted by another suitably config-
ured laptop nearby; worse yet, a suitably configured laptop can masquerade as the
legitimate wireless access point to which the hapless user wants to connect, and
then act as a go-between connecting the unsuspecting user and the legitimate Wi-Fi
access point, thereby intercepting all traffic to and from the unsuspecting user. In
short, the privacy threat extends far beyond the concern of unauthorized access to
computer files. Remote interceptors can gain access to a computer and files
through wireless paths that are enabled by default—for the convenience of the
user—by computer manufacturers.
As far as the confidentiality of the files that reside in the computer is concerned,
even if the computer owner went to the heroic measures needed to make a sensitive
file truly disappear from magnetic media, there is a high likelihood that copies and
earlier versions of that file would exist in numerous other places in the same mag-
netic media; these copies can have unrecognizable names and/or have names that
are invisible in the normal default directory lists. To make things worse, chances
are that there will be fragments of earlier copies of files scattered all over the user’s
magnetic media. Furthermore, even though the computer’s screen and printer show
the latest version of a document, the electronic version of it in the computer will
most likely contain the full history of how it evolved from the very first draft
onward, and this history can be seen by anyone with the know-how.
Unbeknownst to the user, most Windows-based applications create temporary
files on the hard disk at unadvertised locations and use unrecognizable names, so
that should the computer crash for any reason such as a power failure, the user will
not have lost the file he or she had created. Since Windows and its application soft-
ware are not clairvoyant and cannot tell if a computer will crash or not, they usually
create and save such temporary files; if the computer does not crash—as is usually
the case—these temporary files remain in the computer. Additionally and indepen-
dently, Windows stores information about a user’s computer activities in numerous
files on the hard disk; most of these locations, such as the “Registry” and the
“Swap file” are very difficult to find and even harder to remove because they have
been merged with information that the computer needs to operate; if that entire
merged file were removed, the computer would not work at all.
In addition, the names of files created by the user are stored separately from the
files themselves. Even if the user manages to remove a file, its name will still be
discoverable and, if it is particularly revealing, could haunt the computer’s user.
Secure deletion of any one file and its name is not a simple proposition; it must be
viewed only as part of the secure cleanup of an entire disk and never as just the
secure removal of the latest copy of a single file. It follows that what must be elim-
inated is not just a sensitive file itself, but also copies of the file that have been cre-
ated by the computer’s software as well as all information about that file, such as
the file’s name (ideally chosen to be nondescript and not incriminating), the date it
was created, the date it was last accessed, the date it was renamed, and the folder it
was moved from and to—all of which are stored separately on the computer’s hard
disk.
Using the “delete” command to remove a file achieves absolutely nothing. The file
remains in the disk and is merely marked as “no longer wanted.” Using “format” or

Computers
\
113
even the “fdisk” partitioning command does not remove sensitive files either. The
only way to remove a sensitive file and its separately stored name and date stamp is
to overwrite them. Overwriting a known file is easy, assuming that there is only one
copy with no temporary or other copies of it, and no evidence of it in the many
system-level files used by Windows; unfortunately, copies of the file and of seg-
ments of that file are typically stored by Windows all over the hard disk. 
“Disk wiping,” or the process of overwriting all sensitive data on a hard disk so
that such data cannot be retrieved by others, is a very complex business. Windows
offers no means for users to overwrite their sensitive files; rather, Windows makes
it extremely difficult to remove sensitive files because of the many ways that it
leaks sensitive information into assorted obscure places in the computer’s storage
media. As a result, numerous software packages have evolved that have varying
degrees of success in eliminating sensitive data from computers. The problem is
that even the best of them do not work very well for the following technical rea-
sons: (1) Windows and Windows-based application software create and use files
that cannot be removed from within Windows (e.g., the Swap file) while Windows
is running; (2) disk-wiping software has no way of knowing which legitimate-looking
files created by assorted application software should be eliminated; (3) disk-wiping
software usually does not touch the Registry files—yet this is precisely where,
for example, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer stores the user’s web-browsing activ-
ity; (4) Windows stores the names of files and data about those files in a different
place than the files themselves, and treats those names differently even if a file has
been deleted; and (5) the typical high capacity hard disks of today come with a
number of sectors held in reserve. When a data-containing sector in the disk is
deemed by the hard drive’s “smart” firmware to be marginal (e.g., when there are
occasional errors in reading the data from it), the hard disk’s own firmware copies
the data from the marginal sector to one of the sectors held in reserve, assigns the
logical address of the marginal sector to the new sector where those data were cop-
ied, and “mothballs” the marginal sector without overwriting the data in it after
those data were copied onto the new sector.
No disk-wiping software can touch the now-mothballed sector, since it no
longer has an address and hence it does not exist as far as any software is con-
cerned. On the other hand, a forensics investigator with access to the disk drive
manufacturer’s firmware can readily access those sectors and all data in them.
Disk wiping, then, is a very complicated task, and all software that purport to do
it fail quite miserably. Particularly because of reason five above, computer users are
advised not to depend on any such software for wiping hard disks clean, and are
encouraged to physically destroy the storage media before selling, donating, or dis-
posing of magnetic storage media. The only secure fix is to physically destroy the
magnetic media. Given the low cost of hard disks today, there is no excuse for not
destroying the old one and getting a new one if the user is concerned about the con-
fidentiality of computer data contained in the old hard disk.
Unlike conventional analog data, such as the shade of grey or the subjective rec-
ollection of a witness, digital data that takes one of two very unambiguous values
(zero or one) is misperceived by the average person as being endowed with intrin-
sic and unassailable truth. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Unlike tampering with
conventional analog data and evidence, which can often be detected by experts

114

\
with the right equipment, digital data can be manipulated at will and, depending on
the sophistication of the manipulator, the alteration can be undetectable regardless
of digital forensics experts’ competence and equipment. The potential for a miscar-
riage of justice is great, given that many defense lawyers, judges, and juries may be
unaware of the esoteric details of computer science. This aspect of digital evidence
may not be addressed by the computer forensics industry and by the prosecution,
both of which focus on the other aspects of the process of collecting, preserving,
and presenting digital data evidence, which are indeed unassailable, such as the
“chain of custody” portion of handling digital evidence.
A common example of computer evidence can illustrate this point. A suspect’s
hard disk is confiscated and subjected to forensics analysis; a report is generated
for the court stating that the hard disk contained certain files, with certain dates,
and that these files were renamed or printed on various dates, thereby negating the
suspect’s claim that he or she did not know of the existence of these files.
A typical judge or jury will accept these facts at face value. However, the data
found on someone’s hard disk (or other mass storage media) could indeed have
entered that hard disk through any one or more of the following ways without the
suspect’s knowledge, let alone complicity. For example, the hard disk may not have
been new when the suspect purchased it, and it may have contained files from
before the suspect took custody of it. This applies even in the case of purchases of
supposedly new computers, because they could have been resold after being
returned by a previous buyer. Spy-ware could have secretly installed unadvertised
files as well as a capability for the software maker to snoop on the individual’s
computer through the Internet. If this snooping capability were exploited by a
third-party hacker who routinely scans computers for this kind of back-door entry,
then files could be inserted on the suspect’s computer at will. Obtaining full control
of anyone’s computer through existing security flaws in its operating systems and
applications, especially its Internet Explorer, might allow anyone to insert files in it
without the knowledge of the owner. This can happen through an unsecured broad-
band Internet connection or a wireless access point. In addition, when a user
browses the Internet, it is not uncommon to mistype an address and end up inad-
vertently and unintentionally on an “adult” website. Alternatively, one can still end
up at an incriminating site because hackers have often doctored up entries in the
domain name servers (DNS), which amounts to doctoring-up the directory that is
accessed every time a user types the name of a website he or she wants to see.
Advertising in the form of pop-up ads, scrolling text, and images from unsavory
advertisers or purveyors of pornography may get stored (“cached”) in the hard disk
drive. Over a period of time, enough to these ads collect in the computers and
create the appearance of frequent activity. Of course, others in the household or
workplace could have visited websites that the owner did not patronize. Unsolic-
ited e-mail and their attachments can remain on a hard disk for some time. Few
users will go to the trouble of overwriting the offensive attachment because Windows
does not include any provision to overwrite anything. And even if a user did
attempt to overwrite a file with specially purchased software, the name of the file,
which could be quite incriminating in and by itself, would remain on the hard drive.
Computers crash sooner rather than later. The typical course of action is to
take the computer to a technician in an effort to access personal and business

data. Computer technicians, like other outsiders, have the opportunity to place data
into the repaired computer. A few years later, the owner of the computer is likely to
have forgotten about the repair altogether. Computer forensics examiners like to
substantiate their findings by pointing out the time/date stamp associated with dif-
ferent computer files. Yet, the time/date stamp, as well as every single bit of data in
a computer’s magnetic media can be altered undetectably with a disk editor. Addi-
tionally, images can be altered. Unlike images from conventional film-based pho-
tography, which can usually be identified as doctored by a competent investigator,
digital images (such as those taken by any surveillance camera) can be altered in a
manner that no expert can detect, as long as the alteration is done professionally
enough. Likewise, unlike analog sounds (e.g., the infamous gap in the tape record-
ing made during President Nixon’s term in office), where a careful study of the
background noise can detect alterations of analog recordings, digitized files of
sounds can be altered at will; if the alteration is done professionally enough, it will
be undetectable even by a forensics examination of the digital file.
The use of digital evidence has created a new phenomenon in today’s court-
rooms. Computers store more and more information about people’s lives and activ-
ities. This has resulted in an explosive increase in the use of computer forensics
techniques on confiscated or subpoenaed computers, based on the incorrect
assumption that what is in the computer is what the user put into it. An entire cot-
tage industry of computer forensics investigations has sprung up to service the
appetite for such services. The legal and societal problem with this situation is that
individuals in the legal and law enforcement professions may be unaware of at least
some of the many ways whereby the data they present as evidence are really not
evidence of anything because these data may have been placed in a computer with-
out the knowledge or complicity of the owner of the computer. In addition, evi-
dence that is based on a computer user’s Internet Service Provider’s records is,
similarly, evidence of nothing. A person’s Internet account can be accessed by third
parties without that person’s awareness or complicity, even if that person had been
the only one at home when the alleged Internet access occurred.
In the end, digital evidence should be viewed with extreme suspicion, regardless
of the competence or qualifications of the computer forensics expert witness.
While the chain of custody portion of how the evidence was handled may have
been impeccable, the raw digital data itself on which a forensics analysis was based
can be easily and undetectably tampered with by anyone with the right background.

Confessional culture
The term “confessional culture” is used to describe aspects of popular culture
and shifts in social relations taking place in the United States from the late twenti-
eth century to the present. At the heart of confessional culture lies a will to counte-
nance disclosures that infects everything from casual encounters between strangers
to popular television programs that revolve around intimate revelations. The mass
media plays an essential role in enabling and sustaining confessional culture by
providing a crucial venue for publicizing the personal. Most often used as a term of
aspersion, confessional culture is commonly associated with a breakdown in man-
ners and norms of propriety, as well as the proliferation of television and radio
shows that revolve around the disclosure of trivial, and often salacious, personal
details of private lives.
The term has been traced to Michel Foucault’s discussion of confession in The
History of Sexuality. Arguing that confession lies at the heart of Western concep-
tions of sexuality, Foucault suggests that confession forms the basis for Western
legal systems, medical practice, education, family connections, and romantic rela-
tions, and that social life is organized around institutions that rely on the confession
of crimes, sins, and desires to enable practices of normalization.
Foucault emphasizes the wide variety of social institutions implicated in the
confessional imperative, while the contemporary discourse of confessional culture
tends to privilege psychotherapy as the exemplary site of confession, one which
provides both a vocabulary and the implicit model for confession as it is enacted
interpersonally and in popular culture. The late twentieth century saw the emer-
gence of an array of television and radio programs that revolved around confession,
from daytime talk shows, to prime-time reality TV programs, to call-in radio
shows. These increasingly popular genres highlight the close connection between
the will to confess on the one hand and the rise of voyeurism as a dominant social
modality on the other. A confessional culture critically depends not just on subjects
who are willing to tell all, but also on the presence of an audience that regards rev-
elations as entertainment.
Confessional culture has been held accountable for a variety of social ills,
including the displacement of serious news and other programming by shows that
venerate disclosure above all else. The news media have been subject to special
sanction for encouraging the idea that the public has the right to know everything it
can about the private lives of public officials. Daytime talk shows using the style of
hosts such as Phil Donahue or Ricki Lake, where hosts ask personal questions and
guests share private and often intimate details, have been dismissed as modern-day
freak shows, and the ascendance of reality TV has been read as another sign of a
decline in public taste.
Confessional culture has also been linked to a breakdown in the social norms
that were seen at one time to provide welcome protection against violations of

Confidentiality
\
117
personal privacy, particularly against those who otherwise would extend overtures
of intimacy in an indiscriminate manner. The popularization of the phrase “too
much information” in the early years of the new millennium may be a sign of a
nascent backlash against such uninvited intimacies.
Those who defend confessional culture suggest that confession is a powerful
tool for challenging social norms and practices that “closet” or silence sexuality
and social deviance. The very distaste elicited by a confessional culture suggests
the transgressive power of revelation to break down established social norms and
force confrontations with ideas and people who are otherwise repressed or
silenced.

Confidentiality
Confidentiality is the state of having information kept secret. Confidentiality is
treating information as private and protecting it from unauthorized access, disclo-
sure, or publication. Confidentiality generally pertains to information that is not
generally available to the public. Maintaining confidentiality ensures that informa-
tion is accessible only to those authorized to access it and disclosed only to those
authorized to receive it. Confidentiality is an essential component of information
security.
Confidentiality is a term widely used to imply a sense of trust and secrecy
regarding information shared with another. Confidentiality also encompasses a
relationship of trust, loyalty, and reliance between two communicating parties. In a
confidential relationship, the disclosing party (discloser) expects the receiving
party (recipient) to protect and keep secret any shared information and disseminate
it to third parties only with the consent of the discloser or when required by law. In
a confidential relationship, a duty of confidentiality attaches, the breach of which
may be punishable by law. Confidentiality also embraces the ethical principles that
support certain professions in which relationships of trust are formed, such as med-
icine, law, and journalism.
Confidentiality is derived from the Latin word confidentia, or “confidence,” and
the Latin root fid or fidere, which means “faith.” “Confidence” and other forms of
the word have been in use since the fifteenth century with semantics related to the
idea of trust. When information is shared within a relationship of trust and with an
expectation of secrecy, the recipient must take adequate precautions and safe-
guards to control and protect the information from access by or disclosure to any
other entity. While there may be written agreements between the discloser and
recipient to guarantee confidentiality, there is also an implied duty on the part of
the recipient to act in good faith to prevent any harm that may result from disclo-
sure of the information.
Confidentiality does not apply to all information shared with the expectation of
secrecy. For example, if an individual shares personal information with a friend or co-
worker, the obligation of confidence depends upon the circumstances, expectations,

118
Confidentiality
\
and personal relationship between the two individuals. However, in situations
where there are written contracts or agreements that govern information sharing
between two parties, there may be a duty to keep all information confidential.
These agreements can be legally enforced. Injunctive relief, monetary compensa-
tion, and other remedies may be available if the discloser can prove that the
recipient has made unlawful disclosures. Under exceptional circumstances, the
recipient can disclose confidential information if disclosure is mandated by court
order or statute. Information that is deemed confidential is not limited to written
documents. Confidentiality may extend to oral communications, video, voice
recordings, and any form of communication that was used to convey private
information. Ownership of the information generally resides with the discloser,
and permission may have to be obtained from the discloser for the recipient to
use the information.
In certain circumstances, where there is a special relationship between two par-
ties, additional rights may be granted by law to preserve the privacy of information
communicated between the two parties. This right to confidentiality is termed priv-
ilege and belongs to the discloser. Privileged communications are protected by law
from compelled disclosure in judicial proceedings. Some protected or privileged
associations include doctor-patient, attorney-client, priest-confessor, and husband-
wife relationships. The obligation to maintain confidentiality may also extend to
the recipient’s heirs, successors, and representatives. The concept of privilege is
much narrower than that of confidentiality.
In 1977 the U.S. Supreme Court, in Whalen v. Roe, indicated that confidentiality
or informational privacy was one of the two branches of the constitutional right of
privacy (the other being autonomy or decisional privacy). Other courts of appeal
have indicated that this constitutionally protected right of confidentiality may pro-
vide a discloser with a cause of action against the government for the wrongful dis-
semination of private or confidential information. However, in most cases, the
courts have not found the government liable.
Recognition of the duty of confidentiality can be found in several federal stat-
utes. For example, the Privacy Act of 1974 expressly mandates that federal agen-
cies “establish appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to
insure the security and confidentiality of records” as pertaining to individuals’
records that are collected and maintained by the agencies. The federal Freedom of
Information Act provides another example. It recognizes that confidential matters
should not be made public by government agencies.
The medical profession provides an example of confidentiality within a confi-
dential relationship. All newly licensed physicians take the Hippocratic Oath,
which requires physicians to protect the personal and private information of
patients. In short, medical ethics require that doctors keep patients’ personal or
health information confidential. In most instances, doctors must seek consent in
order to disclose a patient’s medical information to third parties. However, medical
confidentiality has become more problematic given the development of new health
care business models, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Now,
patient data is shared with more individuals and entities in the course of treatment
and payment for medical services than ever before. In addition, advances in infor-
mation technologies make it easier, faster, and more convenient to share patient

Confidentiality
\
119
information with relevant parties, thus increasing the possibilities for unauthorized
access and disclosure. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (HIPAA) contains provisions that protect a patient’s confidential informa-
tion by restricting some disclosures of health information without authorization.
The financial industry is required to comply with certain legal obligations to
protect the confidentiality and accuracy of the information it collects and dissemi-
nates. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires consumer-reporting agen-
cies to institute reasonable procedures to ensure “the confidentiality, accuracy,
relevancy, and proper utilization” of an individual’s financial, credit or other per-
sonally identifiable information. The Financial Services Modernization Act of
1999, also know as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), recognized that “each
financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the pri-
vacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those cus-
tomers’ nonpublic personal information.”
The employee-employer relationship may be a confidential one. In the context
of employment, an employee, potential employee, or business associate may have
access to information that is integral to the company’s existence. Such information
includes customer lists, financial performance, proprietary technology, and trade
secrets. A trade secret could be any process or practice that gives a company a
competitive advantage in an industry. Those who are privy to trade secrets may
have a legal obligation to keep them confidential, either by virtue of their confiden-
tial relationships or by contract. Every state recognizes some form of trade secret
protection, either through common law or statute (many states have adopted the
Uniform Trade Secrets Act). Trade secret law allows an owner of a trade secret to
prevent those who are bound either by a duty of confidentiality or by contract from
disclosing the trade secret to others.
A confidential relationship can be created by contract through a confidentiality
or nondisclosure agreement. Here, parties agree to protect the confidentiality of
trade secrets or other confidential information disclosed during employment or
business transactions. Breach of a confidentiality agreement is punishable by law.
Injured parties may request a court to stop further disclosures or otherwise com-
pensate them for the breach.
Under the principles of agency law, an employee owes duties of loyalty, obedi-
ence, and care to an employer. An employee cannot compete with his or her
employer in the same area of business, even if the employee works outside employ-
ment hours. In research institutions or in employment positions involving the devel-
opment of scientific or technological innovations, employees do not necessarily have
ownership rights to their work product. Employees may generate ideas for improving
existing work products or create brand new innovations and discoveries, both of
which may belong to their employer. Typically, employers execute the confidential-
ity, nondisclosure, and invention assignment agreements to protect a company’s
work product investment. Even in the absence of contractual obligations, state tort
law provides for causes of action to prevent an employee from exploiting specialized
skills obtained during the course of employment in order to benefit others.

Constitutional protections
The United States Constitution establishes a minimum of privacy to which gov-
ernment officials may add but from which they may not subtract. Louis Brandeis
and Samuel Warren, his co-author and law partner, are generally credited with intro-
ducing privacy as a legal concept in their heralded law review article published in
1890. That article focused on tort law, but decades later as a Supreme Court justice,
Brandeis spoke grandly of a constitutional “right to be let alone” in Olmstead v.
United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928).
Consistent with Brandeis’s proclamation, many popular accounts speak of a uni-
tary constitutional right of privacy. Supreme Court jurisprudence since Brandeis
wrote makes it more accurate and helpful to understand constitutional privacy ini-
tially in terms of two distinct sets of rights. One set, which includes the Fourth
Amendment’s ban against unreasonable searches and seizures, protects what may
be called informational privacy and restricts the government’s access to informa-
tion about an individual. Another set of rights, which includes the unenumerated
right of privacy at stake in the Court’s highly publicized abortion decisions, pro-
tects individual autonomy by giving individuals freedom to make certain decisions
about the course of their lives. It is true that informational privacy and individual
autonomy both entail an individual’s “right to be let alone” by government. But the
scope, constitutional basis, and debates over these two principles are sufficiently
distinct as to merit separate discussion.
I. Informational Privacy
The Constitution protects informational privacy by regulating the means by
which the government collects information. The Fourth Amendment bans unrea-
sonable searches and seizures and the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against self-
incrimination precludes any person from being “compelled in a criminal case to be
a witness against himself.”
At the outset, it is important to distinguish the method at work in these provi-
sions from another common method, which protects privacy by focusing on the
information’s subject matter. A legal regime might choose to designate certain sub-
jects as inherently private and as presumptively beyond the government’s purview.
The government could be prohibited or restricted from accessing or using informa-
tion about, for instance, an individual’s medical treatment, sexual orientation, or
religious affiliation. Much is to be said in favor of such an approach. Information
pertaining to such highly personal subjects is frequently irrelevant to any legitimate
public concern, its public disclosure can be extremely damaging to the individual,
and even the threat of disclosure can deter desirable conduct. Although some state

Constitutional protections
\
121
and federal privacy laws adopt the approach of designating private subject matters,
the Constitution’s provisions concerning informational privacy do not.
The Constitution instead restricts the means by which information about any sub-
ject may be collected. Provided that information is not obtained through proscribed
means, the government may use information everyone would regard as presump-
tively private. For example, that an individual has a highly embarrassing scar in an
intimate area is private in its subject matter. But when the government learns about
this fact from the voluntary statement of a third-party witness, the Constitution’s
protections of informational privacy do not bar the government from using this fact.
Conversely, the government may not obtain through proscribed means information
that no one would regard as “private” in its subject matter. The privilege against self-
incrimination, for example, permits a criminal suspect to refuse to answer whether
she or he murdered another person on a public street in broad daylight.
It is not clear that any single coherent theory underlies the Constitution’s protec-
tions of informational privacy. Consider the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against
self-incrimination. From one view, the privilege exists because of doubts about the
truthfulness of statements obtained through coercion. Even if this were the Fifth
Amendment’s rationale, it cannot explain the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth
Amendment does not rest on doubts over whether, for example, the illegal drugs
stashed in a person’s kitchen drawer are that person’s or whether a person’s authen-
tic beliefs are expressed in the private diary found next to the bedstead. If anything,
the information’s private location actually tends to strengthen rather than weaken
its reliability.
It is also problematic to link constitutional protections of informational privacy
with the notion that certain subjects are inherently private. The link cannot be a
direct one. As mentioned above, constitutional protections restrict access to public
information and permit access to private information. As an indirect protection of
private subject matters, informational privacy is not very effective. Informational
privacy, by itself, permits government to regulate any subject matter. By regulating
subject matters that might reasonably be thought private, government can generate
the justification needed to overcome Fourth Amendment barriers to accessing pri-
vate areas. Government can obtain information from sources other than through a
search, a seizure, or a compelled statement by a suspect. It may then use such infor-
mation to establish probable cause that a violation of law in question has occurred
and, if necessary, acquire a warrant to undertake a search or seizure or make an
arrest.
The home is the archetypal private place and is explicitly mentioned in the
Third and Fourth Amendments. Government nonetheless remains able to, and
uncontroversially does, enforce prohibitions against violence and abuse in the
home. Informational privacy likewise does not create an effective barrier against
regulation of activity occurring in the home that might reasonably be thought pri-
vate. Consequently, it is difficult to understand the Fourth Amendment’s restric-
tions on gathering information from homes as an indirect means of protecting the
private activities that occur there.
If the Fourth Amendment indeed does aim to protect private subject matters, then
it would seem that government must be precluded from regulating certain private
matters altogether. The Fourth Amendment, however, has not been so interpreted.

122
Constitutional protections
\
Instead of resorting to a unifying theoretical rationale, courts sometimes inter-
pret the Constitution’s protections in light of the particular governmental abuses the
founders had in mind.
The Fourth Amendment grew out of the colonists’ antipathy for the writs of
assistance used by the British to enforce revenue laws. These court-issued writs
authorized British officials to enter any house or other place to search for and seize
prohibited and untaxed goods. Once issued, a writ remained in force throughout the
lifetime of the sovereign and six months thereafter.
Construed narrowly as confined to this abuse, the Fourth Amendment condemns
only unlimited court-authorized searches. The Fourth Amendment’s text explicitly
addresses this abuse, requiring that warrants be based “upon probable cause, sup-
ported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,
and the persons or things to be seized.” The first clause of the Fourth Amendment,
however, does not confine itself to judicially authorized searches and seizures and
speaks more generally of the people’s right to be free of “unreasonable searches
and seizures.” The Supreme Court thus has interpreted the Amendment as address-
ing both warrantless and warrant-based searches and seizures.
The privilege against self-incrimination found in the Fifth Amendment devel-
oped as a reaction to the perceived excesses of the British Courts of Star Chamber,
which sat from 1487 to 1641. These courts required that accused persons answer
any and all questions put to them and became a vehicle for the suppression of polit-
ical dissent. By the eighteenth century, British law had rejected the inquisitorial
practice of the Star Chamber in favor of the principle that no man should be com-
pelled to accuse himself. It forbade the use of testimony compelled during trial or
obtained before trial through torture. Nine state constitutions had a privilege
against self-incrimination when the Fifth Amendment became law in 1791.
In determining the scope of the rights at stake as well as the remedies available
for their violation, the Supreme Court has taken explicit account of governmental
needs and has sought to strike a workable balance between those needs and infor-
mational privacy. Whether it has struck the appropriate balance and even used the
right methodology for doing so are matters of controversy. The Court’s work has
been respectably criticized for both giving too much and too little weight to the
interest of protecting informational privacy. In the limited space here, only the most
basic features of legal doctrine can be summarized. It is important to recognize that
the Fourth Amendment and the privilege against self-incrimination apply to actions
by governmental officials. They offer no protection whatever against invasions of
privacy perpetrated by private persons acting at their own behest.
The Fourth Amendment applies only to “searches and seizures.” In deciding
what this phrase comprehends, the Supreme Court generally has asked whether the
governmental action frustrates an expectation of privacy that society regards as rea-
sonable. Of course, persons have a justifiable expectation of privacy in the home,
so that, absent consent, entry into it and the area close by constitutes a search. Per-
sons also have a justifiable expectation of freedom of movement, so that an arrest
constitutes a seizure.
One interesting set of issues concerns the use of technology to discern activities
in the home. In United States v. Kyllo, 533 U.S. 27 (2001), the Supreme Court held
that thermal imaging of a home constitutes a search. The Court declared that the

Constitutional protections
\
123
use of technology to access information that could not otherwise be obtained with-
out entry into the home constitutes a search, at least when the technology is not in
widespread use. It also constitutes a search to eavesdrop electronically on phone
conversations originating in the home or even from a public phone booth unless
one party to the conversation has consented.
In contrast, the Supreme Court has held that it does not constitute a search for
law enforcement personnel to obtain a person’s bank records, rummage through
trash, use a pen register that records the phone numbers called, or electronically
track the location of an automobile driven on public streets. The reasoning in these
cases is that because the person has made this information accessible to third par-
ties, the person has no protectible expectation of privacy.
Searches and seizures require justification. The Fourth Amendment’s text provides
that searches and seizures must be reasonable, and that warrants may not issue without
probable cause. As some scholars have argued, this may be read to impose a general
requirement of reasonableness and then to specify that reasonableness necessitates
probable cause when a warrant is obtained. So read, the amendment generally requires
neither a warrant nor probable cause for warrantless searches and seizures. The
Supreme Court nonetheless has interpreted probable cause and issuance of a warrant as
the general benchmark of reasonableness across the board, not just for warrant
searches and seizures. The amendment thus embodies a preference for a warrant,
which must issue from a neutral magistrate or judge and contain a particularized
description of its scope. A warrantless search or seizure may be constitutional only if
fits into one of the exceptions that Court has recognized. Measured in terms of the real-
world conduct they encompass, the exceptions are broad. For instance, warrants are
often not required for searches and seizures involving automobiles, brief investigatory
stops, or “exigent circumstances” involving a risk of flight or destruction of evidence.
For both warrant-based and warrantless searches, the Fourth Amendment gener-
ally requires probable cause. As with the warrant requirement, the Supreme Court
has created exceptions. Some searches and seizures, such as administrative
searches of closely regulated businesses and investigatory stops require only rea-
sonable suspicion. Lesser justification is permissible, the Supreme Court has con-
cluded, by virtue of the more minimal intrusion into privacy or the atypical
governmental interests at stake. In a few areas, the Court has dispensed with a
requirement of individualized suspicion altogether. For instance, it has upheld ran-
dom stops near the border to check for aliens who have entered illegally, roadside
sobriety checkpoints to prevent drunk driving, and drug testing unrelated to law
enforcement in certain school and employment contexts.
A victim of Fourth Amendment violations has available two principal reme-
dies. First, if the person has been charged with a crime, evidence obtained as a
result of the violation may be excluded. This exclusionary rule has precipitated
much criticism because of its effect of withholding relevant evidence of guilt and
possibly letting the guilty go free. Historically, the Supreme Court has defended the
rule as necessary to deter violations or, to put the point somewhat differently, to elim-
inate an incentive to violate that would otherwise exist (although more recently the
Court found, in Hudson v. Michigan, that evidence seized even when this rule is vio-
lated may be admissible in court). In its core application, the rule precludes the pros-
ecution from introducing illegally obtained evidence as part of its case-in-chief.

\
Outside of this application, the Supreme Court has established a number of excep-
tions to the rule premised on a judgment that the rule would impose costs in excess
of any deterrent benefits in those applications. The exclusionary rule does not
apply: when evidence has been obtained through good faith reliance on a warrant;
when the prosecution seeks to impeach the accused’s own trial testimony; or, in
grand jury and deportation proceedings.
Second, a victim may sue governmental officials responsible for a Fourth Amend-
ment violation for money damages. Litigants seeking such damages must surmount
significant hurdles. As a practical matter, a person who in fact has committed crimi-
nal wrongdoing has great difficulty winning jury sympathy. In addition, individual
governmental officials are legally immune from damage liability unless it can be
shown that the law concerning the legality of their conduct was so specific and
clearly established that no reasonable person could view their conduct as legitimate.
The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prohibits civil and crim-
inal courts from requiring a witness to answer questions that might incriminate her or
him. It also prohibits law enforcement authorities from using coercion to induce a sus-
pect to confess involuntarily. In Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the
Supreme Court concluded that interrogation while in police custody is inherently coer-
cive. To dispel the inherent coercion, the suspect must be informed of the right not to
answer questions and the right to have an attorney if the suspect so desires.
The degree to which the privilege protects privacy is limited by the rule that it
does not generally allow documents to be withheld. The contents of documents, the
Supreme Court has reasoned, are not testimonial in nature, and the privilege does
not preclude government from requiring the disclosure of documents, presumably
including even private diaries. The privilege permits documents to be withheld only
when the government does not know of their existence, so that the very act of pro-
duction, in effect, would constitute an incriminating admission that they exist.
Remedies for violations of the privilege against self-incrimination and against
Miranda are similar to those available for Fourth Amendment violations. Money
damages may be recovered from the responsible officials subject to the same prac-
tical and legal obstacles present in the Fourth Amendment context. Evidence
obtained as a result of a confession coerced in violation of the privilege against
self-incrimination is subject to exclusion. Statements of the accused in violation of
Miranda are excluded but, in contrast with the Fourth Amendment context, evi-
dence derived from such statements—the so-called fruits of the violation—are not
subject to automatic exclusion. If police illegally seize a map revealing the location
of the murder weapon, which the police then retrieve, the weapon would be subject
to exclusion. But the weapon would not be excluded if a suspect reveals the
weapon’s location in statements obtained in violation of Miranda.
The ongoing War on Terror and technological developments raise new issues
that the law regarding informational privacy inevitably will come to address. The
War on Terror implicates the relationship between informational privacy and
national security. The Supreme Court has sought to accommodate the needs of
law enforcement through the definition of searches and seizures and through the
creation of exceptions to the warrant and probable cause requirements and the
exclusionary rule. It is certainly possible that the Supreme Court will relax nor-
mal Fourth Amendment requirements in the name of national security. As this

volume goes to press, for instance, it is known that the Bush administration has
engaged in electronic surveillance of communications between persons in the
United States, including citizens, and persons abroad suspected of involvement
with Al Qaeda. Based on the threat of terror from foreign terror groups, the
administration has argued that the Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant
and requires only reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause for such sur-
veillance. United States v. United States District Court, 407 U.S. 297 (1972),
rejected a national security exception to the warrant requirement in the context of
threats from wholly domestic groups. However, the Supreme Court studiously
left open whether such an exception exists respecting foreign-based threats.
Technology threatens to shrink privacy in two sometimes overlapping ways. First,
technologies such as electronic tracking, thermal imaging, face recognition, high res-
olution satellite photography, and information storage and retrieval greatly enhance
government’s ability to collect information. Second, Internet-based communication
such as electronic mail, list serves, chat rooms, discussion boards, and credit card
transactions multiply the circumstances in which individuals reveal information
about themselves to third parties in ways that may be stored and later accessed by
government. In other contexts, the Supreme Court has reasoned that by voluntarily
disclosing information to a third party for one purpose, individuals relinquish any
legitimate expectation of privacy respecting disclosure of the information to other
third parties for other purposes. A mechanical application of this logic would imply
that very little computer-based communication is subject to Fourth Amendment pro-
tection. The lower court case law and the scholarly commentary have just begun to
grapple with how to strike a constitutionally appropriate balance between privacy and
governmental needs in the computer age.
II. Individual Autonomy
In addition to limiting the government’s access to information, the Constitution
gives individuals a right to make certain choices about their lives. The First
Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech grants individuals a right to form
and express their own beliefs and, according to the Supreme Court, implies a “free-
dom to associate and privacy in one’s associations” (NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S.
44, 1958). The First Amendment’s religion clause makes religious belief princi-
pally a matter for individuals, not government, and gives them freedom to exercise
their religion as well as the freedom from governmental religious establishments.
This entry will not focus on these First Amendment rights but will instead address
the rights of autonomy the Supreme Court has recognized in the areas of sexuality
and family life. It is these rights, which are not enumerated in the Constitution’s
text, that have come to dominate discussions of and controversies over constitu-
tional privacy.
Like informational privacy, constitutionally protected areas of individual auton-
omy rely upon a principle of governmental noninterference. Autonomy, however,
requires noninterference of significantly greater scope. Constitutional protections
of informational privacy inhibit the government’s access to certain sources of
information, yet they do not by themselves preclude the government from regu-
lating any activity: other sources of information remain available. Government
may not enforce a criminal prohibition against abortion, for example, by coercing

126
Constitutional protections
\
an individual to incriminate herself or by searching her home without a warrant for
medical bills establishing that a suspect has had one. Insofar as the Constitution’s
protections of informational privacy are concerned, however, the government may
enforce an abortion prohibition by securing the testimony of the physician who
performed the abortion. In contrast, rights of autonomy preclude the government
from prohibiting the decisions and actions within those rights. The Supreme
Court’s abortion decisions do not permit government to completely prohibit
women from choosing to have early abortions.
In addition to denying government the authority to regulate certain activities,
autonomy implies a right of informational privacy as a corollary. Constitutional
rights of informational privacy inhibit access only to certain sources of informa-
tion. In contrast, rights of autonomy tend to render certain subjects of information
off limits. Of course, government may not use sources of information shielded by
the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination to pry into activity protected by a right of autonomy. But a right of
autonomy also tends to foreclose inquiry through other sources of information as
well. Because women have a constitutional right to abortion, government may nei-
ther obtain a Fourth Amendment warrant nor question witnesses about such a
choice unless it is relevant to some other subject that is a permissible object of gov-
ernment regulation. By tending to shield certain subjects from official inquiry,
rights of autonomy create an umbrella of privacy that is larger than that established
by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.
In press accounts and popular discussion, one often hears that the constitu-
tional right of privacy is a matter of some controversy. It is important to recog-
nize that there is no controversy over the existence of constitutional protections
of informational privacy that derive almost entirely from the rights specified in
the Constitution’s text. The scope of these protections is a matter of interpreta-
tion and argument, to be sure, but no one challenges their very existence. Simi-
larly, rights of autonomy are not in question insofar as they involve textually
specified rights such as the First Amendment’s protections of freedom of speech
and of religion.
In contrast, there is serious controversy over the existence of rights of autonomy
that do not derive from any specific right found in the Constitution’s text. In its
decisions pertaining to contraception, abortion, and homosexuality, the Supreme
Court has affirmed rights of individual autonomy that go considerably beyond tex-
tually specified rights. In his majority opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U.S. 479 (1965), Justice Douglas declared that a constitutional zone of privacy
derives indirectly from textually specified guarantees found in the First, Third,
Fourth, and Fifth Amendments. These specific guarantees, Justice Douglas opined,
“have penumbras, formed by [their] emanations.”
In more recent decisions, the Court has not relied upon Justice Douglas’s con-
cept of a penumbral right. Instead, it has located rights of autonomy in the Due Pro-
cess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. These rights cannot be derived even
indirectly from the text of that clause, which provides that “no State shall deprive
any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” The text evinces
a concern for the process alone. It permits the government to deprive individuals of
what is important to them, including life itself, as long as government provides the

\
127
process that is due. The Court nonetheless has looked beyond the purely procedural
orientation of the Due Process Clause’s text to incorporate a concept of “ordered
liberty” encompassing an individual’s right to control certain areas of life.
In doing so, the Court has unleashed a vigorous and interesting debate over the
existence of unenumerated constitutional rights generally. The Court’s critics maintain
the Constitution’s text and history provide no warrant for such rights. In their view, the
justices who recognize such rights necessarily rely upon their own subjective political
and philosophical predilections and engage in illegitimate judicial legislation.
Those who defend the existence of unenumerated rights can point to the text and
history of the Ninth Amendment and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. The Ninth Amendment provides that “the enumeration in
the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage oth-
ers retained by the people.” Its drafting and ratification history suggest that it
affirms the existence of unspecified rights. In the debates over ratification of the
original Constitution, the Anti-Federalists had argued that the original Constitution
should not be ratified because, unlike state constitutions, it did not contain a listing
of protected individual rights. In response, the Federalists maintained that any such
listing would be dangerous. A list, they argued, inevitably would be incomplete and
give rise to an inference that unlisted rights are unprotected. The most natural read-
ing of the Ninth Amendment is that it guards against this objectionable inference.
The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also can be
seen to recognize the existence of constitutional rights going beyond those specifi-
cally enumerated in the text. That clause prohibits states from abridging “the privi-
leges or immunities of citizens of the United States” but does not specify those
privileges. Senator Jacob Howard, who served as the Fourteenth Amendment’s
floor manager in the Senate, evidently understood the clause to protect rights not
specifically described in the Constitution’s text. He declared that the protected
privileges encompass “fundamental rights lying at the basis of society” whose con-
tent would be “discussed and adjudicated when they should happen practically to
arise.” Representative John A. Bingham, the principal author of that part of the
Fourteenth Amendment containing the Privileges and Immunities Clause, shared
this understanding. He held that the “privileges and immunities of citizens of the
United States are chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Constitution.”
In other words, the protected privileges include but are not limited to the rights the
text enumerates. These views were rooted in natural law philosophy. There were
undoubtedly physical laws regulating the universe that scientists had not yet speci-
fied but, with scientific progress, would so specify in future. So, too, the moral laws
regulating the universe were incompletely understood. It was important to leave
room for progress in the understanding of these moral laws and not to forever
freeze the list of fundamental rights.
Those who oppose the existence of unenumerated rights offer alternative expla-
nations of these provisions. The Ninth Amendment, they argue, means only that
states remain free to establish rights beyond those protected in the federal Constitu-
tion as a matter of their own law. As for the Privileges and Immunities Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment, they contend that Senator Howard’s and Representa-
tive Bingham’s natural law view was not widely enough shared to give it the force
of law.

128
Constitutional protections
\
Although it has chosen the Due Process Clause rather than the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of the Ninth Amendment as the source, the Supreme Court has
affirmed the existence of unenumerated constitutional rights in general and the
rights of personal autonomy in particular. In so doing, the Court has opened the
door to a controversy over the determination of their scope. Once the existence of
unenumerated rights or a right of autonomy is conceded, how does or should the
Supreme Court determine what it encompasses? The Court obviously cannot deter-
mine the scope of an unenumerated right simply by consulting the Constitution’s
text. Nor would many modern thinkers contend that fundamental rights are await-
ing discovery in a natural moral order accessible through reason or intuition.
In fixing the scope of the unenumerated right of autonomy, the Supreme Court
has used different approaches. Some cases purport to rely on societal tradition. In
Washington et al. v. Glucksberg et al., 521 U.S. 702 (1997), for instance, the Court
insisted that “fundamental rights and liberties [be] . . . ‘deeply rooted in this
Nation’s history and tradition.’” The Court declined to recognize a fundamental
right to physician assisted suicide, finding no established tradition in support of this
practice. The emphasis on tradition often is linked to unease with unenumerated
rights and reflects a strategy for limiting their import. Opponents of unenumerated
rights, such as Justice Scalia, point to the danger that the unelected Supreme Court
justices will give their own subjective notions the force of constitutional law.
Opponents seek to limit judicial subjectivity by requiring that any claimed right
find overwhelming support in the enactments of legislatures and judicial decisions
over the course of time. Using this strategy, Justice Scalia consistently has rejected
appeals to unenumerated rights.
The Supreme Court has not always relied upon tradition, particularly when it
has expanded the scope of enumerated rights of autonomy. In Roe v. Wade, 410
U.S. 113 (1973), for instance, the Court held that constitutional privacy gives
women a right to choose an abortion despite acknowledging that its decision con-
flicted with laws then in force in a majority of the states. In striking down a Texas
law prohibiting consensual adult homosexual sodomy, the Court spoke of an
“emerging awareness” that such laws impermissibly invade the control of adults
over their private sex lives. It did not, however, purport to derive its holding from
tradition. In fact, Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), expressly overrules
Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), an earlier decision that had rejected a
claimed constitutional right to consensual homosexual intimacy because of the lack
of a supporting societal tradition.
When it does not place exclusive reliance upon tradition, the Supreme Court has
referred to its past decisions and the principles it has identified as standing behind
them. The Court has not fashioned any precise rules or principles. Its explanations
variously invoke the life-shaping character of the choice at stake, its quasi-religious
nature, and the absence of demonstrable harm to others. The Court even has relied
upon decisions of foreign courts as support. The phrase “reasoned judgment,”
which some Justices have used, captures the imprecision of the method at work.
The uncertain scope of and rationale for its decisions in establishing new rights
have fueled charges that the Court has engaged in law creation rather than interpreta-
tion. It is no doubt true that the Court’s cases are susceptible of multiple readings and
give the justices fairly wide berth. However, a method based upon societal tradition

Constitutional protections
\
129
likewise gives the Court great latitude. The justices often select from competing tra-
ditions. For example, longstanding proscriptions against sodomy may exist alongside
an established practice of nonenforcement and a more general tradition of govern-
mental noninvolvement in the sex lives of consenting adults. The justices’ choice of
which tradition to emphasize is not guided by tradition. It instead can be seen to
reflect an undisclosed view of the desirability of the particular right in question or the
doctrine of unenumerated rights. In short, the choice whether to recognize any partic-
ular autonomy right or unenumerated right generally is not dictated by the Constitu-
tion’s text or history. It inevitably engages the justices’ philosophical beliefs
concerning the powers of government relative to the individual, the role of the judi-
cial branch relative to the legislature and executive branches, and the degree to which
government regulation may be based upon religion.
While the Supreme Court’s use of an unenumerated right of autonomy traces
back to the nineteenth century, the focus of the right has shifted from economic to
personal matters. In a series of cases in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
tury, the Court read a kind of economic libertarianism into the Fourteenth Amend-
ment’s Due Process Clause. That clause, the Court held, affords strong, although
not absolute, protection to an individual’s liberty to contract freely with others. It
invoked this right of freedom of contract largely against economic regulation, using
it to invalidate numerous measures to protect workers, women, and children. In
Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905), for instance, the Court struck down a
New York statute limiting the number of hours bakers could work on the grounds
that it violated the liberty of bakers and bakery owners to contract freely.
In the mid-1930s, the Court retreated from the Lochner-era doctrine that due
process implies protection for property rights. But the Supreme Court did not for-
ever abandon the idea of an unenumerated right of autonomy. Beginning in the
1960s, it infused this idea with new content, focusing on rights pertaining to per-
sonhood and family life rather than to business and property.
This evolution from rights of property to personhood is illustrated by the con-
trast between the fate of two Lochner-era decisions and that of Lochner itself. In
Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), the Supreme Court overturned a
Nebraska law that prohibited the teaching of German in schools. The other deci-
sion, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), struck down an Oregon stat-
ute prohibiting parents from sending their children to private schools. Consistent
with the general tenor of the Lochner era, in Pierce the Court stressed the property
right of private schools to deal freely with customers. The Supreme Court contin-
ues to cite Meyer and Pierce with approval. Their underlying rationale, however,
has been subtly recast in accordance with modern jurisprudential sensibilities.
Instead of focusing on the rights of teachers and schools to sell their wares in a free
market, the modern Court has focused on language in those decisions that speak of
parents’ liberty to direct their children’s upbringing. In contrast, the result in Lochner
could not be explained on the basis of an individual’s right to make decisions of a
deeply personal nature pertaining to family or self. The result in Lochner conse-
quently is no longer regarded as good law, and government now may regulate
wages and working conditions without violating a constitutional right of autonomy.
According to Supreme Court case law, the Constitution creates a zone of
autonomy that is not limited to and does not derive from the rights specified in

130
Constitutional protections
\
the text. In that zone, government may not dictate the outcome of certain key
decisions pertaining to personhood and family life. These broad-brush statements
conceal considerable diversity in cases over which rights are found in this zone,
their basis and scope, and the degree to which government may impose restrictions. 
The Supreme Court long has recognized a fundamental right on the part of par-
ents to direct the upbringing of their children. During the Lochner era, it relied
upon this right to strike down laws prohibiting parents from sending their children
to private schools and from authorizing them to be taught foreign languages. More
recently, it overturned a state court decision that, without giving any deference to
parental objections, had granted grandparents a right to visit children.
Under Supreme Court precedent, individuals also have a right to decide whether
to become parents in the first instance. The Court first recognized a right on the
part of married couples to obtain contraceptives and later extended the right to
unmarried persons. A much more dramatic extension of the right came with the
landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, which holds that women have a constitutional
right to choose an abortion. Under Roe’s trimester framework, government may not
regulate abortion as such in the first trimester, may impose only those restrictions
that are strictly necessary to promote maternal health in the second trimester, and
may generally prohibit abortion altogether after the fetus becomes viable. In
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), the justices, by a narrow 5-to-4
majority, reaffirmed Roe’s central holding that government may not prohibit abor-
tion altogether before fetal viability. The crucial plurality opinion jointly authored
by three justices modified Roe’s framework in a way that gives government greater
regulatory leeway. So long as it does not unduly burden the right to an abortion,
government may regulate throughout the pregnancy to promote maternal health
and to provide pregnant women with truthful information designed to persuade
them to choose childbirth over abortion.
Another aspect of what might be described as the right to define one’s family is
the choice of partner. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), invalidated a Virginia
miscegenation statute forbidding persons of different races from marrying. In addi-
tion to holding the explicit racial classification a violation of equal protection, the
Supreme Court concluded that it violated an unenumerated due process right to
marry. This “fundamental freedom,” the Court reasoned, may not be denied on “so
unsupportable a basis as” race. More recently, the Court has recognized a right on the
part of homosexuals to choose intimate partners and engage in sexual intimacy.
Lawrence v. Texas overturned a criminal prohibition against consensual homosexual
sodomy in the home. Overruling a prior case that had refused to locate such conduct
within a fundamental right, the Supreme Court spoke of the liberty of all individuals
to choose their personal bonds and accompanying sexual intimacies. Government
may not use the criminal law to demean homosexuals for making such choices.
Finally, the Supreme Court has begun to address whether constitutionally pro-
tected autonomy includes a right to die. Its cases suggest that while there is some
right to voluntary passive euthanasia (the withdrawal or withholding of medical
treatment), there is essentially no right to physician-assisted suicide (the provision
of the means to end life to the patient by the physician).
The Supreme Court’s case law is not a model of clarity or consistency. Whereas
the right to die cases view constitutional autonomy as defined by societal tradition,

Constitutional protections
\
131
the cases pertaining to abortion and sexuality do not. In affirming the existence of
autonomy rights not based upon tradition, the Court has appealed to a variety of
rationales. The cases also vary widely concerning the degree of protection that une-
numerated rights receive. Constitutional analysis typically distinguishes between
fundamental and nonfundamental rights. Restrictions on nonfundamental rights
receive “strict scrutiny.” Under this demanding standard of judicial review, regula-
tion survives only if the justices make their own independent determination that
regulation is strictly necessary to further a compelling interest. Although Roe v.
Wade used strict scrutiny, the Court now uses an “undue burden” standard in its
abortion cases. This test deliberately gives government more regulatory freedom
than does strict scrutiny. In addressing regulation of voluntary passive euthanasia
and parental rights, the Court has been vague about the standard of review. The
Court’s opinion in Lawrence v. Texas even uses the language of the highly deferen-
tial rational basis test applicable to nonfundamental rights.
The existence and scope of an unenumerated right of autonomy has been a
source of political controversy, in significant measure because of its connection
with abortion. It has received attention during presidential elections and has pro-
vided a conspicuous backdrop for presidential appointments and Senate confirma-
tion hearings. It seems quite unlikely that a majority of the justices will repudiate
the existence of such a right altogether and overrule established precedents such as
Griswold v. Connecticut and Meyer v. Nebraska. The question for the future is
whether a majority of justices will conceive of the right so narrowly that it lacks
contemporary significance.
Two issues appropriately have received attention as relevant in the near term.
One concerns the fate of the right to an abortion. As of this writing, five current jus-
tices have reaffirmed and two have repudiated Roe v. Wade’s central holding that a
woman has a constitutional right of access to abortion before fetal viability.
Together with Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts, who have not expressed any
view, new appointments to the Court could call into question the bare majority that
evidently now exists in support of this holding.
The other prominent issue, which lower courts have begun to address with conflict-
ing results, is whether same-sex couples may claim a constitutional right to marry. One
issue is whether laws prohibiting such marriages violate the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment by unjustifiably discriminating on the basis of homo-
sexuality. The other issue, which is relevant here, concerns whether such laws violate
an unenumerated right of autonomy. Lawrence v. Texas and Loving v. Virginia fur-
nish considerable support for holding that all adults have a constitutional right to
choose their marital partners. A number of the attributes that have prompted the Court
to include a choice within a constitutionally protected zone of autonomy are present:
the choice involves family; it has a strong bearing on the direction of one’s long-term
future; a choice to marry a person of the same sex does not inflict any direct or imme-
diate harm on others; and, the reasons for denying such a choice are largely religious
at bottom. On the other hand, a tradition-based approach easily could lead the justices
to conclude that same-sex marriage is not within a constitutionally protected zone of
autonomy. A significant number of recent state enactments explicitly outlaw same-sex
marriage, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act authorizes states not to recognize
the validity of same-sex marriages rendered in other States.

Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO)
Convinced that American Communists were agents of the Soviet Union and thus
threatened the nation’s security, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials,
in initiatives dating from the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, closely monitored the
U.S. Communist Party, including wiretapping the Soviet embassy, Communist
Party headquarters, and prominent American Communists. FBI surveillance of
Communist activists intensified during the Cold War era. For example, FBI offi-
cials pressured the Justice Department to prosecute Communist activists for violat-
ing the Smith Act of 1940 for conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government by
force, and also for failing to register with the Subversive Activities Review Board
as required under the McCarran Act of 1950. These efforts succeeded at first when
the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Smith Act and the conviction
of the top leaders of the Communist Party in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494
(1951).
The shift in the Supreme Court’s interpretation of federal surveillance powers
with the onset of the Warren Court subverted this prosecutive strategy. In Yates v.
United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957), the Court reaffirmed the constitutionality of
the Smith Act, but held that the act proscribed only advocacy to commit a violent
act and not mere advocacy. One year earlier, in Communist Party v. Subversive
Activities Control Board, 351 U.S. 115 (1956), the Court upheld the constitution-
ality of the McCarran Act, but held that the privilege of the Fifth Amendment
allowed the Communist Party leadership to refuse to identify the Party’s mem-
bership and its publications. These rulings caused FBI officials to question the
value of prosecuting Communists under these acts, further heightening their con-
cerns about having to expose FBI informers in the Communist Party during trials.
In August 1956, seeking alternative means to combat the Communist threat, FBI
officials authorized a formal program, COINTELPRO–Communist Party, to

Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO)
\
133
“harass, disrupt, and discredit” the Communist Party by either promoting faction-
alism within party ranks or leaking derogatory information about party officials
to the public. COINTELPRO–Communist Party was a highly secret program, ini-
tiated solely on the authority of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.
During the tumultuous 1960s, FBI officials extended the COINTELPRO system
to other targeted radical organizations and their leadership: in 1961 to the Socialist
Workers Party, in 1964 to white hate/nationalist organizations (notably the Ku Klux
Klan), in 1965 to black hate/nationalist organizations (notably the Black Panther
Party), and in 1968 to the New Left (notably Students for a Democratic Society).
FBI agents were pressured to devise innovative and aggressive tactics to disrupt the
targeted organizations. The proposed and adopted methods varied from the banal to
the sinister, including provoking violence among black nationalist organizations,
sending anonymous letters to parents of radical students reporting on their son’s or
daughter’s illicit sexual activities or use of illegal drugs, and sending anonymous
letters to the wives of Klan members reporting on their husbands’ extramarital
activities.
COINTELPRO was a carefully guarded program. Nonetheless, FBI officials’
creation of centralized files that recorded recommended courses of action and
headquarters review and approval of documents ironically made the program vul-
nerable to a March 1971 break-in at the FBI’s Media, Pennsylvania, resident
agency. After seizing and then photocopying FBI files, radical activists sent copies
to members of Congress, journalists, and the identified targets of FBI surveillance.
In response, in August 1971 Hoover ordered the termination of the COINTELPRO
program and advised FBI agents that future proposed “counterintelligence action”
should be submitted to FBI headquarters “under the individual case caption” and
should be conducted on “an individual basis,” rather than under a centralized cap-
tion program.
The FBI director’s attempt to foreclose further publicity about FBI activities was
negated, however, by the action of NBC correspondent Carl Stern. A recipient of
one of the photocopied Media documents, which was captioned COINTELPRO,
and not knowing the meaning of the document’s caption, Stern filed a Freedom of
Information Act request for the FBI’s COINTELPRO files. Attorney General
John Mitchell rebuffed Stern’s request. The NBC correspondent filed suit in federal
court, and in September 1973 the court ruled in his favor. At first deliberating
whether to appeal, Justice Department officials, chastened by the changed political
setting created by the recent Watergate hearings, decided not to contest the order.
The released COINTELPRO files later became one focus of an intensive con-
gressional review conducted in 1975 by the Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (also know as
the Church Committee), which commanded widespread public attention and docu-
mented the scope and nature of FBI abuses of privacy rights.

Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975)
In 1971 Martin Cohn’s 17-year-old daughter was the victim of an assault and
rape, which she did not survive. Six youths were soon indicted for her rape and
murder. Although there was substantial press coverage of the incident and the trial,
the victim’s name was never disclosed, pursuant to a Georgia statute making it a
misdemeanor to publish or broadcast the identity of a rape victim. Some eight
months later, during the trial, a reporter covering the incident learned the name of
the victim from an examination of the indictments. These indictments were public
records, to which the reporter had access. Later that day, the reporter broadcast a
report concerning the trial over through a television station owned by Cox Broad-
casting Corporation’s network. In the report, he revealed the victim’s name. The
report was repeated the following day.
Martin Cohn brought an action against Cox, relying on the statute and claiming
that the disclosure invaded his right to privacy. Cox admitted that it made the
broadcasts but claimed that the First Amendment protected the disclosure. The trial
court rejected the constitutional claims and granted summary judgment, holding
that the statute provided for a civil action, and that Cox was liable under the statute
as a matter of law because it had broadcast the victim’s identity. On appeal, the
Georgia Supreme Court, in its initial opinion, held that the trial court erred in find-
ing that the statute created a civil cause of action for invasion of privacy. It there-
fore reversed the lower court and did not reach the constitutional argument. It did
hold, however, that a jury must resolve the invasion of privacy claim, which could
stand on its own, without the statute. Upon a motion for rehearing, the Georgia
Supreme Court did reach the constitutionality of the statute: it sustained the statute
as a legitimate limitation of free speech, holding that there was no public interest or
general concern about the identity of a rape victim that would make the right to dis-
close the identity rise to the level of First Amendment protection. The Cox Broad-
casting Corporation appealed.
The Supreme Court of the United States delivered an opinion authored by Jus-
tice Byron White. After a lengthy discussion of jurisdiction, White concluded that
the Court was authorized to consider the merits of the case and reversed the judg-
ment of the Georgia Supreme Court. The Court recognized that there is a zone of
privacy surrounding every individual that the state may protect from invasion by
an abusive press. It also recognized that the twentieth century had seen “a strong
tide running in favor of the so-called right of privacy.” The Court noted, however,
that this case did not involve the appropriation of a name or a photograph, a physi-
cal intrusion into a private area, or a publication of false, defamatory, or otherwise
private information. 
Cox Broadcasting’s argument was that the press may not be held civilly or crim-
inally liable for publishing information that is neither false nor misleading but is
absolutely accurate, however damaging it may be to reputation or individual sensi-
bilities. The Court recognized that truth is a defense in defamation actions by public

figures, but the question as to whether the truthfulness of the disclosure is pro-
tected for private individuals involved in matters unrelated to public affairs was
undecided.
The issue pitted two deeply rooted rights against one another: the right to pri-
vacy versus the freedom of speech and of the press. The Court narrowed the issue
to the question of whether the State may impose sanctions upon the accurate publi-
cation of the name of a rape victim obtained from judicial records that were main-
tained in connection with a prosecution and open to public inspection. The Court
held that the State may not; the statute was unconstitutional. The Court stated that
the developing law concerning the tort of invasion of privacy recognized a privi-
lege in the press to report the events of judicial proceedings. In particular, publish-
ing information contained in public records is not within the reach of the sort of
privacy action Cohn sought here. The Court recognized that the public has a right
to a vigorous press, and that truthful information available in public records is
protected speech. Here, the reporter based his broadcast upon notes taken during
proceedings in open court, and upon the public records provided to him at his
request. In the Court’s view, a statute sanctioning this disclosure violated the con-
stitutional guarantees of the First Amendment. Consequently, in this case, the
Court determined that freedom of the press took precedence over claims to the
right of privacy.

Credit cards
Two of every three American citizens possess one or more credit cards. Every card
operates in a credit card system: a form of retail transaction where a card issuer (i.e.,
banks and other financial institutions) lends the cardholder money for purchases. A
unique credit card number identifies each individual account and the magnetic strip
stores personal and account information. Scanners at retail outlets verify a cards’
authenticity and check accounts for sufficient credit. At the end of the twentieth cen-
tury, American consumers possessed over 1.5 billion credit cards. Collectively, all of
the account and personal identifiable information linked to each card is stored in
large networked databases. The opportunities for financial gain and the risks of loss
present in this system engender a number of problems with respect to individual pri-
vacy, ranging from receipt of junk mail to identity fraud.
The first form of credit cards, which arrived early in the twentieth century, was
the “retail card” issued by merchants to boost sales of their own products. The
modern “universal card,” which is accepted by multiple merchants, appeared after

136
Credit cards
\
World War II with the Diner’s Club. A second universal card followed from Amer-
ican Express in 1958. Both Diner’s Club and American Express were “travel and
entertainment” cards, requiring customers to settle all charges at the end of the
month. Bank cards, a different form of universal card, offered revolving credit,
where debts carried over from month to month and accrued interest. In 1959, Bank
of America offered the first bank card, which was called the BankAmericard and
was renamed Visa in the 1970s. A group of Chicago banks introduced Master
Charge in 1968, which later became MasterCard. At present, four major credit card
brands control the majority of the market: Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
and Discover. Visa and MasterCard, now joint ventures that consist of thousands of
financial institutions, have consistently dominated the industry to such a degree
that a U.S. district court found both guilty of antitrust violations in 2001.
The modern credit card represents an emblem of contemporary consumer culture.
As consumption increasingly defines private life, consumer spending now represents
about two-thirds of the $11 trillion U.S. economy. Debt finances an expanding pro-
portion of this spending. Consumer credit dramatically accelerated in the late twenti-
eth and into the twenty-first century. Between 1989 and 1999, consumer credit rose
over 80 percent. In the early years of the twenty-first century, American households
used approximately 18 percent of their disposable income to service debt. According
to the U.S. Federal Reserve, total consumer debt exceeded $2 trillion dollars in 2005.
A sharp fall in household savings has accompanied the birth of this debt-dependent
society. Saving rates in the United States plunged to all-time lows in 2005, dropping
from 8 percent in the early 1980s to the present .2 percent. But the consumer debt
avalanche indicates more than lifestyle changes concerning buying and saving; it
reveals a broad social tendency toward the individualization of risk that also began in
the 1980s with the rollback of the welfare state. In the twenty-first century, consumer
credit substitutes for the social safety net.
Critical observers of the “Credit Card Nation” stress the social cost of credit
dependency. One such social cost involves the radical invasions of privacy made
possible by the credit card industry. Since the 1980s, consumer culture and social
policy have privileged private consumption over civic participation and public
investment. Ironically, the business infrastructure financing this transformation
opened private life to new legal and illegal intrusions. The source of these privacy
threats emanates, in part, from the information-intensive quality of the credit card
industry.
The consumer credit industry depends upon the storage and rapid flow of personal
data. In a general sense, credit involves inter-temporal exchange: a buyer obtains a
good or service for a deferred payment. Because a promise to pay completes the
transaction, trust forms the foundation of credit. Creditors, then, manage trust to
reduce uncertainty by assessing a borrower’s willingness and ability to repay.
Thus, credit cards impel the collection of personal information for risk analysis.
These data are an invaluable and strategic asset for card issuers, so the credit
industry continuously creates, maintains, and upgrades customer databases.
Major sources of consumer information for card issuers include applications,
billings, and transaction-generated data from individual purchases, third-party
processors, major credit bureaus, and data brokers. Businesses in the credit indus-
try use personal information for multiple purposes: (1) identification of possible

Credit cards
\
137
customers; (2) evaluation of the 100 million–plus applications every year; (3)
account management (i.e., setting interest rates and credit limits); (4) fraud detec-
tion; and (5) packaging and assessment of portfolios. Overall, the credit industry
subjects consumers to a perpetual gaze in order to optimize revenues from estab-
lished accounts and locate new customers.
The organizational structure of the credit card system intensifies the flow of per-
sonal information. Thousands of financial institutions and some non-financial insti-
tutions, like General Motors and Marriot, enter joint ventures to issue cards. To cut
business costs, card issuers frequently outsource transaction processing to third-
party processors, consequently sending personal information to more firms. Issuers
also furnish payment records to credit bureaus. Issuers also purchase personal data
from bureaus in the form of credit reports and lists of “prescreened” prospects. In
the case of the largest issuers, personal information flows throughout the organiza-
tional units of corporate conglomerates in a practice known as “affiliate sharing.”
Customer purchase records present another revenue source to card issuers. Compa-
nies may exploit transaction-generated data for internal marketing by developing
consumer profiles; alternatively, they may sell these data on the information market
to direct marketers and data brokers.
Although the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act curtailed the use of credit
reports—and granted consumers access to view their reports and correct errors—
prescreening, affiliate sharing, and the sale of transaction-generated data escaped
regulation until the late 1990s. In this loose regulatory climate, the widespread
exchange of personal information directly encouraged extensive use of junk mail
and telemarketing, which many Americans regard as intrusive invasions of pri-
vacy. In any year, over 5 billion credit card solicitations target U.S. consumers. The
sale of transaction-generated data (and the complex forms of data analysis and data
mining) fuels a larger advertising industry that saturates Americans with a broader
array of commercial propaganda. However, some recent federal legislation—
including the 1996 amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the 1999
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the 2003 Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction
Act—have given consumers more control over the use of their personal informa-
tion. For example, “opt-out provisions” allow consumers to restrict the sale of per-
sonal information by credit bureaus and card issuers.
Aside from these commercial threats to privacy, the credit industry creates
opportune conditions for identity fraud. On occasion, illegitimate agents simply
purchase personal information from banks, credit bureaus, and other information
brokers. For example, Charters Pacific Bank in Los Angles sold over 4 million
credit card numbers that were illegally billed. In other instances, security breaches
of consumer databases leave consumers vulnerable. Following the scandal of a
major data broker named ChoicePoint in February 2005 that jeopardized the pri-
vacy of 145,000 consumers, the Privacy Rights Clearing House calculated that 114
subsequent major breaches occurred in the industry during the remainder of the
year. The credit industry presents simpler means of fraud as well. Its heavy reliance
on junk mail makes any mailbox a criminal opportunity. Furthermore, innovative
forms of retail intended to speed commerce (e.g., e-commerce, telephone transac-
tions, and pay-at-the-pump) sidestep face-to-face practices of verification, making
the use of stolen cards less risky. Industry defenders assert that fraud and identity

138

\
theft add sizable cost to business. Privacy advocates counter that cost-cutting pres-
sures lead to an overreliance on automation and insufficient investment in security,
and, on top of that, information handlers fail to notify exposed consumers.
Novel challenges to privacy emerge in this debt-dependent society. For every
citizen, information becomes indispensable in a riskier environment stripped of
social protections. And in the United States, personal information is proprietary but
not owned by private persons, who are left to their own devices to negotiate mount-
ing privacy hazards.

Credit rating
The ability of consumers to obtain credit, housing, insurance, utility service,
employment, and other services is determined in part by centralized records of
credit histories maintained by credit bureaus. A credit rating, or credit score, is a
“grade” of creditworthiness that credit bureaus compile as a summary of the con-
sumer’s credit history and then issue to businesses upon request. The rating is a
shorthand version of a consumer’s credit history in numerical form. A business can
then use the rating in making a decision whether or not to engage in the transaction
with the consumer, and if so, under what terms. The precise algorithm credit
bureaus use to compile credit ratings is not publicly known, but factors generally
affecting the rating include the amount of money owed to creditors, the consumer’s
payment history, whether the consumer is seeking several new extensions of credit,
and the types of credit lines the consumer holds.
Credit histories in one form or another have long been an important factor in deci-
sions to extend or deny credit to consumers. Before the development of computerized
credit scoring, such decisions required a skilled evaluation of the information in a
consumer’s background and credit history to determine the likelihood of payment in
a timely manner. Computer models now perform such evaluations and reduce the
calculation to a number. In the system most often used by credit bureaus, the numbers
range from zero to over eight hundred, with a higher score indicating a stronger credit
history.

During the 1990s, mortgage underwriters increasingly used credit ratings to
evaluate credit risks of mortgage applicants. By the end of the century, approxi-
mately 70 percent of all mortgages were underwritten using an automated credit
rating, and the percentage was rising. As the scoring system became regarded as a
reasonably accurate predictor of consumer risk, greater numbers of credit card
issuers, insurers, and other businesses began using credit scores as part of their
decisionmaking processes.
Today, credit ratings are not only used to decide whether or not to extend credit
but are also increasingly being used to set prices and terms for mortgages and other
forms of consumer credit. In certain cases, even very small differences in scores
can result in higher interest rates and less favorable loan terms. Credit ratings are
also used to determine the cost of private mortgage insurance, which protects the
lender from loss and is usually required on mortgages with down payments of less
than 20 percent. Lenders also review credit ratings to evaluate existing credit
accounts and use the information when deciding whether to change a customer’s
credit limits, interest rates, or other terms on credit accounts.
In addition to lenders, landlords and employers may review credit scores. Land-
lords may do so to determine if potential tenants are likely to pay their rent on time.
Employers may review this information during the hiring process, especially for
positions in which employees are responsible for handling large sums of money.
Utility, home telephone, and cellular telephone service providers also may request
a credit score to decide whether or not to offer service to consumer applicants.
Less traditional uses for credit reports and credit ratings are becoming increas-
ingly common. Probate judges review credit scores before determining whether an
individual should be named as executor of a deceased’s estate, and airlines use
credit histories as part of passenger screening for potential terrorist risks. Insurance
companies use credit ratings when underwriting consumer applications for new
insurance and renewals of existing policies. Credit information has been used as a
basis to raise premiums, deny coverage for new customers, and deny renewals of
existing customers.
The expanded use of automated credit scoring has brought changes to the mar-
ketplace that have benefited consumers. The growth in the use of credit scores has
dramatically increased the speed at which credit decisions can be made. Especially
for consumers with relatively good credit, approvals for loans can be given in a
fraction of the time previously required, without manual review of the information.
Credit scores also increase the potential for customized pricing of credit based
on the risk an individual poses. Charging more to consumers considered higher risk
can remove some of the cost of risk carried by the general consumer population,
and can allow for price reductions among consumers who pose less risk. Some
have also argued that reliance on automated credit ratings can reduce discrimina-
tion because the automation of decisionmaking removes or reduces the influence of
subjective bias that can occur when consumer applications are reviewed by an indi-
vidual with decisionmaking authority.
Critics of credit scoring maintain that savings often are not passed on to con-
sumers who pose less risk, and scoring systems simply allow lenders to earn
greater profits from consumers who do not have high credit scores. In addition, the
increased speed at which underwriting decisions can be made has created pressure

140
Credit rating
\
to approve credit applications more quickly. Some contend that the combination of
this increased pace and the increased ability to customize the price charged based
on credit ratings allows lenders to approve a larger share of consumers for loans,
but not necessarily at the best rates for which some consumers would qualify if a
more personalized approach were taken. Moreover, consumers who do not have a
solid understanding of credit scores are more likely to be charged unnecessarily
high rates if the scores are based on erroneous or incomplete data, and the con-
sumer is not familiar enough with the system to correct the problem.
Critics have also argued that the factors used to determine a credit score may only
mask, and not remove, bias from approval and pricing decisions. Lenders are still free
to offer different levels of assistance in dealing with errors in credit records or with
other issues related to credit scores, such as providing rescoring services to selected
customers in an effort to offer better terms. Such discretionary assistance remains a
potential source of bias in the approval process, no matter whether a consumer is
evaluated using an automated credit rating or a manual system.
There is ample evidence that credit scores have statistical validity and are pre-
dictive of credit risk and repayment behavior for large populations. This does not
mean that credit ratings are error free in individual cases, or that credit scoring
models are always predictors of individual creditworthiness; it only means that
they work reasonably well on average. Thus, while the use of credit ratings can
yield predictable results in the aggregate for a large insurer or issuer of credit, it can
impose hardship on an individual consumer who might be a good risk but happens
to have a low score.
While debate surrounding the implications of credit scoring continues, its use is
strongly established in the American financial services industry. Concern over the
statistical validity of credit scoring focuses on two dimensions: the fairness of the
models that interpret the data and the accuracy of the underlying credit data held in
the databases of the major credit bureaus. Because the rating formulas that trans-
form the vast amount of data in an individual’s credit history into a precise number
are not publicly available, evaluating the fairness and accuracy of the models con-
tinues to be problematic.
Credit scores of individuals depend on the information found in their credit his-
tories. The system for creating consumer credit histories involves a large number of
participants who fall generally into one of four categories: consumers, data reposi-
tories or credit bureaus, data users, and data furnishers. Approximately 200 million
consumers have credit reports maintained by the three major credit bureaus
(Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion), which are privately run businesses that col-
lect, organize, and sell consumer information. The three major credit bureaus all
contain similar sets of data about consumers, but the information in each bureau’s
report on an individual is not identical. Data users request credit reports from the
credit bureaus. Data users include lenders, insurers, landlords, utility companies,
employers, and other entities that are interested in assessing the risk of entering
into a transaction with a consumer. Users review the credit information in credit
reports to make decisions about extending credit, offering and pricing insurance
policies, providing utility services, renting apartments and houses, offering
employment, and for other purposes allowed by law. Some data users are also data
furnishers, who regularly report information about consumers’ accounts to the

Credit rating
\
141
credit bureaus, who then add the information to consumers’ credit histories and
organize it in a form that businesses can use. Furnishers of information may send
data (e.g., account payment activity) to some or all three of the major credit
bureaus.
There is no requirement that any business report information to any credit
bureau, but most businesses that regularly use reports also feed information to at
least one of the major credit bureaus. In a typical transaction in which a consumer
applies for credit, such as a credit card, unsecured line of credit, or installment loan
(e.g., for an automobile or furniture), the potential creditor can request a credit
report from one, two, or all three of the credit bureaus. A credit bureau that receives
such a request will send the credit report to the potential creditor and record an
entry on the consumer’s credit report that the report was sent. The creditor can use
the information in the credit report (including the credit score) to help decide
whether to extend or deny credit to the consumer, and what the interest rate and
other fees will be for the extension of credit. If the creditor accepts the application,
the creditor may then act as a data provider and report information on the con-
sumer’s payment history to one, two, or all three of the credit bureaus for as long as
the account remains active. Payments made on time will be reported as such, as
will payments that are 30, 60, or 90 days late.
Information in a consumer’s credit report usually includes identifying data such
as the consumer’s name, Social Security number, date of birth, former names or
aliases, current and former addresses, employment history, income, and the con-
sumer’s employment address. Reports also include public record information
(e.g., judgments, tax liens, and bankruptcies), collections and payment history on
credit accounts, balances outstanding on consumer debts, creditor and bank names
along with account numbers, highest amounts owed, size and frequency of pay-
ments, any amounts past due, date of delinquencies, dollar amount of maximum
delinquencies, and a list of companies that have requested the consumer’s credit
report in recent months. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires credit
bureaus to include any consumer statement or explanation of a dispute concerning
the accuracy or completeness of information contained in the credit history. State
and local governments may also report directly to credit bureaus if consumers fail
to pay child support, have unpaid parking tickets, or have been overpaid for unem-
ployment benefits.
Credit ratings are compiled from the totality of information contained in the
credit report. Private firms provide analytic services to the major credit bureaus
through the development of complex formulae that help interpret the information in
the bureaus’ files. These companies, the most popular of which is the Fair Isaac
Corporation, produce the tools that use the information in a consumer’s file to gen-
erate credit scores based on various risk factors. The rating compiled by Fair Isaac
is known as a FICO score. Some large lenders and mortgage insurance companies
have created their own tools that help them create scores and interpret credit infor-
mation for applications involving large extensions of credit.
Generally speaking, account information can have either a positive or negative
effect on a consumer’s credit rating. On-time payments have a positive influence
while late payments have a negative influence. However, the amount of positive
influence a consumer receives from a timely payment may vary based on the type

142
Credit rating
\
of creditor being paid. For example, timely payments to a prime credit card lender
may have a greater positive influence on a score than timely payments to a lender
considered less favorable, such as a furniture or consumer electronics store. Other
factors that can affect a score include the length of time credit has been established,
the amount of credit used compared to the amount of credit available, and the
length of time a consumer has resided at the current address.
Information obtained from public records and government entities, such as
bankruptcy filings, delinquent child or family support payments, unpaid parking
tickets, or overpayments of unemployment benefits, is often derogatory informa-
tion that has a negative influence on credit scores, but public records may also
include positive information such as the satisfaction of a bankruptcy or the pay-
ment of a judgment lien.
Any type of activity involving bad debts referred to a collection agency will
have a negative impact on a credit history, regardless of how the debt was created.
Collections will continue to have a negative impact after they have been paid or
otherwise satisfied, although they will have a less negative impact once they are
satisfied and some time passes. Under federal law, credit scoring cannot consider a
consumer’s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, receipt of pub-
lic assistance, or the consumer’s exercise of rights under consumer credit laws.
Until recently, a credit bureau did not have to disclose consumer credit scores
upon a consumer’s request. Congress amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to
require credit bureaus to disclose the current credit score or the most recent score
that the bureau had calculated, a statement indicating that the number and scoring
model may be different than the number or model used by other bureaus or any
particular lender, the range of credit scores for the model used, the most impor-
tant factors that adversely affected the score of the consumer who inquired, and
the name of the analytical service company that the bureau used to compile the
credit score. Although a consumer is entitled to one free credit report from each
of the three major credit bureaus each year, the bureaus can charge a separate fee
for releasing the consumer’s credit score that was derived from information in the
report.
In addition to requesting a credit score from one of the major credit bureaus,
consumers can directly contact the Fair Isaac Corporation, the analytical service
company that the credit bureaus most often use to create the score. For a fee, the
company will release the score that it derives from data in each of the three major
credit bureaus and a combined score using information from all three of the files.
If consumers want to raise their credit scores, credit scoring companies suggest
several basic strategies. Consumers should pay bills on time, get current on any
overdue accounts, keep balances low on credit cards, pay down debt rather than
move it from one credit account to another, and not open a lot of new accounts in a
short period of time. Various businesses and authors have studied the credit scoring
system and recommend additional strategies to increase scores. However, because
the formulae for creating credit scores is not publicly known, it is not always clear
that any particular action (such as closing a seldom-used credit card account) will
raise or lower a consumer’s credit rating.

Criminal suspects and arrestees
Privacy rights of individuals arrested for crime or suspected of it are established
and protected by constitutional provisions, statutes, and judicial decisions at both
the federal and state levels. At least two distinct privacy interests are identifiable in
these protections. The first is an interest in limiting access by the government to the
homes, belongings, and conversations of criminal suspects and arrestees, as well as
information about their activities and other personal matters. This interest is pro-
tected by laws that limit the government’s ability to obtain information about peo-
ple generally. The second is an interest in limiting disclosure by the government of
information about arrestees and suspects that is in its possession—specifically, the
very information that a given individual has been arrested for or suspected of
crime. This interest is protected by laws that limit the government’s ability to
release such information to the public.
Government access to information about individuals is limited according to sev-
eral rationales. One is that people should be able to conduct their lawful affairs in pri-
vate from the government—speaking their minds to family and friends, reading
whatever books and magazines they wish to read, enjoying their hobbies, engaging in
intimate behavior—and that the government should be allowed to invade that privacy
only when, and only to the extent that, sufficient justification exists. Underlying this
rationale is the commitment to robust democracy; the concern is that ideas and voices
that might differ with those of the government would be discouraged or silenced if
the government had unfettered access to information about people’s daily activities,
reading materials, personal relationships and gatherings, group memberships, and the
like. Another rationale is that personal information might be embarrassing or simply
too revealing to allow unfettered government access to it—for instance, information

144

\
about one’s habits, health, or finances. A third rationale is that certain means of
obtaining information about individuals, such as inspecting a person’s bodily cavities
or drawing blood for chemical analysis, intrude sufficiently on personal dignity and
bodily integrity to require strict regulation.
The primary source of laws that limit government access to personal informa-
tion on these grounds is the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. That
amendment protects individuals, their homes, their papers, and their possessions
against “unreasonable searches and seizures” by the government, and requires that
warrants for arrest or search be supported by “probable cause” and particularly
describe who or what is to be searched or seized. The U.S. Supreme Court has
interpreted the amendment to mean that government actors ordinarily must obtain
judicial warrants before conducting searches or seizures.
The Court has declared that the “search” language of the amendment specifi-
cally protects personal privacy. Indeed, the Court has defined a search, for purposes
of determining whether the amendment applies, as any government action that
implicates an individual’s “reasonable expectation of privacy.” And the Court has
defined the standard the amendment sets out for issuing warrants: probable cause
as a “fair probability” of crime, or facts and circumstances that create a “reasonable
belief” in criminal activity. Thus, every government search of a person, a home, or
personal belongings by a police officer or other government agent—every govern-
ment action that implicates an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy—
ordinarily requires a search warrant, issued by a judge or magistrate and based on
a finding by that judicial officer that there is a fair probability that the targeted indi-
vidual is guilty of a crime or the area to be searched contains evidence of a crime.
But the Court has created many exceptions to that requirement, several of which
see more practice than the presumptive warrant requirement.
The Court has deemed a wide variety of government investigative activity to be
searches under the “reasonable expectation of privacy” definition and thus subject
to Fourth Amendment scrutiny. Wiretapping or other surveillance of a person’s
conversations or correspondence, for instance, is a search that requires a warrant.
Physically searching a person for evidence of crime also ordinarily requires a
warrant—but there are two major exceptions. The first is when a person is
arrested upon a police officer’s own determination of probable cause, in which
case the officer may thoroughly search the person and the area immediately
around the person—the “grab area”—for weapons and evidence of crime. Such a
search, called a search incident to arrest, can include all containers within the
arrestee’s grab area. The second exception to the requirement of a warrant for phys-
ical searches is when a police officer does not arrest but only detains a person for
brief questioning, which is allowed upon a lower degree of suspicion of criminal
activity called “reasonable suspicion.” As long as the officer also has reasonable
suspicion that the person may have a weapon, a less intrusive search, called a pro-
tective search or “pat down,” is permitted to ensure the officer’s safety.
Searches of cars and other movable vehicles are governed by similar rules. A
police officer’s own determination of probable cause allows an immediate and
thorough search of all areas of a car in which evidence of the suspected crime
might be, including the trunk and all containers within the car. When arresting a
driver or passenger of an automobile, an officer is permitted to search the interior

Criminal suspects and arrestees
\
145
of the car, including the glove compartment, for weapons or evidence of crime.
Short of an arrest, the interior of a car can also be searched just for weapons—for
instance, when a police officer detains a person for a traffic stop or brief questioning—
upon the lower degree of suspicion called reasonable suspicion, as long as the
officer has that degree of suspicion that the person may have a weapon in the car.
Homes are protected more strictly by the Fourth Amendment; the Supreme
Court has stated repeatedly that the home is at the core of the amendment’s protec-
tion. With only one exception, police officers may not search or even enter a private
home without a warrant, even to arrest someone for whom they have determined
probable cause of criminal activity. The exception is the case of “exigent circum-
stances,” which means not only probable cause of crime but also the additional rea-
sonable belief that immediate entry is necessary for one or more of three purposes:
to protect others from harm, to prevent the destruction of evidence, or to catch a
fleeing suspect. And even with a warrant permitting them to enter a home to search
or arrest, police officers are generally expected, and in many states required by
state law, not to enter until they have announced their presence and given the occu-
pant at least a brief opportunity to open the door. However, in the recent case of
Hudson v. Michigan, the Court found that evidence seized even when this rule is
violated may be admissible in court.
Police officers are also forbidden to acquire information about activities within a
home by means other than physically entering it if they do not have a warrant. In
the Supreme Court’s most recent statement on the matter, the case of United States v.
Kyllo, 533 U.S. 27 (2001), the Court forbade the warrantless use of a “thermal
sensor” or imaging device used from outside a home to detect excessive heat ema-
nating from the home caused by high-intensity lamps used for growing marijuana.
Use of the device constituted a search of the home for purposes of the Fourth
Amendment, the Court said, because it revealed information about the interior of
the home that would not otherwise be available without physically entering it.
Because thermal-imaging devices were not yet “in general public use,” the Court
said, using them in that manner implicated an individual’s reasonable expectation
of privacy and therefore required a warrant.
After a person is arrested and taken into custody, privacy protection under the
Fourth Amendment continues, most pertinently with respect to searches that
involve bodily inspections and intrusions. Taking a blood sample from an arrestee
to test it for alcohol content, for instance, ordinarily requires a warrant or court
order. But in the 1966 case that remains the leading precedent on the matter,
Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 166 (1966), the Supreme Court approved of the
warrantless extraction of blood from a hospitalized arrestee when the police had
probable cause that incriminating evidence would be found—namely, evidence that
the arrestee had been driving while intoxicated, which caused the accident that put
him in the hospital—and the additional reasonable belief that the evidence would
otherwise be lost. In other words, there were “exigent circumstances.” And
although the Supreme Court has not ruled on these specific issues, opinions of
lower courts indicate that the same rules govern other very invasive searches, such
as performing surgery to retrieve a bullet or conducting body cavity searches for
drugs or other items, while lesser physical intrusions, such as taking an arrestee’s
fingerprints, a sample for urine analysis, dental impressions, or a chemical swab

146
Criminal suspects and arrestees
\
of part of an arrestee’s body, are permissible upon no more than a police officer’s
determination of probable cause that incriminating evidence will be found.
For any search to be lawful under the Fourth Amendment, it must also be under-
taken reasonably. This means that the search may not extend beyond the area reason-
ably likely to contain the evidence sought, nor may it be conducted with excessive
force or otherwise executed in a manner that is not reasonably justified by the cir-
cumstances of the search and the purpose of it. For instance, while lawfully searching
a home for a stolen television set, officers ordinarily may not open bedroom drawers;
if given consent by a person—another exception to the warrant requirement—to
search certain belongings, officers may not search beyond those belongings.
The constitutions of all 50 U.S. states contain provisions that are analogous to
the Fourth Amendment. In some instances, these provisions are interpreted to offer
greater privacy protection than that offered by the Fourth Amendment. New Jer-
sey’s highest court, for instance, has interpreted the corresponding provision in its
state constitution to require exigent circumstances in addition to probable cause
before an automobile may be searched without a warrant. And, while the bound-
aries of privacy protection under the Fourth Amendment and its state counterparts
are ultimately determined by court decisions, many of the protections are also cod-
ified in federal and state statutes.
These boundaries are constantly being tested and redrawn. In recent years, some
states have enacted laws that require law enforcement officers to obtain DNA sam-
ples of all individuals arrested for certain offenses (typically violent ones) whether
or not the officers have probable cause that incriminating evidence will be found.
Whether taking these samples—typically of saliva or skin—pursuant to these laws
is lawful under the Fourth Amendment, indeed whether it is even a “search” for
Fourth Amendment purposes, will likely be for the courts to determine.
Laws that limit the government’s disclosure of information about arrestees and
suspects—in particular, the very information that an individual was ever arrested
for crime or suspected of it—take a variety of forms and address several means by
which that information might reach the public. In each case, protecting the privacy
of arrestees and suspects, especially those who were never formally charged with
or convicted of an offense, is the primary rationale. The privacy interest these laws
protect is defined in many ways—for instance, an individual’s right to “control”
personal information, deriving from a basic “right to be let alone” by others, and
allowing one to “define oneself.” Its rationale with respect to arrestees and suspects
is the significant harm that can befall one who is publicly identified as an accused
or suspected criminal: social status can be damaged, family members shunned,
employment lost, or future job prospects threatened.
This interest is not one that is seen as protected by the U.S. Constitution. In the
1976 case of Paul v. Davis, the Supreme Court rejected the claim that the public
identification of an arrestee by a government actor before trial violates the
arrestee’s constitutional right to due process. (In that case, local police had
included an arrestee’s name on a list of “active shoplifters” they had distributed to
area merchants. The individual had been arrested for shoplifting but not yet con-
victed of the charge; the charge was eventually dismissed.) In fact, the First
Amendment to the Constitution stands in opposition to such a privacy right.
According to a series of Supreme Court decisions, the free-speech guarantee of that

Criminal suspects and arrestees
\
147
amendment creates a general right of public access to criminal proceedings, so that
citizens can be informed enough about government affairs to exercise their speech
rights intelligently; and both the free-speech and the free-press guarantees of the
amendment allow the media and other private parties to publicize truthful
information—such as the fact of an individual’s arrest or status as a criminal sus-
pect—at least when that information has been acquired lawfully. Nevertheless, leg-
islatures and courts have allowed or required government actors to withhold
information about arrestees and suspects on privacy grounds in certain contexts, and
the Supreme Court has considered and approved of a number of these restrictions.
Regarding suspects, government disclosure of the fact that an individual is or
has been suspected of a crime is forbidden on privacy grounds in several ways.
Grand jury proceedings, for instance, in which citizens hear evidence to decide
whether or not to indict a given individual (i.e., whether or not there is probable
cause of guilt), have long been closed to the public by statute or court rule in the
federal system and the states. One rationale for this secrecy is to protect individuals
whom the grand jury ultimately does not indict from public knowledge of the fact
that they were under suspicion. The Supreme Court has repeatedly approved of
both grand jury secrecy and the privacy rationale for it.
Indictments themselves are typically public documents; however, they might
contain the names of individuals other than the charged defendant who are sus-
pected of participating in the crime even though the indictment does not formally
charge them. Accordingly, courts often order the redaction of these names in order
to protect the reputations of these individuals, and the American Bar Association
has formally adopted a principle forbidding naming such “unindicted co-conspirators”
in indictments. Courts have extended similar protections to other documents in
criminal cases that might be accessed by the public—pre-indictment search war-
rants, transcripts of wiretapped conversations, bills of particulars (detailed state-
ments by prosecutors that give defendants additional information about the charges
against them), pre-sentence reports—and in each case they have done so expressly
to protect the privacy of individuals who are identified in the documents as criminal
suspects but who have not been convicted or formally charged.
Information that identifies suspects in other government documents is also pro-
tected from disclosure on privacy grounds under statutes that otherwise confer
broad rights of public access to government information. The federal Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA), for instance, which requires government agencies to dis-
close agency information to the public upon request, exempts several categories of
information from that requirement; one category is information the disclosure of
which would or could constitute “an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
Several federal court decisions have interpreted this language to allow government
agencies to redact information that identifies past or present criminal suspects
before releasing documents that are subject to disclosure. Some state courts have
interpreted analogous language in their state disclosure statutes similarly.
Information that identifies actual arrestees can also be withheld. At least one fed-
eral court has recently ruled that the personal privacy exemption of the federal FOIA
applies to that information. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also argued that
the exemption supported its decision to withhold the names of hundreds of individu-
als its agents had arrested and charged with immigration violations after the attacks

148
Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990)
\
of September 11, 2001. A federal appeals court upheld the DOJ’s withholding of the
names on other grounds, issuing no ruling on the privacy argument. More broadly,
while information about arrests that have taken place on a given day, including the
names of the arrestees, is generally publicly available in every state (typically at the
pertinent police station), the compilation of this information with respect to a particu-
lar individual—in other words, a person’s arrest record or “rap sheet”—is not.
According to the laws of most states, government actors are forbidden to disclose an
individual’s full arrest record to any person or entity other than another government
agency except in strictly limited circumstances, such as for statistical research.
Instead, states typically draw a distinction between records of arrests that have
resulted in convictions and records of those that have not, permitting public disclo-
sure of the former but not the latter. Nonconviction arrest records can also be sealed
or expunged by law in a number of states. The U.S. Supreme Court approved of with-
holding arrest records on privacy grounds in the 1989 case of U.S. Department of
Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in which the Court upheld
a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) refusal to disclose a person’s rap sheet
under the personal privacy exemption. Notably, the Court did not distinguish between
arrests that resulted in convictions and those that did not.
Information that identifies juveniles who are suspected, accused, or even convicted
of crime is also confidential in most states, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly
endorsed this practice. Although the interest in juvenile confidentiality is not always
or solely characterized as a privacy interest, its primary rationale—to protect juvenile
offenders from negative attention that would stigmatize them, hindering their rehabil-
itation and their reintegration with society—is a quintessential privacy interest.

Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990)
Nancy Cruzan established the federal constitutional right of every American to
refuse unwanted medical treatment in the landmark 1990 U.S. Supreme Court case,
Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health. Cruzan was in a single-car accident
on a deserted country road in the early-morning hours of January 11, 1983. Her car
crossed the centerline, went down a ditch, flattened several saplings and a rural

\
149
mailbox, and flipped onto its top. She was thrown from the car and landed 35 feet
beyond where the car stopped. The car traveled nearly the length of two football
fields from the point where it left the road until it stopped. It took some time for
neighbors down the road to wake up, come outside, and rush back in to call for
help, and still longer for emergency vehicles to make their way to the remote rural
site. A review of police, ambulance, and fire reports suggests that Cruzan may have
gone as long as 30 minutes without oxygen before emergency workers revived her
that night.
For the week after the accident she remained in a full, closed-eye coma. Then,
on day seven, her eyes opened, a point of brief (but false) hope for her family, and
she moved into a kind of open-eyed unconsciousness. Extensive efforts at rehabili-
tation did nothing. Eventually—and quite predictably in hindsight, given the long
period of time without oxygen—Nancy Cruzan lapsed into the kind of eyes-open
unconsciousness that doctors described to the family as a persistent vegetative
state. Some portion of her brainstem—that part of the human brain that controls
basic, primitive human reflexes—had survived the accident. The brainstem can go
significantly longer periods of time without oxygen and survive than the upper,
thinking part of the brain, which is much more fragile. The persistent vegetative
state was so named in 1972 by Drs. Fred Plum and Bryan Jennett in the prestigious
medical journal Lancet. This condition came about as a result of increasingly
sophisticated life-saving techniques at accident sites and better-equipped emer-
gency rooms. As a result, patients who previously would have died were able to be
brought back from the brink of death, but not all of the way back. In the early
1970s, doctors were seeing more and more patients in this condition, necessitating
a diagnosis and a name. Nancy Cruzan slept and woke; she breathed on her own;
she could slightly move her badly paralyzed limbs; her eyes moved around the
room and at times would appear to fix on a person or object; she would startle in
reaction to loud noises; and she would sometimes appear to grimace or smile. But
in the four years after the accident, her family never saw any reaction that they con-
sidered conscious thought—that they thought was Nancy. Her doctors agreed. They
told the Cruzans that Nancy was permanently unconscious, without hope of ever
regaining consciousness, and that she could live another 30 years in that condition
with attentive nursing care and continued use of the main medical technologies
keeping her alive, which were artificial nutrition and hydration, or a feeding tube.
The family came to the conclusion that if Nancy could speak to them, given her
condition, she would ask to have the feeding tube removed. The director of the state
hospital told the family that the hospital would not remove the feeding tube without a
court order. A judge told them that they could be charged with murder if they moved
Nancy home to remove the feeding tube without a court order. So they decided to go
to court. In March 1988, the Cruzans found themselves on trial in southern Missouri
against the attorney general of Missouri and the state Department of Health. At the
end of that trial, the trial judge ruled in the family’s favor. On appeal, the Missouri
Supreme Court overturned this decision, setting up a showdown in the nation’s
highest court.
In the summer of 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the Cruzan case
and set the argument date for December 6, 1989, for its first right-to-die case.
Throughout that fall, on television and radio, in barbershops, on golf courses, in

150
Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990)
\
churches, and at medical schools, the public was talking about the case. What was
this new “persistent vegetative state” condition that television commentators were
calling by its acronym, PVS? What exactly was a feeding tube? Who should
decide? Many commentators suggested that the raising of public awareness about
these complex questions was in many ways more important than the legal battle
itself. On June 25, 1990, the Supreme Court issued its decision. The final vote of
the justices split 5-4, and five of the nine justices wrote their own separate opinions
on what they thought the law was: the end result was the majority opinion, two
concurring opinions, and two dissents. As sometimes happens with complicated
Supreme Court opinions, the interest groups on both sides found something to
claim as victory within those five opinions.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who wrote the majority opinion, reasoned that
competent people have a federal constitutional right, a liberty right, to refuse medi-
cal treatment. The Court had never before directly recognized such a right. A
majority of the justices also recognized that tube feeding was medical treatment,
like a respirator or dialysis or any other device that takes the place of a natural
function that has been lost. On the other hand, the majority opinion ruled that the
federal Constitution did not require Missouri to defer to the parents of an adult like
Nancy Cruzan (she was 25 years old at the time of the accident) to make the deci-
sion to remove medical treatment. If Missouri chose to rely solely on evidence of
Nancy Cruzan’s own wishes, the Court noted that the state could impose such a
standard without running afoul of Nancy’s constitutional rights. The Court also
stated that leaving the life support in place in one way simply preserved the status
quo, with advances in medicine, or possibly “the discovery of new evidence regard-
ing the patient’s intent” creating at least “the potential that a wrong decision will
eventually be corrected or its impact mitigated.”
The Cruzans took this language and went back to court in Missouri for a new
trial in November of 1990. Three friends of Nancy Cruzan had telephoned her par-
ents when they saw the story in the news over the previous year. These friends told
the Cruzans about conversations they’d had with Nancy about living on life sup-
port. This time the attorney general and the Department of Health chose not to
oppose the family, or even to participate in the trial. On December 14, 1990, just
shy of eight years after her accident, the trial court again ruled in favor of Nancy
Cruzan’s parents. Doctors at the state hospital removed her feeding tube immedi-
ately, and the hospital transferred Nancy to their hospice wing that afternoon.
Over the course of the next 11 and a half days, the nation watched the final chap-
ter of the Cruzan saga unfold in the remote, hilly southern Missouri town of Mt.
Vernon. Protesters from around the country arrived and satellite television trucks
were not far behind. Various groups filed emergency appeals in the state and fed-
eral courts over those 11 days, seven appeals in all; signs popped up on the lawn
like “Missouri Euthanasia Center” and “Atrosity [sic] Torture Murder.” On the day
before Christmas, a big new sign appeared that read “Nancy’s Gift at Christmas
from her Parents and Doctor—DEATH!” Inside the hospital, the family huddled
together, day after day, talking softly, holding Nancy’s hands, and praying. At 2:47
a.m. on December 26, 1990, Nancy Cruzan’s breathing stopped, and she died.
In the wake of the Cruzan case, many states passed laws seeking to address the
issues raised by the case. Congress passed a law called the Patient Self-Determination

Act, which provides that all patients entering hospitals in the United States must be
counseled about living wills and other types of health care planning. The New York
Times wrote that Nancy’s case had helped “free countless Americans of some of the
fears attending death.”

Cryptography
Whether it be cuneiform inscribed on clay tablets, histories on papyrus, agricul-
tural transactions on quipu, or philosophical tomes on paper, writing is fundamen-
tal to human civilization. Writing is about communication, but sometimes the
communication needs to be secret. That is the role played by cryptography, the sci-
ence of secret (crypto) writing (graphy). In almost every civilization, cryptography
appeared shortly after writing. Only the Chinese empire, where written language
was confined to a small elite and ideographic writing made the process of encryp-
tion difficult, seems to have made scant effort to develop encryption methods.
Until the modern era, if two people wanted to communicate privately, they
moved to a private space, a field, or a room where they could not be overheard. The
invention of electronic communications—first the telegraph, then the telephone,
and more recently the Internet—changed the pace and extent of communications,
as well as the need for confidentiality. And so cryptography, once the domain of
the military, diplomats, lovers, and young children, is now a tool of the public.
Every time an individual purchases an item online via a secure website, every time
an employee logs onto the company’s internet via a virtual private network, every
time an individual downloads a song to an iPod, someone is using cryptography.
Modern digital communications systems operate on strings of numbers: 0s and 1s.
The first step in encryption is to convert the alphabetic system into bits. Like much
in cryptography, this idea is not new. In the second century B.C., the Greek historian
Polybius proposed a method for encoding letters as numbers. Applying his method
to the Roman alphabet, the letters could be written in a 5  5 grid (with i and j
combined in a single element) and each letter then labeled by its grid entry; for
example, d is (1,4) while f is (2,1). Once the message has been transformed into
bits, the unencrypted string, or plaintext, is encrypted into the ciphertext by the
cryptosystem.
Fundamentally there are two types of cryptographic transformations: substitu-
tion and transposition. In 1500 B.C., a Mesopotamian scribe employed substitution.
Using cuneiform symbols with multiple syllabic interpretations in their least com-
mon mode, the scribe hid a formula for ceramic glaze. Transposition ciphers take
the letters of a message and shift them around within the message according to a
predetermined technique. For example, a transposition cipher might take the grid

proposed by Polybius and write the text into a square by rows in one order and read
it off by columns in a different order.
There are two aspects to an encryption system: the method for the encryption
system, called the algorithm, and a secret, called the key. The key is specific to the
pair—or group—of people who want to communicate privately. This methodology
was codified by the nineteenth-century cryptographer Auguste Kerchoffs, who
observed that any cryptosystem used by a large group of people will leak informa-
tion about how the system works. The system must be secure even if the algorithm
is public, so the secrecy of the system must lie entirely in the key (which is shared
with a much smaller group of people). Opening the algorithm to public scrutiny
helps establish confidence in the algorithm’s security and thus enables the algo-
rithm’s acceptance.
As is well known to printers (and Scrabble players), in any language, letters
have a particular frequency distribution. For example, in English text, the letter e
appears about 13 percent of the time, and the letter t appears about 9 percent of
the time. There is also a frequency distribution of pairs of letters, triples of let-
ters, and so forth. In English, for example, the pair th is the most common pair,
or digraph, while er is the second most common. Frequency distributions are a
well-known tool for attacking substitution and transposition ciphers; the first
description of frequency distribution appears in the Arabic encyclopedia, the
Subh al-a sha, completed in 1412 A.D. Frequency analysis can also be used
against polyalphabetic ciphers, cryptosystems that use more than one alphabet
for a single encryption.
In cryptosystems the whole may be greater than the sum of its parts. The
proper combination of substitution and transposition with a key can make for a
very strong cryptosystem. That was the basis for the development of the U.S.
Data Encryption Standard (DES), an algorithm with a 56-bit key that served as a
U.S. cryptography standard from 1977 to 2005 and was widely used inside and
outside the government. In a strong algorithm, each additional bit of key length
increases the algorithm’s security by a factor of 2. The increasing speed and
dropping price of processors spelled the end of DES’s security, and in recent
years the algorithm was replaced by triple-DES, a cipher with apparent 112-bit
security. The cryptosystems described thus far have all been symmetric-key sys-
tems, in which both the sender and the receiver use the same key for encryption
and decryption. The difficulty of transmitting the key, especially between two
parties who have not previously communicated (such as the initial time a con-
sumer makes a purchase at an online store), led to the 1975 invention of asym-
metric-key, or public-key, cryptography by Whitfield Diffie and Martin
Hellman.
Public-key cryptography makes public both the algorithm and the public, or
encryption, key; the decryption key, often referred to as the private key, is not
published. The system’s impenetrability is based on the apparent difficulty of cer-
tain mathematical functions, ones that are easy to compute and hard to invert. Mul-
tiplication and factoring appear to be one such pair. These provide the
underpinnings for the RSA public-key cryptosystem, which provides the key
exchange mechanism of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Because public-
key computations are slower than symmetric-key systems, a public key is often

used for exchange of a symmetric key, after which the data are encrypted using a
symmetric-key algorithm. A second generation of public-key cryptosystems based
on the more complex arithmetic of elliptic curves is coming into use. These sys-
tems, employing a smaller key size for the same security level as RSA, are being
implemented in low-power and small-memory devices.
Public-key cryptography makes possible digital signatures, which provide a
guarantee of the authenticity of the sender. Cryptography actually serves four func-
tions: confidentiality, the functionality that no one but the intended recipient can
understand the communication; integrity, a guarantee that the message has not been
modified or corrupted; authentication (of the sender); and nonrepudiation, evi-
dence that prevents the sender from later denying the communication.
Communication has two aspects, the content and the transactional information:
for example, the writing on the envelope and the enclosed letter indicate who the
sender and receiver are, when the message was sent, how long it is, and the content
of the message. Traffic analysis, the study of the transactional (i.e., envelope) infor-
mation, has long been of great value to intelligence agencies. Even if the message
itself cannot be decrypted, the transactional data reveal much about the target’s
organizational structure and intentions. Traffic analysis was used heavily during
World War II, but until recently there has not been much effort or interest in the
civilian world in developing ways to hide transactional information. Because the
Internet enables real-time tracking of what information individuals are accessing,
there is now a strong interest in developing systems to make transactional informa-
tion anonymous, including what sites an Internet user is browsing. The various sys-
tems for anonymous re-mailing and anonymous browsing, including Anonymizer
and Onion routing, are all based on public-key cryptography.
In 1975, when the U.S. government put forth a call for the public cryptosystem
that became DES, the public cryptography community numbered just a handful of
researchers, and most cryptography research was done by military agencies. A
quarter of a century later, when it came time to replace DES, the community had
gone public. DES’s replacement, the Advanced Encryption Standard, adopted in
2002, was developed by Belgian researchers and was vetted by cryptographers
around the world. This is one small measure of how cryptography has moved from
the secretive military and government realm into the public world.

Curtilage
Simply put, the curtilage is the area immediately outside one’s home. Tradition-
ally, the Fourth Amendment was interpreted to protect not only the interior of a
home, the area inside the four walls, but to also protect the area immediately out-
side the home: the curtilage. The term has included garages, driveways, cottages,

154
Curtilage
\
and backyards for Fourth Amendment protections from unreasonable searches and
seizures. The Supreme Court instructed in California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207
(1986), that “[t]he protection afforded the curtilage is essentially a protection of
families and personal privacy in an area intimately linked to the home, both physi-
cally and psychologically, where privacy expectations are most heightened.”
The curtilage concept originated in common law to afford the area immediately
surrounding a dwelling house the same protection from burglars as was afforded
the house itself. The curtilage is the area to which the intimate activity associated
with the “sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life” extends (Boyd v.
United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886)). Courts have extended Fourth Amendment
protections to the curtilage. Further, they have defined the curtilage, as did com-
mon law, by reference to the factors that determine whether an individual reason-
ably may expect that the curtilage will remain private. The difficulty for the courts
in addressing issues of privacy and protection from unreasonable searches has been
in determining where the curtilage ends.
In Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, 59 (1924), the Supreme Court ruled that
that the Fourth Amendment’s protection did not extend to “open fields.” The
Supreme Court reaffirmed that holding in Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170
(1984), and ruled that the extent of the curtilage should be determined by factors
that bear upon whether an individual reasonably could expect that the area in ques-
tion should be treated as the home itself. The court instructed that the central com-
ponent of any inquiry to determine if an area constituted curtilage should be an
inquiry as whether the area harbors the “intimate activity associated with the ‘sanc-
tity of a man’s home and the privacies of life.’”
In United States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294 (1987), the Supreme Court drew upon the
history of its own cases, as well as the experience of the lower courts, to hold that
curtilage questions should be resolved by considering four factors: (1) the proximity
of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home; (2) whether the area was included
within an enclosure surrounding the home; (3) the nature of the uses to which the
area was put; and (4) the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from obser-
vation by people passing by. The court, however, warned “that combining these fac-
tors [does not produce] a finely tuned formula that, when mechanically applied,
yields a ‘correct’ answer to all extent-of-curtilage questions. Rather, these factors are
useful analytical tools only to the degree that, in any given case, they bear upon the
centrally relevant consideration—whether the area in question is so intimately tied
to the home itself that it should be placed under the home’s ‘umbrella’ of Fourth
Amendment protection.” The difficulty in protecting privacy rights in areas tradi-
tionally viewed as curtilage is seen in a review of cases addressing the question.
The call was easy for the Hester Court to make. In that case, revenue agents wit-
nessed what they believed was a moonshine sale and pursued suspects through a
field where they found discarded whiskey bottles. Acknowledging that while there
might have been a trespass, the Court held there was no illegal search or seizure. It
relied upon British common law for the holding that the right to be secure in one’s
home from unreasonable searches and seizures did not extend to open fields. But in
the nearly 60 years between Hester and Oliver, the issue had become so muddled
that the Supreme Court felt compelled to re-address the issue to resolve “the confu-
sion the open fields doctrine has generated among the state and federal courts.”

Curtilage
\

The court in Oliver had no difficulty upholding the actions of state investigators
who ignored no trespassing signs and entered into a field to seize a marijuana crop.
In that case, two Kentucky state police officers drove onto a private farm to investi-
gate a claim that the farm owner was growing the marijuana. They drove past the
farmer’s home and got out at a gate with that displayed a no-trespassing sign. They
followed a path around the gate and walked for several hundred yards past a barn
and a camper. Despite shouts from an unidentified person advising the officers to
leave the property, the investigators continued on to find marijuana growing more
than a mile from the landowner’s home.
In ruling that Oliver had no expectation of privacy, and therefore, no Fourth
Amendment protections from the warrantless search in his fields, the court held the
rule of Hester v. United States may be understood as providing that an individual
may not legitimately demand privacy for activities conducted out of doors in fields,
except in the area immediately surrounding the home. This rule is true to the con-
ception of the right to privacy embodied in the Fourth Amendment. The Amend-
ment reflects the recognition of the Framers that certain enclaves should be free
from arbitrary government interference. For example, the Court, since the enact-
ment of the Fourth Amendment, has stressed the overriding respect for the sanctity
of the home that has been embedded in our traditions since the origins of the
Republic.
In contrast, open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities
that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveil-
lance. There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities, such
as the cultivation of crops, that occur in open fields. Moreover, as a practical mat-
ter, these lands usually are accessible to the public and the police in ways that a
home, an office, or commercial structure would not be. It is not generally true that
fences or “No Trespassing” signs effectively bar the public from viewing open
fields in rural areas.
The court likewise demolished any expectation of privacy for a homeowner with a 10-
foot-high privacy fence in California v. Ciraolo. In that case, the yard immediately
behind a home was within the curtilage, and a tall fence prohibited passersby from seeing
what was growing in the yard. The Court even acknowledged the resident had “a subjec-
tive expectation of privacy.” Nevertheless, the Court held that a search by an airplane fly-
ing over the yard was not a search entitled to Fourth Amendment protection. Since the
inspection by air did not involve a physical invasion into the curtilage, there was no legit-
imate privacy right. “What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own
home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection,” the Court ruled.
The idea that what can be seen from the air by anyone is not subject to Fourth
Amendment protections was again upheld in Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445 (1989).
In that case, police used a helicopter to fly over a greenhouse to view through slats
in the roof. Despite obvious efforts by the greenhouse owner to obscure the public’s
view, the Supreme Court approved the aerial search. In short, the Court held that
even though the greenhouse was within the curtilage of Riley’s home, Riley had no
reasonable expectation of privacy since the interior of the greenhouse was visible
from the air.
Garbage left in closed opaque plastic bags on the curb had been considered pri-
vate under California law until the Supreme Court ruling in California v. Greenwood,

156
Curtilage
\
486 U.S. 35 (1988). In that case, police investigators searched through trash bags
left for collection by the Greenwoods. Based on evidence of drug use found in the
garbage, police obtained a search warrant for the Greenwood residence. Inside
the home, police found various drugs, and the Greenwoods were prosecuted. The
defendants claimed the search of their garbage constituted an illegal search and sei-
zure under California law and the Fourth Amendment.
The Greenwood Court agreed that the couple may well have expected their pri-
vacy in the garbage to be protected and that the nature of their garbage bags would
not become public. Nevertheless, the court held the expectation unreasonable. “It is
common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street
are readily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members
of the public. Moreover, respondents placed their refuse at the curb for the express
purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have
sorted through respondents’ trash or permitted others, such as the police, to do so.”
The court also dismissed the Greenwoods’ reliance on state law.
This review of cases shows that while the concept of privacy within curtilage
technically survives, the courts have generally been unwilling to protect it.

Data brokers
Given the value of data about individuals, it is inevitable that someone will gather,
organize, and sell such data. Data brokers’ services vary to suit the needs of their cli-
ents. Marketers may want data that will help them reach their target audiences more
efficiently. Employers, lenders, insurance vendors, and others may want a variety of
information about a specific individual. A business may want detailed information
about people in a specific area for use in making a location decision. 
Data brokers may provide direct access to the data they collect by selling extracts from
their data, or they may provide a more restricted service, such as selling profiles of one
individual at a time. Their services may also include computing a score from a statistical
model, such as a score indicating the likelihood of fraud in a credit application.
Data brokers collect their data from a variety of sources, including
• Credit-granting consortiums (banks, department stores, credit card
issuers, etc.)
• Insurance or insurance applications
• Real estate transactions
• Tax records and property appraisals
• Product registrations
• Rebate forms
• Sweepstakes forms
• Store discount cards
• Telephone directories
• Billable telephone addresses
• Legal or criminal justice records
• Licensing (driver’s and other)
• Vehicle registrations
• News organizations
• Post office deliverable address counts
\
\

Data brokers
\
Some types of information may voluntarily be made public by the individual;
these might include personal websites and web logs (blogs). Other information
may also be given voluntarily but without the realization that the information might
be put to more generally use than the provider intended. Product registrations or a
registry of disaster victims fall in this category. A great deal of information is gath-
ered in the course of business transactions, some of which may be subject to legal
privacy restrictions and some not. Credit transactions, credit card balances, credit
limits, insurance applications, and purchases made with store discount cards are
examples. 
New data may be computed from existing data. Credit scores are computed from
a variety of statistics on an individual. Some data brokers even use statistical mod-
eling to calculate estimated data. A broker may, for example, calculate an average
household income for block groups based on United States Census data along
with data from magazine subscriptions, vehicle registrations, property appraisals,
post office deliverable address counts, and estimates by local governments. That
information could then be associated with an individual in connection with the
individual’s address.
Data brokers serve a variety of clients. These include law enforcement, land-
lords, employers, political parties, and stalkers. Data brokers exert varying degrees
of control over the use of their data, sometimes as restricted by law. Some take sub-
scriptions only from established businesses or government agencies, although such
a policy has not proven to be a foolproof method of preventing misuse. Data col-
lected by data brokers have potentially annoying applications, such as spam, and
may be devoted to potentially illegal purposes, including identity fraud or denial
of credit. 
Another potential problem with data brokers is the accuracy of their data. Data
may be entered incorrectly or data from the wrong person may be entered into a
database. For some types of data, such as credit data, legal requirements give indi-
viduals the opportunity to suggest corrections to the data collected about them.
Individuals generally have no say in how their personal facts are aggregated to gen-
erate a composite such as a credit score. Web search engines in a sense are data
brokers. Employers may search web pages using an applicant’s name and find
matches to the wrong person. In addition, statistical models can produce false posi-
tives, an example of which is an account flagged as likely to be fraudulent but that
is actually not.
Although there are laws that restrict the exchange of certain types of informa-
tion, such as health insurance information, credit information, or student records, a
great deal of information about individuals can be gathered and exchanged freely.
Given the easy availability of personal data, credit approvals can be made quickly,
appropriate medical treatment can be given, and consumers can hear about prod-
ucts they may want. All of these uses give the collection of personal data great
value. Unfortunately, the profitability associated with many misuses makes the data
an attractive target for theft when legal restrictions bar access.
The concern over security of collections of personal data extends to collec-
tions not made by commercial entities. The security of individual and business
census data, law enforcement records, and national security data collections is a
major privacy issue. For the latter collections the accuracy of the data is also a

major concern. If inaccurate information in the national security database prevents
you from flying, or if an inaccurate entry in a law enforcement database makes you
vulnerable to false arrest, how easily can you get that information corrected?

Data mining
Data mining can be defined as the use of statistical techniques to unearth previ-
ously undiscovered relationships from large volumes of data. The goal of data min-
ing may be classification, such as trying to identify whether an individual belongs
to a particular group, or it may be prediction, such as trying to identify those who
will spend the most at a website.
A wide range of commercial, governmental, charitable, educational, and medi-
cal organizations make use of data mining applications. Objectives of data mining
include
• Security. Based on the information known about an individual, is she likely
to associate with terrorists? Should she be placed on the “no fly” list?
Should she be targeted for additional investigation and surveillance? 
• Customer relations management. How can the information in a firm’s data-
base be used to identify products and services in order to increase a firm’s
bottom line? Say someone just bought the new Harry Potter book online.
How can that customer’s information be used to determine what other prod-
ucts he might be interested in?
• Political and charitable fundraising. What characteristics make it likely
that someone will send a contribution in response to a fundraiser’s mailing?
• Credit scoring. Based on the individual’s credit history, would it be a good
risk to give an applicant a 30-year mortgage?
• Fraud detection. What characteristics of an insurance claim make it likely
to be a fraudulent one? Was it really the cardholder who bought concert
tickets on his credit card, or was his card stolen? 
• Medical. What group of patients is most likely to benefit from a new treat-
ment? What cities are most at risk of a flu epidemic?
Data mining has exploded over the last decade due to several factors: First, the
amount of information available about individuals and events has expanded rapidly.
For example, many grocery stores use frequent-shopper cards to collect information
on purchases by individual customers. Digital images collected by surveillance cam-
eras, satellites, and other sources add to the diversity of data available to be mined.
Additionally, public records such as property tax assessments that previously were
on paper only are now commonly found online. Second, the organization of raw data

160
Data mining
\
in databases and data warehouses makes the exploration of large data collections fea-
sible. Third, the exponential growth that has occurred in computing power allows
firms and governments to run complex algorithms on extremely large databases. 
Data mining employs statistical algorithms to detect and explore patterns and
relationships. In other words, given the data, data mining creates one or models
This differs from traditional statistical analysis, in which models or hypotheses
come first and the researcher asks, “Do the data support my model?” Some of the
statistical techniques used in data mining are regression, decision tress, and neural
networks. With any of these techniques, one measure is chosen as a target variable.
The target variable may have discrete outcomes, such as “made purchase” versus
“did not make purchase” or “tax fraud” versus “no tax fraud.” Or it may have con-
tinuous outcomes, such as “amount of money spent.” Other measures or variables
are chosen as predictors, such as income, past spending, or education. Data mining
techniques then attempt to make the most accurate prediction of the target variable. 
Regressions try to fit an equation to the available data. The equation has inputs
and produces a predicted value. In traditional statistical analysis, the researcher
pre-specifies which subset of possible inputs should be included in the equation. In
a data mining approach, the researcher puts in all of the information at her disposal
and lets the algorithm choose what information actually is important. 
Decision tree analysis takes a different approach. This technique divides the data
into successively smaller groups, using rules to determine which divisions are best.
For example, a tree analysis might find that the most effective rule for predicting
the amount spent on books is to divide customers into those who earn over
$100,000 and those who do not. The second split might be to divide the “under
$100,000” group into those who have a college degree versus those who do not.
A neural network is a mathematical model that in some sense simulates a collec-
tion of nerve cells (neurons). Each neuron has a set of inputs and one output. The
outputs of neurons can connect to the inputs of other neurons. Each neuron
“learns” by changing the way it combines input values in proportion to the differ-
ence between the actual and predicted values of the target variable.
Data miners usually divide their large datasets into several parts or “samples.”
Possible relationships are “discovered” using multiple techniques on one sample of
data. Another subset of the data is used to establish how well each technique pre-
dicts the target variable. Data miners compare alternative techniques to see which
one works best on the new data subset. In some cases a regression model might
predict best, and in other cases the neural network might be best. These models
may also be applied to new samples of data. A financial institution might, for
example, develop a model to classify pending credit card purchases as either
fraudulent or valid. The model can be applied to new purchases as they happen and
be used to authorize the purchase.
Data mining offers a number of social benefits. The techniques have been used to
reveal and then rectify fraudulent Medicare claims. Several states now use data min-
ing techniques to direct tax audits at those returns that are predicted to contain fraud
or error. Pharmaceutical companies have begun to incorporate data mining in the
drug discovery process in an effort to predict if a compound will have toxic effects.
Hospitals use data mining results to design emergency room protocols to deliver

Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721 (1969)
›
161
more effective patient care. On the commercial front, businesses have employed data
mining to target advertising campaigns and to improve customer service.
Data mining also raises serious privacy concerns in a number of areas. For
example, people may be misclassified. Even a good model predicts only that people
with a certain set of attributes are statistically likely to possess the target attribute.
Some people might be denied a mortgage based on a creditworthiness model even
though they actually would make all their payments on time. A larger concern is
the misapplication of data mining techniques. A model that excluded whole neigh-
borhoods from mortgages, for example, would be effectively redlining. Data may
also be used for unauthorized purposes. Information from a consumer’s warranty
form may be used in data mining applications unrelated to the provider’s intent.
Some data are legally protected. Data collected from patients by a health care
provider are protected from disclosure by law. Although it might not be illegal,
data mining that uses other, unprotected data to proxy the protected data certainly
violates the spirit of the law.
Because data mining may be effective in the aggregate, however, the very exist-
ence of these techniques creates some threat to privacy by creating a demand for
data to input to the model. The desire to identify potential terrorists leads to pres-
sure to supply more personal data to mine for suspects. What can get lost in the
face of this pressure is the careful consideration of whether it is good for society in
the long run to have public access to personal information such as a person’s
library records or genotype. It is conceivable, for example, that accurate predic-
tions of the likelihood of developing certain diseases can be made based on an indi-
vidual’s genotype. What are the social implications of making these individuals
ineligible for health insurance as a result of their genotype not being kept private?

Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721 (1969)
In Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721 (1969), the United States Supreme Court
held that the taking of fingerprints is covered by the Fourth Amendment prohibition
against unreasonable searches and seizures. Fourteen-year-old John Davis was fin-
gerprinted during a rape investigation in Meridian, Mississippi. The victim could give
no description of her assailant other that that he was a “Negro youth.” The police exe-
cuted a “dragnet” investigation, interrogating suspects and taking fingerprints.
Davis’s fingerprints, which were recorded on two occasions, matched latent finger
and palm prints taken from the scene of the crime. He was convicted and sentenced to
life in prison. The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the conviction.

162
Decisional privacy
\
On appeal, the state conceded that they did not have probable cause to arrest
Davis at the time they took his fingerprints. The majority opinion, written by Jus-
tice William Brennan, held that Davis’s fingerprint was the fruit of an illegal
search, and the evidence must therefore be excluded from trial. Davis’s conviction
was reversed. The court made clear, however, that Fourth Amendment protection
applied not to the fingerprints themselves, the taking of which was not overly intru-
sive, but to the arrest for the purpose of taking fingerprints. Moreover, the appre-
hension without probable cause had involved an interrogation and a redundant
second request for fingerprints. The Court left open the possibility that the police
could request or demand fingerprints from citizens with something less than proba-
ble cause, using “narrowly circumscribed procedures.” Some states subsequently
passed statutes authorizing detention for recording physical characteristics based
on a standard less than probable cause.
Justice Hugo Black dissented, viewing the decision as an excessive expansion of
the scope of the Fourth Amendment. Justice Potter Stewart also dissented, calling
the reversal a “useless gesture.” Stewart argued that fingerprints were not “evi-
dence” in the conventional sense because, even if they were “wrongfully seized,”
they could be “identically reproduced and lawfully used at any subsequent trial.” 
Today, the primary importance of Davis is in the context of DNA evidence. The
legality of “DNA dragnets” has been much discussed, and Davis is one of the key
precedents in that debate. While some scholars argue that Davis makes DNA drag-
nets unconstitutional, others claim that the decision’s apparent allowance of limited
detentions to record fingerprints would apply to DNA recording as well, especially
if the DNA were limited to nondiagnostic identifying characteristics, as opposed to
the entire genome.

Declaration of Independence
No document better distilled American Revolutionary thought regarding liberal
equality than the Declaration of Independence. It adapted philosopher John
Locke’s notion of inalienable human rights and the government’s duty to its citi-
zens. On the motion of Virginian Richard Henry Lee, which John Adams of Massa-
chusetts seconded, the Continental Congress established a committee to draft the
document. The committee was composed of Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger
Sherman, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert R. Livingston. They assigned the actual
writing to 33-year-old Thomas Jefferson. He understood that his task was “[n]ot to

find out new principles, or new arguments, never before thought of” but to express
widely held convictions of “the American mind.” His success lay in the document’s
concise natural rights formulation of Revolutionary argument. Members of the
Continental Congress signed the Declaration on July 4, 1776, but they had voted
for the actual act of independence on July 2.
The Declaration explained the reason for breaking away from England within
the context of ethical theory. The manifesto took for granted the self-evidence of
natural human equality. It prohibited despotic rule without the people’s consent.
The people had no obligation to remain the subjects of a government that infringed
on their co-equally inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A
litany of accusations against George III followed. They were meant to show that
the king’s despotic rule had forced the colonists’ hand, leaving them no choice but
to declare their independence. The Declaration asserted that a divine natural order
granted all people equal and inalienable rights. The power of government was
derived from the will of the people who could overthrow any authority that failed to
safeguard their happiness and could subsequently form a new nation.
Despite the Declaration’s bold assertion of rights, it lacked an explicit censure of
slavery or slave importation. This was no accident. Jefferson’s original draft had
accused King George of acting “against human nature itself” by keeping open an
international slave trade that violated the “rights of life and liberty in the persons of
a distant people.” But when South Carolina objected to that clause, the Continental
Congress excised it from the final draft.
This wavering of principles did not efface the Declaration’s vision for creating a
nation dedicated to preserving civil rights, which later generations understood to
include the right to privacy. Its doctrine, as Samuel Adams said nearly 30 years
after the states ratified it, became part of “the political creed of the United States.”
This creed prohibited tyranny and committed the national government to achieving
the common good rather than pandering to the interests of any individual, family,
or class. To many groups, the Revolution brought no relief for their political impo-
tence, but the implications of the Declaration were profound for all future genera-
tions willing to put the creed into sincere legal operation. The ethical perspective of
the manifesto demanded unabated national self-criticism to address shortcomings
related to the demands of America’s statement of purpose. A hurdle of constitu-
tional doctrine that faced the advocates of civil rights, such as revolutionary aboli-
tionists and feminists, was the Declaration’s lack of an enforcement mechanism.
The principles it espoused said something about the American people, but it little
benefited those under the immediate yoke of subordination.
For the Revolutionary generation, the Declaration was intrinsic to American
civil culture. In the decades that followed, Fourth of July commemoration was cel-
ebrated throughout the country. At one of those events in the1790s, John Quincy
Adams, who would become the sixth president of the United States, asserted, “The
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States are parts of
one consistent whole, founded upon one and the same theory of government.”
Although in legal terms the Declaration did not dictate the passage of any particu-
lar law, instigate any police action, or mandate the interpretation of any case, it pro-
vided all three branches of government with a sense of normative purpose. The
Declaration of Independence also served as a measuring stick against which the

164
Declaration of Independence
\
people could evaluate governmental conduct. But because it was only a general
statement, liberty and equality were often cast aside for personal gain or exploita-
tion, with little or no federal response. The country that asserted its affinity to uni-
versal equality found excuses for the misappropriation of slave labor and the
exclusion of women from many privileges of citizenship.
Fortunately, the story of the Declaration did not end with the Revolutionaries but
became a legacy to shape the conscience of future generations. Abolitionists con-
sidered it the cornerstone of a government committed to protecting individual
rights for the entire populace, regardless of race. They grounded demands for the
immediate liberation of slaves in the Declaration’s self-evident truth of equal free-
dom. To them slavery was inimical to the immutable law of nature, designed to
keep African Americans subjugated to the whims of their oppressors.
Abraham Lincoln, even before he became president, explicitly accepted much of
the abolitionist view against slavery, which he called a “great moral wrong” that
offended the Declaration’s “fundamental principles of civil liberty.” In the Declara-
tion, he found an egalitarian ethic that served as “the great fundamental principle
upon which our free institutions rest.” Dealing with secession and Civil War, Lin-
coln seemed to elevate the Declaration above the Constitution, finding in it princi-
ples of “liberty to all” and the proposition of equality that would enable the nation
to achieve a “new birth of freedom.”
After the Civil War, the majority in Congress were filled with a fervor stemming
from the Declaration’s self-evident truths about the inalienability of fundamental
rights. Congressmen like Representative Thaddeus Stevens and Senator Charles
Sumner understood that racial inequality was incompatible with the country’s com-
mitment to the freedom and happiness of the whole. Most factions of the Recon-
struction Congress, during the 1860s and 1870s, were united in their desire to
further the values of the Declaration.
Legislators formulated constitutional amendments to provide Congress with the
power to enforce the Declaration’s ideals. Those changes to the Constitution in
effect made the federal government the guarantor of the rights promised in the Dec-
laration of Independence. As Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax explained,
“The Declaration of Independence must be recognized as the law of the land, and
every man, alien and native, white and black, protected in the inalienable and God-
given rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” The Reconstruction
amendments imported principles of governance from the Declaration into the Con-
stitution. By tying the conception of the Declaration with the Constitution, they
intrinsically connected guarantees of fundamental rights, such as those of the Bill
of Rights, with national citizenship. This meant that states could not trump nation-
ally recognized rights, shifting authority to the national government in matters of
group discrimination.
The Thirteenth Amendment’s abolition of slavery was predicated on the enlight-
ened notion of universal human liberty. Indiana Representative Godlove S. Orth,
for instance, expected the Thirteenth Amendment to “be a practical application of
that self-evident truth” of the Declaration “‘that [all men] are endowed by their cre-
ator with certain unalienable rights; that among these, are life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness.’” Private actors were henceforth prohibited from any badges and

incidents of involuntary servitude that kept people from enjoying the scope of free-
dom that should have been secured at the nation’s founding.
When questions were raised about the effectiveness of the Thirteenth Amend-
ment, work began on the Fourteenth Amendment to realize the ends implicit in the
Declaration’s statement on governmental purpose. The Equal Protection Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment was most clearly tied to the ideals that the Revolution-
aries had espoused. It placed authority in the federal government to protect funda-
mental rights against any contrary state laws or state-sponsored actions. The Due
Process Clause likewise protected the inalienable right to liberty against arbitrary
state intrusions. Substantive due process brings privacy within the purview federal
liberty interests.
The Fourteenth Amendment’s arguably implicit importation of equality princi-
ples from the Declaration into the Constitution provided the impetus for numerous
Supreme Court privacy decisions. The Court has relied on these underlying notions
of liberty and equality in such key privacy cases as Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U.S. 479 (1965) (concerning intimacy and the use of contraceptives); Roe v. Wade,
410 U.S. 113 (1973) (on abortion rights); and Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558
(2003) (dealing with homosexual intimacy).

Digital cash
The 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta caught the attention of a number of privacy
advocates when the Olympic facilities refused to accept cash. To some observers,
this development foreshadowed the coming of a cashless society where digital
forms of payment would completely replace paper money. 
In the twenty-first century, a growing proportion of economic transactions rely
on electronic forms of payment, such as credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards,
and electronic fund transfers (EFTs). Electronic forms of payment offer consumers
a number of benefits. Electronic funds transfers, such as automatic billing, allow
consumers to avoid the hassles of the checkbook. They ensure timely payment,
eliminating the problem of late fees. Prepaid cards enable consumers to obtain spe-
cific services, such as mass transit, with greater ease. Debit and credit cards elimi-
nate the inconvenience of cash shortages. They also provide a sense of security as
they incorporate some protections against lost or stolen cards. Furthermore, some
forms of retail, such as e-commerce, depend on electronically completed transac-
tions. While the digital direction of modern commerce does offer consumers new
conveniences, it also raises privacy questions.

Although the replacement of lost or stolen cash depends entirely on the good
grace of others, cash does offer an important advantage with respect to privacy:
consumer anonymity. The paper money used to pay for a good or service leaves no
record of the purchaser. Conversely, every commercial exchange that is electroni-
cally mediated generates an electronic “paper trail”: data that may be compiled,
stored, and merged for the purpose of generating consumer profiles. Banks, credit
bureaus, and other financial institutions can sell such transaction-generated data
on the information market to data brokers and direct marketers. The compilation
and exchange of personal information recorded from electronic payments thus sus-
tains an assortment of intrusive marketing techniques such as telemarketing,
spam, and junk mail. Aside from its use for marketing purposes, the electronic
“paper trail” is available to law enforcement personnel who can assess such infor-
mation. Purchasing records enable investigators to identify items bought and sold,
as well as the whereabouts of any citizen. 
Electronic forms of payment also make consumers vulnerable to criminal inva-
sions of privacy, including identity fraud or theft. One’s exposure to cash loss is
limited to the quantity of money that the individual carries on his or her person, but
the potential financial loss from credit or debit cards is far greater. Debit cards
present the highest risk. Unlike credit cards, where the law limits the cardholder’s
liability to $50, the consumer’s legal liability is unlimited with debit cards. Addi-
tionally, since payment occurs immediately, the consumer has no time to contest a
charge and no leverage to withhold payment. 
In summary, while the acceptance of a variety of new forms of electronic pay-
ment indicates that both consumers and marketers appreciate the associated conve-
niences, these innovations also have the potential to inflict financial damage far
beyond what is possible with the use of cash.

Digital signatures
“On the Internet no one knows you’re a dog,” reads the caption of the iconic
New Yorker cartoon. That lack of identifiability is great for maintaining one’s ano-
nymity but creates difficulty in using the Internet to conduct online transactions.
There needs to be a way to bind an entity to the information that is being provided.
Digital signatures do exactly that.
Digital signatures were invented by Whtifield Diffie and Martin Hellman in
1975. The signatures rely on public-key cryptography, whose security is based on
what appear to be difficult mathematical problems. Public-key algorithms work by
the publication of a “public key” with which messages are encrypted by the sender,

while the receiver has secret information, the “private key,” with which to decrypt
the message. The system succeeds because a particular mathematical function is
computed quickly whereas the inverse computation is slow.
In digital signatures, the roles of the public and private keys are reversed. The
sender—in order to prove that he or she is indeed the sender of the electronic
packet—wraps the information (or a shortened version of it, called a hash) in cryp-
tography keyed by the sender’s private key. Because the sender’s public key is pub-
lic information, anyone receiving the message can unwrap it, but that is not the
issue.
In digital signatures the concern is linking the message to the sender. The com-
putational complexity of the signature function makes it highly unlikely that any-
one other than the sender could sign the message, and this enables authentication
of the communication. The computations involved are too complex for a human to
perform; it is actually the sender’s machine that computes the digital signature. If
the sender’s machine has been corrupted, or if the sender contracts with a third
party to do the signing, this could lead to counterfeiting—the transmission of other
data signed using the sender’s private key. Of course, this is no different from the
off-line world, where counterfeit signatures are also a possibility.
All data exchange between computers must occur according to a fixed protocol
so that the machine correctly interprets the received bits; this is the purpose of stan-
dards. In 1992 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the arm
of the U.S. government responsible for setting standards for information security
for its civilian agencies, sought a digital signature standard. 
The RSA algorithm was the first practical public-key method for digital signa-
tures, and the RSA signature scheme had been in use since the early 1980s (when
the algorithm’s main application was machine-to-machine authentication of soft-
ware configurations). The NIST now proposed that a different algorithm be used:
DSA. The DSA choice was problematic: the algorithm been designed by the
National Security Agency (whose process was not transparent), appeared to be sub-
ject to possible patent infringement problems, and was deemed too short—and thus
easier to break and counterfeit—to be fully secure. Public objections resulted in
changes to the proposed standard, the most important of which was a variable key
size, enabling appropriate security. 
Digital signatures simplify technical data exchange, allowing machines to
“sign” information about their software, as well as online contractual arrange-
ments. The latter, of course, require laws recognizing the validity of digital signa-
tures, and many nations now have such laws. 
Often technologies developed for one purpose are subsequently used for
another. Internet websites operate more efficiently if they can identify repeat “cus-
tomers,” and many sites attempt to do so, sometimes using digital signatures for
authentication. Because digital signatures precisely identify the sender (or the
sender’s machine), there is the capability of aggregating user information. Such
problems can be avoided through the use of digital signatures with technology to
ensure anonymity.

Dirkes v. Borough of Runnimede, 936 F. Supp. 235 (1996)
In Dirkes v. Burough of Runnimede, the United States District Court, District of
New Jersey, decided that the dissemination of the video rental history of a former
police officer and his wife violated the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988.
Accordingly, the court allowed the case to proceed against numerous defendants,
including the Borough of Runnimede, the Borough of Runnimede Police Depart-
ment, and several Borough of Runnimede police officers who secured the former
officer’s rental information in the course of a disciplinary investigation. Although it
was heard by a relatively low-level court, the case represents one of the strongest
defenses of privacy protection ever made in a court case; indeed, it recalls and
quotes numerous historical texts promoting the heightened importance of maintain-
ing individual privacy protections in the modern era. 
The case centered on an investigation of and disciplinary action against the
plaintiff, Chester Dirkes, who was formerly a police officer in the Borough of Run-
nimede Police Department. The department alleged that during the course of an
investigation, Dirkes had removed pornographic magazines and videotapes from a
citizen’s home. The department then issued a disciplinary notice and suspended
Dirkes without pay or benefits. Although he was acquitted of the charges in a for-
mal trial held a few weeks later, the Borough hired special counsel and resumed its
internal affairs investigation against Dirkes.
To aid in this continued investigation, one of the police officers working on the
case obtained the names and rental dates of several pornographic videotapes rented
by Dirkes and his wife. The officer gathered this information from an employee of
Videos to Go, an establishment that Dirkes apparently visited regularly to rent vid-
eotapes. In obtaining this information, the police officer did not obtain a search
warrant, a subpoena, or any sort of formal court order. Instead, he simply asked
for and received the information from the employee at the store. As a result of this
investigation, this private information was circulated and disclosed to numerous
people at various proceedings, including one before the Superior Court of New Jer-
sey, Camden County.
Dirkes and his wife then filed suit against numerous defendants, alleging the
violation of two provisions of the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C.
ß2710), as well as common law privacy rights. The court found that these claims
were valid and enforceable against all the defendants given the broad construction
of the act.
The court began its analysis by quoting several famous articles and discussions
emphasizing the importance of an individual’s privacy. The court noted that the

169
Privacy Act of 1974, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Tax Reform Act of
1976, the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, and the Cable Communications
Policy Act of 1984 all confirm that Congress reserves extensive protections against
disclosures of citizens’ personal information, particularly in the modern era of
increasing technological advancement, in which the risk of disclosure is much
greater. The court quoted numerous Supreme Court opinions stressing this point,
including Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928), in which Louis Brandeis,
in a famous dissent, argued that the “right to be let alone” is “the most compre-
hensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized man.” Thus, the court con-
cluded, “Consistent with this principle, in construing the scope of the [Video
Privacy Protection] Act, this Court must strive to protect this aspect of an individ-
ual’s right to privacy in the face of technological innovations that threaten this fun-
damental right.”
The court found it undisputable that the defendants violated the Video Privacy
Protection Act; the violation simply was not an issue. Instead, the court focused
its analysis on which defendants were properly charged as violators. The court
ultimately rejected the argument that only the video outlet that revealed the pri-
vate rental information of Dirkes and his wife could be properly sued by them.
On the contrary, the court found “that those parties who are in possession of per-
sonally identifiable information as a direct result of an improper release of such
information are subject to suit under the Act. Because it is undisputed that [one
of the police officers], the Department, and the Borough all possess the informa-
tion as a direct result of a violation of the Act, each is a proper defendant.” Thus,
by broadly interpreting the reach of the statute based on its high regard for indi-
vidual privacy, the court maximized the protection of individual privacy in this
case.

Disclosures
Disclosures can take many forms and come from a variety of sources. These
forms and sources of disclosure determine the nature of any associated threat to
privacy and the character of privacy protections.

170
Disclosures
\
Disclosures by government may be the most damaging to privacy. They can
arise from the application of laws that address interests other than privacy. Three
important areas demonstrate how disclosures permitted or required by law may
affect privacy. In one of these areas, public financial disclosure, the government
requires high-ranking government employees to provide private information,
which is then disseminated by the government. This tolerance of disclosure is
grounded in the need to protect government programs from conflicts of interest or
corruption and to reassure the public of the integrity of the public sector. 
In the second area, litigation, the government, through the courts, requires the
disclosure of private information by parties seeking redress or defending them-
selves in civil litigation. Although such disclosure may often be voluntary, the
courts possess the authority to require the parties, as well as third persons, to pro-
vide information that may threaten privacy. Increasingly critics have challenged the
ways in which the courts reconcile the need for information in litigation with limi-
tations on disclosure.
In the third of these areas, protection of whistleblowers, the government encourages
the disclosure of information in order to defend a variety of public interests. These dis-
closures may include private information. The degree of risk to privacy from these dis-
closures depends on the definition of permitted versus prohibited disclosures, the
standards for disclosure, and the identity of those to whom disclosures may be made. 
An examination of these three areas shows how privacy protection permeates
government activities that rely on disclosures of information. It also demonstrates
that the definition of privacy and the means of its protection are affected by the
context of these disclosures.
Disclosures can also protect privacy. For example, the access to and correction
of records permitted by the Privacy Act of 1974 reduce the likelihood of the gov-
ernment maintaining inaccurate or false information. Disclosures likewise expose
and thereby deter government invasions of privacy. In this regard, the disclosures
required by public records law and volunteered by whistleblowers support rather
than threaten privacy.
Public financial disclosure laws provide public access to information regarding
the private financial affairs of public employees. Employees subject to these laws
must submit required information or face criminal and civil penalties, including
administrative sanctions. Such laws seek to increase public confidence in govern-
ment, to alter the perceptions about and conduct of public employees, and to
encourage debate regarding conflict-of-interest provisions. The majority of states
had adopted some form of public financial disclosure laws prior to the enactment
of the federal Ethics in Government Act of 1978. 
The Ethics in Government Act illustrates the scope of disclosures under these
laws and their effect on privacy. The Act also demonstrates ways in which these
disclosure laws address concerns about privacy. The Ethics in Government Act
applies to high-level government officials and civil servants. The act requires these
employees to file disclosure forms that are then made available to the public. The
forms direct the reporting of a variety of financial interests, including earned and
unearned income, financial transactions, compensation received, and positions held
in businesses and nonprofit organizations. The disclosure forms call for consider-
able detail regarding the reporting of gifts and income.

Critics attack financial disclosure laws as invasions of the right of privacy of
affected government officials. Legal challenges to the provisions on this ground,
however, have proved to be unsuccessful. Despite the failure of most judicial chal-
lenges, criticisms based on the infringement of privacy have had an influence on
these laws. In the act, Congress sought to limit the information reported to the
types of financial interests likely to involve conflicts of interest. Congress also
sought to reduce administrative burdens and intrusions on financial privacy.
The Ethics in Government Act limits the reporting of assets and liabilities to
broad bands of value and places minimum value on the compensation and gifts that
must be disclosed. The act incorporates other protections for reporting employees,
including the review of reports prior to disclosure, destruction of reports after six
years, and penalties if the reports are used for unlawful purposes or for commercial
interests such as solicitation.
Public financial disclosure not only may affect the privacy of employees but also
may infringe on the privacy of others. Many financial disclosure laws include the
financial interests of spouses and other close relatives among those that must be
reported by employees. Infringement of the privacy of third persons seems less jus-
tified, and some state courts have struck down the requirement to report the assets
of a spouse. 
Although the privacy interests of third persons demand special consideration,
the exclusion of the financial interests of close relatives invites evasion. The Ethics
in Government Act includes the financial interests of spouses of employees but
seeks to accommodate the privacy interests of third persons by allowing exemp-
tions that limit the circumstances in which their financial interests must be
reported. These exemptions emphasize factors such as a spouse’s independent
receipt of gifts or independent property holdings. 
Persons who bring or defend civil litigation are subject to rules designed to pro-
vide other parties with information regarding claims and defenses. These rules
allow discovery of documents, the questioning of witnesses under oath, physical
and mental examinations, and interrogatories to other parties. These discovery
devices enable the parties to address fairly and efficiently the merits of claims and
defenses. However, they also give parties extensive information about others,
including much information that is private—personal finances, membership and
donor lists of private associations, physical and psychological data, private associa-
tions and affiliations, and personal attributes and items of conduct.
The disclosure of this information, acquired under the authority of the courts, by
parties to the litigation threatens personal privacy, invites abuse, encourages intimi-
dation, and discourages individuals from seeking redress in the courts. As a result,
judges have the authority to order parties not to disclose or promulgate this infor-
mation except in the context of the litigation itself. These “protective orders” are
common and important safeguards of the judicial process and of privacy.
Critics of the authority of judges to issue these protective orders assert that these
orders have been used to deny the public and government agencies information
about public health and safety. In response, several states have enacted provisions
that restrict the ability of judges to limit the disclosure of health and safety infor-
mation acquired by the parties in litigation. One of the broadest of these provisions,
the Florida Sunshine in Litigation Act, prohibits protective orders to prevent the

172
Disclosures
\
disclosure of information regarding a public hazard. The definition of public haz-
ard encompasses information about any person who has caused or is likely to cause
injury—a definition that may place some private information about individuals
beyond the scope of protective orders. 
Private information may be disclosed in other ways during litigation. Many liti-
gation documents, such as pleadings, motions, and judicial rulings, are public
records. In addition, the common law and the Constitution provide access to court
proceedings and to rulings that terminate or conclude the litigation. Some courts
have extended this right to documents filed by the parties in regard to such rulings.
Although courts have the authority to close proceedings and to seal records, these
actions are unusual.
Access to litigation materials illustrates how the electronic revolution has altered
the character of disclosures accompanying public documents. Electronic dissemina-
tion makes the disclosure of information contained in litigation widely available
throughout the world. For example, persons who file for bankruptcy may face the dis-
closure of much private information. Parties in a variety of types of litigation face the
disclosure of medical files, tax and employment records, and personal identifiers. 
Scholars disagree as to whether the medium of disclosure should affect the
determination of what constitutes a public record. Some argue that access to judi-
cial records should remain the same regardless of the medium of disclosure
because a person has no expectation of privacy in public records. Others argue that
electronic disclosure alters the expectation of practical obscurity that litigants
appropriately held when documents were available only in paper form at a specific
physical location. 
The practices of the federal courts illustrate both the importance of public access
through the Internet and the risks to privacy posed by such access. The software
Public Access to Court Electronic Records, which enables users to access docu-
ments over the Internet, permits a person, at a small cost per page, to view case file
documents, listings of case parties, reports on case-related information, chronolo-
gies of such information, claims registers, judgments, and case status information,
as well as a nationwide party and case index. 
On the other hand, courts retain the right to deny access to court files by weigh-
ing the interest in privacy against the presumption of public access. The courts may
also consider other interests arguing against disclosure, including the likelihood of
pretrial publicity, impairment of law enforcement, and judicial efficiency. Model
rules developed by the Judicial Conference of the United States permit courts to
require the redaction of certain private information in court filings for bankruptcy
and criminal cases. For example, in criminal cases certain personal information and
identifiers may be withheld, including Social Security numbers exclusive of the
last four digits; financial account numbers, except for the last four digits; names of
minor children other than their initials, the month and day of birth, and home
addresses other than the city and state. 
Because the system of electronic access requires registration, it can track the
accessing of particular documents by each user. This tracking is justified as a deter-
rent to possible abuse. 
The federal government and most states protect from reprisals both public-
and private-sector employees who disclose information regarding certain types of

misconduct by their employers or by others. In addition, the federal government
and many states have false claims laws that encourage disclosures of fraudulent
claims against the government by providing that whistleblowers receive a portion
of any amounts recovered on behalf of the government. Whistleblower laws sup-
port the rule of law, the prevention of corruption, the discovery and deterrence of
misconduct, and protection of the public from health and safety risks and from
financial losses. Protected disclosures, however, may contain private informa-
tion, including financial and medical data. 
These statutes address the protection of privacy in a number of ways. First, they
prohibit certain disclosures. The prohibitions can be broad, such as one that denies
protection for any disclosure barred by law, or more narrow, such as ones incorpo-
rating only specific prohibitions. Broad prohibitions encompass any privacy law
that prohibits the disclosure of certain information. More narrow ones must specif-
ically incorporate any privacy protections.
Second, the standard for disclosure influences the number of disclosures that can
be made and perhaps the risk to privacy. Most statutes require that the whistleblower
have a reasonable belief that the disclosed information evidences violation of the
types of misconduct addressed by the law. Some statutes require that the misconduct
in fact exist for the whistleblower to receive protection, and a few protect a disclosure
made solely on the basis of a good faith belief of wrongdoing. More disclosures are
likely under the good faith standard than under the standard of wrongdoing in fact.
Third, these statutes address to whom disclosures may be made. Some statutes
permit disclosures to the public at large; other statutes limit them to certain public
bodies or law enforcement agencies. A few permit otherwise prohibited disclosures
to be made to special officials with the authority to address the issues raised by
such disclosures. 
Usually, the same standard for disclosures applies regardless of the party to
whom the disclosures may be directed. In other cases, the standard for disclosure
can vary depending upon the person or entity to whom the disclosure is made. For
example, disclosures within a company or agency may be subject to the most
lenient standard, disclosures to regulatory or law enforcement agencies marked by
a more demanding standard, and disclosures to the public associated with the most
demanding standard for disclosure.
Whistleblower laws place the responsibility for disclosures on the individual.
Protected disclosures may be made even though an employee’s agency or company
might have decided not to release the information. Whistleblower protection vindi-
cates this responsibility and uses it to advance important public interests. Individ-
ual responsibility, however, allows employees to resolve information disclosure
issues differently than the institutions for which they work. This difference
between individual choice and institutional policy has implications for the protec-
tion of privacy.
Of course, leaks and anonymous disclosures pose even greater threats to privacy.
These types of disclosures are not bounded by the judgments contained in whistle-
blower laws. Effective laws may reduce the likelihood of leaks by encouraging dis-
closures under legal standards. The possibility of unauthorized disclosures
threatening privacy justifies the information management requirements of some
privacy laws and their emphasis on security.

\
It is perhaps easier to see how disclosures can threaten privacy than to under-
stand how they protect it. The access provisions of the Privacy Act illustrate the
protective character of disclosures. By permitting individual to examine records
pertaining to them, the Privacy Act gives individuals the ability to evaluate the
information contained in these records and to judge the compliance of the govern-
ment or employer with the information management requirements of the law. Dis-
closures in these circumstances serve to protect rather than to threaten privacy.
Likewise, disclosures by whistleblowers can help to secure rights to privacy.
Disclosures exposing the illegal collection, management, and use of information by
the government or by private parties deter such abuses. These disclosures also
allow a response to abuses at a time when the damage to affected individuals may
be limited. These disclosures encourage legal and political actions to guarantee
effective privacy protection. 
In the context of the regulation of information held by the government, disclo-
sures can reflect opposing government views of privacy. Privacy scholar Alan Wes-
tin emphasizes the relationship between access and privacy in democratic
governments. He defines democracy and authoritarianism in terms of information
policy. Authoritarian governments are identified by ready government access to
information about the activities of citizens and by extensive limitations on the abil-
ity of citizens to obtain information about the government. In contrast, democratic
governments are marked by significant restrictions on the ability of government to
acquire information about its citizens and by ready access by citizens to the infor-
mation about the activities of government. Rather than being inexorably in conflict,
disclosure and privacy are both intertwined with democratic accountability.

DNA and DNA Banking
DNA is the abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule encoding
genetic information that is found in the nucleus of all human cells, except mature
red blood cells. It controls the structure, function, and behavior of cells and
determines individual hereditary characteristics. DNA banking involves the collec-
tion and storage of bodily specimens that contain DNA, the storage of strands of
DNA extracted from such specimens, and the maintenance of databases of
sequenced DNA. According to an inventory commissioned by the National Bioeth-
ics Advisory Committee in 1999, specimens of human material that contain DNA
are collected from approximately 20 million individuals per year and stored in col-
lections ranging in size from less than 200 specimens to more than 92 million.

Given this proliferation of DNA banking, a significant portion of the general public
has or soon will have their DNA stored in a DNA repository. These repositories,
sometimes referred to as DNA banks, tissue banks, gene banks or biobanks, can
differ in many respects. A DNA bank may be organized as a public, private, non-
profit, or commercial entity that exists for a discrete period of time or indefinitely,
depending on its purposes. Some repositories store DNA as an unintended conse-
quence of possessing bodily material that has been collected for other uses. Other
repositories store bodily specimens (e.g., blood, saliva, urine, sperm) specifically
because the specimens contain human DNA. Of the dedicated DNA repositories
only a few engage in DNA banking as an end in itself; most DNA banking is under-
taken to support activities such as biomedical research, law enforcement, or genea-
logical research. The purpose, size, storage technology, longevity, and corporate
status of the entity can influence the kind and degree of privacy risks presented by
its DNA banking and the extent to which its activities are regulated to reduce those
risks.
Since DNA is present in most human cells, it would be impossible to conduct
routine medical care and related laboratory services without collecting and banking
DNA. For example, blood banks and clinical, diagnostic, and pathology laborato-
ries routinely collect and process tissue samples for a variety of diagnostic and
therapeutic purposes with no intention of deriving genetic information from the
samples. This incidental DNA banking does not in itself raise privacy issues
beyond those associated with creating and maintaining personal medical informa-
tion. Although federal and state privacy laws that govern medical record keeping
and disclosures of health information undoubtedly apply to their activities, no
additional legal restraints are placed on these entities merely because they are in
possession of DNA samples. Most notably, institutions such as these are not
required by federal or state law to destroy specimens after a particular time, and
therefore they may retain specimens (and any information linked to them) based on
their specific storage capacity and internal policies. Consequently, the possibility, if
not the probability, of unauthorized access and misuse of samples is presented by
incidental DNA banking. Until the samples are either destroyed or stripped of indi-
vidual identifiers, this possibility entails some risk to personal privacy. 
Some companies bank DNA as a consumer service that is available to anyone
who is able to pay the requisite fees. This service has been marketed to parents as a
means of preserving their DNA or their children’s DNA to make it available if
needed for identifying missing persons or bodily remains. In this kind of DNA
banking, samples must be maintained in an identifiable form, but there is no need for
them to be linked to any personal information beyond identifiers and contact infor-
mation. Assuming that storage facilities fulfill their contractual obligations to safe-
guard the samples against unauthorized access, any personal genetic information
should remain encoded in the DNA, and banking under these conditions would
appear to present minimal risk to personal privacy. Nevertheless, commercial DNA
banking of this type is a new industry that is relatively unregulated in the United
States. It presents unresolved legal issues, including the degree of privacy protec-
tion available to those who purchase the banking services. For example, some
banks offer to store samples for 20 years or longer. What happens to the contractual
promises made to “depositors” in the event that a bank goes out of business, files

\
for bankruptcy protection, or merges with another entity is not clear. What such
banks are legally obligated or are permitted to do with samples that are unclaimed
when the term of storage expires or when storage fees are not paid has yet to be
addressed by any state or federal statute or court ruling. 
The concerns related to storing or banking DNA are compounded when banking
is done for purposes related to genetic information and testing. An individual’s
entire genome is encoded in each DNA sample collected from that individual.
Since DNA is relatively stable, there is no need to go back to an individual to col-
lect additional samples every time a new procedure for deriving information from
DNA becomes available. Therefore, possession and storage of a DNA sample pre-
sents the opportunity to access a wealth of information about that individual,
including information that could not be anticipated at the point in time the sample
was collected. Consequently, once steps are taken to preserve an individually iden-
tifiable sample for analysis, the risks to that individual’s privacy can be significant.
Given that an individual shares DNA to varying degrees with his or her genetic rel-
atives, those privacy implications may extend to family members as well. The pri-
mary risk is that unauthorized testing of DNA might result in strangers knowing
more about an individual’s genetic makeup than that person knows herself or wants
others to know. In response to these concerns, many states have enacted laws that
regulate the circumstances surrounding genetic testing. However, few of these laws
even mention the collection or storage of DNA samples and instead focus on what
constitutes adequate consent or authorization to conduct testing and to use or dis-
close test results. Moreover, these laws tend to be directed toward the behaviors of
insurers or employers and do not usually include a general prohibition against
secret or surreptitious collection and testing of DNA that is applicable to everyone. 
In 1998 the Icelandic Parliament enacted the Act on a Health Sector Database,
a law authorizing the collection and storage of the entire nation’s health informa-
tion and genetic material by a private biotechnology corporation and granting
that company, deCODE Genetics, an exclusive license to exploit the data. This
model of a national biobank ignited an ethical and legal debate about how
biobanks of such magnitude should be regulated. Specific questions were raised
about whether the planned methods for collection and storage of DNA samples
and personal information will adequately protect the privacy of the hundreds of
thousands of Icelanders involved. Much of the criticism of the Icelandic model
focused on its use of presumably open-ended consent for inclusion of Icelanders’
personal information in the databank as opposed to a voluntary, informed-
consent process. Doubts were also raised as to whether measures for protecting
data, such as the use of encryption techniques, were sufficient to guard against
breaches or disclosures of data. 
In the wake of the controversies over Iceland’s model for biobanking, planners
of other large-scale gene banks (e.g., in Estonia, the UK, Japan, and Quebec) are
experimenting with different approaches with regard to the structure, protocols,
and oversight of their banks to protect the interests of individuals who contribute
samples and information. Notable differences include the consent procedures that
the banks will employ, the extent of personal information that will be passed on to
researchers, and the measures that will be taken to prevent researchers from being
able to determine whose DNA and information they receive.

The United States has not yet set up a national DNA bank to support genetic
variation research that is comparable to the Icelandic project or the UK biobank.
Nevertheless, DNA banking is being pursued by a significant number of nonprofit
as well as for-profit entities in the United States. Several of the for-profit banks
function as brokers and intermediaries that facilitate research and don’t actually
conduct in-house research. This is significant because established laws and regula-
tions for the protection of human subjects in research do not apply to a broker
model of DNA banking. However, research laws, particularly the federal regula-
tions known as the Common Rule (codified at 45 CFR 46) will generally apply to
researchers that purchase samples and data from these broker-style banks. There-
fore, to satisfy concerns of their clients over compliance issues and to protect their
own options to directly engage in research at a later time, some banks have chosen
to design their protocols for collecting samples and information and for protecting
the privacy of their donors to be consistent with the federal research regulations.
Nevertheless, such compliance is voluntary, and in the absence of a federal law
imposing such rules on DNA banking or uniform state laws regulating these activi-
ties, the banks’ policies would not be enforceable.

Do-not-call registry
On June 27, 2003, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission opened the National
Do-Not-Call Registry (DNCR) in compliance with the Do-Not-Call Implementa-
tion Act. The DNCR is a registry of telephone numbers in the United States that
telemarketing firms are prohibited from calling. The act, which took effect March
31, 2003, also requires telemarketers to display their phone numbers on caller ID
devices and mandates that a live operator be on the line within two seconds of the
time the customer answers the phone. 
The DNCR was a joint establishment of the Federal Trade Commission and
the Federal Communications Commission in response to growing consumer frus-
tration over telemarketing calls. Telemarketing had been widely regarded as an
intrusion on personal privacy, violating consumers’ “right to be let alone” and
their anonymity. Industry estimates in 2002 indicated that telemarketers could ini-
tiate as many as 104 million calls per day to homes and business. Increases in the

178
“Don’t ask, don’t tell”
\
use of auto-dialers, which are used to deliver prerecorded messages to thousands
and to initiate phone calls while telemarketers are still pitching to other consumers,
exacerbated consumer aggravation. 
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) was the primary law
in place governing the conduct of telephone solicitation, but it was rendered inef-
fective because consumers had to separately request that each telemarketer be put
on the company-specific do-not-call lists, which were often ignored by telemarket-
ing companies. As a result, 30 states had set up their own do-not-call lists to regu-
late intrastate telemarketing by 2003. 
The federal rule required the National Do-Not-Call Registry to merge with sim-
ilar but less restrictive state lists. Beginning October 1, 2003, telemarketers would
be required to synchronize their databases every three months with the DNCR and
would face a maximum penalty of $11,000 for each call in violation. Tax-exempt
nonprofit organizations and calls of a political or religious nature would not be sub-
ject to the do-not-call requirements since they are not considered telephone solici-
tations under the TCPA. Telemarketing companies with an established business
relationship with a particular individual may also call up to 18 months after the last
business transaction unless the individual specifically asks the company not to call
again. 
Before its implementation on October 1, 2003, the DNCR was challenged in
federal district courts in Oklahoma and Colorado. The telemarketing industry
argued that the DNCR infringed on commercial speech by introducing unconstitu-
tional content-based restriction and that the FTC lacked adequate authority. Con-
gress reacted on October 2 by granting the FTC specific jurisdiction over the
enforcement the DNCR. The U.S. Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, on February 17,
2004, upheld the constitutionality of the DNCR, stating that the FTC had a legiti-
mate and substantial interest in protecting citizens’ privacy in terms of the right to
be left alone in their own homes. The court also justified the FTC’s decision target-
ing commercial telemarketing by citing complaint statistics presented in the legis-
lative history of the TCPA, which indicated that commercial telemarketing intruded
on personal privacy more than noncommercial solicitations. 
On October 23, 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court turned away an appeal by the
American Teleservices Association and refused to question the legitimacy of the
NDCP, which already had more than 63 million phone number registered.

“Don’t ask, don’t tell”
A person’s sexual orientation, and whether or not he or she discloses it to others,
is generally understood to be a private matter. The decision of the Supreme Court

in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), recognized that the constitutional right
of privacy encompasses adult consensual relationships and that homosexuals’
“right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in
their conduct without intervention of the government.” One major exception exists
with respect to employment in the United States military.
Federal law in the United States prohibits openly gay and lesbian people from
serving in the armed forces. The asserted rationale by military leaders for this pol-
icy of legalized discrimination focusing on status and not conduct is that the pres-
ence of openly gay and lesbian personnel would interfere with the military’s ability
to accomplish its mission. As with most things military, Congress defers to military
leaders to determine what is best for the military, including an institutionalized pol-
icy of employment discrimination. Although the late conservative senator Barry
Goldwater (R-AZ) observed that “[e]veryone knows that gays have served honor-
ably in the military since at least the time of Julius Caesar,” it is argued that
because heterosexuals have such antipathy for gay people, they would be unable
and unwilling to serve with them. A similar argument was made with respect to
racial integration of the armed forces. Although racial segregation has ended and
the practice of racial intolerance is banned, the military asserts that it is unable to
control or punish intolerance toward gay people. The United States is virtually
alone among Western military powers in banning openly gay personnel.
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is the common name for the federal law, enacted in
1993, and attendant regulations banning openly gay and lesbian service members.
While the previous policy prohibited service outright, the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”
standard allows gays and lesbians to serve in the military, but under drastic restric-
tions. Under the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” framework, the military is forbidden to
ask about the sexual orientation of a service member or recruit, and the service
member or recruit is not to reveal (in words or conduct) his or her sexual orienta-
tion. Engaging in sexual conduct with a member of the same sex, however, remains
grounds for discharge. The military is not to pursue suspected homosexuals with-
out credible evidence. The law is an attempted compromise between an outright
ban on gay service members and an end to discrimination.
It has long been the position of the U.S. military that homosexuality is incom-
patible with military service. In keeping with that official edict, in the 1980s, nearly
17,000 men and women were discharged on the grounds of homosexuality. By the
end of the 1980s, two decades after the start of the gay liberation movement, civil
rights groups had begun to push for an end to the military ban. Numerous social
scientists and military experts came forward to refute the premise that the presence
of gays and lesbians in the military had an adverse effect on the mission of the mil-
itary. Legal challenges were also mounted, albeit unsuccessfully. Public opposition
to discrimination against gays grew with news reports of brutal, unprovoked
attacks by service members against suspected gay comrades.
In 1992 then-candidate Bill Clinton, declaring the unfairness of the discrimina-
tory treatment of gays and lesbians, pledged to end the ban. After Clinton’s inaugu-
ration in 1993, it appeared that the military’s ban on gay personnel might be
overturned. But Clinton’s proposal to end the ban faced strong opposition from the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and members of Congress, who were spurred on by the politi-
cal opposition. President Clinton withdrew his campaign promise to lift the ban on

\
homosexuals in the armed forces and agreed to the compromise of “Don’t Ask,
Don’t Tell,” which was later amended to include “Don’t Pursue.”
As the civil rights group Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) has
observed, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue” signifies new limits to military
investigations and the intent to respect service members’ privacy: 
[The military] agreed to take steps to prevent anti-gay harassment. They agreed
to treat lesbian, gay and bisexual service members even-handedly in the criminal
justice system, instead of criminally prosecuting them in circumstances where they
would not prosecute heterosexual service members. They agreed to implement the
law with due regard for the privacy and associations of service members. 
However, SLDN also has concluded, “Intrusive questioning continues. Harass-
ment continues in epidemic proportions. Little regard for service member privacy
has been shown during the life of this law. Simply put, asking, pursuing, and harass-
ing have continued.”
A 1998 legal case illustrates the military’s refusal to comply with the letter and
spirit of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” as well as the implications of the policy for elec-
tronic privacy. In McVeigh v. Cohen, brought in federal court in Washington, D.C.,
the Navy was found to have engaged in a “witch hunt” to oust an 18-year veteran
and decorated sailor. The Navy was ultimately found to be in violation of “Don’t
Ask, Don’t Tell” and to have impermissibly invaded the sailor’s privacy in violation
of the federal Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986. The sailor, a mas-
ter chief petty officer, had used his AOL electronic mail account to collect toys at
holiday time for the children of his shipmates. A recipient felt that the username
associated with the e-mail account suggested the sailor was gay, and reported him.
The Navy commenced an investigation and, under false pretenses, convinced AOL
to reveal information about its subscriber, which the Navy used to confirm that the
sailor was gay. On that basis, the Navy sought to oust CPO McVeigh. United States
District Judge Stanley Sporkin enjoined the Navy from discharging McVeigh. He
found that the Navy, in addition to engaging in the prohibited witch hunt, had vio-
lated federal electronic privacy law in a way that suggested an era of snooping by
“Big Brother” government. AOL, whose terms of service promised privacy to its
subscribers, quickly settled with McVeigh.
In the same year McVeigh was decided (1998), the Defense Department released
a review of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” It acknowledged many improper investiga-
tions and recommended better training for those responsible. Improper investiga-
tions have declined since then but have yet to be completely eliminated. For
example, the Defense Language Institute has discharged highly trained linguists in
recent years, many with much-needed expertise in Arabic, because of alleged
homosexual conduct using criteria advocates believe were unwarranted. Since
“Don’t Ask, Don’t” tell became law, thousands of gay and lesbian service members
have been ejected from the military, at a projected cost of hundreds of millions of
dollars. The rate of discharge for homosexual conduct has declined in recent years,
which is historically consistent with discharge patterns in previous times of war.
The military is thought to be more lenient in its enforcement efforts in wartime due
to recruitment difficulties.
The McVeigh case represents one of the few successful legal challenges under
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Challenges to the constitutionality of the policy so far

Douglas, William O. (1898–1980)
William O. Douglas was born on October 16, 1898, in Maine, Minnesota, but he
spent much of his childhood in the state of Washington. In his youth Douglas
enjoyed hiking and fishing in the Cascade Mountains. His wilderness experiences
left a lasting impression on him, and he even published a semi-autobiographical
account about his rapturous love for the outdoors. After serving as the valedictorian
of his high school class, Douglas attended Whitman College on a full-tuition schol-
arship and graduated in 1920. After teaching for two years, he attended Columbia
Law School, graduating from there in 1925. After a brief stint in a major law firm,
Douglas taught at Columbia Law School and then at Yale Law School. 
His career was marked by a further spike when he became chairman of the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission (1937–1939). He did not stay there long, as Pres-
ident Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated him to the Supreme Court of the United
States, and the Senate quickly confirmed his appointment. He served on the Court
from April 17, 1939, when he was just 40 years old, to November 12, 1975—a
period longer than any of the Court’s other justices served. During that time, Dou-
glas wrote a record number of 1164 opinions and over 450 dissents. He worked
with almost one-third of all the other justices who had been appointed to the high-
est court before his retirement. 
For a time, Douglas contemplated resigning from the Court to occupy an emi-
nent office in the executive branch of government. In 1944, when the Democratic
Party nominated Roosevelt for a fourth presidential term, Douglas nearly became
the vice-presidential candidate on the ticket. Roosevelt’s top two choices for run-
ning mate were Douglas and Harry Truman. The president scribbled both names on
a piece of paper. Although there was some indication that Roosevelt preferred Dou-
glas, by happenstance Truman’s name appeared first on Roosevelt’s list. Robert
Hannegan, party chairman of the Democratic National Committee, understood the
order in which Roosevelt wrote the names to be indicative of his preferences. Tru-
man therefore became Roosevelt’s vice president, succeeding him as president
after his death. Just four years later, in 1948, Truman asked Douglas to join the
ticket as his vice-presidential running mate, but Douglas turned down the offer. 

182
Douglas, William O. (1898–1980)
\
Douglas chose to remain a member of the Court. At the heart of his landmark
privacy jurisprudence is an unorthodox belief in the Constitution’s plasticity. In
cases dealing with individual rights, Douglas often relied on a broad interpretation
that places more emphasis on pre-constitutional liberties than on stare decisis.
“The Constitution is a compendium,” he declared, “not a code, a declaration of arti-
cles of faith, not a compilation of laws.” Douglas also believed that the Bill of
Rights is a sampling of rights rather than an exhaustive list, that there are also une-
numerated rights that the Bill of Rights implies in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth,
and Ninth Amendments. In his view, the people are sovereign; the Constitution is
an instrument for their common good. The right of privacy protects people’s ability
to make choices without government interference in their personal concerns and
relationships. Douglas framed privacy opinions in broad humanitarian terms that
continue to guide decisionmaking.
When Justice Douglas wrote his seminal decision in Griswold v. Connecticut,
381 U.S. 479 (1965), the Supreme Court had already decided several cases on pri-
vacy that addressed such spheres as people’s right to live free of unreasonable
searches and seizures, to refuse to provide self-incriminating testimony, and to pre-
serve “the sanctity of” their “home and the privacies of life.” The Court had also
placed informational privacy within the realm of the First Amendment. Indeed,
Justice Douglas had written a majority opinion in Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942) that
found unconstitutional, on equal protection grounds, a state law calling for the
sterilization of certain convicts; however, in it he never mentioned privacy, despite
the “basic liberty” of procreation that was involved. He then connected the consti-
tutional protection of liberties to “more than freedom from unlawful government
restraint,” to “privacy” and the “right to be let alone,” in Public Utilities Commis-
sion v. Pollack (1952).
Douglas’s majority opinion in Griswold analyzed whether the Constitution pro-
tected marital privacy. The case involved a constitutional challenge brought against
a Connecticut law against using or counseling about the use of contraceptives.
Douglas located the rights of married people to make reproductive decisions and
associate without unnecessary governmental intrusion in the “penumbras” of pri-
vacy “formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and
substance.” In his 1958 book The Right of the People, he explained that the “pen-
umbra of the Bill of Rights” protected natural rights that “have a broad base in
morality and religion to protect man, his individuality, and his conscience against
direct and indirect interference by government.” His reliance on constitutional pen-
umbras was met with some resistance both within the Court and among academics.
Justice Hugo Black rejected the decision because he could “find in the Constitution
no language which either specifically or implicitly grants to all individuals a con-
stitutional ‘right to privacy.’” Similarly, several constitutional scholars, John Hart
Ely and Herbert Wechsler being among the most prominent, have disparaged those
constitutional decisions that rely on substantive principles to protect individual
rights. Douglas, to the contrary, regarded certain vital rights to be derived “from the
totality of the constitutional scheme under which we live” and determined that it
was the Court’s obligation to protect them against government interference. 
Despite the criticism of privacy rights, most justices have found privacy intrinsic
to the Constitution. Indeed, the more Douglas was able to pull the Court in the

Driver’s Privacy Protection Act

183
direction of his thinking, the more willing he became to take controversial stands. In
Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which upheld a woman’s right to terminate a
pregnancy, Chief Justice Burger decided to assign the majority opinion to Justice
Blackmun, who recognized the right to privacy “whether founded on the Fourteenth
Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and resting upon state action, or . . . on the
Ninth Amendment reservation of rights to the people.” Douglas’s concurrence, agree-
ing with the Court’s decision but assuming a different rationale for it, was one step
ahead. To him, the Ninth Amendment was linked to the “‘Blessings of Liberty’ men-
tioned in the preamble to the Constitution.” His concurrence set out spheres of pri-
vacy: The First Amendment protects the absolute right to “the autonomous control
over the development and expression of one’s intellect, interests, tastes, and personal-
ity.” The state may exercise more control over the sphere of liberty pertaining to
“freedom of choice in the basic decisions of one’s life respecting marriage, divorce,
procreation, contraception, and the education and upbringing of children.” 
In another sphere of privacy, the government must demonstrate a compelling
state interest to limit the “freedom to care for one’s health and person, freedom
from bodily restraint or compulsion, freedom to walk, stroll, or loaf.” Douglas’s
descriptions of freedoms related to individual rights intrinsic to living meaningful
lives, not merely being left undisturbed by government interference. The Court has
continued to rely on Justice Douglas’s privacy formulation, most recently in find-
ing that the right to privacy extends to homosexual couples in the landmark case
Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003).

Driver’s Privacy Protection Act
The Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) was passed in 1994 to protect per-
sonal information collected by a state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). As of
the DPPA’s 1997 deadline, it is illegal for any DMV to release information about any
individual in their database. The DPPA was enacted to protect private individuals
from organizations or individuals using personally identifiable information
such as name, Social Security number, or addresses in order to harass individu-
als or to commit a robbery or other violent crime. Moreover, supporters of the
law argue that the DPPA provides important protections of individuals’ right to
privacy that more than 30 states were failing to enforce before the bill was
passed. Violators face criminal fines and civil liability suits that can provide
victims with actual and punitive damages as well as reimbursement of legal
costs. The law has been amended to include more specific protections and has
also faced several state challenges. In 2000 the U.S Supreme Court upheld its
constitutionality despite state challenges that the act violates state commerce

\
laws, with other state courts ruling that the law protects an individual’s data
only within DMV databases.
The DPPA gained both public and legislative support after a series of highly
publicized cases, including the death of actress Rebecca Schaffer, where individ-
uals used information obtained through DMVs to commit crimes and engage in
forms of harassment. An obsessed fan used DMV records to obtain Shaffer’s
address, after which he continued to stalk her and finally murdered her. Other
cases involved Operation Rescue members using DMV records to harass women
who visit doctors known to perform abortions. Although a few states had already
passed laws that protected driver information, the DPPA created a federal stan-
dard restricting access to these records. The DPPA ultimately passed as an
amendment to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (103
H.R. 355). The law limits access to the database to certain agencies and limited
purposes, including legitimate local, state, and federal government functions;
matters of motor vehicle safety; theft; emissions issues; product recalls; and
motor vehicle market research and surveys. Individuals and groups may also
acquire access to databases for legitimate business transactions initiated to verify
the accuracy of personal information, for anonymous research activities and
preparation of statistical reports, for insurance-related applications, for use by
licensed investigators or security services, for the benefit of private toll transpor-
tation facilities, and for use by anyone who has written permission from an indi-
vidual to release his or her information (18 U.S.C. §2721). Ironically, although
the bill limits individual and group access to drivers’ information, the bill would
not have protected Shaffer, as her killer used a private investigator to obtain her
home address. 
Due to the popularity of the DPPA, the “Shelby Amendment” was added,
requiring DMVs to get written permission before they can release or sell a driver’s
personal record to a third party. This amendment requires marketers to obtain a
driver’s consent before acquiring personal information for mass mailings. 
As mentioned earlier, the DPPA has faced several state challenges. Critics
argue that it threatens state constitutional powers with its prohibition of lucrative
state expenditures. Previously, states made over a million dollars from selling
names in DMV databases. South Carolina challenged the DPPA in 1998, arguing
that the law violated principles of federalism. However, the Supreme Court unan-
imously upheld the constitutionality of the act in 2000 as a proper exercise of
Congress’s authority to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce
Clause (528 U.S. 14). In 2001 Davies v. Freedom of Information Commission
challenged the act as limiting the right to freedom of information. The Connecti-
cut Supreme Court ruled that the DPPA does not apply to other government agen-
cies that receive personal information from the state DMV in the course of their
normal governmental functions.

Drug testing
›
185
Drug testing
A drug test is a process whereby a bodily fluid or material—typically urine,
blood, or hair—is analyzed to determine whether traces of drugs are present. Most
drug metabolites can be detected in urine for up to three days after the drug was
used; others are detectable for as long as four weeks after last use (e.g., marijuana
used by heavy or chronic smokers). Two primary methods of detecting drugs in
urine dominate the testing industry: immunoassays and chromatography. The
Enzyme-Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT), the Enzyme-Linked Immun-
osorbent Assay (ELISA), and the radioimmunoassay (RIA) are among the most
commonly used screening methods. With these methods, a given urine sample is
compared with a calibrator containing a known quantity of the drug for which tests
are being conducted. If the sample is equal to or higher than the calibrator, the test
result is positive. Although reliability at one time was a significant problem,
improvements have resulted in current accuracy levels of 95 to 99 percent.
The Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) technique is the most
accurate for detecting drugs in body fluids. To date, courts accept screening tests as
100 percent accurate as long as they are followed by a GC/MS corroboration.
Although confirmatory tests cost considerably more than initial screenings—$40 to
$75—about 70 percent of employers require them. However, 13 percent of employ-
ers repeat the procedure (such as EMIT) on the same sample, 5 percent test a new
sample, and 7 percent perform no confirmatory test (and simply disqualify appli-
cants or respond otherwise to positive-testing employees). Today there are over a
dozen initial screening tests accepted by the scientific community, although three
tests dominate private, public, and military applications: EMIT, RIA, and Thin-
Layered Chromatography (TLC).
Although urine analysis is the testing procedure most commonly used, hair fol-
licle testing, which is much more precise in detecting the long-term presence of
drugs, is becoming more accepted. As the cost of hair testing decreases and as
courts rule on its validity and reliability, hair rather than body fluids likely will
become the preferred specimen for private and public agencies. Urine testing gen-
erally reveals drugs consumed within the past two or three days, and blood testing,
which reveals current impairment, discloses drug use within the past 2 to 22 hours.
Hair testing, by comparison, exposes drug use as distant as two months prior to
testing, allowing greater surveillance of people’s previous behaviors. Saliva testing
also will likely become more widely used. A number of companies are manufactur-
ing saliva testing mechanisms designed for the workplace as well as for criminal
justice agencies, drug rehabilitation clinics, and hospital emergency and psychiat-
ric wards. Their on-site advantages are also contributing to recent discussions
about their potential for testing motorists during traffic stops. Drug metabolites in
body sweat are tested for by means of a patch worn on the skin and are most com-
monly used with individuals on probation or parole. In time and with the develop-
ment of increasingly sophisticated and less expensive techniques for drug testing,
biological information other than that gleaned from urine may become preferred.
Drug testing in the United States was first imposed on those who had relin-
quished some of their personal liberties: members of the armed forces and jail
inmates and prisoners. Since 1981 the military has conducted over a million urine
analyses each year. About 71 percent of jails practice surveillance of inmates with

the use of drug testing procedures, and about 49 percent of adult probationers are
subject to routine screening. 
However, drug testing has quickly expanded to include individuals previously
exempt. Workers and job applicants have been the main subjects. Students have
been targeted as well, although to lesser extent. The drug testing industry has
grown nearly exponentially because of its aggressive marketing strategies, and this
growth has been accelerated by political campaigns, as well as judicial, executive,
and legislative decisions. 
On September 15, 1986, President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order
12564: Drug-Free Federal Workplace, effective immediately. It required screening
employees and job applicants, through testing, for illegal drug use. The order called
for mandatory random testing in all agencies of the executive branch. Congress
soon passed legislation requiring testing programs among federal agencies. The
broadest action for private employees was the passage of the Drug-Free Workplace
Act of 1988 (P.L. No. 100-690, Nov. 18, 1988), which requires employers with fed-
eral contracts worth at least $100,000 and any recipient of a federal grant to insti-
tute a comprehensive “drug-free workplace” program. Although comprehensive,
the act did not require employers to test employees or applicants.
On October 28, 1991, President George Bush signed the Omnibus Transporta-
tion Employee Testing Act of 1991 (P.L. No. 102-143, Oct. 28, 1991), stipulating
the testing of employees in the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal High-
way Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Urban Mass
Transportation Administration. The act, among other things, added alcohol to the
list of drugs targeted for testing. This act preempted state laws and authorized both
random and pre-employment drug and alcohol testing. 
In challenges to drug testing policies, courts have weighed an individual’s
“reasonable expectation of privacy” against the interests of public safety and
security. Although privacy rights are not mentioned in the United States Constitu-
tion, the Supreme Court has ruled that they are implicit in the Bill of Rights and
specifically the Fourth Amendment. Most challenges to drug testing have relied on
issues of privacy and unreasonable searches. In 1989 the Supreme Court upheld a
California District Court ruling that railroad workers can be subjected to random
drug testing. The ruling, that drug testing is a reasonable search that does not vio-
late the Fourth Amendment, affected public employees working for federal, state,
county, and municipal governments (Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n,
489 U.S. 602, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 1989). Private employees were unaffected by the
ruling since they, unlike public-sector workers, have no constitutional protection
from searches and seizures from their employers. Writing for the majority, Justice
Anthony Kennedy also upheld the use of the EMIT and GC/MS drug testing proce-
dures (the ones most commonly used), claiming that they are “highly accurate.” 
On the same day as the Skinner ruling, the Court, in a 5-4 decision in National
Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 109 S.Ct. 1384 (1989), held that Customs
Service agents, like railroad workers, are subject to drug testing and that such
procedures do not violate Fourth Amendment protections. The Court consid-
ered the necessity of agents having unimpeachable integrity along with the
needs of the government, national security, and public safety. Writing for the
minority in the Von Raab case, Justice Scalia stated that even “school crossing

Drug testing

187
guards” would be subject to drug testing under this ruling. Only six years later, in
1995, the Court upheld the testing of junior high school student-athletes, citing the
existence of reasonable suspicion that student-athletes were both using and pro-
moting drug use (Vernonia School District v. Wayne Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 1995).
In June 2002, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court, in Board of Education of Inde-
pendent School District Number 92 v. Earls, upheld a drug testing program in
Tecumseh, Oklahoma, compelling students who participate in any extracurricular
activities (including the school choir, the marching band, and the academic team)
to submit to urine tests. A positive finding or refusal to comply results in expulsion
from extracurricular activities for the academic year. 
Since 1989 federal circuit courts generally have relied on the Skinner ruling
when upholding drug testing. Courts likewise have ruled that pre-employment drug
testing does not violate Fifth Amendment guarantees. The Fifth Amendment pro-
tects individuals from being compelled to testify against themselves. The argument
is that public-sector employers violate employees’ Fifth Amendment rights by sub-
jecting them to drug testing, the results of which may be incriminating. Courts,
however, have sided with employers over employees on two grounds. First, courts
have ruled that the Fifth Amendment is limited to the government compelling indi-
viduals to testify against themselves. Requiring physical evidence such as blood,
urine, and hair samples rather than the testimony of individuals is not considered a
violation of their Fifth Amendment guarantees. Second, courts have ruled that the
Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination only in criminal proceedings—
processes that exclude drug testing. 
These decisions in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches cleared the
way for the wholesale adoption of workplace drug testing. States passed legislation
creating drug-free workplaces and offering financial incentives to employers that
participate. Some states offer employers credits on their workers’ insurance poli-
cies. Others support employers through public policies. For example, in the dis-
charge of employees who are in violation of drug-free workplace programs,
employers’ actions are considered reasonable and “for cause.” States also have
shifted the legal burden of proof from employers to employees who are injured on
the job and whose post-accident (and mandatory) drug screening results are posi-
tive. Thus, employers have a financial incentive directly from their states of resi-
dence to implementing drug-free workplace programs. Among companies that
subject employees to drug testing, 53 percent do so because of government man-
dates and incentives.
Workplace drug testing increased from 21.5 percent of companies in 1987 to
84.8 percent of companies in 1993—a 250 percent increase. Drug testing has now
leveled off or has decreased slightly, primarily among small businesses. Among
Fortune 500 companies, about 40 percent of employees are subject to drug testing
compared with 48 percent among Fortune 1000 firms. The larger the company, the
more likely it is to use drug testing surveillance on applicants and employees.
About 71 percent of worksites with more than 1000 employees conduct drug tests
while 40 percent of worksites with 50 to 99 employees screen for drugs. Among
companies with fewer than 50 employees, only 2 percent require drug testing.
The prevalence of drug testing varies widely by industry type. Blue-collar workers
are much more likely to be subjected to drug testing than white-collar employees.

188

\
The workers most likely to be subjected to drug and alcohol screening are non–
college-educated males who are full-time employees and union members. Drug
testing varies by geographic region as well, with the southern United States report-
edly conducting more drug testing than any other area in the country. Most drug
testing programs require the worker or job applicant, in the presence of a monitor,
to urinate into a specimen cup.
Employers currently rely on a number of procedures for testing both employees
and those seeking work. Pre-employment testing (i.e., testing of job applicants) is
considered a preventive strategy for employers since it denies employment to appli-
cants identified as drug users. Pre-employment testing is the most broadly used
type; 78 percent of companies require applicants to comply. Random or unan-
nounced testing is designed to ferret out current drug users. It has become the most
common testing procedure among current employees, with 46.7 percent of work-
sites using this method. It also remains the most controversial, as employees define
it as an invasive procedure requiring no probable cause. Reasonable-cause testing
is used when an employee’s job performance suggests possible drug use. Since the
legal stakes are higher for this type of testing, employers are cautioned to use it
judiciously. Even with the recognized potential for litigation, it is the second most
common testing procedure on employees, with 37 percent of worksites using this
method. It also produces the highest percentage of positive findings. Post-accident
testing is used in cases where employees have been involved in on-the-job acci-
dents. Although employees may display no signs of inebriation or of being under
the influence of alcohol or drugs, employers nonetheless test employees after on-
the-job accidents. About 26 percent of worksites use this form of testing. Periodic
testing is used on a regular schedule, usually in conjunction with physical examina-
tions, which are required of some employees in specific occupations. Since
employees must be given advance notice of such exams, few employees test posi-
tive, and only 13.7 percent of worksites use this procedure. Rehabilitation testing is
used with employees who earlier tested positive and as a condition of continued
employment are required to participate in counseling and periodic drug testing to
monitor their sobriety and abstinence. Most current drug testing programs are
designed to test all employees (e.g., random testing) and job applicants (e.g., pre-
employment screening). Pre-employment screening currently is the most com-
monly used type of drug testing. Seventy-eight percent of companies require job
applicant drug testing. 
The drug testing industry is the quintessential example of modernity. The pro-
found faith in technology, underlying philosophy of surveillance, ability to rapidly
process large numbers of samples, and confidence in science as a means of social
control characterized by the industry suggest modern strategies and ideologies for
addressing complex social issues. Drug testing—the social surveillance of stu-
dents, military personnel, prisoners, job applicants, and workers—is a component
of general and dynamic processes of social control. Drug testing represents a fun-
damental shift in social relations and is one of an increasing number of intrusions
into privacy. Previous generations of workers, students, military men and women,
and inmates were subject to surveillance, yet control methods today are far more
efficient, and many rely on biological science.

These modifications in some respects reflect changing technologies that offer
heretofore unknown surveillance modes and strategies. In other words, they may be
technologically determined modes of control. They also are part of larger
surveillance-related developments in people’s everyday lives, and particularly in
the workplace. Beyond lengthy background investigations; several rounds of inter-
views; and polygraph, integrity, physical, and psychological screening, drug testing
has quickly become a primary technique for distinguishing the reputable from the
disreputable. As a means of differentiating, it is considerably less expensive than
background checks or physical or psychological investigations. Also, its results,
unlike those of polygraph exams, are admissible in court. Given drug testing’s
widespread use, it has become standard operating procedure in innumerable private
and public settings.

Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972)
The Supreme Court case of Eisenstadt v. Baird began when William Baird gave
away Emko vaginal foam to a woman following a Boston University lecture on
birth control and overpopulation. Massachusetts charged Baird with a felony: dis-
tributing contraceptives to unmarried men or women. Under the law, only married
couples could obtain birth control products, and only registered doctors or pharma-
cists could provide them. Baird was not an authorized distributor of contraceptives.
At the time, Massachusetts General Laws provided for a maximum five-year
term of imprisonment for anyone who “gives away . . . any drug, medicine, instru-
ment or article whatever for the prevention of conception,” except as prescribed by
a registered physician for any married person. The State Supreme Judicial Court’s
interpretation was that the violation of these provisions made it a felony for any-
one, other than a registered physician or pharmacist acting in accordance with a
physician’s order, to dispense any article with the intention that it be used for the
prevention of conception.
According to the Supreme Court, the legislative purposes the statute was meant
to serve were not altogether clear. In a previous decision, the State Supreme Judi-
cial Court noted only the state’s interest in protecting the health of its citizens. In
another decision the court found a second and more compelling ground for uphold-
ing the statute: to protect morals through “regulating the private sexual lives of sin-
gle persons.” The Court of Appeals, however, did not consider the promotion of
health or the protection of morals through the deterrence of fornication to be the
legislative aim. Instead, the court concluded that the statutory goal was to limit
contraception in and of itself. The court held that this purpose conflicted “with fun-
damental human rights” under Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965),
where the Court struck down Connecticut’s prohibition against the use of contra-
ceptives as an unconstitutional infringement of the right to marital privacy. 
In Eisenstadt, the question the Court dealt with was, did the Massachusetts law
violate the right to privacy acknowledged in Griswold v. Connecticut and protected
from state intrusion by the Fourteenth Amendment?

\
In a 6-to-1 decision, the Court struck down the Massachusetts law, although not
strictly on privacy grounds. The Court held that the law’s distinction between sin-
gle and married individuals failed to satisfy the “rational basis test” of the Four-
teenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Married couples were entitled to
contraception under the Court’s Griswold decision. Withholding that right from
single persons without a rational basis proved the fatal flaw. Thus, the Court
stepped away from the emphasis on marital privacy in Griswold to uphold a less
restrictive right to privacy and to invalidate the Massachusetts statute. “If the right
of privacy means anything,” wrote Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., for the majority,
“it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted gov-
ernmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the deci-
sion to whether to bear or beget a child.”

Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986
Electronic surveillance is a significant tool in modern law enforcement, bring-
ing dimension to dialogues, minimizing interpretation ambiguity, and making rec-
ollection issues obsolete. When used appropriately, it has the power to bring down
the most elusive criminals. There is little wiggle room for a defendant whose words
are captured on tape. If used inappropriately, surveillance has the power to invade
our privacy, stifle our creativity for fear of being exposed as different, and share our
secrets with those who have no need to know. Mindful of the balance that must be
struck between law enforcement’s need to intercept the communications of wrong-
doers and an individual’s right to be free of unwarranted eavesdropping, the legisla-
ture enacted the Omnibus Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1968 and the
Electronic Communication Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986. 
The ECPA consists of three subtitles and covers three specific types of commu-
nications: wire, oral, and electronic. The three subtitles are Title I, the Wiretap Act,
which deals with the interception of communications that are in transmission; Title
II, the Stored Communications Act, which covers the accessing of stored electronic
communications and records; and Title III, the Pen Register Act, which applies to
pen registers and trap-and-trace devices, which record phone numbers or address
information (such as the “to” and “from” lines in an e-mail).

Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986
›
193
The types of communications covered by the ECPA are wire, oral, and elec-
tronic. A wire communication involves aural transfers, which are communications
containing the human voice that travel through a wire or cable device at some point
during their transmission. A landline or mobile telephone conversation taking place
in real time is an example of this type of communication. An oral communication
is one uttered by a person under circumstances such that the person has a reason-
able expectation that the communication will not be overheard. In other words, the
communicator must have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her conver-
sation and the communication must be one that society is willing to protect. This
definition applies to communications intercepted through bugs or other recording
devices such as tape recorders that do not involve a wire transmission. Finally, elec-
tronic communications include all non-wire and non-oral communications: signals,
images, and data that are transmitted through a medium such as wire, radio, elec-
tromagnetic, or photoelectronic. Prime examples of electronic communications are
electronic mail messages, faxes, (electronic) pages, and text messages.
The extent to which audio and electronic communication surveillance occurs is
reported annually to Congress through the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts. Specifically, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968 requires that certain information—including the number and nature of federal
and state applications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire,
oral, or electronic communications; the offenses under investigation; the locations
of intercepts; the cost of the surveillance; and the numbers of arrests, trials, and
convictions that were a direct result of such surveillance—be reported annually.
The 2004 report concluded that 1710 intercepts were authorized that year by state
and federal courts, which was an increase of 19 percent compared with the number
in 2003. Of the 47 jurisdictions (federal, state, the District of Columbia, and the
Virgin Islands) that currently authorize this type of surveillance, 20 reported using
it during 2004 as an investigative tool. Furthermore, the report showed that federal
officials requested 730 intercept applications in 2004, which amounted to a 26 per-
cent increase over the number requested in 2003.
Historically, wiretapping laws have required the consent of all parties before a
communication could be intercepted. An example of a situation involving the con-
sent of all parties is the use of a telephone answering machine. The machine owner
has given his consent by attaching the machine to his phone and asking the caller to
leave her message after the beep. The caller has given her consent to be intercepted
by recording her message. Thus, both parties to the communication gave prior con-
sent for the content of the interception to be captured. 
Federal law and 35 states allow for the interception of wire communications if
only one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent. However, the
conditions for interception still vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
For example, jurisdictions may define the term “party” as anyone involved a con-
versation or as law enforcement personnel only. Jurisdictions may limit the
offenses for which interception is permissible to select crimes. Some jurisdictions
limit the ability to record the intercepted communications. Some jurisdictions may
allow interception for reasons of officer safety but for no other purpose, including
its use as evidence in criminal or civil matters. Some jurisdictions may allow the
interception of communications that are part of a videotaped car stop. 

194
Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986
\
The ECPA requires law enforcement to obtain a court order with an accompany-
ing affidavit based on an extensive list of legal requirements before the content of a
communication can be captured. The list is extensive because wiretap surveillance
poses a greater threat to privacy than the physical searches and seizures covered by the
Fourth Amendment. Interception inevitably captures some communications of non-
targets whether or not their communication is relevant to the investigation. Not every
communication of a criminal suspect is criminal in nature. Further, unlike the typical
search warrant—where officers announce, enter, search, and exit—electronic sur-
veillance is conducted surreptitiously and is ongoing until the objectives of the
investigation are met. In some cases the monitoring continues for months and
involves thousands of communications.
The list of legal requirements includes proper authorization from the appropriate
official; identication of the investigators, the crimes, and the parties to be inter-
cepted with specificity; tripartite probable cause; a full and complete statement of
the facts and circumstances relied on by the applicant to justify the belief that the
order should be issued; the goals of the interception; the length of time for the
interception, including when it will begin and end, the actual hours of interception
per day, and the days of the week of interception; exhaustion and necessity; mini-
mization; and the equipment and technology to be employed.
All electronic surveillance statutes require tripartite probable cause demonstrat-
ing a link between the interceptee, the device intercepted, and the offense. Specifi-
cally, before an ex parte order approving a wiretap may be issued, the judge must
determine that (1) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is commit-
ting, has committed, or is about to commit certain enumerated offense(s); (2) there
is probable cause to believe that communications relevant to the particular
offense(s) will be intercepted; and (3) there is probable cause to believe that the
facilities (devices) from which the communications will be intercepted are being,
or are about to be, used in connection with the commission of the offense(s) or that
they are commonly used, leased, or listed under the name of a person connected
with the alleged offense(s). The standard for review of tripartite probable cause is
exactly the same as that required by the Fourth Amendment for a search warrant.
Therefore, courts are bound to consider only the facts contained within the four
corners of the affidavit.
All electronic surveillance statutes require the issuing judge to review the affida-
vit to determine whether normal investigative procedures have been tried but failed,
reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if they were tried, or are too dangerous.
To satisfy this requirement (commonly referred to as the necessity/exhaustion
requirement), the affidavit cannot be merely a boilerplate recitation of the difficul-
ties of gathering usable evidence. The affidavit must include a complete statement
providing detailed information about all prior interceptions on the named intercep-
tees and the facility or device to be intercepted. It also must include all pertinent
information relevant to the investigation, including possibly exculpatory informa-
tion. However, some discretion is allowed in terms of disclosing the evidence in
less than its entirety to establish probable cause, provided there is no effort to mis-
lead the court toward approving a warrant that might otherwise not have been
issued. For example, it has been held acceptable for the government to withhold
information to protect the confidentiality of informants.

In evaluating the good faith efforts regarding the use of alternative methods of
investigation, a reviewing court is guided by reasonableness; the police need not
exhaust all conceivable techniques. Before granting the wiretap application, how-
ever, the issuing judge must determine that standard investigative techniques
employing a normal amount of resources have failed to do the job within a reason-
able period of time. Essentially, all that is required is that the investigators give
serious consideration to non-wiretap techniques prior to applying for wiretap
authority and that the court be informed of the reasons for the investigators’ belief
that such non-wiretap techniques have been or will likely be inadequate. In other
words, the government must make a reasonable good faith effort to run the gamut
of normal investigative procedures before employing an electronic surveillance
technique. Other investigatory techniques typically employed are dialed number
recorder (DNR)/trap-and-trace analysis; surveillance, mobile and stationary; trash
or garbage runs; use of informants; criminal history checks; execution of search
warrants; a grand jury investigation; use of surveillance cameras, mobile tracking
devices, and pole cameras; toll record analysis; undercover investigations; and
clone pagers.
The ECPA also requires that the interception of oral communications through
wiretapping be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of commu-
nications not otherwise subject to interception. Interception is proper only if it is
necessary to achieve the goals of the authorization. This does not require that all
innocent or unrelated communications remain unmonitored. Rather, the statute
requires that unnecessary intrusions on the privacy of the individuals being law-
fully monitored be minimized to the greatest extent possible. Compliance is deter-
mined using a case-by-case reasonableness standard. Specifically, a minimization
inquiry is not to be made in a fragmented manner, considering each interception
alone. Instead, it requires an examination of the totality of the monitoring agents’
conduct for the duration of the authorized interception. Minimization is satisfied if,
on the whole, the agents have shown a high regard for the rights of privacy and
have done all they reasonably could to avoid unnecessary intrusion. 
The burden of proof for minimization is initially on the government to make a
prima facie showing of compliance; the burden then switches to the defense for
production and persuasion. The compliance standard for minimization is the over-
all reasonableness of the totality of the conduct of the monitoring agents in light of
the purpose of the wiretap and the information available to the agents at the time of
the interception. The more complex and widespread the investigation, the wider the
latitude of eavesdropping allowed. Factors involved in this reasonableness determi-
nation include: the sophistication of the suspects and the counter-surveillance
methods; whether coded conversations are used; the location and operation of the
target telephone or device; the extent of judicial supervision; the duration of the
wiretap; the purpose of the wiretap; the length of the calls monitored; the existence,
or lack thereof, of a pattern of pertinent calls; the absence of privileged intercep-
tions; and the proper handling of interception of windfall or other offenses. 
The wiretap statute contains its own exclusionary rule providing that no inter-
cepted communications, wire or oral, can be received in evidence if the communi-
cations were unlawfully intercepted, if the order was insufficient, or if the
interception was not made in conformity with the order. Due to this clear legislative

196
Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986
\
intent to limit surveillance in order to protect privacy issues and to control law
enforcement surveillance, a substantial compliance standard is mandated by most
courts for each provision of the statute that is deemed to be a central or functional
safeguard factor. In short, only surveillances that are narrowly focused with consti-
tutionally acceptable, pre-approved judicial sanctions based on special showings of
need are permissible.
The Stored Communications Act (SCA) (18 U.S.C. 2701–2711) governs law
enforcement’s access to stored, or temporarily stored, wire and electronic communi-
cations. This includes any backup copies of files in temporary electronic storage.
Accordingly, it governs access to the subscriber records of various communications
service providers, including Internet service providers (ISPs). If a communication is
being transmitted from its origin to a destination, then the Wiretap Act applies. If it is
stored in the computer of a provider of an electronic communication service (ECS)
or a remote computing service (RCS), then the Stored Communications Act governs. 
The Stored Communications Act is much less protective than the Wiretap Act. It
includes no exclusionary provision and no minimization requirement, and it allows
for little judicial supervision. The degree of privacy protection afforded customers
and subscribers depends on whether the stored communication is considered content
or non-content information and whether it is housed by an ECS or RCS provider. In
determining whether the information sought is content or non-content, experts usu-
ally make the analogy to mail. The content is the actual letter, and the non-content is
the envelope. Telephone companies and electronic mail companies generally act as
ECS providers and a company’s or university’s server represents an RCS.
The SCA is not a catch-all statute designed to protect the privacy of all stored
communications. It does not cover information stored on home computers, since
that information is protected by the Fourth Amendment. The SCA protects only
information held by third-party providers. It is essentially a Fourth Amendment
type of protection for computer networks. The statute limits the government’s abil-
ity to compel providers to disclose information stored by an ECS or RCS about
their customers and subscribers.
Specifically, the statute restricts the ability of service providers, including ISPs,
to voluntarily disclose information about their customers and subscribers to the
government. (The Fourth Amendment is not applicable here because it would allow
private providers to make such disclosures to third parties under the knowing
exposure doctrine.) The SCA is a legislative attempt to protect the privacy of an
individual’s content information electronically stored by third parties. The Act
mandates that some official action be taken before the disclosure can occur unless
it falls within one of the eight specifically designated exceptions listed in 18
U.S.C.2702(b), including disclosure to the recipient of the communication, to the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in connection with a report,
and to a consenting originator.
The type of official action required for disclosure depends on whether the infor-
mation is content or non-content, whether it is stored for less or more than 180
days, and whether the information is held by an ECS or RCS provider. A warrant is
necessary to compel an ECS provider to disclose the contents of communications
held in storage for 180 days or less (18 U.S.C. 2703(a)). To force an ECS provider
to disclose content in electronic storage for more than 180 days or to compel an

Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986

197
RCS provider to disclose content at any time, the government has several options: a
search warrant, with no notification to the subscriber or customer (18 U.S.C.
2703(b)); a court order combined with prior notice to the subscriber or customer
(which can be delayed in some circumstances) (18 U.S.C. 2705); or an administra-
tive, grand jury, or trial subpoena with prior notice to the subscriber or customer
(18 U.S.C. 2703(b)).
A court order requires that the government provide specific and articulable facts
showing that there are reasonable (not probable) grounds to believe that the infor-
mation sought is “relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation” (18
U.S.C. 2703(d)). A subpoena requires only that the government is seeking relevant
information and that the request is not overly broad. 
Non-content, or envelope-type, information may be disclosed more readily
through a mere subpoena, as it is deemed less private than content information.
Many argue, however, that non-content disclosure does reveal private information.
From the packaging of mail delivered to a home, one can identify an individual’s
doctors, interests, associates’ names, political affiliations, and perhaps sexual pref-
erences; a subpoena is all that is required. Non-content information amounts to
basic subscriber information of the sort included in pen register data: name;
address; local and long-distance telephone connection records, or records of ses-
sion times and durations; length of service (including start date) and types of ser-
vice utilized; telephone or instrument number or other subscriber number or
identity, including any temporarily assigned network address; and the means and
source of payment for such service (including any credit card or bank account
numbers) (18 U.S.C. 2703(c)(2)). 
The Pen Register Act regulates the government’s use of pen registers and
trap-and-trace processes. Pen registers provide real-time information as to the
date and time the phone is off hook, numbers dialed, the date and time a call is
terminated, the duration of the call and, if it is an incoming call, whether it was
answered. Trap-and-trace processes capture in real time the telephone number
of the device calling the target phone (caller ID). Trap-and-trace devices are
geographically limited in scope.
Pen registers are not protected by the Fourth Amendment. A person has no rea-
sonable expectation of privacy in terms of this information because the information
is available and accessible to a third party, such as the telephone company. Further-
more, pen registers presumably capture only non-content information. Although the
installation and use of a pen register does not constitute a search under Fourth
Amendment criteria requiring a warrant, most jurisdictions, including federal juris-
dictions, require a court order before installation. The order required is of the type
described under the SCA, certifying that the information sought is relevant and
material to an ongoing criminal investigation. Certification by the government
means only that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to the investigation.
Thus, the court order should include the identity of the law enforcement officer
making the application, the identity of the agency conducting the investigation, and
a statement under oath by the applicant that the information likely to be obtained is
relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the agency.

Act) expanded the definition of pen registers and trap-and-trace devices to include
addressing information on e-mails and to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Whereas
previously pen registers recorded only numbers dialed on the telephone line, the
definition now includes all forms of transmission (“dialing, routing, addressing, or
signaling information”). The effect of this change is that e-mail headers (i.e., the
address information), IP addresses, and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) now
fall under this definition. The concern is that the information revealed from IP
addresses and URLs is more content-like than non-content–like. IP addresses and
URLs reveal significant information about users, including what their interests are
and where they shop. This concern has not been addressed to date. 
In summary, a court order certifying that the information likely to be obtained
by such installation and use is relevant to an ongoing investigation is all that is
required for its release. The orders can last up to 60 days and are not reviewed. This
differs greatly from a warrant, where a return is required. Neither the Stored Com-
munications Act nor the Pen Register Act contains an exclusionary rule. Thus, an
individual has no recourse when the government illegally collects information.

Electronic mail
Electronic mail (“e-mail”) refers to messages transmitted through the Internet or
some other network. In modern implementations, e-mail messages are usually deliv-
ered very quickly, although not quite in real time, unlike instant messaging (IM) and
similar communication methods. Internet users commonly treat e-mail as the online
equivalent of postal mail, unaware of its implications for privacy and security.
Third-party monitoring of e-mail is commonplace and can occur without the
knowledge of either party to a communication. Other privacy issues relate to the
technical mechanisms employed by marketers and others to monitor the reception
and disposition of e-mail messages, the storage and retention of e-mail messages,
and the actions of individual e-mail users. In addition, e-mail is commonly used to
transmit intrusive and unwanted advertisements and other unsolicited messages
called spam.
The standard protocol for sending Internet e-mail is the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP). The Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and the Internet Mes-
sage Access Protocol (IMAP) are the most common protocols used for accessing
received e-mail messages. Typically, the sender uses e-mail client software to com-
pose a message. That software then transmits the message through an SMTP
server, usually one operated by the sender’s own Internet access provider, which

Electronic mail
›
199
transmits the message to an SMTP server designated to receive messages on behalf
of the recipient. The message is held there until it is retrieved by the recipient.
The header of a message and its envelope both contain addressing information,
although most e-mail clients display only the header. The “from” and “to” fields in
the header normally contain the e-mail addresses of the sender and recipient,
respectively, and sometimes their names as well. However, these fields do not con-
trol the delivery of a message, and they can easily be altered by the sender. Another
means of concealing the address of a recipient (for example, from other recipients)
is to place it in the “bcc” (blind carbon copy) field rather than the “to” field. In
2001 a large pharmaceutical manufacturer sent a form e-mail message to hundreds of
consumers who had agreed to receive e-mail reminders about an antidepressant drug.
The company inadvertently included the recipient’s address in the “to” field instead
of the “bcc” field, causing all of the addresses to be exposed to each recipient.
Extensions to the SMTP protocol can be used to authenticate the source of a
message or encrypt its content. E-mail messages may be sent pseudonymously or
anonymously by routing them through a remailer that strips or alters identifying
information before forwarding each message and, optionally, encrypts the message
content.
An e-mail message may be sent in plain text or in various enhanced formats
such as HTML, and may include file attachments and (depending on the format)
embedded images and even program code. Current e-mail clients may disable cer-
tain enhanced features because of their privacy and security implications. For
example, a sender may embed a link to an image located on the sender’s web server
in an HTML e-mail message in order to monitor whether and when the message is
opened or previewed by the recipient. If the recipient’s e-mail client were to
retrieve the image from the sender’s web server and display the message, the access
log for that server would reveal the date and time that the message was opened, the
IP address from which the image was requested, and other information the sender
might find useful.
Some e-mail systems provide senders with the ability to track delivery of mes-
sages, control message retention or forwarding, and even recall messages after they
have been sent. Although standard Internet e-mail does not intrinsically support
these functions, they can be implemented by e-mail client software or various
work-arounds.
User actions can have many privacy-related consequences, often unintended.
For example, an e-mail message can be forwarded by its recipient to a third party
without the sender’s knowledge or consent. Although such forwarding may be con-
sidered a breach of “netiquette,” e-mail users may give little thought to the original
sender’s privacy or other rights in the message content. A related concern arises
when a forwarded message contains the e-mail addresses of many other recipients,
who may not be aware that their addresses are being circulated widely.
The “reply to all” function available in many e-mail clients causes the user’s
reply to be directed to all of the recipients of the original message as well as its
sender. Frequently, users will inadvertently use “reply to all” when intending only a
private “reply.” Similarly, a subscriber to an Internet mailing list who desires to
respond only to the individual who posted a particular message may inadvert-
ently send a reply to the entire list either by using the “reply to all” function or (if

200
Electronic mail
\
the listserver is configured to direct replies to the entire list) by merely selecting
“reply” without first checking the “reply-to” address in the posted message.
A different user error led to unanticipated consequences in McVeigh v. Cohen
(1998). A noncommissioned naval officer mistakenly used the wrong AOL account
name when sending a message to the wife of a fellow crew member. The account
name he used was linked to a profile that listed his marital status as “gay.” The
Navy then initiated discharge proceedings for homosexual conduct, based on the
statement in his online profile, although a court later enjoined the proceedings.
In the United States, federal laws protect the privacy of e-mail. The most impor-
tant of these, the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), makes
it illegal to intercept an e-mail message. This prohibition applies to law enforce-
ment officials as well as private entities. However, there are many exceptions to this
prohibition; for example, an e-mail service provider may view messages when nec-
essary for purposes related to the operation of the service.
In United States v. Councilman (2005), the United States Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit ruled that the interception provisions in ECPA apply to e-mail in
temporary, transient storage. In Councilman, an Internet service provider routinely
scanned its customers’ e-mail in order to obtain a commercial advantage. The court
rejected the provider’s claim that a less protective standard should apply to e-mail
messages in temporary storage than to those “in transit.”
Law enforcement officials can access e-mail messages with a warrant or court
order, and in some instances even without an order or warrant. Such access was
expanded under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appro-
priate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA
PATRIOT Act), enacted in the aftermath of 9/11. In 2000 it was revealed that the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had developed an automated system for
scanning e-mail messages using hardware and software installed at the premises of
a suspect’s Internet service provider. The system, originally named Carnivore and
later renamed DCS1000, was widely criticized by privacy advocates and civil liber-
tarians. Critics charged that the system would facilitate broad privacy violations
and lacked accountability; the FBI claimed that it protected privacy by intercepting
only those communications that were within the scope of a court order. The gov-
ernment had effectively abandoned Carnivore by 2003, although other mechanisms
for intercepting and monitoring e-mail remain in use.
A seemingly nonobjectionable exception to ECPA permits the interception of e-mail
with the consent of the sender or recipient. Some Internet providers routinely require
such consent as a term of service, however, and courts generally have held that an
employer has the right to access messages sent or received using its e-mail systems,
at least if the employer has informed employees that their e-mail will be monitored.
Surveys of employers in the United States reveal that monitoring of employee e-mail
has become the rule rather than the exception, especially at larger firms.
In Smyth v. Pillsbury Co. (1996), a federal court in Pennsylvania rejected an
employee’s claim that he had been wrongfully discharged on the basis of “inappro-
priate and unprofessional comments” he had made in e-mail messages to his super-
visor. The company had assured its employees that their e-mail would be
confidential and that the company would not intercept it or uses it as grounds for
termination or reprimand. The court held that the employee had lost any reasonable

Electronic surveillance
›
201
expectation of privacy in regard to his comments when he sent them over the com-
pany’s e-mail system, and that the company’s interception of his messages was not a
substantial invasion of his privacy.
Storage and archiving of e-mail messages can greatly increase the likelihood
that third parties will gain access to their content. Declining data storage costs have
removed much of the incentive to delete unneeded messages, while technological
advances have made it easier to recover messages that have been deleted and those
that exist only in otherwise obsolete backup archives. Meanwhile, businesses
increasingly are adopting uniform policies on electronic document retention,
largely in response to changes in the legal environment.
In Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC (2004), an employment discrimination case
against a large investment brokerage firm, employees of the firm had deleted e-mail
messages relevant to the case even after being instructed to retain them by the
firm’s lawyers. Many of the relevant messages eventually were retrieved, and the
court instructed the jury to infer that the remaining missing messages contained
material damaging to the firm’s case. The plaintiff ultimately won damages of
nearly $30 million.
In Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States (2005), the Supreme Court reversed
Arthur Andersen’s conviction for obstruction of justice, which was based largely on
the accounting firm’s destruction of electronic records. Legislation enacted in the
wake of the Enron/Andersen scandal has imposed stricter document retention require-
ments on businesses, particularly in the banking and financial services sector.
Individuals with personal e-mail accounts also have privacy interests that are
affected by the storage and retention of e-mail. In 2004, when Hotmail and other
web-based e-mail providers generally offered fairly limited storage capacities,
Google’s GMail service began offering 1 GB in free storage along with advanced
search capabilities, encouraging users to keep old messages rather than deleting
them to free up space. Although Google’s privacy policy limits the use and disclo-
sure of stored e-mail messages, it is clear that long-term retention of e-mail mes-
sages increases the opportunities for a breach of privacy.

Electronic surveillance
Widespread electronic surveillance, whether conducted by the government, cor-
porations, or individuals, has obvious consequences for individual privacy. Techno-
logical innovations have enabled the use of surveillance without the need for

\
physical proximity to a subject. Since the presence and use of such technology are
often difficult to detect, a subject under surveillance may find that conversations, e-
mails, and activities that were assumed to be private communications or actions
were in fact observed and tracked. Although such messages and acts may be pro-
tected by privacy rights, these traditionally have had to be balanced against an
often-conflicting public interest, such as the need to obtain evidence of criminal
wrongdoing or to strengthen national security. 
The term “electronic surveillance” does not necessarily correspond to a legal
definition. As a descriptive phrase, it is extremely broad; as reflected in the legisla-
tive framework, however, it is used generally to delineate the means and techniques
of surveillance, rather than to characterize the information obtained thereby. This
usage thus includes within its purview wiretapping, “bugging,” and the electronic
interception of e-mail.
Wiretapping can be done either mechanically or, given modern telephony, digi-
tally. The former involves placing a listening device on physical equipment such as
a handset, and either connecting directly to the telephone line or mechanically
switching the telephone signals. With the development of digital telephony, which
is utilized by cable service companies, and Internet telephony, the difficulties and
detection risks of physical or mechanical tapping can be minimized, as a remote
computer can be used to perform the requisite signal switching easily and effec-
tively. Wiretapping and bugging, whether mechanical or digital, are means by
which the contents of a communication can be detected and recorded. Digital inter-
ceptions can, however, also record “logs,” such as a list indicating the number and
duration of the calls made and received. Telephone service companies also rou-
tinely log non-content data for billing and other subscriber-related purposes. These
records may be subject to disclosure in response to a subpoena or other court order.
The “traditional” means of electronic interception reflected a distinction
between content and non-content communications, in that pen registers and
trap-and-trace devices work differently than wiretaps. A pen register is an elec-
tronic device that records the numbers dialed from a telephone; a trap-and-trace
device is similar except that it records the incoming dialed numbers to a telephone.
As reliance on the use of computers and the Internet has grown, it has become pos-
sible to collect more and increasingly varied kinds of non-content data (often
referred to as “transactional data” or “traffic data,” to distinguish such information
from the actual contents of a communication). Transactional data include the date
and time of a communication, its duration, and the kind of telephone dialing infor-
mation collected by pen/trap devices. On the Internet, which transmits information
in the form of digital bit streams and data “packets” that are automatically re-
assembled at the destination computer, transactional information also includes
routing information and the identifying Internet Protocol (IP) “address” of the
sending and receiving computer. In essence, devices that enable the monitoring and
recording of transactional data are utilized to identify the source, destination, and
other information regarding the transmission of a communication.
“Packet sniffer” software and “black box” devices that are attached to a com-
puter network and that detect, filter, intercept, and record data passing across the
network are readily and commercially available. Such technology, considered tools
for network analysis, are useful for troubleshooting and technical maintenance;

203
however, they also facilitate the monitoring of e-mails, Internet chat sessions, file-
sharing activity, and other communications that pass through the network. The
Carnivore software suite that was utilized by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation (FBI) is an example of packet sniffer technology, relying on sophisticated
filtering to isolate, intercept, and analyze data packets transmitted across an Inter-
net service provider’s (ISP’s) network.
This category of surveillance includes keystroke-logging devices (which record
every stroke of a computer user’s keyboard entries). Keystroke loggers can take
the form of hardware devices or software; in the latter form, they can be installed
by way of a “Trojan horse” or other software virus. The FBI has successfully uti-
lized keystroke loggers to obtain encrypted computer passwords of suspects in
criminal investigations. 
Other forms of computer and online tracking technology include “cookies” and
“web bugs” (also known as “web beacons” or “clear gifs”), used mainly by Internet
marketers and advertisers. A cookie is a data file that is stored on the user’s com-
puter and sends back information about that user’s online activity with regard to
particular websites and web pages (such as when they were accessed and for how
long). Cookies are useful for gathering information about users’ web browsing
habits and preferences, and they can also store registration, online shopping, and
other user data. A web bug is an invisible image embedded in a web page or an e-
mail that is is downloaded when the page or e-mail is opened by a computer user.
Although similar to cookies in that they provide information about when a user vis-
its a website, web bugs embedded in e-mails can generate wider privacy concerns,
as they also provide information about the user’s computer (e.g., its IP address and
web server). 
The term “spyware” is used generally to refer to software that exists on a com-
puter’s hard drive unbeknownst to the user and that surreptitiously monitors the
user’s computer activity; it may also alter or activate certain computer functions at
a third party’s behest (such functionality classifying it also as “malware,” or mali-
cious software). A good deal of “adware,” or software that displays advertising to a
user, is also commonly categorized as spyware because it is often installed without
the user’s knowledge, though it may not amount to malware. Spyware, particularly
adware, usually includes a monitoring function, which can vary from monitoring
the user’s online browsing activity to redirecting the user to different websites (usu-
ally as part of an advertising network utilizing the spyware in question).
These devices are used to detect the presence and availability of wireless net-
works and activity within those networks. With the proliferation of wireless net-
works in homes, schools, offices, and elsewhere, there has been a corresponding
increase in the establishment and availability of wireless access points (WAPs),
including free WAPs offered by commercial establishments to their customers.
This has facilitated the practice of “war driving,” where a laptop enabled with the
right software can be used to detect a wireless computer network, to log on to it,
and even to intercept data traveling across that network.
“Locational data,” similar to “transactional data” in that they do not generally
relate to the contents of a communication, disclose the geographical location of a user
or computer. Locational data can be obtained by utilizing the Global Positioning
System (GPS) or devices that rely on triangulation between a wireless cellular

204
Electronic surveillance
\
telephone and cellular signal towers, as does the E-911 feature included in U.S,
cellular phones, as mandated by the Federal Communications Commission.
Mobile or cellular telephones utilize a wireless network comprising various base
stations linked to a traditional telephone network and communicating through elec-
tromagnetic radio waves. Although different providers may use different techno-
logical standards for communications, digital technology such as GSM (Global
System for Mobile Communications) is used widely. In addition to speech, mobile
telephones support other services, such as text messaging, Internet access, and the
exchange of video and photo files. Tapping into a mobile telephone network allows
the collection of transactional as well as locational data, since it is possible to iden-
tify the base station for the call in question. Content data can also be intercepted,
and, as new technology (such as 3G, or third-generation, mobile telephone technol-
ogy) enabling the transfer of more types of files gains ground, the kinds of content
data that can be intercepted will also grow. These new technologies rely on the
transmission of data stored on a mobile device (“tag”) equipped with a transponder
that responds to radio frequency signals sent by a transceiver. Radio frequency
identification (RFID) allows the transmission of locational and transactional infor-
mation in the form of data stored on the tag; because the tag can be attached to any
person or object, an RFID system enables mobile tracking. 
Data mining is an analytical tool that uses statistical modeling, computational
techniques, and search functionality to analyze, extract, compare, and link vast
amounts of data within and across databases. Previously disparate or unconnected
data can be compiled and analyzed, and patterns discerned.
A significant issue for privacy in relation to some of these new techniques is the
possibility that they can be used in combination. For example, locational data can
be combined with a user’s web browsing patterns (obtained by some other
method), placed into a database, and analyzed using a variety of software and tech-
niques, including data mining. This ability poses a challenge for the legal regula-
tion of electronic surveillance, which traditionally has largely focused on, and
applied differing standards based on, distinctions between content and non-content
data, and between data being intercepted while in transmission and its interception
thereafter (i.e., in electronic storage).
A few differences between the more traditional forms of electronic surveillance
(such as wiretapping, bugging, and the use of pen registers and trap-and-trace
devices) and methods involving the Internet should also be noted in this context.
First, it is easy to make a distinction between the contents of a communication and
the transactional data surrounding it, such as the telephone number dialed or the
duration of the call. This distinction is less clearcut in the case of Internet commu-
nications. For example, the subject line of an e-mail communication can reveal
much about the contents of the e-mail itself, and some pen/trap devices can capture
dialing signals that are content-related (such as credit card numbers). Second,
tracking a computer user across the Internet (such as by means of the websites vis-
ited) can disclose information that is not limited to facts regarding location and
destination, but that is more personal in nature, such as the user’s online shopping
behavior, interests, and habits. Third, the availability and adoption of data mining
technology raises the possibility not only that databases containing personal or pri-
vate information can be created, but also that vast amounts of information can be

combed, compiled, linked, and profiled in a way not previously technologically
feasible. The implications include the risk that existing laws will prove insuffi-
ciently flexible or technology-neutral to cope with the new technology (and its
allowance for electronic surveillance on a scale and with an ease not previously
possible) and that the broad potential capacity for greater electronic surveillance
mandates a reexamination of the appropriate balance to be struck between privacy
protection and the need to prevent legitimate government or corporate objectives
from being impeded by overzealous regulation of new technology.
Electronic surveillance that does not capture the contents of a communication is
dealt with by specific provisions and statutes. The Pen/Trap Statute prohibits the
use of pen/trap devices except through a court order or under the Foreign Intelli-
gence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA). The Stored Communications Act crimi-
nalizes unauthorized access to or alteration of wire or electronic communications
in “electronic storage” by anyone other than the systems provider or the user who
originated the communication or for whom the communication was intended,
except under a warrant or court order. These legislative measures thus allow the
U.S. government, upon a court’s authorization, to obtain transactional, traffic-
related, and similar data through electronic surveillance, and to gain access to the
contents of wire and electronic communications after their transmission. 
The same technology that permits government surveillance can be used by pri-
vate corporations and individuals to obtain information surreptitiously. One key
difference between government (public-sector) surveillance and private-sector
monitoring is the lack of Fourth Amendment protection for subjects of the latter.
Although the provisions of the Wiretap Act prohibiting intentional interceptions of
content-based transmissions apply to private-sector surveillance, its exceptions
allow limited monitoring. For example, interception is permitted with the consent
(express or implied) of at least one of the parties to the communication, or if the
interception is “a necessary incident to the rendition of the service or to the protec-
tion of the rights or property of the provider of the service.” The consent exception
has been invoked in some cases involving the use of cookies and similar technol-
ogy by Internet advertisers to monitor the web browsing habits of computer users.
Because Internet advertising relies on a network of individual websites to which
the advertisers serve up their advertising, U.S. courts have held that the provisions
of the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) regarding con-
sent require only the consent of the individual “client” website, not of the individ-
ual users of each of those websites, and that consent pertains to the placing of the
advertisements, not of the cookies carried by them to an individual user’s computer.
For this reason, it has been problematic for individual users to rely on the ECPA to
protect them against Internet marketers.
Electronic surveillance is generally viewed as an indispensable tool for criminal
investigations and law enforcement. Both legislators and the courts have displayed
some measure of nimbleness in enacting, amending, and interpreting the law to
accommodate this need while remaining cognizant of the corresponding risk of
loss of privacy. In the United States, the need to balance privacy concerns with the
needs of law enforcement can be seen in the various procedural safeguards in the
wiretap statutes and the courts’ role in interpreting the Constitution. Although
recent legislation, such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing

\
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
(USA PATRIOT Act) and similar laws in other jurisdictions, seems to have tipped
the balance in the direction of greater surveillance, this shift may be justified on the
grounds of national security in the face of a growing threat of terrorism. The chal-
lenge will be to continue to maintain the appropriate balance, to the extent neces-
sary and proportionate to the perceived public policy threat justifying a potential
encroachment on privacy. In addition, any future amendments to electronic surveil-
lance legislation should be mindful that new technology challenges the boundaries
of legal distinctions between the interceptions of different kinds of data. These
issues should remain uppermost in the minds of policymakers, particularly if
greater surveillance powers continue to be granted by law, since at some point the
pressing public policy need for such powers may well diminish or disappear alto-
gether. Consequently, the difficulties inherent in attempting to craft a balance
between individual privacy and increased surveillance must be confronted.

Electronic toll collection
Electronic toll collection is a system that allows government agencies and munici-
palities to collect tolls from commuters electronically without the need for drivers to
stop and collect a toll ticket or pay the booth operator. Electronic toll systems are in
place in different countries around the world and allow traffic to flow more easily
through toll areas. These radio frequency identification (RFID) systems work by
using radio signals to communicate between a toll booth and a transponder posi-
tioned on an automobile. The transponder is a small plastic device that contains
electronic information about the owner. An antenna at the toll booth sends out a
radio frequency that activates the transponder as it approaches. The transponder

European Data Protection Directive
›
207
then sends back information that the toll antenna reads. The system charges the
commuter’s account by using the toll booth through which the automobile first
passed along with the final toll booth passed through to calculate the total toll. The
transponder is associated with a credit card or bank account that is kept on file and
from which funds are deducted. 
Some systems are also equipped with video cameras that can take pictures of the
cars that pass through a toll booth and their license plates. When a vehicle without
a transponder drives through the toll booth, the camera will take a picture of the car
and its license plate; it will then mail a ticket to the owner of the vehicle. The cam-
eras are also used to catch drivers who try to use transponders that have been
reported stolen. Although the primary functions of the system are to facilitate the
collection of tolls and to avoid slowing traffic, it can also be used to gather infor-
mation about those that pass through it. 
One concern is the monitoring of specific driving patterns of individual com-
muters using this collection system. Since the transponder contains information
about the driver of the vehicle needed for billing purposes (such as a home
address), it would be easy to track how far a driver commutes from home each day.
From this a driving pattern could be established for all commuters who use the
electronic toll collection system. This information could be used by agencies such
as insurance companies to determine rates for drivers based on where and how far
they drive. Car rental companies could also use this information. In places where
video cameras are installed, there will also be a picture of the car and license plate
to go along with the commuter’s account information carried in the transponder. 
Another concern is keeping the information that is carried on the transponders
secure. Because transponders carry personal information about their owners, many
motorists want to make sure that information is not used for purposes other than
collecting the appropriate toll.

European Data Protection Directive
The European Data Protection Directive is an abbreviated reference to what is
officially titled the “Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the pro-
cessing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.” Adopted October
25, 1998, the directive comprises of a set of data protection laws consisting of 34
articles that reflect the consensus achieved among the then 15 members of the
European Union over eight years of negotiation. Designed to harmonize and coor-
dinate the flow of information, particularly personal data, across the borders of EU
member states, the directive provides a unified, comprehensive framework for data
protection legislation and practices in both the public and private sectors in each

208
European Data Protection Directive
\
EU member state, including countries that joined after the adoption of the direc-
tive. Updates on the implementation of the EU directive in the 25 member coun-
tries are available on the data protection website of the European Commission.
The directive is important not only because it provides a regulatory framework
for privacy regulation in 25 EU member countries, but also because it sets privacy
standards internationally that emphasize the rights of individuals to their personal
information as an unalienable human right.
Of the main stakeholders involved in the use of personal data—individuals, gov-
ernments, and businesses—the directive focuses on the right of individuals to con-
trol the collection, distribution, and use of their personal information—a traditional
human right in many EU member countries. This individual right is protected in
particular through the directive’s stipulations regarding the principles of openness,
access and correction, collection limitation and finality, accuracy, security, and
enforcement or redress—often considered important fair information principles.
According to the directive (Article 18[1]), anyone collecting and processing per-
sonal information from individuals (the so-called data controller) must register
with the public data protection authority. Furthermore, data protection legislation
of member states must include a requirement for open information about the col-
lection of personal data. At a minimum, before collecting any personal information
from individuals, the data controller must openly provide the identity and contact
information of the controller, the purpose of the data collection and processing, a
description of the categories of the data to be collected, the recipients of the col-
lected data, possible transfers of the collected data to entities outside the EU, and
measures taken to ensure the security of the data. Finally, toward the objective of
openness, the data controller must ensure that “the data subject has unambiguously
given his consent” (Article 7a) before any data processing can begin, including the
transfer of data to third parties. Few exceptions apply to this rule.
The EU directive stipulates that individuals must be provided with access to per-
sonal data collected about them “without constraint at reasonable intervals and
without excessive delay or expense” (Article 12). The directive also states that any
changes individuals request about the personal data collected from them must be
passed on to third parties to whom the data may have been exposed. According to
the directive, individuals in EU member countries must also have the right “as
appropriate” to correct the data collected from them, stop the processing of their
personal data, or even demand that their personal data be removed from databases. 
To ensure the control of individuals over their personal data, the EU directive
requires that personal data collection from individuals in EU member countries be
limited to specific and clearly articulated purposes. Article 6[1b] states that data
must be “collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further
processed in a way incompatible with those purposes.” In other words, data can be
collected only to the extent that the collection is in line with the specified purposes.
Moreover, if an entity that has collected personal data would like to use the data for
a purpose not specified in the original data collection process, and to which indi-
viduals therefore did not consent, the entity must request renewed, unambiguous
consent from those individuals to the new use of their personal data. Data can,
however, be used for statistical or scholarly purposes as long as member states
establish guidelines for such usage that are line with the directive.

European Data Protection Directive
›
209
In addition, the directive limits the types of the data that can be collected from
individuals in EU member states. For example, data that reveal an individual’s eth-
nic origin, race, political conviction, religious beliefs, or health and sexuality
cannot be collected unless the entity collecting such information has the right to do
so in the member country (e.g., for the performance of government services,
employment, etc.).
The principle of accuracy is an important component of the directive’s overall
emphasis on data quality. According to Article 6[1]d, those who collect personal
data from individuals must ensure that such data be “accurate, and where neces-
sary, kept up to date.” If the accuracy of the data cannot be confirmed, the data
must be erased. The directive states, “Every reasonable step must be taken to
ensure that data which are inaccurate and incomplete . . . are erased or rectified.” 
To protect the rights of individuals regarding their own personal information, the
EU directive requires that those who collect personal data from individuals ensure
that these data are kept secure. Data controllers must implement “appropriate tech-
nical and organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or
unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or
access” (Article 17[1]). In essence, the entity collecting personal data is responsi-
ble for protecting the data from unlawful uses, manipulation, or loss.
Although redress does not fall under the usual set of “fair information princi-
ples,” it is an important principle for adequate data protection according to the EU
directive. Redress is to be guaranteed by public independent authorities: “Each
Member State shall provide that one or more public authorities are responsible for
monitoring the application within its territory of . . . this Directive. These authori-
ties shall act with complete independence” (Article 28[1]). The purpose of such an
independent mechanism is to ensure that individuals have recourse if they feel that
their right to their personal data has been infringed. Thus, EU member countries
must not only verify the independence of their data protection authorities, but also
bestow on them the power to investigate claims of data protection violations, to
intervene and stop the collection of personal data, and to initiate legal procedures
against violators of data protection rights. 
Based on the recognition that data from EU citizens is collected by entities not
only in the EU but also from countries outside the EU, the directive stipulates that
personal data about EU citizens can be transferred only to those countries that offer
individuals “adequate” protection of their right to their personal information. As
stated in Article 25[1], “the Member States shall provide that the transfer to a third
country of personal data . . . may take place only if . . . the third country in question
ensures an adequate level of protection.” For example, a business traveler from a
country without adequate protection may not take data about business or customer
contacts collected in EU member countries outside the EU. By barring the transfer
of personal data from EU citizens to businesses and other entities in countries with-
out levels of privacy protection deemed appropriate by the EU, the directive sets de
facto standards for data protection internationally. Accordingly, countries such as
Canada, Australia, and Japan have implemented data protection laws that provide
similar levels of protection for personal data. Others—in particular the United
States—have worked out special agreements with the EU so that U.S. businesses
can claim compliance with these principles.

F
Fair Credit Reporting Act
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is the principal federal statute regulating
the activities of credit bureaus and users of credit reports. Credit bureaus are private
companies that maintain computerized records of consumers’ credit histories
(known as credit or consumer reports). There are three national credit reporting
companies, each of which keeps reports on millions of consumers. Reports include
information on consumer debts, payment habits, bank accounts, employment, and
other personal information. Credit bureaus issue reports to employers, credit card
companies, insurers, banks, and other businesses upon request and payment of an
issuance fee. The businesses then use the information to make decisions about hir-
ing, extensions of credit, issuance of insurance policies, and other matters of con-
sumer concern. The FCRA establishes the rights of consumers whose credit reports
are maintained by credit bureaus and ensures that reports are reasonably accurate
and released only for purposes permitted by the law. 
Enacted in 1970 as a new title to the Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968,
the FCRA was drafted to accommodate the sometimes conflicting goals of facili-
tating the free flow of information about consumers while ensuring the issuance of
substantially accurate reports. The law attempts to balance the interests of consum-
ers in having accurate credit reports against the desire of the business community
to obtain quick and inexpensive data necessary to make informed commercial deci-
sions. Thus, while the law tries to ensure that credit bureaus issue consumer reports
fairly, accurately, and with respect for the consumer’s right to privacy, it does not
mandate completely accurate credit reports or give consumers control over who
may see their reports. The FCRA provides a base level of consumer protection that
relies on consumers monitoring their reports and correcting inaccuracies as they
find them. 
To prove a credit bureau’s violation of the accuracy requirements imposed by
the FCRA, a consumer first must establish that the report is materially incorrect.
Early court decisions applied a narrow test of accuracy and rejected claims that the
information contained in a report, while technically correct, was misleading,
incomplete, or irrelevant. These decisions were subject to criticism, and courts in
recent years have upheld consumer claims when reports are technically accurate
\
\

212
Fair Credit Reporting Act
\
but misleading. When information is so incomplete as to be misleading and when
clarifying information is readily obtainable, courts may find that the accuracy
requirement of the FCRA has been violated. 
Even if a consumer can establish that the report contains inaccurate or
extremely misleading information, the credit bureau still may not have violated
the act. The FCRA does not mandate accurate credit reports, only that credit
bureaus maintain “reasonable procedures” to assure “maximum possible accu-
racy.” In any action against a credit bureau for inaccurate reporting, the consumer
has the additional burden of proving that the bureau did not have reasonable pro-
cedures in place. While the law does not specify the precise procedures a bureau
must establish, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued guidelines and
general standards that bureaus are expected to follow. For example, bureaus
should implement procedures to ensure that its employees are properly trained to
create, update, and release consumer reports, and that data are properly recorded
and reproduced. Agencies that transmit data electronically over long distances
(the dominant method under current practice) must ensure that the information is
properly converted to computer format and that it is neither modified nor suscep-
tible to unauthorized access during transmission. As with the FCRA in general,
determining the reasonableness of reporting procedures requires balancing the
credit bureau’s interest in minimizing time and expense against the consumer’s
interest in accuracy. 
Studies have shown that a significant percentage of the credit reports existing in
credit bureau databases contain erroneous information. The most common errors
include mistaken information about the status of an account or payment history,
information about one consumer mixed with data on a different individual, and the
failure of the credit reporting agency to remove obsolete information as required by
the FCRA.
Credit bureaus cannot be guarantors of completely accurate information.
Bureaus obtain most of the information in credit reports from outside sources, typ-
ically businesses that extend credit and provide payment histories to the bureau for
inclusion in consumers’ files. The FTC and the courts have concluded, however,
that credit bureaus are not merely conduits of information. If the bureau should rea-
sonably be aware of errors that indicate systemic problems or a pattern of unreli-
ability with a particular source of information, the bureau should evaluate its
procedures and implement cost-effective adjustments. In addition, the law requires
periodic review of data to determine whether information has become obsolete or
misleading with the passage of time. 
Except in transactions involving large amounts of money, credit bureaus may
not disclose adverse information that is more than 7 years old (10 years for infor-
mation about bankruptcies). There is no requirement that a credit bureau delete
obsolete information from its files, only that it not include such information in a
report unless the monetary thresholds are satisfied. Consumers can enforce this part
of the FCRA with relative ease because, unlike the disclosure of inaccurate infor-
mation, a bureau’s improper disclosure of obsolete information automatically vio-
lates the FCRA regardless of the reasonableness of the agency’s procedures. While
instances of unlawful disclosure of obsolete information are not uncommon, many
of the disputes over this section of the FCRA center on whether the credit bureau

Fair Credit Reporting Act
›
213
had reasonable grounds to believe that the information was being disclosed in con-
nection with one of the specified exempt transactions involving large sums of
money. 
The only way consumers can ensure that their credit files are completely accu-
rate is to discover and correct errors themselves. The FCRA facilitates this task by
giving consumers the right to learn the contents of their credit bureau files. The
FCRA requires that information in a consumer’s file be available upon proper iden-
tification. The consumer has a right to receive one free copy from each of the three
major credit bureaus per year (and more than one copy in some states). 
Before credit reports were available on the Internet, only a small percentage
of consumers reviewed their reports on a regular basis. Today, most consumers
are aware that credit reports exist and that they have a right to access them. In
addition, when a creditor, employer, or insurance company uses negative credit
information to make an adverse decision, the FCRA requires that the consumer
be informed of his right to review the report that influenced the decision. The
user of the report must inform the consumer that a report was considered and
must provide the contact information of the bureau issuing the report. This infor-
mation prompts many consumers to contact the credit bureau and request a copy
of the report.
A credit bureau can only disclose the information in its own file. Other credit
bureaus may have files containing information compiled from the same or different
sources. Thus, even if the consumer discovers and corrects erroneous information
in the file of the one bureau contacted, the same data may be present in the files of
other bureaus that potential creditors might use. 
If a consumer questions the accuracy of a report and believes that additional
information would correct an error or clarify a misleading statement, the bureau
must make a good faith investigation of the claim. According to the FTC, at a min-
imum, the bureau must verify the information within a reasonable time by checking
back with the original source and confirming the data. An exception to the investi-
gation requirement is when the bureau has reason to believe that the consumer’s
dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. If, after the investigation, the bureau agrees with
the consumer and finds the information to be inaccurate, the bureau must delete the
data from its files. If the consumer is not satisfied with the outcome of the investi-
gation, the consumer may file with the bureau a brief statement clarifying his or her
side of the dispute. In subsequent reports, the bureau must note that the item is dis-
puted and must provide either the consumer’s statement or a clear summary of the
dispute along with the report. 
If the investigation results in the deletion of information or the inclusion of a
consumer’s statement of dispute, the consumer still must contact the other two
major credit bureaus to correct erroneous information that may be in their files. 
To protect consumer privacy, credit bureaus are prohibited from releasing
credit reports except for specific purposes. Permissible purposes include applica-
tions for credit, insurance, employment, and housing rentals. Reports can also be
issued for review of existing accounts (for example, to a creditor or insurer decid-
ing whether to retain the consumer as a customer), and for a promotion or reten-
tion decision by an employer. Other permitted uses include court orders, law
enforcement, child support payment determinations, and professional licensing

214
Fair information practices
\
decisions. The law also allows release of a report generally for any “legitimate”
business need in a transaction initiated by the consumer for personal, family, or
household purposes. 
The FCRA was amended in 2003 to help consumers address problems associated
with identity fraud and theft. If consumers believe that someone is opening
accounts in their names or is otherwise impersonating them, they can request that
“fraud alerts” be placed on their credit reports. A fraud alert indicates that a consumer
does not authorize new credit or increases in credit limits on an existing account. A
consumer may include a telephone contact number that must be called to identify the
consumer before any new account is opened. The law also requires merchants to
truncate credit and debit card numbers on electronically printed receipts, thus reduc-
ing the risk of stolen card numbers, and includes new rights that help consumers rem-
edy the effects of identity theft and restore their credit histories.

Fair information practices
Fair information practices (FIPs) are a set of principles for defining and address-
ing concerns about privacy of personal information. In most countries with privacy
laws, FIPs are officially acknowledged as core privacy principles and incorporated
in privacy and data protection laws. The international policy convergence around
FIPs as core elements for information privacy has remained in place since the late
1970s. United States privacy laws, which are much less comprehensive in scope
than laws in other countries, often reflect some FIPs elements. However, FIPs prin-
ciples are much less universally recognized and followed. 
Fair information practices were invented by a U.S. government advisory
committee in a 1973 report issued by the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on
Automated Personal Data Systems. Elliot Richardson, secretary of the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and Welfare, established the committee in response
to the growing use of automated data systems containing information about
individuals. 
The central contribution of the advisory committee was the development of a
code of fair information practices for automated personal data systems. According
to Committee Chairman Willis Ware, the name Code of Fair Information Practices
was inspired by the Code of Fair Labor Practices. According to the committee’s
original formulation of the code, 

Fair information practices

Safeguards for personal privacy based on our concept of mutuality in record
keeping would require adherence by record-keeping organizations to cer-
tain fundamental principles of fair information practice:
• There must be no personal-data record-keeping systems whose very existence
is secret;
• There must be a way for an individual to find out what information about
him is in a record and how it is used;
• There must be a way for an individual to prevent information about him
obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other
purposes without his consent;
• There must be a way for an individual to correct or amend a record of
identifiable information about himself; and
• Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of
identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their
intended use and must take reasonable precautions to prevent misuse of the
data.
The first formal statutory implementation of FIPs came in the Privacy Act of
1974 (5 U.S.C. §552a), a law applicable to federal agencies. The act reflects the
committee’s recommendations for a federal privacy statute. However, the first stat-
utory mention of FIPs did not come until 2002, when Congress established a
Department of Homeland Security Privacy Office with responsibility for ensuring
compliance with fair information practices as set out in the Privacy Act.
Around the same time that the U.S. enacted the Privacy Act of 1974, European
countries began to pass national privacy laws applicable to the public and private
sectors, beginning with Sweden in 1973 and the Federal Republic of Germany in
1977. Both countries’ laws were consistent with or relied upon FIPs. Other Euro-
pean countries enacted comparable privacy laws in the late 1970s and early
1980s.
As privacy laws spread within Europe, international institutions began to
address privacy and the international implications of privacy regulation. The Coun-
cil of Europe adopted the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard
to Automatic Processing of Personal Data in 1980. The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) proposed similar privacy guidelines
around the same time.
FIPs provided core principles for both documents, but both organizations
revised and extended the original U.S. statement of FIPs. The work of the Council
of Europe and the OECD contributed to the international spread of FIPs as core pri-
vacy policies. Of the two early-1980s international privacy documents, the OECD
Privacy Guidelines are cited most often. 
The eight principles set out by the OECD are:
Collection Limitation Principle: There should be limits to the collection of
personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair
means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data
subject.

216
Fair information practices
\
Data Quality Principle: Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for
which they are to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes,
should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date.
Purpose Specification Principle: The purposes for which personal data are
collected should be specified not later than at the time of data collection and
the subsequent use limited to the fulfillment of those purposes or such oth-
ers as are not incompatible with those purposes and as are specified on each
occasion of change of purpose.
Use Limitation Principle: Personal data should not be disclosed, made
available or otherwise used for purposes other than those specified in accor-
dance with [the Purpose Specification Principle] except: (a) with the con-
sent of the data subject; or (b) by the authority of law.
Security Safeguards Principle: Personal data should be protected by rea-
sonable security safeguards against such risks as loss or unauthorized
access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of data.
Openness Principle: There should be a general policy of openness about
developments, practices and policies with respect to personal data. Means
should be readily available of establishing the existence and nature of per-
sonal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the identity and
usual residence of the data controller.
Individual Participation Principle: An individual should have the right: (a)
to obtain from a data controller, or otherwise, confirmation of whether or
not the data controller has data relating to him; (b) to have communicated
to him, data relating to him within a reasonable time; at a charge, if any, that
is not excessive; in a reasonable manner; and in a form that is readily intel-
ligible to him; (c) to be given reasons if a request made under subparagraphs
(a) and (b) is denied, and to be able to challenge such denial; and (d) to chal-
lenge data relating to him and, if the challenge is successful, to have the data
erased, rectified, completed, or amended.
Accountability Principle: A data controller should be accountable for com-
plying with measures, which give effect to the principles stated above.
The reliance on FIPs by the European Union in its 1985 European Data Protection
Directive ensured the spread of FIPs throughout Europe.
Different statements of FIPs sometimes appear disparate, but the content is fre-
quently similar. However, statutory implementations of the principles may vary in
different countries and in different sectors. The international agreement on basic
principles should not obscure the complexity of the policies, the considerable vari-
ation in their application, and the controversy about their implementation in differ-
ent contexts and by different record keepers. 
In the United States, law occasionally requires elements of FIPs, but private-sector
compliance, while slowly increasing, is mostly voluntary and sporadic. Also, short-
ened or incomplete versions of FIPs have sometimes been offered in the United
States by federal agencies or trade associations. The United States is a significant lag-
gard among industrialized nations in implementation of FIPs. 
Critics of FIPs can be found on both sides. Some believe that FIPs are too weak,
allow too many exemptions, do not require a privacy agency, and have failed to
keep pace with information technology. Critics from a business perspective often

prefer to limit FIPs to reduced elements of notice, consent, and accountability.
They complain that other elements are unworkable, expensive, or inconsistent with
openness or free-speech principles.
In 1999 Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court of Australia and former chair of
the OECD committee that developed the 1980 guidelines spoke at an international
privacy conference. He noted the many changes brought about by new computer and
communication technologies and suggested that it might be time for a review of the
guidelines.

Family
Privacy within family law has two fundamental yet interrelated meanings. First,
privacy can mean privatization, the use of internal rather than external norms, and
thus, the legal ability of those within the relationship to control their own rights and
responsibilities, such as through prenuptial contracts, cohabitation agreements, or
separation agreements. There has been a general movement since the last third of
the twentieth century to allow for increased private contracting before, during, and
at the end of marriage, as well as between cohabiting couples. States have adopted
different standards for judging these contracts, sometimes applying general stan-
dards of contract law, while at other times stressing the nature of the fiduciary rela-
tionship between marital partners. While these contracts have been upheld when
they relate to obligations between intimate partners, courts have been far stricter
when these agreements affect the rights of children through child support or child
custody, generally holding that the state must decide these issues under a “best
interest of the child” test.

\
Second, privacy can denote a protected sphere. The right to engage in any activi-
ties that one chooses within that sphere. Older understandings of marital privacy were
summarized by Blackstone as involving the wife’s legal existence being “suspended”
during the course of the marriage, with the husband responsible for protecting his
wife during her coverture. Based on this reasoning, a wife could not testify against
her husband in court because she did not have a separate legal identity from him. As
another example, because of the wife’s legal disabilities during marriage, there was a
specific doctrine—the “necessaries doctrine”—that allowed her to buy necessities
from a third party, using her husband’s credit. If the husband refused to pay for the
necessaries, the creditor could sue the husband for the debt. As women have become
able to maintain their own separate existence during marriage, the conceptions of
marital privacy have changed.
Based on contemporary privacy law, this entry discusses two different aspects of
family privacy: (1) the marital relationship and (2) the parent-child relationship. A
third form of familial privacy related to sexual decisionmaking outside of marriage
is discussed elsewhere. The constitutional development of marital relationship
privacy involves two distinct elements: the right to marry and the right to sexual
privacy for marital decisionmaking. 
The first form of marital privacy protects the very decision of whom to marry.
State laws generally establish who may marry whom, prohibiting, for example,
polygamous and incestuous marriages. Although the Supreme Court had fre-
quently discussed the right to marry, it was only in 1967 that the Court addressed
the nature of the right itself, striking down Virginia’s anti-miscegenation law in
Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967). In subsequent cases, the Court established
the quasi-fundamental nature of the right (for heterosexuals) to marry. This form of
marital privacy has become increasingly controversial in the context of same-sex
marriage, where advocates argue that individuals should have the freedom to
choose their partners. In Goodridge et al. v. Department of Public Health (2003),
finding a right to same-sex marriage, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
reiterated that individuals are protected against burdensome regulations of their
right to marry, finding that the Massachusetts constitution prevented undue govern-
mental interference with issues of “personal liberty.” On the other hand, other
courts have distinguished the fundamental nature of the right to marry a person of
the opposite sex, which is historically protected, from the option of marrying a per-
son of the same sex, which has not been a traditionally protected legal right. Courts
have repeatedly held that the right to marital privacy does not extend to polyga-
mous or incestuous relationships. 
The second form of marital privacy involves the right to relational privacy; this
right is most frequently addressed in the context of sexual decisionmaking. Perhaps
the first reference in Supreme Court jurisprudence to the privacy of the marital rela-
tion occurs in the 1885 bigamy prosecution of Cannon v. United States. Angus Can-
non was unable to offer testimony that he had not “cohabited,” in a sexual sense, with
a particular woman, because the Court was so protective of marital privacy.
The concept of marital privacy was also important in other nineteenth-century
courts. Marital privacy was repeatedly used as a justification for failing to prose-
cute spousal violence. Rather than sustaining the eighteenth-century notion of mar-
ital unity, nineteenth-century courts began to use marital privacy as the theory for

Family

219
protecting against intervention in the ongoing family. By contrast, divorce courts
often inquired into minute details of marriages; once the marriage ended, courts
felt free to examine the marital relationship in surprising detail. 
It was only in 1965, in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, that the Court
directly addressed the concept of marital privacy, locating it in the penumbras of
various constitutional rights. Griswold involved the provision of contraceptives to
a married couple in violation of a Connecticut statute that criminalized the using,
or helping others to use, contraceptives. Seven years later, in Eisenstadt v. Baird,
405 U.S. 438 (1972), a contraceptive case involving unmarried people, the Court
found that the right to privacy was not restricted to the confines of marriage, and
that, although it attached to marital couples, it also attached to individuals who
might comprise a couple. In 2003, in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, the Court
allowed the right of privacy to protect same-sex sexual intimacy.
Because marital privacy applies both to the couple and to the individuals
involved in a marriage, a wife is not required to inform her husband, much less
receive his consent, before having an abortion. The Supreme Court recognized,
in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992), that while
both marital partners have similar interests in living children, state abortion reg-
ulations have a much stronger effect on the wife’s liberty interest than on the
husband’s.
Ultimately, the constitutionally developed right to marital privacy protects the
relationship between husband and wife from undue interference. It creates and
preserves a “zone of privacy” surrounding the marital relationship, specifically
in the context of sexual decisionmaking, but also more generally in its affirma-
tion of other constitutional protections for the home and the family. 
Turning to the second aspect of family relationship privacy, there are several
different categories of parent-child privacy that courts have defined and pro-
tected. First, there is a right to raise children, including the authority to direct
their religious and educational upbringing, which has been repeatedly recognized
by the Supreme Court. Second, there is, at least under certain circumstances, a
right to establish a relationship with a child that is explicit in cases involving
unwed fathers. 
One critical aspect of parent-child relational privacy concerns the right to
raise a child in the manner that one chooses. In Meyer v. Nebraska (1923), the
Court asserted that the right of liberty “denotes not merely freedom from
bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any
of the common occupations of life . . . to marry, establish a home and bring up
children.” 
Parental autonomy is not absolute. Indeed, although courts defer to the notion
of parental control, the state can remove children from their parents’ care for
abuse and neglect, require children to attend some form of schooling, and estab-
lish a minimum work age for children. Moreover, just as with respect to other pri-
vacy rights, the constitutional reasoning that supports parental autonomy is
somewhat sparse, even if it is grounded in pragmatic concerns. In Meyer, the
Court explained that it had never posited a definitive explanation of the liberty
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, but that “without doubt,” it included

220
Family
\
the right to raise children. On the other hand, regardless of their legal basis, the
cases can be seen as establishing a precedent for privacy. 
A second aspect of parent-child privacy concerns the rights of men to have
relationships with their children: a married man has the right to a relationship
with a child, and an unmarried man has an enforceable right against an unmarried
mother to establish a relationship with their child. In a series of cases beginning
with Stanley v. Illinois in 1972, the Supreme Court considered the rights of unwed
fathers. Generally, the Court has protected the rights of unwed fathers when they
have lived with or established a substantial relationship with their children,
unless the unwed father is asserting rights against an “intact” family.
In the first case, Stanley v. Illinois, the Court used procedural due process to
find that an intact biological family could not be broken up without a hearing on
the unfitness of the parents. The father in that case had lived sporadically with his
children. Six years later, the Court held in Quilloin v. Walcott, that an unwed
father who had not lived with his children could be denied parental rights based
on application of the best interest standard. Allowing the new husband of the bio-
logical mother to adopt the children would help preserve an existing family unit,
and because the biological father had never lived with the child or the mother, the
Court held that the state could deem his rights inferior to the best interests of the
child. One year later, however, the Court struck down a statute that precluded an
unwed father from objecting to the adoption of his children since he had main-
tained a substantial relationship, had lived with and had acknowledged paternity
of his children.
Then, in Michael H. v. Gerald D., the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional-
ity of a California statute that presumed that a child born to a married woman,
who was cohabiting with her husband, was a child of the marriage, unless the
presumption was challenged within two years. In that case, a man not married to
the mother had a 98.07 percent probability of being the biological father; he
sought to be declared the father under California law. Even though he had some
established relationship to both the mother and the child, and had lived with them
both, he had no constitutionally recognized legal rights as a father. A plurality of
the Court opined that the family unit traditionally given respect did not include
an unwed father who sought to establish a relationship with his child when the
mother was married to someone else.
The unwed child cases can be reconciled to mean three things. First, unwed
fathers have the opportunity, in certain circumstances, to establish relationships
with their children. Second, preservation of the traditional family unit takes pri-
ority over the rights of even the unwed biological fathers who do establish a rela-
tionship with their children. Third, although a relationship may exist between an
unwed father and his child, legal rights as a father may not always be recognized.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
Few privacy laws affect the lives of parents and students on an everyday basis as
does the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA affords par-
ents the right to inspect and review their children’s education records; the right to
seek to amend information in the records they believe to be inaccurate, misleading, or
a violation of privacy; and the right to consent to the disclosure of personally identi-
fiable information from the education records. When a student turns 18 years old or
enters a postsecondary institution at any age, the rights under FERPA transfer from
that student’s parents to the student (“eligible student”). The FERPA statutory cita-
tion is 20 U.S.C. §1232g and its regulatory citation is 34 C.F.R. Part 99.
FERPA was one of the first federal privacy statutes passed by Congress. Senator
James L. Buckley of New York was the main architect and legislative sponsor of
FERPA, adding the provisions as an amendment to a pending education bill in the
summer of 1974. By introducing this legislation, Buckley sought to address what
he viewed as a violation of the rights of parents, who were being denied access to
information schools maintained on their children, and to address a routine lack of
privacy of students’ education records. President Ford signed FERPA into law on
August 21, 1974, with an effective date of November 19, 1974. On December 31,
1974, Senator Buckley and Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island cosponsored
major amendments to FERPA to address ambiguities that had arisen about the new
requirements in the four months after its passage, making the changes retroactive to
its effective date.
Simply put, FERPA protects the privacy of education records and the privacy
interests of parents in their children’s education records. FERPA does this by con-
ditioning the receipt of federal education dollars by educational agencies and insti-
tutions on the condition of compliance with FERPA’s requirements. As a general
rule, FERPA applies to all public school districts and virtually all postsecondary
institutions, public and private. Private schools at the K-12 level, for the most part,
are not recipients of U.S. Department of Education funds and are, thus, not subject
to FERPA. 
The requirements of FERPA center on the definition of “education records.”
The term is broadly defined to mean all records that contain information directly
related to a student and that are maintained by the educational agency or institu-
tion or by a party acting for the agency or institution. While parents and eligible
students must provide consent before personally identifiable information from

222
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
\
education records is released, there are a number of exceptions to the general
consent rule. Most of these exceptions are commonsense disclosures that allow
schools to carry out the business of educating students, such as release of student
information to school officials who have a legitimate educational interest; trans-
fer of a student’s records to a new school or college; disclosure of necessary
information to state and federal education authorities for an audit or evaluation of
education programs or for the enforcement of federal legal requirements that
relate to education programs; disclosure of “directory information” (such as
name, address, and major) on students for school yearbooks, plays, and sports
events; and the release of information to appropriate authorities to address health
or safety emergencies. At the postsecondary level, even though the rights under
FERPA belong to the student, there are several exceptions to the general consent
rule that permit colleges and universities to share information with parents with-
out the eligible student’s consent, most notably, an exception that allows disclo-
sures to parents of students who are claimed as dependents for federal income tax
purposes.
There is no specific exception to FERPA’s general consent rule for the disclosure
to noneducational agencies, although some of the exceptions could apply under cer-
tain circumstances. For instance, a student’s health records, including immunization
records, that are maintained by a school are considered education records and may
not be disclosed to a local or state health department without consent. However, a
school could use FERPA’s health or safety emergency exception to disclose person-
ally identifiable information from students’ education records to local or state health
authorities in a situation that presents imminent danger to students or other members
of the school community, such as an outbreak of an epidemic. 
Also, there is no specific exception in FERPA for disclosing education records
to local or state law enforcement authorities, yet FERPA permits school officials to
comply with lawfully issued subpoenas and court orders, as long as certain condi-
tions are met. In addition, records that are created by a school’s campus law
enforcement unit for the purpose of maintaining a safe campus and reporting crime
are not considered education records and, thus, may be shared with outside law
enforcement authorities.
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) works hand-in-hand
with FERPA to protect the privacy of education records of students with disabili-
ties. School officials must take into consideration both FERPA and IDEA when
making decisions about disclosing education records of disabled students. IDEA
contains safeguards and provisions not found in FERPA that afford additional
rights to parents of students covered by IDEA.
The FERPA statute and regulations contain administrative enforcement provi-
sions, including a complaint procedure under which parents and eligible students
may file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education. A unique aspect of the
FERPA enforcement provisions is the requirement that the department seek volun-
tary compliance from schools before proceeding with enforcement actions, such as
withholding federal funds. Perhaps Congress was incorporating into FERPA a fun-
damental respect for the long-established view that local and state governments are
to control education matters. Whatever the reason, it has worked well. For the most
part, schools want to be in compliance with FERPA, and routinely request training

223
on the law and seek out technical assistance from the department regarding its
application.
FERPA has been amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Pro-
viding Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act
of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) to permit schools to disclose personally identifiable
information on students to the U. S. attorney general in compliance with an ex
parte order, a court order that is issued without the consent or knowledge of the
parent or student, related to anti-terrorism activities. One of the more interesting
aspects of FERPA is how it applies to disclosures that concern national security.
Historically, FERPA has always permitted schools to disclose personally identifi-
able information from education records in order to comply with lawfully issued
subpoenas and court orders, as long as the school made a reasonable attempt to
notify the parents or students whose records were being requested, prior to compli-
ance. In 1994 Congress amended that provision to permit educational agencies and
institutions to disclose education records in order to comply with court orders or
subpoenas issued for law enforcement purposes, without the required notification,
if the court or issuing agency so ordered. More than likely, Congress made this ini-
tial change in order to assist law enforcement authorities with investigations con-
cerning illegal drugs. 
Today, education officials routinely address competing interests of privacy ver-
sus accountability, privacy versus safe campuses, privacy versus national security,
and privacy versus an increasing demand for information. All in all, FERPA has
worked well, and has provided parents and students with valuable privacy rights
with regard to education records.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Created in July 1908 as the investigative division of the Department of Justice,
the Bureau of Investigation (renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935)
has experienced a steady increase in its role and authority. At the time of its cre-
ation, the bureau had one supervisor and nine agents; by 2003 its personnel had
increased to 27,856 (11,776 agents and 16,080 support staff). This growth captures
the significant change in public policy and popular values that evolved during the
twentieth century: the rejection of a states’ rights tradition that feared centralized
power, and thus viewed law enforcement as a local and state responsibility, to the
acceptance of the need for and value of an inherently secret federal police force.
The resultant growth in FBI resources (with FBI appropriations increasing from
an estimated $329,824 in 1911 to $4.3 billion in 2003) was accompanied by an

224
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
\
unprecedented increase in FBI investigative capabilities. This growth was accom-
plished through technological innovations such as wiretapping, bugging, data
banks, and computers, as well as the use of break-ins to photograph confidential
records, all of which posed potential threats to privacy rights. A more powerful FBI
could obtain and then act upon information about the noncriminal personal and polit-
ical activities of individuals and of the organizations with which they were affiliated.
Congress’s enactment of legislation expanding federal responsibilities and sur-
veillance authority compounded this privacy problem. These laws included crimi-
nalizing prostitution in 1910, proscribing pornography (as early as 1878),
legalizing wiretapping and bugging in 1968, and authorizing roving wiretaps and
computer, credit, and library searches without having to meet a “probable cause”
standard of a federal law violation in 2001. 
As one byproduct, FBI investigations of so-called White-Slave Traffic Act (also
know as the Mann Act, 1910) cases moved beyond organized prostitution and
resulted in FBI agents monitoring and maintaining information about illicit sexual
conduct. For example, in 1925, FBI officials established a discrete “obscene file” to
centralize and maintain a permanent collection of obscene and pornographic litera-
ture, paraphernalia, and films. These anti-obscenity initiatives became catalysts for
a more benign view of the FBI. In 1946, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover extolled the
“potential publicity value” of obscene literature investigations, observing that such
investigations could also help curb “juvenile delinquency” and stymie “local vice
and crime,” because these were “stimulated through the circulation of pornogra-
phy.” The potential for abusing this information was furthered by new technology
(wiretaps, bugs, databases, and computers) with FBI officials instituting a National
Crime Information Center in 1967 that had terminal connections to all arrest and
identification records developed by local and state police agencies. Nonetheless,
the most far-reaching development affecting privacy rights stemmed from secret
initiatives instituted in response to security concerns triggered by World War II, the
Cold War, and the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.
The perceived subversive threat posed by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia,
which culminated in U.S. military involvement in World War II and in the contain-
ment and nuclear deterrent policies of the Cold War, reshaped the FBI’s role and
contributed to Congress’s and the public’s acceptance of the need for secrecy. In
August 1936, in an effort to anticipate espionage or sabotage, President Franklin
Roosevelt issued a secret oral directive authorizing the FBI to conduct “intelli-
gence” investigations. Intelligence investigations differed from criminal investiga-
tions, which were predicated on a probable cause standard, in that they were based
on mere suspicion about an individual or organization, owing to ideology or sym-
pathies. Four years later, in May 1940, Roosevelt issued a secret directive authoriz-
ing FBI “national defense” wiretapping, which was banned by a 1934 law.
Meanwhile, on his own, J. Edgar Hoover authorized FBI break-in and bugging
activities, dating from 1942 and in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Intelligence investigations, moreover, led to the creation and maintenance of
files that contained derogatory personal and political information and that were
not finite in duration. A criminal investigation could be initiated on the premise
that the subject was suspected of planning to violate (or had violated) a federal
statute. Such investigations continued until prosecution was effected or when no

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
›
225
(or insufficient) evidence of a federal crime was uncovered; in both instances, the
file then would be closed. Intelligence investigations, in contrast, did not focus
solely on conduct but focused as well on intent, resulting in the collection of
information about the subject’s personal character, associations, social attitudes,
and political activities. These investigations were not finite, and the resultant
files were not necessarily closed should no evidence be uncovered of criminal
conduct, such as espionage, sabotage, or terrorism.
Furthermore, the FBI began to maintain files on individuals whose names came up
as a result of their association with the subjects of criminal or intelligence investiga-
tions. A file would be opened on an individual named in an ongoing investigation.
Similarly obtained information would subsequently be added to the file. As a result,
the FBI retained information on hundreds of thousands of individuals who might
never have been directly investigated. The scope and contents of FBI records are sug-
gested by released FBI files on prominent Americans, including First Lady Eleanor
Roosevelt, Illinois governor and Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson,
presidents John Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower, Under Secretary of State Sumner
Welles, anti–Vietnam War activist John Kerry, folk singer Pete Seeger, and feminist
activist Gloria Steinem.
Significantly, information obtained through intelligence investigations could not
be used for prosecutive purposes, whether because it was obtained through illegal
investigative techniques or because it did not confirm a violation of a federal stat-
ute. Most FBI intelligence investigations uncovered no information about planned
espionage, sabotage, or terrorist activities, but only about the subject’s personal
conduct and political activities. This violation of privacy rights was soon com-
pounded by FBI officials’ alternative tactics of using this information to contain or
discredit radical activists and even prominent citizens.
At first informally and episodically, FBI officials in time sought to ensure that
such sensitive information could be disseminated more efficiently. Beginning in
February 1946, FBI officials launched an “educational” campaign to “influence
public opinion” by using carefully orchestrated and camouflaged leaks through
“available channels”; i.e., to favored reporters, columnists, editors, congressional
committees, members of Congress, and prominent citizens. Specific recipients
included conservative reporters such as Walter Trohan and Don Whitehead, mem-
bers of Congress such as Senator Joseph McCarthy and then Congressmen Richard
Nixon, congressional committees including the House Un-American Activities
Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, as well as trusted state
officials and prominent citizens. FBI officials even devised formal programs to
contain or discredit individuals whose political activities or personal conduct they
deemed abhorrent. These formal programs included the Counter Intelligence Pro-
gram (COINTELPRO) (1956), Sex Deviate (1951), Responsibilities (1951), and
Mass Media (1955).
The origin and evolving purpose of the Sex Deviate program highlights the pri-
vacy problem posed by FBI officials’ intrusive and secret methods. FBI agents began
to collect and maintain information on homosexuals dating from 1937. Until 1951 no
action was apparently taken as a result of this collection activity. In 1950, in a com-
panion investigation to that triggered in response to Senator Joseph McCarthy’s
charges of “known Communists in the State Department,” a special Senate commit-

226
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
\
tee launched an investigation into allegations of homosexuals in the State Depart-
ment, based on the premise that the employment of homosexuals posed a security
risk because of their vulnerability to blackmail. In response, in June 1951, FBI offi-
cials launched a code-named Sex Deviate program with the goal of purging sus-
pected homosexuals from employment in the federal bureaucracy, judiciary, and
Congress. By 1954, FBI officials also began disseminating information about sus-
pected homosexuals to, at least, “proper” university and police officials “in appropri-
ate instances where the best interests of the Bureau is [sic] served.”
Dating from 1940, moreover, FBI officials regularly forwarded reports (some
volunteered, others in response to requests) to the White House about presidents’
political critics, including dispatching a special squad to the 1964 Democratic
National Convention to monitor the contacts and report on the plans of civil rights
activists aligned with the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. FBI officials also
conducted leak investigations at White House request and (again at White House
request) conducted “name checks” on specified reporters (Harrison Salisbury, Peter
Lisagor, Ben Gilbert, Joseph Alsop); that is, they complied memoranda summariz-
ing all information in FBI files about the individual. A particularly egregious such
action involved a November 1970 Nixon White House request that the FBI forward
a list (and all relevant information) of homosexuals and “any other stuff” on mem-
bers of the Washington press corps.
FBI dissemination activities could have posed a potential political problem for
FBI officials because they contradicted their own protestations that FBI files were
confidential, and that FBI investigations were confined to violations of federal stat-
utes. FBI officials could be confident that their dissemination practices would not
be compromised by White House officials who shared a mutual interest in main-
taining secrecy. In the cases of the media and Congress, FBI officials adopted pre-
cautions to preclude discovery. First, they only leaked information to reporters or
members of Congress whom they deemed reliable and who promised not to dis-
close FBI assistance because they shared a common political interest. In those
cases when the recipient violated the condition of confidentiality, FBI officials
severed relations, as in the case of Senator McCarthy in 1953, and in the case of the
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in 1954. Furthermore, FBI officials never
provided recipients with FBI files or official memoranda. The relevant information
was conveyed in a “blind memorandum” form. Blind memoranda were prepared on
plain white, non-letterhead stationary, allowing FBI officials to deny truthfully that
no official FBI record had been leaked.
Three examples capture the varied and problematic nature of the privacy threats
posed by these covert practices. The first involved Hollywood actor Rock Hudson.
In 1965 FBI officials uncovered information that the Hollywood actor was homo-
sexual. They shared this discovery with President Lyndon Johnson, but while pri-
vately expressing concern that Hudson might play an FBI agent in a movie, there is
no direct evidence that they sought to influence Hudson’s acting career. 
The same was not true, however, for syndicated columnist Joseph Alsop. Having
learned in 1957 that Alsop had been compromised in a homosexual tryst in Mos-
cow, FBI officials briefed senior Eisenhower administration officials (Attorney
General Herbert Brownell and White House aide Sherman Adams) about this mat-
ter as well as other information that the FBI had uncovered about Alsop’s sexual

proclivities. Infuriated by a series of columns that Alsop had recently published
criticizing the Eisenhower administration’s fiscal conservatism for contributing to a
“missile gap,” then Attorney General William Rogers contacted the FBI in 1959 to
obtain a full report on Alsop’s homosexuality, emphasizing his intention to share
this information with senior Eisenhower administration officials and stressing that
he would not “take responsibility for such information not going further.” Briefed
on this matter, Nathan Twining, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, subse-
quently emphasized to Rogers the need to ensure that the publishers of Alsop’s col-
umn learn of this information.
The third and most egregious example involved Civil Rights leader Martin
Luther King, Jr. From wiretaps of King’s office and residence and then bugs
installed in King’s hotel rooms as he traveled around the country, FBI officials
learned of King’s illicit sexual activities. In an effort to contain and discredit the
civil rights leader, triggered in part by antipathy on learning that King would
receive the Nobel Peace Prize, FBI officials unsuccessfully sought to interest vari-
ous reporters in this scandalous information, and then sent a composite tape and an
anonymous letter to King’s residence, threatening to expose King’s “hideous
abominations” in an attempt to intimidate the civil rights leader or even provoke
him to commit suicide. The letter ended, “You are done. There is but one way out
for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.”
The scope of the FBI’s violations of privacy rights and abuses of power became
known only in the 1970s, as the result of the first-ever congressional investigation
of the U.S. intelligence community, with special House and Senate committees
obtaining access to heretofore secret agency records, and then as the result of the
release of FBI records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which
was amended in 1974. While the revelations contributed to a healthy skepticism of
the FBI and a scaling back of FBI activities, Congress did not enact a legislative
charter defining the parameters of the FBI’s authority. As one consequence, the
principal restrictions precluding future violations of privacy rights derived from
executive guidelines. And, while Attorney General Edward Levi instituted rela-
tively strict guidelines in 1976 intended to preclude “security” investigations from
spilling over into monitoring political and personal conduct, these restrictions were
rescinded by more permissive guidelines instituted by Attorney General William
French Smith in 1983, ostensibly to address a new “domestic security” threat of
terrorism.
While fears of domestic terrorism only became a major national concern follow-
ing the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pen-
tagon, FBI investigations of alleged terrorists had earlier spilled over into
monitoring political conduct, as in the case of a 1981–1985 investigation of the
Committee in Support of the People of El Salvador (CISPES), an activist organiza-
tion critical of the Reagan Administration’s Central America policy. In the years
after 2001, and more intensely following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, FBI
investigations have closely monitored Arab American citizens and alien residents
and critics of the Iraq war. In contrast to Cold War investigations, these investiga-
tions could lawfully employ intrusive investigative techniques that had been autho-
rized under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate

228

\
Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA
PATRIOT Act). 
Once again, these investigations were not confined to suspected criminals (in
this case, terrorists). The overwhelming majority of the alien residents detained
in 2001 were found only to have overstayed their visas or relied on forged docu-
ments. Furthermore, although FBI officials during the period October 2001
through December 2002 recommended indictments in 98 terrorist cases, Justice
Department attorneys brought charges in only 60 of the cases, rejecting the oth-
ers either because of the “lack of evidence of criminal intent” or because a fed-
eral crime had not been committed. Of the 60 cases prosecuted, only 16 resulted
in convictions. In one of these cases, however, Justice Department attorneys sub-
sequently petitioned the court to drop the convictions of two defendants, conced-
ing that exculpatory evidence had been withheld from defense attorneys and that
a key government witness was unreliable. A grand jury investigation, aborted in
2004, moreover, confirmed that the targets of this inquiry were either students at
Drake University or Des Moines, Iowa, peace activists who had organized a con-
ference to rally opposition to the Iraq war. Publicity about the target of the sub-
poenas led the United States Attorney in Des Moines to suspend this grand jury
proceeding.
Because of stringent secrecy restrictions, it is impossible to evaluate the scope
and impact on privacy rights of the FBI’s expanded surveillance instituted in the
aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attack. The Des Moines grand jury proceeding is
tantalizingly suggestive, and the targets of FBI surveillance knowable because of
a decision to convene a grand jury investigation. Left unresolved is the question
whether this instance of FBI surveillance of student and peace activists was atyp-
ical and whether, rather than attempting to prosecute dissidents, covert dissemi-
nation activities were undertaken as had been done during the Cold War.

Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999

Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999
On May 6, 1999, the United States Congress effectively repealed the Glass-
Steagall Act of 1933 by enacting the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act). Thus,
the barriers set up by the Glass-Steagall Act between commercial and investment
banking companies were removed to pave the way for increased competitiveness
and efficiency in the financial marketplace. For this reason, the GLB Act is often
referred to as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, as it recognizes
the changes occurring in the financial services industry since the Great Depression.
The three privacy components of this legislation are known as the Financial Privacy
Rule, the Safeguards Rule, and the pretexting provisions.
The Financial Privacy Rule prevents the disclosure of collected nonpublic
financial information to third-party companies without consent from the customer.
The law states that all financial institutions must disclose their policy related to the
sharing of private personal information and allows customers the option to prevent
this information sharing in certain situations. In addition, customers must receive a
copy of this policy statement no less than once every 12 months from their finan-
cial institution. In addition to the federal agencies assigned with enforcing these
privacy requirements, state governments have been empowered to oversee financial
service activities. 
The Safeguards Rule states that financial institutions must create, implement, and
sustain controls to keep their customer information secure. The Safeguards Rule
applies to all customer financial information regardless of its source. This is applica-
ble to financial institutions collecting and maintaining information on their own cus-
tomers as well as other companies that use this information. Credit bureaus are
required to maintain the same preventive safety measures concerning information
pertaining to an individual’s finances as apply to primary financial institutions.
Under Section 304 of the GLB Act, pretexting provisions protect customers of
the financial institution from other individuals and entities that procure information
pertaining to their personal finances using deceptive practices. If an individual is
pretexting, he or she is providing fraudulent information in an attempt to acquire
another individual’s private financial data. Soliciting a third party to engage in pre-
texting is also illegal. Companies engaging in pretexting and selling this confiden-
tial information are subject to legal action under this legislation. Additionally, the
victim may sue the pretexting individual or company in civil court for monetary
damages.
The passage of this legislation poses some privacy issues to consumers by
allowing the same holding companies to engage in a wide array of financial activi-
ties. Some examples of this broad scope include insurance underwriting, commer-
cial banking and lending products, credit counseling, tax preparation, and
investment products and advice as allowed after review by the Federal Reserve
Board. If the holding company is deemed to be well managed and stable, the Fed-
eral Reserve Board may grant these extended services to holding companies of
financial institutions. 
This is just one of many bills that have been passed in recent years in an effort to
help protect people from identity theft and unwanted usage of their personal infor-
mation. This legislation enables federal and local agencies to penalize those misusing

Fingerprints and fingerprinting
Fingerprinting is the world’s most widely used, and certainly one of its most
trusted, biometric identifiers. Biometric identifiers use bodily attributes to link
human bodies to archival records maintained by some organization, usually an
agent of the state.
Fingerprints are representations of “friction ridge skin,” a corrugated type of
skin that covers the fingers, palms, and soles. This skin falls into general pattern
types. The most common pattern types are called arches, loops, and whorls. The
general patterns may be divided into varying numbers of subpatterns. Further vari-
ation may be found in the abrupt ending and bifurcation of ridges at seemingly ran-
dom intervals.
It is widely assumed that each individual finger has a unique pattern of friction
ridge skin. It has also been shown that the general topography of the friction ridge
skin remains persistent throughout an individual’s lifetime. An image of friction
ridge skin can be created using ink or a computer scanning device in order to store
a record of the individual’s friction ridge skin for retrieval at a later date. Since the
record is based on a purportedly nonrepeating, persistent, and difficult-to-alter
bodily attribute, such records are considered less vulnerable to fraud or deceit than
records based on such information as name or an identification number. Such a
record-keeping system has numerous potential uses in governance and other areas.
Fingerprints have been used since ancient times in China, India, Japan, and else-
where as signs or seals on documents. Not until the nineteenth century were finger
prints adapted for bureaucratic record keeping. The initial developments in using
fingerprints for record keeping took place primarily in India. Fingerprints were first
used as signatures on contracts and for pensioner identification. Single prints were
also used to identify opium cultivators, emigrants, and government workers. Using
sets of ten prints for criminal records soon followed.
In order for states to use fingerprints for bureaucratic record keeping, it was nec-
essary to devise a system of indexing records according to fingerprint patterns.
Only with such a system could fingerprinting be used to correctly identify an indi-
vidual employing an alias or using fraudulent documents. After initial researches
by Henry Faulds and Francis Galton, working classification systems were devised
almost simultaneously in 1894–1895 by Edward Henry, a British colonial official
stationed in India, and Juan Vucetich, a police official in La Plata, Argentina.

Fingerprints and fingerprinting
›
231
There are three primary uses of finger prints. Deliberately recorded fingerprints
may be used for verification. In such applications, the user claims a certain identity,
and then the person’s fingerprints are checked against a fingerprint record in order
to verify that the person is who he or she claims to be. Such a use is common in
banking and security, and for control of state disbursements. Deliberately recorded
fingerprints may also be used for archival purposes. In such uses, an individual’s
fingerprints are checked against a database of fingerprint records indexed accord-
ing to fingerprint pattern type. The archivist may then be able to determine whether
the individual has a record in the database even if the individual gives false infor-
mation. The most common such use is for criminal record keeping. Accidentally
left fingerprints may also be used for forensic purposes. A fingerprint left at the
scene of crime may be checked against a database or the prints of a group of sus-
pects in order to associate an individual with a crime. This last use has fewer pri-
vacy implications.
The inclusion of citizens’ bodily information in a government database raises a
number of privacy issues. The creation of criminal records based on fingerprints
has generated little opposition since convicted criminals were thought to be entitled
to reduced privacy rights. U.S. law has been divided on whether the retention of
fingerprint records of individuals who were arrested but not convicted (or of those
convicted for juvenile offenses) constitutes an invasion of privacy that outweighs
the state’s issue in retaining such records. The predominant, though by no means
universal, view is that retention is permissible. Arguments that fingerprint records
violate the Fifth Amendment ban against self-incrimination also have not been suc-
cessful. In fact, John Wigmore, a leading U.S. evidence scholar, has concluded that
a person’s fingerprint “is not testimony about his body, but his body itself.” 
Critics of DNA databanks today tend to cite “genetic exceptionalism” to argue,
incorrectly, that fingerprints, unlike DNA, contains only identifying information,
not information about race, gender, disease, or behavioral propensities. In fact,
weak correlations have been found between each of these characteristics and fin-
gerprint pattern types, but the correlations have not been strong enough to support
any sort of action. The popular conception of fingerprints as being devoid of any-
thing other then individualizing information has made fingerprinting immune to the
sorts of privacy criticisms that have been based on the presence of hereditary, med-
ical, and behavioral information contained in DNA.
Fingerprint databases had potential utility in many more areas than criminal
identification. Early enthusiasts named banking, disaster victim identification,
immigration, entitlement control, and protection against kidnapping or amnesia as
areas of utility, and even promoted “universal identification.” Fingerprints, how-
ever, rapidly acquired a “criminal stigma” that damped public enthusiasm for such
uses. Among the most enthusiastic proponents of universal identification were
Vucetich and his protégé Luis Reyna Almandos. After some initial progress,
Argentines rebelled against the idea of universal identification, and Vucetich’s rep-
utation as a national hero was damaged by his efforts.
In the United States, government bureaucrats did succeed in creating fingerprint
databases for immigrants, armed services personnel, civil servants, and schoolteach-
ers. During the 1930s, police and government groups pushed universal identification.

232
Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429 (1991)
\
But American citizens rejected the idea of universal identification, and three bills
containing the idea failed to pass Congress between 1935 and 1943.
The idea of universal citizen fingerprint identification has not seriously been
considered since that time. However, the U.S. government has continued to collect
noncriminal fingerprints by exploiting the fingerprinting of the special categories
discussed above. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), whose finger-
print repository constitutes the largest biometric database in the world, recently
announced that its civilian fingerprint file had surpassed its criminal file in size.
Each file contains over 40 million records, and approximately 7000 records are
added each day.
The digital storage of fingerprint records and recent developments in automated
fingerprint search and retrieval software has greatly enhanced the potential utility
of fingerprint databases for a multitude of purposes. Biometric identification is
increasingly being proposed as a security solution in the post-9/11 world. For
example, many states now record fingerprints in conjunction with issuing drivers’
licenses, and some credit card companies and banks offer to encode fingerprints
on cards as a security measure. Cheap fingerprint scanners that can authenticate
identity are now used to control access to homes, automobiles, secure areas, and
personal computers. Given these developments, collecting, storing, and using fin-
gerprints will continue to raise privacy issues for a long time to come.

Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429 (1991)
In an effort to curb drug trafficking in Broward County, Florida, Sheriff’s
Department officers routinely and regularly boarded buses at scheduled stops to
question passengers and seek their permission to search their luggage. Programs
such as the one in Broward County have been implemented across the United
States by various law enforcement agencies, and have led to the use of surveillance
at bus stations, train depots, and airports. Law enforcement officers, stationed at
these various locations, routinely approach individuals at random or because they
vaguely suspect criminal activity or the presence of illegal drugs. 

Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429 (1991)
›
233
In this case, Terrance Bostick purchased a bus ticket from Miami to Atlanta. At
a stop in Fort Lauderdale, two officers from the Sheriff’s Department boarded the
bus wearing jackets with insignias and badges, and one carried a zippered pouch
easily recognizable as containing a pistol. The officers approached Bostick and,
after matching his identification with his ticket, explained their presence as narcot-
ics officers in search of illegal substances. After advising Bostick of his right to
refuse, they sought permission to search his luggage. He gave his permission. The
officers discovered cocaine in his second bag and placed him under arrest for drug
trafficking. 
At his trial, Bostick made a motion to suppress the cocaine on the grounds that it
had been seized in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The motion was
denied, and the Florida Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. The Florida
Supreme Court, on certification, adopted a per se rule that the Sheriff’s Department
practice of bus checking was unconstitutional since a reasonable passenger would
not have felt free to leave to avoid questioning. The United States Supreme Court
granted certiorari to determine whether Florida’s per se rule was consistent with
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. 
The issue before the Supreme Court was whether a police encounter on a bus like
the one in Bostick constituted an illegal search and seizure. In Justice O’Connor’s
opinion, she asserted the state conceded that the officers lacked the reasonable sus-
picion required to justify a seizure, and that if a seizure did in fact take place, the
drugs must be suppressed as tainted fruit, pursuant to the fruits of the poisonous
tree doctrine. 
In the Court’s analysis, O’Connor sets forth that a seizure does not occur simply
because a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few questions, because
it is consensual in nature and the individual is not being confined or detained. Citing
a string of cases such as Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), California v. Hodari D.,
and Florida v. Boyner, O’Connor pointed out that the Court has consistently held
that mere questioning does not trigger Fourth Amendment scrutiny unless it loses
its consensual nature, and that law enforcement officers do not violate Fourth
Amendment rights by merely approaching an individual on the street or in another
public place, or by asking the individual if he or she is willing to answer some
questions and then putting questions to the individual if the person is willing to lis-
ten. In the eyes of the Court, Bostick’s encounter was no different than if he had
been approached in the terminal or on a public sidewalk, and thus the fact that it
occurred in the cramped confines of a bus made no difference. 
In his argument to the Court, Bostick stated that a reasonable bus passenger
would not have felt free to leave under the circumstances of this case because there
was nowhere to go on the bus, especially since the officers towered over the seats
and there was little or no room to move about. The Court disregarded Bostick’s
argument, stating that the confinement of the bus was a natural product of Bostick’s
decision to take a common carrier, and not the result of police conduct. Thus, his
freedom of movement was restricted by a factor independent of police actions.
Bostick was completely within his rights to disembark the bus and simply refuse to
answer the officers’ questions, even though it would have required more effort than
walking past or ignoring an approaching officer. Given such reasoning, the Court

234
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA)
\
remanded the decision back to the Florida Supreme Court to determine the seizure
question under the correct legal standard.
In the dissent’s opinion, Justice Marshall agreed with the framing of the ques-
tion to determine whether or not a seizure has taken place, but he disagreed with
the majority’s affirmative response. Marshall suggested that sitting on a bus and
attempting to disregard a police inquiry is not the same as being stopped on the
street. Had Bostick disembarked from the bus, it would have caused him either an
economic loss—his luggage or the money used to purchase the ticket—or the
inconvenience of having to obtain new transportation, or both. 
Finally, the dissent argued that just because a person enters a room with only
one exit does not give the police the right to enter the room and block the only exit.
Nor is it permissible for an officer to exploit a person based on his or her decision
to expose himself or herself to public or personal constraints. By consciously sin-
gling out persons who undertake interstate or intrastate travel, officers who conduct
suspicionless, dragnet-style sweeps put passengers in the situation of having to
choose between cooperating with an inquiry or exiting the bus. It is because of this
forced choice that the dissent held the opinion that the conduct of the officers in the
case of Bostick violated the Fourth Amendment.

Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA)
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), 18 U.S.C. 1801–1871,
established a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to decide government
applications to conduct electronic surveillance in the United States against foreign
powers or their agents. “Agents” include persons engaged in international terror-
ism. The FISC’s approval authority has since been extended to cover surreptitious
physical searches (“black bag jobs”), pen registers (capturing outgoing noncontent
dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling telephone information), trap-and-trace
devices (capturing noncontent incoming electronic impulses that identify the origi-
nating number), and compelled disclosure of “tangible records” by record holders
such as telephone companies, banks, travel agencies, and libraries. The FISC is
comprised of sitting federal judges who meet secretly at the Department of Justice.
FISA targets are unrepresented in its proceedings.

Freedom of association
›
235
FISA was enacted after the Supreme Court suggested that Congress constitution-
ally may enact lower standards for collecting foreign intelligence than for collecting
criminal evidence. Congress authorized the FISC to approve electronic surveillance
on a finding of probable cause to believe that the target was a foreign power or agent,
and that the location of the surveillance was used by that power or agent. This stan-
dard is less exacting than the traditional finding of probable cause to believe that evi-
dence of a crime will be found. The government must also certify, inter alia, that “a
significant purpose” of the surveillance is obtaining foreign intelligence, and the gov-
ernment must state that it will follow procedures to “minimize” the acquisition and
retention of information and limit the dissemination of nonpublicly available infor-
mation about U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens (“United States persons”). 
The FISC may approve pen registers, trap-and-trace devices, and compulsory
disclosure of tangible records following an even lower standard. The government
must only certify to the FISC that the information is relevant to an investigation to
obtain foreign intelligence that does not concern a United States person, or relevant
for an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelli-
gence activities. This “mere relevancy” standard reflects Supreme Court decisions
suggesting that people waive privacy protections of information they voluntarily
convey to third parties such as telephone companies or banks. 
No United States person may be considered a foreign power or agent, nor may
the government investigate such a person, solely on the basis of First Amendment
activities. On the other hand, FISA lets the government collect transactional infor-
mation about even innocent U.S. citizens who are not foreign agents as long as the
government asserts that the information is for a terrorism investigation.
Critics assert that FISA is a sham, emphasizing that through 2004 the FISC
denied only 4 of 18,732 applications, and that the “mere relevancy” standard is
toothless. FISA defenders respond that any prior judicial approval is better than
none, and that the mere prospect of judicial decision disciplines the executive deci-
sionmaking process.

Freedom of association
Associations require privacy from government intrusion. If the government pre-
vents people from associating or tells them how and for what reasons they can act
together as a group, associations cannot thrive. Associational freedom is especially
important for unpopular or minority groups. 

236
Freedom of association
\
Freedom of association is not among the specific protections of the Constitu-
tion of the United States. However, the Supreme Court has recognized a right of
association under the First Amendment. In early cases involving freedom of
association, the Supreme Court found that government interference with mem-
bership in associations undermined the ability of people to engage in political
advocacy. In more recent years, groups have asserted freedom of association as a
defense against the application of laws prohibiting them from discriminating in
their selection of members. While the Supreme Court has rejected claims that
associations have a right to refuse to admit women as members, the Court has
upheld the right of the Boy Scouts of America to discharge a gay Eagle Scout. In
addition to the First Amendment protection for freedom of association, the
Supreme Court has recognized that the Constitution also protects intimate associ-
ations, especially families.
Among the protections of the First Amendment are the freedom of speech and
the right to assemble. The Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment to
include also the freedom of expressive association: the right to associate for the
advancement of beliefs and ideals. On this understanding, associations are consti-
tutionally protected because they empower citizens to exert political influence and
to keep government in check.
In the 1958 case of NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 44 (1958), the first case
clearly recognizing this constitutional freedom, the Supreme Court held that
requiring the NAACP to divulge its membership list to the government violated the
members’ associational rights. If the government was entitled to know the identi-
ties of the members, people would be less willing to participate, and the organiza-
tion would be less able to engage in political advocacy. Nonetheless, three years
after the NAACP case, the Supreme Court in Communist Party of the United States v.
Subversive Activities Control Board (1961) upheld a federal order requiring the
Communist Party to disclose its membership list. 
In a series of subsequent cases, the Court followed the rationale of the NAACP
case and recognized several ways in which government action unduly burdens the
freedom of association. One way is by imposing burdens on specific kinds of associ-
ations. In Healey v. James (1972), the Court ruled that the Central Connecticut State
College could not deny recognition and the use of campus facilities to a local chap-
ter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The Court found that withholding
these privileges from one specific kind of organization without sufficient justifica-
tion abridged the students’ First Amendment rights to freedom of association. 
Government action might also infringe associational freedom by imposing bur-
dens on individuals because of their associational ties—thereby making membership
more difficult. In Shelton v. Tucker (1960), the Supreme Court held unconstitutional
an Arkansas statute that required teachers employed in a state-supported school or
college to file an annual affidavit listing every organization to which a teacher had
belonged or had contributed during the preceding five years. While the Court recog-
nized that public schools have a legitimate interest in screening their teachers, the
broad disclosure requirement unduly impaired the teachers’ freedom of association
because it required revealing membership in associations that did not bear on a
teacher’s fitness to teach.

A different way in which the government might infringe on associational free-
dom is by requiring membership in an association in order to receive a governmen-
tal benefit. Not all such schemes are impermissible. For instance, the Supreme
Court has held that the government can legitimately restrict licenses to practice law to
lawyers who join a professional bar association, although where an individual’s polit-
ical interests are implicated, the government has less power to compel membership in
an organization. However, the Court has been less willing to sanction compelled
membership that implicates political interests. In Elrod v. Burns (1976) the Court
held unconstitutional the actions of a sheriff who discharged a series of public
employees, including low-level security officers, because they were not Democrats.
While the Court recognized that some kinds of government employment involving
policymaking could legitimately require party loyalty, broader dismissals of this
kind undermined associational freedom. Similarly in Branti v. Finkel (1980) the
Court found unconstitutional the actions of a county public defender in discharging
assistant public defenders because they were Republicans. Party affiliation had no
legitimate bearing on serving as an assistant public defender, and so the govern-
ment could not penalize Republicans by terminating their employment. 
Freedom of association has arisen in cases involving unions. In early cases,
courts viewed associations among co-workers as unlawful conspiracies. However,
since the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, federal statutory
law has safeguarded the rights of employees to associate in unions and to engage in
collective bargaining with their employers. Employees can be required, pursuant to
union-shop provisions, to join a union as a condition of employment, to finance
activities of the union, and to be bound by agreements the union reaches with an
employer. The Supreme Court has upheld these aspects of federal law while recog-
nizing they implicate First Amendment interests.
Employees cannot, however, be forced to support a union’s political speech. In
the case of Abood v. Detroit Board of Education (1977), the Court held that non-
union teachers in a public school could not be required, under an agency-shop pro-
vision of a collective bargain agreement between the union and the employer
school board, to finance the expressive activities of the union. The union was only
entitled to collect funds for advocacy from members who were willing to contrib-
ute, and noncontributing members could not be threatened with the loss of their
jobs. A similar principle applies to bar associations. In Keller v. State Bar of Cali-
fornia (1990), the Court held that although a bar association may use collected
dues to fund activities germane to regulating the legal profession and improving the
quality of legal services, where bar membership is required to practice law, the
association may not use dues to fund more ideological activities. Bar members can-
not be required, for example, to finance literature on the bar association’s position
on gun control laws. 
Freedom of association has also arisen in cases involving political parties. In a
series of cases addressing the procedures for selecting party delegates, the Supreme
Court has underscored the associational rights of political parties and their mem-
bers. In Kusper v. Pontikes (1973) the Supreme Court stated that the right to associ-
ate with the political party of one’s choice is a basic constitutional freedom, and it
struck down an Illinois statute prohibiting a voter from voting in the primary of one
party within twenty-three months of voting in another party’s primary. In Cousins

238
Freedom of association
\
v. Wigoda (1975) the Court held that a state court injunction prohibiting a rival set
of delegates from attending the 1972 Democratic National Convention violated the
associational freedom of the enjoined delegates and of the National Democratic
Party. In several subsequent cases, the Court invalidated on freedom of association
grounds, legislative interference with the selection of convention delegates. The
Supreme Court has also invoked associational freedom in invalidating governmen-
tal impediments to the formation of new political parties. 
Political parties have at times sought the right to exclude individuals who apply
to join, raising the issue of the extent of a party’s freedom to choose its members.
In a series of cases beginning in 1927, the Supreme Court invalidated efforts by the
Texas Democratic Party to exclude African Americans from voting in the state
Democratic primary elections. However, in these so-called White Primary Cases,
the Court viewed the party’s regulation of the primary as so closely tied to the gen-
eral election process that it was governmental action rather than private associa-
tional activity. The Court therefore avoided determining whether the associational
freedom of political parties extends to race-based discrimination in membership or
other kinds of limitations on who may join.
An association’s freedom to select its members free from government interfer-
ence was central to two cases in the 1980s involving the ability of the Jaycees and
Rotary to deny membership to women. In Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984),
the all-male Jaycees asserted that the application of the Minnesota statute prohibit-
ing sex discrimination violated the organization’s freedom of association. The
Supreme Court disagreed and held that Minnesota could require the Jaycees to
admit women as full members of the organization. The Court recognized that the
Jaycees had a right of expressive association and that the organization engaged in
expressive activities because it took public positions on issues and engaged in
civic, charitable, lobbying, fundraising, and other activities worthy of constitu-
tional protection under the First Amendment. In addition, the Court recognized that
forcing a group to accept members it does not desire is an intrusion on the group
and may impair the ability of the original members to express only those views that
brought them together. Freedom of association, the Court said, presupposes a free-
dom not to associate. Nonetheless, the Court held, requiring the Jaycees to admit
women did not unduly burden its associational freedom because the presence of
women would not alter any message the Jaycees sought to communicate. The Jay-
cees could refuse members who did not share the organization’s views. But the
organization could not simply assume that women held contrary views and thereby
exclude them wholesale from membership. There was no evidence that application
of the anti-discrimination law would alter the Jaycees’ expression, and to conclude
otherwise required reliance on impermissible assumptions about the opinions of
women. In a subsequent case, Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary
Club of Duarte (1987), the Supreme Court applied the same analysis and held that
Rotary had no First Amendment right to exclude women in violation of the Califor-
nia Unruh Act. The Court concluded that the Act did not violate Rotary’s First
Amendment interests because there was nothing about the inclusion of women that
would affect the organization’s expression.
The Court’s more recent decision in Boy Scouts of American v. Dale (2000) is
difficult to reconcile with these two cases. James Dale, an Eagle Scout, had been

Freedom of association
›
239
expelled as a member of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and as assistant scout-
master of Monmouth Council, New Jersey, because he was gay. Monmouth Coun-
cil officials learned of Dale’s sexual orientation when they read in a newspaper
about his role as co-president of the Rutgers University Lesbian/Gay Alliance.
Dale claimed that in dismissing him, the BSA had violated a New Jersey law pro-
hibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The United States
Supreme Court held that the application of the New Jersey statute to the BSA
would violate its right of expressive association. The Court viewed the Boy Scouts
as an expressive association: it instills values in its members and promotes its
views in the broader community. Deferring to the BSA’s assertion that its message
included a disapproval of homosexuality—even though that message was not the
organization’s central purpose and some Scouts disagreed with the official posi-
tion—the Court found that Dale’s presence as an assistant scoutmaster would
unduly burden the organization’s expression. The BSA would be seen as approving
of homosexuality if it was forced to allow gay leaders. The government, therefore,
could not require the organization to abide by the nondiscrimination law. Some
commentators view the Court’s decision to extend associational freedom beyond its
origin as a political right. 
After the Dale case, to claim a right of expressive association, an organization
must engage in some form of public or private expression. An organization does
not have to associate for the purpose of disseminating a certain message in order to
be entitled to First Amendment protection. The organization must merely engage in
expressive activity that could be impaired. The First Amendment prohibits applica-
tion of an anti-discrimination statute to compel an association to admit an individ-
ual as a member if the presence of that individual would significantly affect the
association’s ability to advocate its public or private viewpoints. In making that
determination, deference is given to the association as to the nature of its expres-
sion and as to what would impair that expression. In addition to government regu-
lations compelling an association to admit members, associational freedom might
be infringed by government action imposing other kinds of burdens on associations
or their members. 
In the fall of 2005, the Supreme Court was called on to apply these standards to
determine whether the faculty members of private law schools have an associa-
tional right to exclude from campus military recruiters who, in accordance with the
governmental ban on openly gay individuals serving in the military, refuse to abide
by the schools’ policies of non-discrimination. A decision in that case is expected
in 2006. 
In addition to the First Amendment freedom of expressive association, the
Supreme Court has recognized that there exists a constitutionally protected free-
dom of intimate association. The Constitution safeguards a zone of privacy, the
Court has reasoned, in which highly personal relationships are protected from gov-
ernment intrusion. This is because personal bonds cultivate and transmit shared
ideals and beliefs and provide a buffer between individuals and the power of the
state, and because individuals derive emotional enrichment from close ties with
others. Protecting intimate relationships from unwarranted state interference there-
fore safeguards people’s ability to develop their identities and is an important com-
ponent of liberty.

240
Freedom of Information Act
\
Freedom of intimate association is, however, quite narrow. The Supreme Court
has found that marriage, parent-child, and similar familial relationships merit pro-
tection. The Court has also at times suggested that some small-scale, selective, and
highly personal groups other than families might be sufficiently intimate to deserve
constitutional protection. However, the Court has never specifically recognized a
right of intimate association as belonging to any group or organization beyond the
family setting.

Freedom of Information Act
The Freedom of Information Act is a federal law that gives any person the right
to obtain public records from United States government agencies. The law’s under-
lying rationale is that democracy works most effectively when the public has as
much information as possible about the government, provided that disclosure will
not harm the nation or individuals. In the forty years since the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act’s passage, the law has helped reveal fraud, waste, and corruption in the
federal government. Coupled with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act gives people the right to obtain agency records about themselves and
the inner workings of the government. Citizens submitted 3,266,394 Freedom of
Information and Privacy Act requests in fiscal year 2003 alone, more than in any
previous year. 
President Lyndon Johnson reluctantly signed the Freedom of Information Act
into law in 1966, noting his concern that the public’s right to know could affect
national security and privacy interests. Nearly a decade later, Congress overrode a
presidential veto to bolster the law in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Presi-
dent Nixon’s resignation. Changes to the law in 1974 significantly improved the
public’s ability to obtain information from the government. The Freedom of Infor-
mation Act was amended again in 1986, when Congress exempted some Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) records from the law’s provisions, and in 1996, when it
was modified to include electronic records.The Freedom of Information Act cre-
ates a right of access to records maintained by administrative agencies, federal cor-
porations, and other entities that perform work on behalf of the federal
government. The law does not apply to records of the president, Congress, courts,
private companies, or individuals. It also does not reach records held by state or
local governments, although many of these entities have enacted their own open-
government laws. More than fifty countries around the globe have enacted similar
government transparency laws. The world’s oldest freedom of information law was
enacted by Sweden in 1766.
The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to make information
available to the public in three ways. First, each agency must publish information

Freedom of Information Act
›
241
about itself, as well as inform the public about how it can obtain information, make
submissions or requests, or obtain agency decisions. 
Second, the Freedom of Information Act requires that agencies make certain
kinds of agency documents and records automatically available to the public. Cate-
gories of information covered by this requirement include certain statements of
policy, interpretations, and administrative and staff manuals, as well as copies of
records released to requesters that are likely to be requested by others. Each agency
must make this information available in electronic form and hard copy. Most agen-
cies meet this requirement by posting material on the Internet and maintaining it
in reading rooms open to the public.
Third, agencies must disclose records in response to requests from the public.
The law presumes that all material must be given to the public unless it is specifi-
cally exempted from disclosure. Records may be withheld from the public when
they are (1) classified national defense or foreign policy information, (2) related
only to an agency’s internal rules and practices, (3) specifically exempted from dis-
closure by another law, (4) confidential business information such as trade secrets,
and commercial or financial information, (5) interagency or intra-agency records
that would be privileged in a lawsuit, (6) personal information that would invade a
person’s privacy if disclosed, (7) law enforcement records, (8) information used by
an agency to regulate or oversee financial institutions, and (9) oil well data. These
exemptions are to be construed by an agency as narrowly as possible.
Once an agency receives a Freedom of Information Act request, it must inform
the requester within 20 working days whether or not it will release the requested
information, and if not, the reasons why. A requester who receives a negative deter-
mination may file an appeal to ask the agency to reconsider. The agency must
respond to the appeal within 20 working days. If dissatisfied with the result, the
requester may file a lawsuit in federal court to enforce his or her rights. 
An agency may make arrangements to process requests according to the amount
of time or effort such requests will involve. For example, while an agency might
typically process requests on a “first in, first out” basis, it might address a request
for a specific record more quickly than a request for hundreds of records. Further-
more, if a requester can demonstrate a “compelling need” for agency records, the
agency will give the request special priority and process it “as soon as practicable.” 
An agency may charge reasonable fees for the work involved in processing a
Freedom of Information Act request. A requester who seeks documents for com-
mercial use may be charged for the time and resources an agency spends searching
for records, duplicating them, and reviewing them for information that should be
withheld. An agency may only charge a fee for duplication costs when the request
is from the news media or an institution whose purpose is scholarly or scientific
research, and the request is not made for a commercial purpose. A noncommercial
request from anyone else is subject to reasonable search and duplication fees. An
agency may entirely or partially waive duplication fees if the requester shows that
release of the records is in the public interest. 
The Freedom of Information Act has interesting implications for personal pri-
vacy. While the goal of the law is government transparency, records sometimes
contain intimate details about government employees and private citizens. Often it
is clear that such information should be shielded from the public to protect an

242
Freedom of Information Act
\
individual’s privacy. In other situations, however, an individual’s personal informa-
tion can actually contribute to the public’s understanding of government opera-
tions. In these cases, it is less obvious whether the information should be made
public or withheld in the interest of privacy. 
The Freedom of Information Act provides two distinct exemptions for personal
information. The law shields personal information in government records when
disclosure “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
The law also provides a specific exemption for personal information in law
enforcement records when disclosure “could reasonably be expected to constitute
an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Because association with a law
enforcement activity can cause embarrassment and stigma, a person’s privacy inter-
est in the personal information contained in these records is typically more compel-
ling than the interest in the personal information included in more routine
government records. In fact, the Supreme Court has found that this privacy interest
is so substantial that it may be claimed by close family members after a person’s
death.
Regardless of the type of government record that contains personal information,
personal details will be released only if the public’s interest in disclosure outweighs
the individual’s privacy interest in the information. Agencies cannot use personal pri-
vacy as a basis to withhold information individuals have requested about themselves.

G
Garbage
Renowned archaeologist Emil Haury proclaimed, “If you want to know what is
really going on in a community, look at its garbage.” Garbage offers a peek into the
private lives of people and a glimpse of activities occurring behind the walls of a
building. Garbage bins contain a wealth of items like food, clothing, and appli-
ances; however, garbage is also a source of information providing insight into more
personal matters through mail, memos, identifications, passwords, and credit card
data. Supreme Court Justice White eloquently described garbage as revealing the
“tell-tale items on the road map of life in the previous week.”
Most people never consider that the sensitive items they toss in the trash will be
recovered. They should. There is no recognizable expectation of privacy in dis-
carded materials left for collection. Trash reveals the intimacies of individuals’
lives, including eating, health, hygiene, political and sexual practices, financial
dealings, personal relationships, reading, and recreational habits.
Although the most common item found in landfills is paper, there is no limit to
the wealth of items and information set aside as trash. In fact, the culling through
garbage is so pervasive as a means of collecting information that it has been given
the scientific-sounding slang name of “garbology.” The actual practice of rummag-
ing through commercial or residential trash to find useful discarded items or to
extract confidential data and security-compromising information is called “dump-
ster diving.” Trash so defines a society and so exposes human activity that it is no
wonder that trash is regularly studied and examined by anthropologists to learn
about human behavior, by law enforcement to expose criminal behavior, and by
reporters, thieves, and spies to gather confidential tidbits, steal identities and
acquire trade secrets, respectively.
The extent to which the information and items referred to as garbage are pro-
tected from intrusive study and examination is a matter addressed by both the
judicial and legislative branches. Until 1967, constitutional protections regard-
ing privacy under the Fourth Amendment focused on arcane concepts of property
and possessory interests in certain places: persons (their bodies and clothing),
homes (apartments, motel rooms, businesses, barns), papers (documents, letters),
and effects (cars, packages, luggage). The Supreme Court decision in the case
\
\

244
Garbage
\
Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967) dramatically altered that principle by
holding that the “Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person
knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject
of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even
in an area accessible to the public may be constitutionally protected” (Katz
(1967), 361). A person’s entitlement to protection was not absolute or unlimited.
Protection required both an actual, subjective expectation of privacy, and an
objective, reasonable expectation of privacy that society as a whole would be
willing to accept.
In California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35 (1988), Justice White addressed this
entitlement to privacy protection as it applies to garbage utilizing Katz’s two-prong
test. White concluded that although individuals may have a subjective expectation
of privacy in their garbage, it was not an objectively reasonable expectation of pri-
vacy that society was prepared to recognize. In other words, society is not about to
manifest a constitutional protection of privacy to discarded trash. White provided
three reasons for his conclusion: (1) It is common knowledge that plastic garbage
bags left on a public street for collection are readily accessible to animals, children,
scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public. (2) The items are placed
there for the express purpose of conveying the bags to a third party, the trash collec-
tor, who might sort through them or permit others, such as the police, to do so.
Finally (3) it is not reasonable to expect the police to avert their eyes from evidence
of criminal activity that other members of the public may observe.
This decision to afford no constitutionally protected privacy interest in the con-
tent of trash left at the curb for garbage collectors was consistent with other recent
Supreme Court holdings concerning the exposure of activities to third parties or
items visible to the public. For example, there is no expectation of privacy in tele-
phone numbers conveyed to a telephone company, to financial documents con-
veyed through a bank, or to activities in a backyard that are exposed to persons in
aircrafts.
Justice White’s decision was firmly premised on the belief that society does not
recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding trash left for collection in
an area accessible to the public. His decision was not predicated, as commonly
believed, on the doctrine of abandonment. Abandoned property is not subject to
Fourth Amendment protection because that protection only extends to places and
items for which a person has a subjectively reasonable expectation of privacy, and
no person can have a subjectively reasonable expectation of privacy about an item
that has been abandoned. In fact, according to the rationale in Greenwood, a per-
son’s subjective expectation of privacy is irrelevant to the holding concerning gar-
bage and the right to privacy.
This distinction between the abandonment approach and the reasonable expec-
tation of privacy approach is crucial. Many people, including Justice Brennan in
his fervent dissent in Greenwood, subjectively believe that “the aspects of their
private lives that are concealed safely in a trash bag will not become public”
(Greenwood (1988), 46.) To that end, many like Greenwood are careful to con-
ceal their trash even from the trash collector by using opaque, sealed bags. Others
go to the extent of shredding their documents, burning their refuse, or co-mingling
their waste with others. Still others, primarily business enterprises, in an effort to

Garbage

245
prevent industrial espionage, provide physical security barriers like razor ribbon
fences, security guards and dogs, and locks on their garbage containers. Individu-
als and businesses going to such lengths are hoping to limit access to the trash.
All of these extra security and concealment practices, while effectively increas-
ing one’s subjectively reasonable expectation of privacy in one’s garbage, do
nothing to afford privacy protection in the content of the garbage. In the end,
society will not objectively find a reasonable expectation of privacy in items left
for collection by others.
In fact, because of the theoretical distinction made by the Greenwood holding, a
person does not have the ability to protect his or her trash from intrusive examina-
tion. There is no distinction between private trash (trash that is meant to be kept
secret until destroyed) and public trash (trash that is abandoned to the public).
Once garbage is placed in the public domain, regardless of whether it is concealed
in opaque, secured bags, shredded into potentially undecipherable 5/32-inch
pieces, or placed in a locked storage receptacle, the garbage is still subjected to
public disclosure. Hence, there is no privacy protection preserved. The concept
may be illuminated by making the analogy between the disposing of trash and
other scenarios. Just as a person engaging in a private conversation in a public set-
ting or a home is subjected to the possibility that the conversation may be over-
heard by others if that person speaks too loudly, the disposing of trash in public
poses the risk that it may be rummaged through and deciphered once it is placed on
the curbside. In both situations, the expectation of privacy has been effectively
eliminated by the individual’s own action of speaking too loudly or placing the gar-
bage out for collection.
 The concept was exemplified in United States v. Scott, 486 U.S. 35 (1988).
Therein, the shredding of tax documents into tiny strips did not deter the police
from seizing the bits from the trash without a warrant, piecing the minute segments
together, and using the evidence against Scott at trial. The mere fact that a person
shredded the garbage before placing it outside of a home does not create a reason-
able heightened expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The garbage
was still discarded in an area particularly suited for public inspection and consump-
tion. At most, the shredding made it less likely that third parties would be able to
ascertain meaning from the documents. The Fourth Amendment does not afford
protection even when a third party expends the effort and expense to solve the jig-
saw puzzle created by shredding.
The Greenwood decision and its successors forewarned the industrial world
that trade secrets placed in the trash in a discernible form were not legally pro-
tected either. Although dumpster diving is believed to be the number one method
of business and personal espionage, the failure to take adequate precautions to
protect a trade secret from clandestine trash searches precludes recovery even
against one who may have used improper means to obtain it. Upon intentional,
inadvertent, or accidental disclosure, the information ceases to be a trade secret
and becomes public information. The fact that the information was disposed of in
a manner constituting evidence of a subjective desire or hope that the contents
would be unintelligible to competitive third parties does not change the fact that,
as a result of the company’s own actions, the trade secret was placed in the public
domain.

246
Garbage
\
A Pennsylvania manufacturing business learned this lesson the hard way when a
competitor business ordered its salesperson to steal all of the other company’s trash
set out for collection in order to acquire its trade secrets. In Frank W. Winne & Son,
Inc. v. Palmer, U.S. Dist. 11183 (1991), the result, both here and in the previously
cited situations, was a failed attempt at secrecy by reason of underestimating a
third party’s (police or industrial spies) resourcefulness. It was not an invasion of
constitutionally protected privacy. There is no constitutional protection from scru-
tiny as to information received from a failed attempt at secrecy. Simply stated, the
test for determining legitimacy of an expectation of privacy is not whether the indi-
vidual chooses to conceal private activity, but instead whether the government’s
intrusion infringes upon the personal and societal values protected by the Fourth
Amendment. To that end, the public exposure of the trash bested Greenwood’s,
Winne’s, and Scott’s actions.
Horrific stories concerning wastebasket recovery applications abound. In Green-
wood, the Court cited an incident in which a reporter seized the garbage bags of then
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and searched them to create a “newsworthy” and
embarrassing story. Dumpster diving is commonly practiced by competitors seeking
trade secret information and by watchdog groups hoping for information on organi-
zations they are investigating. Some companies, like Weird Stuff, Inc., tout them-
selves as being in the business of salvaging and reselling discarded software, which
they openly admit to obtaining by the practice of dumpster diving (Novell, Inc. v.
Weird Stuff, Inc., U.S. Dist. N.D. Cal. (1993)). The practice of raiding refuse makes
consumer privacy obsolete and identity theft an easy task. Companies even advertise
their dumpster-diving expertise in trade journals and on the Internet. They list their
skills as high-tech forms of corporate espionage and publish instruction manuals on
how to reconstruct shredded documents. 
Congress’s enactment of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C.
1831–1839, enacting P.L. 104–294 (1996) clearly reflects the national concern
with trade secret theft and corporate dumpster-diving practices. The implementa-
tion of hefty criminal sanctions for those convicted of economic espionage (15 years)
and the potential of a $10 million fine for corporations that sponsor such activity
highlight the abuse of clandestine trash searches further.
As the list of concerns mounts regarding the potential for exposure of private
information through garbage disposal, a number of solutions have been devised.
Effective June 1, 2005, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) promulgated a rule
requiring that whenever a business organization disposes of confidential personal
information about employees, applicants, customers, and so forth, the organization
must do so properly by taking reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized
access to or use of the information in connection with its disposal. Although the
new rule (16 C. F.R. 683.3(a)) does not obligate businesses to either maintain or
dispose of consumer or personal information in a certain time or in a specific man-
ner, it does require that if the material is disposed, it will be disposed properly with
privacy rights ensured. Of significant importance is the provision within the rule
requiring the removal and disposal of all personal information from computers
before the hard drives may be discarded or donated. 
Since the Greenwood decision declined to provide privacy protection for gar-
bage under the U.S. Constitution, several states and a village have provided their

Gender
›
247
own privacy protection for trash. For instance, the Village of Hamburg, New York,
has increased awareness of the public quality of trash by requiring residents to
stash curbside garbage in clear plastic bags so that officials may monitor those who
do not comply with recycling laws. The mandate was deemed constitutional
because it notified residents of their reduced right to privacy in garbage, and the
law bore a reasonable relationship to the public goal of ensuring compliance with-
out necessarily requiring physically ripping apart each bag to examine the contents.
New Jersey courts deemed that a person does have a reasonable expectation of
privacy in the garbage left at curbside because the New Jersey Constitution
requires only that an expectation of privacy be reasonable as established by general
social norms. Thus, since most people in New Jersey rarely expose the content of
the information in their trash to the public, that expectation of privacy is reason-
able. Likewise, in State v. Boland, 115 Wn. 2d 571 (1990), the Supreme Court of
Washington rejected the Greenwood approach. The state of Washington’s constitu-
tion explicitly protects a citizen’s private affairs, and since local ordinances govern
and regulate trash collection, the state’s citizens maintain a reasonable expectation
of privacy that their trash will be collected and culled only by sanitation workers.
Other states have established constitutional protections from trash searches. The
Vermont Constitution protects as private trash co-mingled with another’s resulting
from apartment-living status. However, in Washington, D.C., in the Danai v. Canal
Square Associates, 862 A.2d 395, DC (2004) decision, the court held otherwise.
The state of Hawaii recognizes a person’s expectation of privacy in trash placed in
an employer’s receptacle. Connecticut passed groundbreaking legislation in 1997
when it revised Connecticut’s trade secret law by designating dumpster diving as a
form of espionage and an improper means of obtaining trade secrets. Although the
law does not technically affect the public nature of garbage, it does afford trade
secret owners with some protection. All of these state decisions (with the exception
of Danai) suggest that a person’s privacy interest in garbage demands a greater pro-
tection than the federal provision dictates.

Gender
During the 1970s, when the women’s liberation movement peaked in the United
States, the slogan “the personal is political” became a popular feminist refrain. While
most feminists adopted this motto in order to stress that traditionally “private” matters
such as rape, domestic violence, and sexual harassment needed to be addressed on a

\
public level, it has been seen as a sign that feminists are, if not absolutely opposed,
then at least highly suspicious of the right to privacy. While some feminists, such as
Catherine Mackinnon, have denounced privacy as an inherently patriarchal value, an
examination of mainstream feminist positions going back to the nineteenth century
shows that women’s rights advocates have generally struggled not to eradicate the
boundaries between public and private, but to liberate women from their historical
confinement in the private domain. Above all, feminists have stressed that sexual
equality will not be achieved until there is general recognition of the role of gender in
defining both the general concept of privacy and the traditional divisions between the
public and private spheres.
In the United States, the women’s rights movement preceded the Civil War, but
it was not until the postwar period, after black men won the franchise and the word
“male” had been specifically applied to voters in the Fourteenth Amendment, that
the fight for women’s suffrage became a militant national campaign. Throughout
this era, however, the more women agitated for admission to public life, the more
they were told that nature had designed them to devote themselves to homemaking,
child-rearing, and other ostensibly sacred domestic duties. For example, when the
Supreme Court upheld an Illinois court’s rejection of Myra Bradwell’s application
to practice law in Bradwell v. Illinois, 83 U.S. 130 (1873), Justice Joseph P. Bradley,
writing for the majority, held that it would be a violation not merely of social con-
vention but of divine law if women tried to find fulfillment in the public sphere.
“The civil law, as well as nature herself, has always recognized a wide difference in
the respective spheres and destinies of man and woman,” Bradley famously
insisted, and “the constitution of the family organization, which is founded in the
divine ordinance, as well as in the nature of things, indicates the domestic sphere as
that which properly belongs to the domain and functions of womanhood.” 
In sanctifying women’s place within the private realm, Bradley fell into step
with the cult of domesticity that consumed nineteenth-century American society
and shaped popular perceptions of privacy well into the twentieth century.
Throughout this period, as modern methods of manufacture stoked the home-building,
household goods, and advertising industries, an obsession with the material and
moral ingredients required to make a happy home took hold of the country. Books,
pamphlets, magazines, newspapers, and almost every other conceivable publication
offered seemingly endless instruction on how to achieve domestic well-being. The
most common admonitions were directed at women, drumming in the message that
their first responsibility was to attend to the needs of their husbands and children, a
duty that could best be carried out within a clean, well-organized, smartly
equipped, and tastefully decorated private home. The cult of domesticity thus rein-
forced the doctrine of separate spheres by defining the home as the site of women’s
highest calling, and it also raised the value of privacy by popularizing the notion
that every family ought to occupy its own private refuge, a haven that, if it were
filled with the right consumer goods, would enable every family member to attain
the moral attributes appropriate to his or her gender-specific position in the world. 
The impact of the cult of domesticity is apparent in Louis Brandeis and Samuel
Warren’s essay, “The Right to Privacy,” which was published in the Harvard Law
Review in 1890 and went on to become one of the most influential and frequently
cited articles in American legal history. In constructing the first systematic case for

a legal right to privacy, Brandeis and Warren complained that devices such as the
telegraph and instantaneous photography had made it increasingly difficult for men
to shield themselves and their dependents from public exposure and shame. Conse-
quently, quoting Lord Coke’s dictum that “every man’s house is his castle,” the
authors maintained that the home, an evermore necessary refuge from industrial
civilization, would cease to serve its purpose unless the heads of families were pro-
vided with more effective means to safeguard the sanctity of their homes.
Among the various examples they used to illustrate why men required these new
protections, Brandeis and Warren singled out newspaper stories about sexual mis-
conduct and intimate relations as an especially virulent blight on modern con-
sciousness. In their view, the press needed to be prevented from circulating details
about sexual transgressions, not so much because these revelations shamed the
girls and women who were the usual victims, but more because such publicity dis-
honored the men who were supposed to protect them. To support this type of cen-
sorship, the authors pointed to legal fictions commonly used to address “intrusions
by seduction upon the honor of the family,” that is, cases of statutory rape or child
molestation, which enabled fathers to collect damages against guilty parties with-
out actually specifying the nature of the violation. Such legal devices conformed to
social propriety, Brandeis and Warren maintained, because they allowed men to
avenge outrages to their honor and reputation, but did not require further disclosure
of ostensibly unspeakable crimes.
Although it took decades for courts to embrace the broad range of privacy pro-
tections envisioned in “The Right to Privacy,” the notion that sexual misconduct
should not be the subject of news reporting or public discussion became a widely
accepted social convention for most of the twentieth century. Whereas nineteenth-
century newspapers had routinely published accounts of rape and sexual molesta-
tion, usually providing the names and addresses of both perpetrators and victims,
these stories became less common with the evolution of journalism as a profession
and the rise of newspapers such as the New York Times. Articles on sexual wrong-
doing did not vanish altogether, but in general, in stories in which the mention of
sexual assault and misconduct could not be avoided, as in cases involving addi-
tional crimes, reporters resorted to euphemisms such as “nameless outrage,” “vio-
lation of the home,” or even “outrage against her husband” to refer to sexual attacks
on women. 
The effect of this configuration of the right to privacy was not only to reinforce
barriers to women’s participation in public life, but also to make it difficult or
impossible for them to escape violence, injury, and oppression in the domestic
sphere. The curtain that privacy defenders drew around the family home was not
lifted after women won the vote in 1920, and the gentlemen’s agreement that gen-
erally precluded reporting on sexual transgressions remained in place until the late
1970s. Likewise, the idea that women might forsake domestic duties in order to
assume more active roles in public remains controversial today. Advocates for sex-
ual equality, consequently, did not specifically oppose the right to privacy, but they
protested the ways in which it barred women from the public stage while also
obscuring their experience in the private domain.
The nineteenth-century doctrine of separate spheres has in important respects
lost its grip on popular consciousness, thanks in large part to the efforts of 1970s

250

\
women’s liberationists to subject previously private matters such as rape and
domestic violence, as well as the unequal division of labor within the home, to the
public scrutiny that privacy defenders such as Brandeis and Warren strove to avoid.
Sexual inequality, well-known feminists such as Betty Freidan and Gloria Steinem
argued, stemmed not only from the active exclusion of women from the higher lev-
els of business, academia, and government, but also from the dependency, bore-
dom, and in many cases, physical and emotional pain they suffered within the
home.
In stark opposition to idealized conceptions of the domestic circle as the space in
which women realize their deepest wishes by ministering to the needs their families,
many 1970s feminists derided the life of the typical housewife as a brainless exist-
ence built on sexual submission, vapid consumption, and deep-seated anxiety about
meaningless routines. Women’s rights activists declared, first in consciousness-
raising groups and then in public demonstrations, that sexual equality would not be
achieved until women enjoyed parity on both sides of the public/private dichotomy,
not only receiving equal pay for equal work, access to higher education, and unfet-
tered opportunity in every profession, but also casting off primary responsibility for
childrearing and other domestic cares. 
Ironically, at the very moment women’s liberationists began to issue public
demands for freedom from the restrictive bonds of conventional marriage, exit
from the stultifying dreariness of housework, and relief from sole responsibility
for child care, the Supreme Court responded to the pressures of the sexual revolu-
tion by reasserting the conventional divisions between public and private life. In
Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), the Court ruled that the decision to
obtain and use contraceptives falls within the boundaries of marital privacy. Citing
the “penumbras,” or shadows, cast by various amendments to the Constitution,
William O. Douglas, who wrote the majority opinion, argued that the choices
made by married couples in respect to family planning are contained within a zone
of privacy into which the government should not intrude. The privacy claims that
belong to married couples stood on special ground, Douglas argued, because the
marriage bond involves principles that predate the Bill of Rights and pertain to a
relationship that is as significant, if not more significant, than any other: “Marriage
is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the
degree of being sacred . . . it is an association for as noble a purpose as any
involved in our prior decisions.” 
A few years after Griswold was decided, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438
(1972), the Court abruptly dropped its previous focus on marital privacy and held
that unmarried persons should have equal access to contraceptives because the
right to privacy belongs to individuals rather than to married couples. The Court
did not explain why the right of association, which had been accorded such high
status in Griswold, was no longer relevant. Instead, Justice William J. Brennan,
who wrote the majority opinion, simply declared, “If the right of privacy means
anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwar-
ranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as
the decision whether to bear or beget a child.”
Eisenstadt set the stage for Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), in which the
Court found that a limited right to abortion is included in women’s general right to

Gender

251
privacy, although the state may step in to regulate or prevent late-stage terminations
of pregnancy. While these rulings were welcomed by feminists because they gave
women some control over sexual reproduction, they were seen by many as inher-
ently problematic because the Court failed to address the role of gender in limiting
women’s ability to make choices within the domestic sphere and in constricting
women’s access to the material means required to translate their choices into
action. The principle of government noninterference that informed Roe’s reliance
on the privacy right was and has remained especially burdensome for poor and
marginalized women because they have always been more likely to require public
assistance to access medical services, more likely to be caught in dependent rela-
tionships, and generally less likely to be able to assert their political rights. How-
ever, when women’s liberationists pressed for abortion on demand during the late
1970s, the Supreme Court answered in Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980) that
the government had no obligation to provide financial assistance to women who
would otherwise be unable to afford medically necessary abortions. 
Without pretending that the oppressive elements within prevailing perceptions
of privacy have been entirely resolved, feminist theorists, most notably law profes-
sor Anita Allen-Castellitto, have argued that it makes more sense to re-envision pri-
vacy from a feminist perspective than to jettison it altogether as incompatible with
equal rights. On the one hand, feminists such as Allen observe, exposing the private
sphere to greater public scrutiny and regulation is bound to hurt women if the
gender-based assumptions that frequently shape this exposure go unrecognized. On
the other, promoting the notion that “the personal is political” without reservation
seems to preclude even the possibility that women might enjoy a considerable
degree of dignity and autonomy within the realm of home and family. 
The solution, according to these feminist reconstructionists, is to formulate a
more nuanced and accurate view of privacy, one that takes account of the real relief
that may be gained from protection from public intrusion without denying the sub-
jugation, loneliness, abuse, deprivation, and violence that too many women endure
in their homes. “Choice,” which is the shorthand typically used to refer to repro-
ductive freedom and most closely tied to women’s right to privacy, is, after all, a
painfully empty concept to those who have no means to act upon their decisions. At
the same time, a world in which women have even less control over personal infor-
mation and less control over intimate relations, like one in which they have less
control over reproductive choices, would clearly not bring them any closer to genu-
ine equality in either the private or the public spheres. Thus, while there is no set-
tled view of privacy among present-day feminists, there is general agreement that it
will not become a truly positive value until it is paired with an understanding of the
gender-specific limits that are still placed on women’s agency on both sides of the
public/private divide.

Genetic information and testing
\

and Mary Law Review 40 (1999).

Genetic information and testing
Genetic testing can be defined as any technique that can be used to gain infor-
mation about aspects of an individual that are influenced, caused by, or controlled
by genes. Defined this broadly, it encompasses methodologies not reliant on labo-
ratory analyses or technology, such as the compilation of a detailed family medical
history. In common usage, however, genetic testing usually refers more narrowly to
processes used to determine the structure of an individual’s genes and includes
molecular testing (examination of DNA or RNA), microscopic examination of
chromosomes, and biochemical tests that determine the presence or absence of
gene products (proteins). 
The privacy implications of genetic testing can vary as well as the technique
employed. Depending upon the purpose of a genetic test and the surrounding cir-
cumstances, testing and the resultant information may have a profound impact on
individual and family privacy or none at all. Perhaps most critical to this determina-
tion is the degree to which the identity of the individual who is being tested is
linked to specimens and information throughout testing activities. These activities
include the collecting of specimens or samples for testing, storage of samples (pre-
and posttesting), the analysis itself, the storage of genetic information generated
from the analysis (DNA banking), and disclosures of samples and data to third
parties.
The informational value of a DNA sample can increase after the sample is col-
lected from an individual because scientific breakthroughs in deciphering the
genetic code and understanding the function of genes are continually being made.
The scope of genetic tests now available illustrates the informational value of sam-
ples that have already been collected and hints at the range of information that
might be culled from them in the future. In health care, genetic testing is used to
identify predispositions to rare genetic diseases (e.g., Huntington’s Disease), to
predict response to drugs, to estimate risks for developing common illnesses (e.g.,
some cancers), and to determine carrier status for reproductive purposes. Outside
of medicine, it is employed to identify bodily remains, connect individuals to crim-
inal acts, and determine paternity. It has been incorporated into genealogical
research and is used for marketing nutritional supplements and skin-care products
to consumers. In the future it may be used to identify predispositions to injury or to
screen for cognitive abilities and other traits unrelated to health. 
Of course, not all the genetic information produced from testing is highly private,
powerful, or sensitive; some genetic information is quite benign or obvious. But
because much genetic information is highly personal, prolonged storage of, and easy
accessibility to, identifiable samples (and genetic data) present significant risks to
individual privacy. As this entry will illustrate, varying degrees of legal protections are
available to mitigate those privacy risks, and just as there is no single comprehensive
privacy law in the United States, there is no single comprehensive genetic testing or
genetic privacy law. Consequently, one can best categorize the laws pertaining to
genetic privacy as a patchwork of rights and protections that derive from constitutions,

Genetic information and testing

253
statutes, regulations, and common law. Identifying and summarizing laws that regulate
genetic testing and related privacy interests is further complicated by the fact that laws
that do not explicitly refer to genetic testing or genetic information may nevertheless
be interpreted to also apply to such matters. 
Although there is no explicit provision in the U.S. Constitution that recognizes a
right to privacy, a number of federal constitutional provisions have been interpreted
to protect certain aspects of individual privacy from interference by state or federal
government. When state governments exercise their authority through laws that
restrict individual decisions, affected individuals may look to constitutional rights
to privacy in formulating a challenge to that authority. Every state has enacted laws
that authorize the compulsory collection and testing of DNA by law enforcement
officials, although who can be compelled to provide samples varies from state to
state. All states compel collection of samples from felony sex offenders, a majority
of states extend their authority to include all convicted felons, and approximately
half of the states authorize collection from individuals convicted of misdemeanors.
A few states go so far as to include those arrested on suspicion of committing a
crime (e.g., Texas). States contribute the genetic data generated under these laws to
the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which is also the repository of genetic
information about individuals convicted of violent crimes under federal law.
CODIS is maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and it
enables federal, state, and local crime labs to exchange and compare DNA profiles
electronically. 
The type of genetic profiling authorized under these statutes involves decoding
regions on the human genome that are sufficiently unique so as to be useful for
identification purposes but which are not generally thought to contain information
associated with any known physical or mental traits. When most of these laws
authorizing such DNA profiling were enacted, the privacy interests affected by
such testing were therefore viewed as deriving primarily from the compulsory
aspect of the testing, rather than from the nature of the information produced. But
more recently, studies have questioned whether the regions of DNA involved
should be viewed as “junk DNA” that is devoid of any personal information.
Therefore, in the future when more is known about how DNA functions, the pri-
vacy implications of such testing may come to be viewed differently. The constitu-
tional challenges raised thus far in regard to such forensic testing have been based
on the Fourth Amendment guarantees against unreasonable search and seizures and
the protection of personal security. The Supreme Court has yet to review and rule
on the constitutionality of any of these statutes. But the federal circuit courts that
have reviewed these Fourth Amendment claims have declined to find any of these
statutes to be in violation of the U. S. Constitution. 
Genetic testing conducted by governmental agents for entirely different pur-
poses has also been challenged on constitutional grounds. In 1995 employees in a
federally funded research laboratory brought a lawsuit against their employers
claiming that they had been subjected to nonconsensual testing for several condi-
tions, including sickle-cell trait, and that the testing violated (in addition to some
other statutes) their rights to privacy as guaranteed by the constitutions of Califor-
nia and the United States. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims, but in
Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, 135 F3d 1260 (9th circuit

254
Genetic information and testing
\
Feb. 3, 1998), the circuit court reinstated the constitutional claims, recognizing that
few subject areas are more personal and more likely to implicate privacy interests
than one’s health or genetic makeup. As a result, the case went back to the trial
court. Neither the California Supreme Court nor the U.S. Supreme Court has sub-
sequently addressed or ruled on the privacy issues raised in the Bloodsaw case.
Therefore, the relationship between constitutionally protected rights to privacy and
secret or nonconsensual, genetic testing of governmental employees has yet to be
authoritatively defined by any court. 
Regardless of whether the U.S. Constitution places restrictions on how the gov-
ernment obtains, uses, or disseminates genetic information, an executive order
issued by President Clinton in February 2000 limits the use of genetic testing in
federal employment. Under Executive Order 13145, federal employers are prohib-
ited from discriminating against their employees on the basis of genetic informa-
tion and are further prohibited (with a few exceptions) from disclosing genetic
information about an employee or any member of a federal employee’s family. As
long as this order remains in effect, the genetic privacy of federal employees is pro-
tected to the extent that they should not be subjected to nonconsensual genetic test-
ing at work. 
In the 1970s states began enacting laws to protect individuals with specific
genetic traits from being discriminated against on the basis of those traits. Typi-
cally, these statutes addressed sickle-cell disease, thalessemia, Tay Sachs, and cys-
tic fibrosis as the traits of concern, and extended protection to individuals who
either had these genetic conditions or were carriers of the conditions. For the most
part these laws regulate how information regarding the traits could be used in the
employment and insurance arenas; they do not restrict how the information might
be acquired in the first place, nor do they restrict disclosures or sharing of informa-
tion about these, or any other genetic diseases, outside of employment or insurance.
Consequently, they provide little in the way of privacy protections, even for those
affected by one of the named conditions. 
A second wave of genetic legislation that began across states in the early 1990s
had the primary purpose of protecting economic interests that might be affected as
a result of the expansion of genetic testing and thereby greater opportunities for
genetic discrimination. These statutes mainly focused on regulating uses of genetic
information in health insurance and employment, and incorporated privacy protec-
tions to varying degrees. Wisconsin is credited with being the first state to generally
ban genetic discrimination in employment and to ban genetic discrimination in health
insurance. By 2000, a majority of states had enacted genetic anti-discrimination laws
that apply to health insurance and employment practices. Commonly, these statutes
regulate the extent to which an insurer or employer can request or require that indi-
viduals disclose genetic information to them or undergo testing that would generate
genetic information. Thus, these laws are based on the notion that genetic informa-
tion should be treated differently from other personal or health information, but
many states limit this policy of so-called genetic exceptionalism to the realms of
insurance or employment. Consequently, they might guard against situations where
an insurer or an employer would know more about an individual’s genetic informa-
tion than the individual would know, or would choose to know, about himself or

herself, but they do not provide any privacy protections for genetic testing or
genetic information that results from occurrences elsewhere. 
States also determine the impact of statutory rules through the definitions that
are employed within a statute. Here, the scope of definitions employed for genetic
testing and genetic information affects the reach of protections that statutory rules
provide. Some states, like New Mexico, define genetic information broadly to
include information about the genetic makeup of a person or members of a person’s
family; information resulting from genetic testing, genetic analysis, or DNA com-
position; information that an individual has participated in genetic research; or
information related to the use of genetic services. Other states define it more nar-
rowly. For example, Maryland defines genetic testing as laboratory tests of human
chromosomes or DNA, thus excluding any other methods by which genetic infor-
mation can be generated. 
Some states have taken a wide view toward protecting genetic privacy and regu-
late genetic testing regardless of where it occurs. For example, Illinois prohibits
genetic testing by anyone (not just health insurers or employers) without the indi-
vidual’s informed and written consent. These states also treat information derived
from genetic testing as confidential and privileged, and as a general rule permit
releases of genetic information only to the individual tested or to persons specifi-
cally authorized in writing by that individual to receive the information. 
Another factor influencing the impact of state regulation of genetic testing and
information is the inclusion in some statutes of what are referred to as sunset provi-
sions. As a result, in those states, additional action is required by the state legisla-
ture for the rules to remain in effect after the specified date. For example, in
Massachusetts the rules governing genetic testing and use of genetic information in
life and disability insurance expired at the end of 2005, but rules governing genetic
testing (and disclosures of genetic information) within health care are not subject to
the sunset provision and consequently remain in effect. 
In order to thoroughly protect privacy, however, legislation should also address
routine destruction of samples as well as routine destruction of genetic information
that is maintained in an individually identifiable form, include stringent penalties,
and provide for strict enforcement. While some states provide statutory penalties,
most often in the form of monetary fines for violations, and grant enforcement
authority to one or more state agencies, few require routine destruction of samples
in order to guard against unauthorized testing. 
The impact that state insurance laws described above can have on protecting pri-
vacy is further tempered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA), a federal statute that removes some employee benefit plans (including
health plans) from the reach of state insurance laws. Therefore, individuals in states
that have enacted such laws may not be protected by them, depending upon how
they obtain their health insurance coverage. Several bills that would remedy this
disparity have been introduced in Congress. One such proposal, the Genetic Infor-
mation Non-Discrimination Act of 2005 (S.306), passed the Senate in February
2005. An identical bill was introduced in the House shortly thereafter and referred
to several committees for consideration, but to date no federal law has been enacted
that contains provisions comparable to these state insurance and employment laws.

\
One federal statute, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (HIPAA), provides some protection from discrimination on the basis of
genetic information to individuals when they move from one health plan to another.
However, it does not put restrictions on the collection of genetic information by
insurers, prohibit insurers from requiring an individual to take a genetic test, or
limit the disclosure of genetic information by insurers, and therefore it lacks any
privacy provisions. 
Regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under
HIPAA, often referred to as the HIPAA Privacy Rules, regulate disclosures of indi-
vidually identifiable health information held by most health care providers, health
care clearinghouses, and health plans. Any genetic information that fits the defini-
tion of health information as used in these regulations would be protected as well. 
The HIPPA regulations do not preempt any state laws that protect health infor-
mation more stringently than those regulations. Consequently, the more stringent
state laws would apply to actions in states that have enacted what have been
referred to as genetic exceptionalism statutes. This includes amendments to exist-
ing medical information laws that provide additional rules and special protections
for genetic information as well as statutes dedicated to protecting genetic informa-
tion regardless of the context in which it is created, stored, or disclosed. 
In regard to genetic information that would fall outside medical record or health
information laws (because of who holds the information or how it was created),
individuals would need to look to common law for protection of genetic privacy.
No court has yet applied any of the common law protections of generalized privacy
interests to circumstances involving nonconsensual genetic testing, unauthorized
disclosure of genetic test results to third parties, or publication of private genetic
information.

Global Positioning System (GPS)
The premier satellite-based radio navigation and position-finding system, GPS,
was designed and deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense in the late 1970s
and has become generally synonymous with such systems, despite the availability
and continued development of alternatives such as the Soviet Glonass system and
the European Union’s proposed Galileo. GPS now underpins a vast array of defense,
commercial, and civil applications, although it was initially conceived to support the
American military’s demand for worldwide, all-weather, high-precision navigation

and weapons delivery. As a state-controlled, “dual-use” (i.e., military/civil) system
of global purview, GPS has raised a number of complex issues in technology regu-
lation, state sovereignty, and the militarization of civil society. Its privacy implica-
tions, however, might be less clear, in that GPS satellites are effectively little more
than sophisticated radio beacons, allowing receiving devices to compute their
three-dimensional positions at a specified time.
It is when GPS is integrated with other technologies that a broad spectrum of
privacy concerns results, if privacy can be construed as the ability to conceal or
control one’s communications and information about oneself. Technologies that
record or transmit location information elsewhere (such as cellular telephones or
vehicular tracking devices) or that use it to constrain movement (devices that
administer progressively stronger electric shocks to children or incarcerated indi-
viduals as they stray further into proscribed regions) are pertinent examples. GPS
has undeniably changed the field of navigation forever, but in concert with associ-
ated technologies, it has yielded a whole new constellation of privacy concerns. 
As with any satellite-based positioning system, GPS comprises three seg-
ments: a “constellation” of earth-orbiting satellites, a network of ground tracking
and control facilities, and a radio receiver, typically operated by an individual user.
The satellites are arranged in orbit so that every point on the earth has a direct line-
of-sight to at least four of them at all times. Time signals from ultra-precise atomic
clocks on board the satellites are encoded and transmitted via radio, along with the
satellites’ positions and various corrective information. Individual receivers (bear-
ing lower-precision quartz clocks) compare these time signals with their own, com-
puting the satellite-to-receiver travel time of the signals and thereby the distance.
Once the distance and location of four such satellites is known, position in three-
dimensional space (e.g., latitude, longitude, and altitude) can be determined using a
geometric computation known as trilateration.
The privacy implications of GPS precipitate from three distinct developments
over its 30-year history. The first centers on the opening up of GPS to civilian
users, analogous to the shift by which ARPANET became the Internet. Following
the 1983 downing of Korean Airlines flight 007 by military aircraft when it strayed
into Soviet airspace, President Ronald Reagan announced publicly that GPS sig-
nals and technology would be made available internationally for civilian use,
thereby helping to keep civil aircraft on course. Regulatory developments over the
next fifteen years catalyzed a number of civil-sector uses of GPS—surveying in
particular—by ensuring the accessibility of satellite signals, fostering the design of
less-expensive receivers, and adopting or publishing GPS standards. Under Presi-
dent Clinton, the May 2000 shutoff of “selective availability”—an intentional blur-
ring of GPS signals for nonmilitary users—improved precision for many by an
order-of-magnitude almost overnight, thereby laying the groundwork for a com-
merce in high-precision (and potentially sensitive) location data.
Improvements in both timeliness and resolution—that is, the precision with
which position can be determined—constituted a second development with direct
consequences for privacy. The timeliness with which position can be ascertained
depends on a number of factors, such as the number of satellites that can be simul-
taneously acquired by a given receiver, but for most purposes, position can effec-
tively be updated continuously and instantaneously using GPS. Since its inception,

258
Global Positioning System (GPS)
\
the resolution of GPS was high compared to other position-finding systems,
and that resolution has steadily increased since deployment began. Continuous
position-tracking at better than 10-meter resolution is essential for a whole host of
applications, such as the navigation of individual vehicles in dense urban areas.
While many techniques for tracking position have been devised, most provided
only direction or rough location, and/or were limited to city-sized regions or
smaller. Instead of exotic equipment that indicates approximate location (perhaps
only of subjects within the local metropolitan area), GPS is comprised of com-
monly available signals and equipment that can provide a current location to within
earshot, anywhere on earth.
Finally, a third development key to privacy considerations has been the contin-
ued reduction (through electronic microminiaturization) of the physical size of
GPS receivers. The capabilities of the suitcase-sized devices of only two decades
ago can now be packaged into cellular telephones or wristwatches, with further
miniaturization envisioned. In the mid-1990s the proliferation of cellular tele-
phones in the United States caused a dramatic rise in emergency calls, but in many
cases the caller was unable to identify his or her precise location. As a result, the
FCC ordered cellular providers to build position-finding into their systems, making
miniature GPS receivers an attractive add-on to cell phones. The current (and envi-
sioned) enhancement of the cellular phone as a position-finding device has
spawned a new information services sector referred to as location-based services
(LBS), wherein information presented to a cell phone user is modified according to
his or her location (GPS-determined or otherwise). Commercial vehicular naviga-
tion systems, for example, display a map of the local area without the need for the
user to enter his or her current position. GPS-equipped cellular phones themselves
could allow urban pedestrians to quickly locate nearby facilities in unfamiliar cit-
ies, or act as a medium for localized advertising—while potentially making phone
records a record of personal location as well. Receivers small enough to be worn or
subcutaneously implanted have engendered further civil applications, including the
monitoring of traffic, pets, livestock, criminals, mental patients, or even children.
In 2001 the Digital Angel Corporation began offering patented, GPS-based tech-
nologies for just such applications.
The profit to be made from this growing array of applications is making “loca-
tional information” a valuable commodity to be bought and sold in the same way as
telephone numbers or demographic profiles. Location is the principal index of geo-
graphic information systems (GIS), the spatially organized databases increasingly
used to visualize communities and the environment. Further, recent national and
international efforts to develop spatial data infrastructures are indicators of the
increasing societal significance being placed on having access to up-to-the-minute
location. By both delineating a uniform spatial grid encompassing the globe and by
providing a mechanism for instantly determining one’s location on that grid, GPS
is a foundational technology that has added location to identity, communication,
property, and the other aspects of social life sometimes conceived of as public or
private.

Gossip
Gossip is a particular kind of communicative activity that typically involves the
sharing of unfortunate, unsavory, or unflattering information about the private
affairs of others not present. Gossip has a typical structure in social interaction, and
its participants occupy a typical set of social roles. Gossip is usually surreptitiously
accomplished in small groups of trusted others in face-to-face interaction, although
its content may also be conveyed via phone, electronic mail, and letter. Although
the discharge of gossip usually focuses on its purveyors, gossip cannot exist with-
out purveyors and audience members; nor can it exist without the persons who are
its subject in absentia. 
As an organized activity, gossip typically includes a tacit agreement, between pur-
veyors and listeners, that the information shared will be kept private among those
included in the conversation, or at least that the purveyor of its contents will be kept
confidential among those participating in the conversation. This is often accom-
plished by using phrases that conceal the source or purveyor of information, such as
“I heard . . . .” This assumptive procedure also provides purveyors with a convenient
disclaimer of responsibility for the truthfulness of the information being shared.
Like stories in general, what matters about the authenticity of gossip’s content is
not its truthfulness, but rather the degree to which people regard it to be true, and
whether or not it is meaningful to listeners and thus worthy of sharing with others.
The nature of gossip as a private conversational activity with unverifiable origins
casts doubt on its reliability. As such, gossip does not hold the same ontological
status as other kinds of talk, and it is commonly relegated in everyday life to the
level of rumor. “Hearsay” is legally disregarded as legitimate testimony in courts of
law in the United States because of the shaky ground on which it stands. Depend-
ing on the severity of its content, whether what is being shared is purported to be
true or can be proven to be true, and whether or not its sources can be identified,
the subject likely has little recourse against allegations even to the legal status of
libel, slander, or defamation of character. The structure of gossip previously
described makes such action prohibitive.
For many years, social researchers overlooked gossip, or perhaps regarded it as
trivial and unworthy of scientific investigation. However, in the last three decades,
sociologists have begun to recognize and take seriously gossip as an important fea-
ture of social life in the subfield of micro-sociology, the study of human behavior in
face-to-face interaction. Several sociological studies have discussed the social roles,
social organization, social and moral consequences, and social functions of gossip.
The three social roles associated with gossip—the absent subject, the purveyor,
and the audience—are all moral actors in the context of gossip. Gossip’s subject
matter, the private affairs of others, most obviously bears on the reputation or moral

260
Gossip
\
standing of its absent and unwitting subjects. The subjects of gossip are typically
excluded altogether from the information being discussed by others and exhibit no
control over its content, meaning, or audience. To the extent that such information
becomes known to subjects, the persons whose private affairs are being discussed
are likely to perceive gossip as an invasion of privacy. To the extent that the infor-
mation is perceived as real or true, gossip deprives a person of the ability to partic-
ipate in the construction of his or her own social reality or to manage impressions
of the self. Because gossip incapacitates the subject’s ability to control information
about the self, it represents the opposite of impression management, one’s ability to
perform the self, in form and content, and may have further consequences for one’s
relationships with those “in the know.”
The social role of the purveyor includes the ability to exercise control over who
is included and who is excluded in the immediate discussion, and what information
is relayed and withheld in that encounter. While the consequences of gossip are
usually thought to bear most upon the reputation or social status of those being dis-
cussed, gossip bears on the moral status of its purveyors as well. What is communi-
cated by purveyors is likely to say as much or more about them as about the
subjects being discussed. Through gossip, purveyors perform and reveal them-
selves, their interests and values, to a chosen audience. Gossip may also bear on its
purveyors in another, more salient, way. Given the high cultural value placed on
individual privacy, especially in the United States, as well as the expectation for
treating others with respect and civility, being perceived to have too great a concern
for the personal affairs of others, particularly those details that could cause one
public embarrassment, purveyors of such matters might garner a reputation as a
“gossiper.” Such a reputation potentially casts one as indiscreet, having poor
manners and “low” concerns, untrustworthy, nosy, or “holier than thou.” In poten-
tially soiling the reputations of others through gossip, purveyors risk their own.
Those who occupy the role of audience member are also moral actors. The words
typically used to describe this role—audience, listener, or receiver—disguise the
agency typically accorded by these terms to this position. In fact, the audience of
gossip may exercise a great deal of power in this communicative act. Audience
members are not, and are not expected to be, merely listeners. Purveyors usually
include them in the conversation because they are trusted. Purveyors are also per-
forming for their audience. Audience members have a range of possible functions
in their social role: as confidantes or as betrayers of confidences; as co-constructors
of reality, as future purveyors, or as terminators of gossip; and, finally, as adjudica-
tors of purveyors and absent subjects alike. Once included in the conversation,
members of the audience are implicated and obliged to assume a stance, rather than
to merely listen. The choices audience members make have consequences for their
relationships with purveyors and possibly absent subjects, consequences that bear
on their own moral standing.
Sociologists have also identified a number of social functions of gossip includ-
ing, among others, informal social control, social solidarity, information manage-
ment, and reinforcing the normative order. The most commonly discussed social
function of gossip in sociological research is informal social control, a means of
responding to deviant behavior and thus maintaining social stability. Because the
content of gossip usually conveys something unsavory or unfortunate about the

›
261
absent subject, gossiping may lead to the stigmatization and marginalization of
absent others by those included in the gossip. All individuals privy to gossip col-
laboratively negotiate through their interaction what kinds of deviant affairs might
merit such talk and, conversely, what values and norms they venerate. Gossiping
about absent others, as well as the threat of being gossiped about, is a powerful
form of informal social control that functions to regulate human behavior accord-
ing to the norms of the group. As a response to deviance, the social control function
of gossip may also lead to further social functions. The prevalence of gossip in a
social group may have deleterious effects, creating suspicion, mistrust, and discord,
or “productive” effects such as reinforcing shared group norms and enhancing
social solidarity among members. 
That gossip has historically connoted the pejorative is evinced by an emerging
body of work regarding “good” gossip, just as the term “male nurse” reveals the
assumptive gendering of “nurse.” It is not known if gossip’s character is maligned
because it concerns the private affairs of others, because of its usual damaging con-
tent and consequences for individuals, because of its fictive nature, or perhaps
because it is perceived to be predominantly an activity of women. What is recog-
nized is that gossip is a powerful feature of everyday social life and has arrived as a
burgeoning subject of social inquiry.

Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)
In Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional
a Connecticut law criminalizing the use of contraceptives as inconsistent with a
constitutional right of privacy. In so doing, the Court recognized the existence of
such a right, navigated an uneasy tension in its prior cases, and laid what became
the foundations for constitutional rights to decisional privacy (including abortion)
and informational privacy.
Although the U.S. Constitution protects many rights expressly, it does not con-
tain any mention of the word “privacy.” Nevertheless, prior to Griswold, the
Supreme Court had recognized in a number of cases that the Constitution protected
privacy interests of one form or another. Prior to the New Deal era, the Supreme
Court had protected the private sphere from government regulation through a num-
ber of related doctrines. Thus, in criminal procedure law, it had held in cases such
as Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886) that the Fourth and Fifth Amend-
ments to the Constitution created a form of privacy right protecting a person’s pri-
vate papers from government scrutiny. In Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905)
and related cases, it held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment guaranteed a liberty of contract and state neutrality in economic affairs that

262
Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)
\
prevented many kinds of state regulation touching private affairs, including work-
place safety rules and minimum wage laws. And in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S.
390 (1923) and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), the Court declared
that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause denied the states the power
to interfere with parents’ rights to send their children to private schools and to edu-
cate them in languages other than English. 
Many of these rules were inconsistent with the needs of the modern regulatory
state, and with the notable exception of the Meyer and Pierce strand of the doctrine,
over time they were gradually whittled away by the Supreme Court. Particularly
after the Court was comprised of a majority of Justices appointed by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Court’s constitutional law jurisprudence shifted to allow
significantly greater government regulation of economic activity. Interpretations of
the Due Process Clause like Lochner that appeared to be unmoored from the text of
the Constitution became suspect, and the Court increasingly deferred to modern
welfare legislation. At the same time, however, as it noted in the famous case of
United States v. Carolene Products, 304 U.S. 144 (1938), the Court began to show
a greater willingness to protect First Amendment and other non-economic civil
liberties from government interference. These somewhat divergent impulses—
judicial restraint and modern civil libertarianism—would soon come into conflict in
contexts relevant to privacy. For example, in Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535
(1942), Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the Court, invalidated under equal pro-
tection grounds, Oklahoma’s law providing for mandatory sterilization of habitual
criminals because it violated a fundamental right to procreate. In Prince v. Massachu-
setts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Court held in the context of children engaged in
selling religious materials that the modern state’s power to regulate on behalf of
child welfare trumped both First Amendment rights and parental rights under
Meyer and Pierce. Griswold v. Connecticut would again place these two guiding
principles of post–New Deal constitutional jurisprudence into direct conflict in the
context of privacy.
Griswold was the culmination of a series of challenges by birth control advo-
cates to a Connecticut law outlawing contraception. That law, passed in 1879,
made it a crime for any person to use or aid any person in using “any drug,
medicinal article, or instrument for the purpose of preventing contraception”
(Conn. Gen. Stat. §§53–32, 54–196). The statute had never been enforced,
though Abraham Ullman, Connecticut’s long-serving attorney general, had
threatened to prosecute any violators. Birth control advocates had twice before
attempted to challenge the Connecticut statute without first violating it, but in
Tileston v. Ullman, 318 U.S. 44 (1943) and Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961),
the Supreme Court rejected these challenges on procedural grounds without
reaching the issue of the statute’s constitutionality.
In 1961, the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut and its executive direc-
tor, Estelle Griswold, tried to challenge the statute again by opening a birth control
clinic in New Haven. Their goal was for Griswold to be arrested and force a deci-
sion on the constitutionality of the statute. This time they succeeded. Ten days after
the clinic opened, Griswold was arrested along with Charles Lee Buxton, a Yale
Medical School professor and medical director of the clinic. They were found
guilty of violating the statute by giving advice to married couples and fined $100,

›
263
over their objections that the statute violated the Constitution’s Fourteenth Amend-
ment guarantee of due process of law. The Connecticut state appellate and supreme
courts affirmed Griswold and Buxton’s convictions.
The United States Supreme Court heard Griswold and Buxton’s appeal and
reversed it by a vote of 7-2. The justices recognized that the Constitution includes
an unenumerated right of privacy, although they disagreed somewhat about the
source and content of that right. 
Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice William O. Douglas concluded that
state regulation of the use of contraceptives by married couples violated a constitu-
tional right to privacy. However, Douglas had a problem. As a member of the group
of justices who had opposed the Court’s Lochner cases, Douglas was reluctant to
merely hold that a broad right of privacy was inherent in basic notions of due pro-
cess of law. Indeed, to make such an argument would be to have engaged in the
same sort of constitutional interpretation that he and others had been so critical of
during the New Deal period, in which they had charged that the earlier cases had
essentially made up rights and incorporated them into the Constitution by fiat. His
solution to the problem was to locate a right of privacy across a broad spectrum of
the protections in the Bill of Rights. Thus, he argued that the First Amendment had
been interpreted to include not just the rights protected in Pierce and Meyer (recast-
ing those cases in the process), but also a right protecting against government intru-
sion into associations of individuals for a common purpose. Furthermore, other
provisions of the Bill of Rights had “penumbras, formed by emanations from those
guarantees that help give them life and substance” (p. 484.) Thus, the Third
Amendment prohibits the quartering of soldiers in private homes, the Fourth
Amendment gives people security and privacy in their private homes and papers,
the Fifth Amendment’s self-incrimination clause creates a “zone of privacy” that
the government could not breach, and the Ninth Amendment recognizes that rights
not enumerated by the Constitution might nevertheless be retained by the people.
These protections, taken together, he argued, created a broader zone of privacy that
while not specifically articulated by any one of these provisions in the Constitu-
tion’s text, was nevertheless protected by all of them acting together. Because mar-
riage was an association of ancient origins and tremendous social importance, its
privacy could not be violated by the state’s intrusion into the marital bedroom for
signs of contraceptive use. Although Justice Douglas’s theory garnered the votes of
a majority of five of the nine justices, and thus gained the status of binding law, a
number of justices articulated alternative theories justifying the outcome. Justice
Arthur Goldberg, along with Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William Brennan,
joined Douglas’s opinion, but they also articulated a broader theory of constitu-
tional privacy grounded in the Ninth Amendment and “so rooted in the traditions
and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.” (p. 487). Justice
John Harlan, although he rejected Douglas’s penumbral theory, agreed with the
outcome because the Connecticut law violated basic values “implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty” (p. 500) that were protected by the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Byron White similarly agreed with the outcome,
but also rejected Douglas’s theory of constitutional privacy. Instead, he argued, the
case ought to be resolved by basic principles of due process: the Connecticut law
deprived married people of the important liberty of contraceptive use and family

Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)
\
planning, and did not directly advance the regulatory interests put forward by the
state. Justices Potter Stewart and Hugo Black dissented, noting that while they
thought the Connecticut statute was a terrible one (Stewart famously called it “an
uncommonly silly law” (p. 527)), the law did not violate any provision of the Con-
stitution and ought to be upheld by the courts. Black and Stewart were both con-
cerned by the fact that the Constitutional text contained no mention of any right of
privacy, and that for judges to essentially invent such a right would be for them to
substitute their own views of morality for that of legislatures. Black, in particular,
was troubled by the legacy of Lochner, and by the Court’s reliance on Meyer and
Pierce, which he acknowledged came from that discredited constitutional tradition.
More generally, Black feared for the legitimacy of an unelected judiciary that could
so easily substitute its own “personal preferences” (p. 526) regarding the correct-
ness of laws. In Black’s view, such an approach to the judicial role would amount
to a shocking departure from the constitutional separation of the judiciary from
politics and the political branches of government at all levels.
The Court’s opinions in Griswold have been read as protecting two distinct vari-
eties of a constitutional right of privacy. On the one hand, Griswold can be read as
protecting “information privacy”—a right to keep information secret from the gov-
ernment. Two groups of Supreme Court cases have developed this theme further.
First, there are two cases that can be read as explicitly recognizing a constitutional
right of informational privacy. Thus, in Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589 (1977), the
Court intimated that the Griswold right to privacy might include an individual right
against government disclosure of certain kinds of sensitive information, such as
medical information. This suggestion was confirmed in Nixon v. Administrator of
General Services, 433 U.S. 425 (1977), in which former President Nixon chal-
lenged a federal statute nationalizing his presidential papers as violating his right to
privacy with respect to personal papers contained in the archive. The Supreme
Court agreed with Nixon that he had a Whalen-type privacy interest in, for exam-
ple, presidential documents relating to his family life or personal legal advice, but
held that the act’s provisions allowing for archival screening of his papers to sepa-
rate out the private ones from the public ones sufficiently protected his informa-
tional privacy rights, given both the government’s interest in the public papers and
the tiny fraction of the total body of papers that were truly private. Further articula-
tion of the constitutional right to informational privacy has been left to lower courts
for further development, and although a number of such courts have protected con-
stitutional informational privacy rights, the jurisprudence is neither particularly
robust nor consistent. 
A second area where information privacy rights have been given constitutional
protection is in the Court’s invalidation of notification provisions in state abortion
laws. Thus, in cases such as Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417 (1990) and
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), the Court invalidated notifica-
tion provisions in state abortion laws that would have required women seeking an
abortion to first notify their husbands or parents. To this extent, these cases can be
read as protecting a constitutional interest in nondisclosure consonant with the
Griswold conception of informational privacy. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that
although the informational reading of Griswold is probably a better reading of the

Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)
›
265
right recognized in Justice Douglas’s majority opinion, it has remained largely
undeveloped by subsequent cases.
By contrast, an alternative reading of Griswold as protecting “decisional privacy”—
the right to make reproductive and other intimate decisions without government
interference—has received significantly more attention. In Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405
U.S. 438 (1972), the Court addressed the contraceptive rights of unmarried per-
sons, and confronted the problem that Justice Douglas’s rationale for the confiden-
tiality of marital relationships was not as strong outside the marital context. Justice
Brennan held for the Court that “if the right of privacy means anything, it is the
right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted government
intrusion into matters so fundamental as the decision whether to bear or beget a
child.” In so doing, the Court transformed the constitutional right to privacy from
one rooted in the confidentiality of relationships from government scrutiny to an
individual liberty interest to make intimate decisions free from government inter-
ference. This decisional understanding of the constitutional right to privacy formed
the basis for Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). In Roe, the Court found the right to
privacy to include a right of abortion and located it in the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, thereby abandoning Justice Douglas’s penumbral concep-
tion of privacy. Subsequent cases, most notably Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992),
have confirmed the basic validity of the Court’s ruling that abortion rights are con-
stitutionally protected, although numerous challenges have addressed various
aspects of this right, prompted in large part by the enormous importance of the
abortion issue to the national political landscape. The right to decisional privacy in
fundamental decisions has been extended to other areas of the law with mixed
results for claimants, with subsequent cases involving the right to terminate life-
sustaining medical care (Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S.
261 (1990)), physician-assisted suicide (Washington et al. v. Glucksberg et al.,
521 U.S. 702 (1997)), parental rights to direct their children’s upbringing (Troxel v.
Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000)), and the right to private homosexual conduct (Bow-
ers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986); Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)).
Griswold v. Connecticut was arguably the most significant of a number of post-
Lochner Supreme Court decisions in which the Court was called upon to evaluate the
constitutionality of regulations of activities and decisions central to personal identity
and self-determination. It thus raised one of the central questions to any society in
which judges interpret a written Constitution: how to interpret a written text in light
of changed times and changed views of morality. As a general rule, liberals have
tended to applaud the Court’s willingness in Griswold to look beyond a narrow read-
ing of the text of the Constitution to find that the Due Process Clause protects a basic
and broad commitment to liberty and individual autonomy. In this regard, they have
echoed the arguments of justices Douglas and Goldberg. Conservatives, on the other
hand, have tended to argue that Griswold’s right to privacy is unmoored by any limit-
ing principle, and that unelected judges interpreting the right to privacy improperly
substitute their own elitist morality for the morality of the citizenry acting democrati-
cally through its elected representatives. In this regard, conservatives accuse liberals
of engaging in the same methodology of constitutional interpretation that was dis-
credited at the end of the Lochner era, in an echo of the arguments made by Justices
Black and Stewart in dissent.

\
To this extent, the actual rationale of the decision in Griswold has been somewhat
obscured by Roe v. Wade, as abortion politics have become one of the most important
divisions in American politics. This is unfortunate, because the issues raised by
Griswold are important enough to warrant more separate attention than they have
been accorded, both at the level of national politics and academic commentary.

Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145 (1947)
In this case, which involved a search incident to an arrest, the Supreme Court
affirmed the admissibility of evidence of one crime that was found by officers dur-
ing a proper, but warrantless, search for evidence of another unrelated crime. The
basis for the Court’s ruling was subsequently expanded by the courts as the test
required for the plain view doctrine.
George Harris was a suspect in the forgery of a $25,000 check drawn on an
Oklahoma oil company that was to be cashed in a New York bank. Two warrants
were issued for his arrest, and subsequently five Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) agents arrested him in the living room of his Oklahoma City apartment.
After the arrest, agents spent five hours searching the four-room apartment for evi-
dence of the forgery. 
Just before completing the search, one of the agents found a sealed envelope in a
bedroom dresser marked “George Harris, personal papers.” Inside that envelope
was a second sealed envelope in which the officer found 8 draft cards and 11 draft
registration certificates. Harris was subsequently convicted of unlawful possession,
concealment, and alteration of the Selective Service materials.
Harris attempted, unsuccessfully, to have the evidence found in his dresser sup-
pressed as the result of what his attorney argued was an unreasonable and unconstitu-
tional search. The Court rejected Harris’s arguments that officers could not search his
apartment, reasoning that searches incident to arrests were authorized to include “the
premises under his immediate control.” In this case (under now-antiquated Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence), the Court held, that included the entire apartment. Open-
ing and then searching the sealed envelopes were authorized because officers were
looking for canceled checks and related pieces of paper that easily could have been
hidden in the envelopes. The argument that the documents found had nothing to do
with the crime then being investigated also failed to convince the Court’s majority.
“In keeping the draft cards in his custody [Harris] was guilty of a serious and
continuing offense against the laws of the United States. A crime was thus being
committed in the very presence of the agents conducting the search. Nothing in
the decisions of this Court gives support to the suggestion that under such
\

\
circumstances the law-enforcement officials must impotently stand aside and
refrain from seizing such contraband material.” 
The ruling essentially followed earlier findings that generally related to discov-
eries by police in fields or private yards. In those instances, the courts relied on the
premise that citizens had no expectation of privacy for activities conducted in open
yards or fields. The Harris Court brought concepts from the earlier rulings indoors.
In Harris, the FBI agents were properly in the defendant’s home, the initial
search was deemed valid, and given the nature of the search, the draft cards were
discovered in plain view by an agent while he was searching for other papers.
Thus, the draft cards were subject to seizure without a warrant. The resulting
plain view doctrine thus became an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant
requirement that permits law enforcement officers to seize clearly incriminating
evidence or contraband when it is discovered in a place where the officers have a
legal right to be.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
Congress passed Public Law 104-191, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), to accomplish multiple purposes. Title II,
Subtitle F, Part C covers health care administrative simplification. A major purpose
of this part was to encourage development of a modern health information system
by establishing standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of cer-
tain health information.
The law required the secretary of Health and Human Services to use rulemaking
to implement four main objectives. The first objective was the establishment of
standards for financial and administrative transactions, as well as the data elements
for those transactions, to enable health information to be exchanged electronically.
The goals of this objective were to improve the health care system and reduce
administrative costs. The secretary published initial rules for eight “standard trans-
actions” (45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 162) in 2000, with a compliance date in 2002.

\
269
A second objective was the establishment of a standard unique health identifier
for each individual, employer, health plan, and health care provider. The secretary
adopted employer and provider identifier rules in 2002 and 2004. The national
health plan identifier was delayed administratively. Controversy about the individ-
ual identifier led to later congressional prohibitions against administrative action to
adopt an identifier.
A third objective was the establishment of standards for the security of elec-
tronic health information. The secretary published final standards in 2003, with a
compliance date in 2005. This final rule specifies a series of administrative, techni-
cal, and physical security procedures (45 C.F.R. Part 164) for covered entities to
use to ensure the confidentiality of electronic, protected health information.
The fourth objective was the establishment of national standards to protect the
privacy of personal health information. HIPAA directed the secretary to establish a
health privacy rule if the Congress was unable to enact a health privacy law within
three years of the date of enactment. Congress failed to act by the deadline, and in
2000, the secretary adopted a privacy rule (45 C.F.R. Part 164) with a compliance
date in 2003.
The law assigns the secretary the task of enforcing HIPAA standards through
administrative sanctions. The law includes criminal penalties for wrongful disclo-
sure of individually identifiable health information. The law did not provide for pri-
vate rights of action for aggrieved individuals. The Office of Civil Rights at the
Health and Human Services Department enforces the privacy rule.
The HIPAA standards generally do not preempt state privacy laws that provide
more stringent privacy protections. Thus, the federally established standards pro-
vide a floor of privacy and security protections that states can exceed. The privacy
and security rules apply to covered entities, which are health care providers that
conduct standard transactions in electronic form, health plans, and health-care
clearinghouses.

Health privacy

Health privacy
The privacy of health records has been a concern of physicians and patients
since the dawn of medicine. Developments in health care during the twentieth cen-
tury made health records more complete and more valuable to a wider range of
health care and other institutions. These developments have increased tensions
between privacy and other societal goals, including providing better quality care,
controlling costs, and preventing fraud and abuse. State laws on health privacy,
while often numerous, are often disjointed and variable, and may fail to reflect cur-
rent health care activities. Judicial decisions often recognize the need to balance
privacy against other interests. A federal health privacy rule adopted under the
authority of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA) established a national floor for privacy protection, forced the health care
industry to pay more attention to privacy, and prompted a review of some state
laws.
Confidentiality has historically been recognized as an important element of the
physician-patient relationship. In the fourth century B.C., the Hippocratic Oath
called on physicians to treat as “holy secret” patient information that “should not
be published abroad.” Notably, the oath does not prohibit all disclosures. Even at
the beginning, health professionals recognized that the obligation to keep patient
information private was not absolute. 
Later ethical codes for physicians reflected both the importance of confidential-
ity and the possibility that disclosure might be necessary. For example, the first
code of ethics of the American Medical Association, adopted in 1847, called on
physicians not to disclose information except when “imperatively required to do
so.”
Recognition of the importance of health privacy by the law dates back to 1828,
when New York state established the first physician-patient privilege to protect
confidential communications between physician and patient. This privilege is a
creature of statute and not of common law. The privilege is testimonial, so it
applies only in court or court-related proceedings. While the privilege has spread in
some form to all states, it is often limited in scope, unavailable, or simply irrelevant
to administrative disclosures that have become a routine part of health care. In
some states, for example, the privilege only applies to confidential communications
between patient and psychiatrist.
Tensions between privacy and other concerns grew stronger as the twentieth
century progressed as a result of developments in the health care system. The
growth of these tensions was not always reflected in the rhetoric about the tradi-
tional importance of privacy in the health care relationship. Privacy advocates and
politicians sometimes failed to recognize the enormous increases in the authorized
use and disclosure of patient information for activities far removed from treatment
and payment. Neither the public nor health professionals appeared to be fully
aware of either the expanded sharing of patient information or the routine mainte-
nance of patient information outside the treatment setting.
Early in the twentieth century, recorded patient health information was rare.
Over time, health records maintained by physicians and hospitals grew in size and
number. Health records now contain massive amounts of treatment information, as
well as information not related to treatment, including information about a patient’s

Health privacy

relatives, finances, education, and employment. The traditional maintenance of tis-
sue samples for research or reference has raised new privacy concerns because of
the ability to retrieve genetic information. 
Third-party payment for health treatment, including payments from both private
insurance and government plans, increased demands for the sharing of patient
information. Bills for treatment, along with supporting documentation, routinely
go to third-party payers. Employer-sponsored health insurance also increased the
likelihood that records of workers and their families would be shared with employ-
ers. Further, distinctions between treatment activities and payment activities began
to blur as pre-approval of treatment by insurers became a common prerequisite for
payment.
Pressures to contain health care costs and to provide higher-quality care
expanded the routine sharing of individually identifiable health records with new
institutions. Disease management programs, often sponsored by employers or
insurers, often resulted in more sharing of patient records.
Health fraud investigators, prosecutors, and both public and private sector audi-
tors routinely obtain access to patient records to prevent fraud and abuse. Accredi-
tation of health care facilities and professional licensing activities also have
increased demand for the disclosure of health records.
Many public health functions rely in whole or in part on access to identifiable
patient records. These functions include vital statistics reporting; communicable
disease, birth defects, and occupational injury reporting; public health surveil-
lance, investigations, and interventions; adverse event reporting for regulated drugs
and devices; occupational disease and workplace surveillance activities; and child
abuse, neglect, and domestic violence reporting.
Government activities such as health oversight, health planning functions, civil
rights law enforcement; and beneficiary eligibility determinations for public pro-
grams often require patient information. Research activities, including systematic
investigations to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, often rely on
access to patient records. The use of institutional review boards to screen research
protocols for ethical and privacy concerns became common by the end of the twen-
tieth century. Federal rules governing research involving human subjects apply to
federally funded research activities. These rules establish standards for institutional
review board membership and activities (Common Rule 45 C.F.R. Part 46).
Law enforcement agencies use health records for functions including routine
criminal investigations, health care fraud investigation, gunshot wound reporting,
and emergency response. The Secret Service requests patient information in con-
nection with protective activities for the president and other officials. National
security agencies also seek health information.
Health information is also of interest to marketers, who routinely traffic in infor-
mation reflecting the health conditions of individuals. Marketers usually obtain
health information from sources outside the treatment process. Private investigators
seek health records for use by insurance companies and others. Evidence suggests
that the demand has been sufficient to support surreptitious trafficking in patient
information.
In 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court considered health privacy issues arising from
the use of a state-operated database. In Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589 (1977), the

272
Health privacy
\
Court reviewed a state statute that required the reporting of prescriptions for dan-
gerous drugs to the health department. The Court found that the law was a reason-
able exercise of the state’s broad police powers and that the reporting requirement
had not violated any constitutional right of information privacy. However, the
Court did acknowledge the threat to privacy implicit in the accumulation of per-
sonal information in computerized data banks or other government files.
In Jaffe v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1 (1996), the Court adopted a psychotherapist
privilege as a newly recognized privilege in federal court. The privilege applies to
confidential communications made to psychiatrists, psychologists, and licensed
social workers in the course of psychotherapy. In United States v. Westinghouse
Electric Corp., 638 F.2d 570 (3d Cir. 1980), a federal appeals court decided a case
involving a federal agency subpoena to an employer for its employees’ health
records for use in an investigation of a workplace health hazard. The decision listed
factors to be considered in deciding whether an intrusion into an individual’s pri-
vacy is justified. The seven factors were (1) the type of record; (2) the information
it did or might contain; (3) the potential for harm in any subsequent nonconsensual
disclosure; (4) the injury from disclosure to the relationship in which the record
was generated; (5) the adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure;
(6) the degree of need for access; and (7) whether there was an express statutory
mandate, articulated public policy, or other recognizable public interest favoring
access. The importance of this decision is the identification of specific elements to
be considered in weighing a privacy interest. 
In Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, 17 Cal. 3d 424 (1976), the
California Supreme Court held a psychiatrist could be liable to a third party for fail-
ing to warn about a dangerous patient. State law is not uniform on the duty to warn.
Until 2003, when the federal government required implementation of health pri-
vacy rules under the authority of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil-
ity Act (HIPAA), legislative protections for the privacy of health records were
largely left to the states. The quality of state health privacy legislation has been
highly variable. Older approaches found in many state health privacy laws tend to
provide that health records are confidential, but offer little practical guidance about
what that means in an era when numerous institutions request or demand access to
records. Comprehensive state privacy statutes that reflect institutional and techno-
logical developments in the health care system have been relatively rare. Only a
few states adopted a model state law proposed by the National Conference of Com-
missioners on Uniform State Laws in the mid-1980s. 
Aside from broad statutes on health privacy, states tend to have dozens of sepa-
rate and uncoordinated laws addressing different aspects of the collection, mainte-
nance, use, or disclosure of patient information. Laws may cover records by type
(e.g., HIV/AIDS, mental health, genetics), by institution (e.g., hospitals, nursing
homes, mental health facilities, insurers), by health care provider (e.g., physicians,
pharmacists, optometrists), or otherwise (e.g., physician-patient privilege). Privacy
standards may vary considerably from law to law in the same state. In some states,
a single health record could be subject to privacy requirements under multiple state
and federal laws. In particular, many states have special laws addressing privacy
and other issues related to HIV/AIDS and to genetic information.

Prior to HIPAA, federal health privacy laws were limited in scope. The Privacy
Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. §552a) established comprehensive fair information prac-
tices for most personally identifiable records maintained by federal agencies,
including health records. Specific laws and a common set of regulations cover fed-
erally funded alcohol and drug abuse treatment records (see, for example, 42
U.S.C. §290dd-2 and 42 C.F.R. Part 2).
The biggest development in health privacy legislation was the enactment of
HIPAA. The resulting health privacy rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services forced the health care industry to pay active attention to pri-
vacy. The rule establishes a minimum national floor of privacy and security protec-
tions that reflect fair information practices for access, amendment, openness,
accountability, and use and disclosure limitation. Entities covered directly by the
rule are health care providers who bill for services using standard (electronic)
transactions, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. The rule covers pro-
tected health information, which includes individually identifiable health informa-
tion in the possession of covered entities.
Covered entities must require their contractors who perform a function involv-
ing the use or disclosure of protected health information to meet the rule’s stan-
dards through contracts. However, the HIPAA privacy rule does not apply to
secondary users of health records, such as researchers, law enforcement agencies,
auditors, and others. The net result is that many users of health information outside
immediate health treatment and payment circles are not subject to the HIPAA pri-
vacy rule or any other privacy law.
HIPAA does not preempt most state laws that provide more stringent privacy
protections. One consequence is that older state privacy laws that were sometimes
ignored have become the subject of new attention and compliance. Another conse-
quence is that state legislatures are reexamining their health information laws and
revising them to reflect the terminology and policy found in the HIPAA privacy
rule. Other federal privacy rules, such as the alcohol and drug abuse confidentiality
rules, also remain in effect. Health records maintained by schools subject to the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g) are
not subject to the HIPAA rule.
The HIPAA rule established substantive and procedural restrictions on the use
and disclosure of identifiable patient records. The rule allows for the use and dis-
closure of records for numerous broadly defined categories of activities, including
treatment, payment, health care operations, health oversight, public health, judicial
activities, law enforcement, research, and others. The rule also allows all uses and
disclosures required by law. For most uses and disclosures, patient consent is not
required. For the most part, HIPAA allows nearly all governmental and administra-
tive uses and disclosures that became routine during the twentieth century. A mini-
mum necessary rule applies to some uses and disclosures.
Critics have objected to the broad scope of permitted uses and disclosures
allowed by the rule, to the weakness of procedural prerequisites for some disclo-
sures, and to the lack of a general requirement for patient consent. The rule also
generated objections from communities of record users, such as researchers and
public health officials, who claimed that the new rule made their ability to obtain

274
Home
\
identifiable records more difficult and created disincentives to disclosures by
record keepers.
The HIPAA privacy rule also established a broad range of administrative
requirements for covered entities. These requirements include the preparation of a
notice of privacy practices, designation of a privacy official, training for workforce
members, safeguards for records, maintenance of disclosure history, and formal
policies and procedures. Covered entities must also grant patients access to their
records and limited rights to seek amendment of records. A separate HIPAA rule
establishes detailed standards for the security of electronic protected health infor-
mation.
Continuing challenges include fully implementing the federal privacy rule,
resolving the difficulties that arise when applying different privacy regulations in
different states or to different elements of a health record, and adapting privacy pol-
icies to an increasingly interstate, interconnected, and digital health information
system. In particular, privacy will present new problems in ongoing planning for
more widespread use of electronic health records and for a national information
network. Existing conflicts between privacy interests and other health objectives
are likely to increase, and new conflicts will arise with new implementations of
technology. In addition, concerns about the discriminatory use of health informa-
tion, particularly genetic information, will also be significant issues in the future.

Home
Celebration of the home as the place where we realize ourselves as loving,
responsible, and satisfied human beings has been a definitive theme in American
culture since the founding of the Republic. However, the currently prevailing con-
ception of the home, that is, as a stand-alone private dwelling owned and occupied
by a nuclear family, did not assume its central position in American consciousness

Home
\
275
until the decades immediately following the Civil War. During this period, urban-
ization, industrialization, and technological progress converged to fuel the popular
conviction that every family ought to possess, or at least strive to possess, a private
refuge from the complex pressures of the modern world. 
This widespread fixation on the home, now known as the cult of domesticity,
also developed in reaction to the burgeoning women’s movement, which, in the
eyes of its critics, threatened to erase the natural boundaries between public and
private life. Tracing the right to privacy back to its roots in the nineteenth century
accordingly reveals its anti-feminist heritage. Moreover, sketching the way ideas
about privacy evolved over time shows that the area usually conceived as the space
in need of protection has not been inhabited by separate individuals, but by a tradi-
tional family. Thus, historically, the right to privacy has been deeply entwined with
the popular idealization of the conventional family home.
No legislation that was expressly designed to protect the right to privacy passed
until after the turn of nineteenth century. However, courts recognized a man’s right
to suppress public disclosure of his domestic affairs in various rulings on house-
hold violence. In State v. Rhodes, 61 N.C. 453 (1868), Judge Edwin Godwin Reade
held that domestic violence, at least when it did not result in severe or lasting
injury, should be ignored by the law because the publicity attending prosecution
would undermine the authority that husbands are naturally expected to exert over
their wives. In Reade’s view, whatever ills might issue from wife-whipping and
other types of physical chastisement, paled in comparison with “the evils which
would result from raising the curtain, and exposing to public curiosity and criti-
cism, the nursery and the bed chamber.”
Similar concerns about shielding the home from public scrutiny animated Louis
Brandeis and Samuel Warren’s famous essay, “The Right to Privacy,” which was
published in the Harvard Law Review in 1890. Citing recent inventions such as
instantaneous photography, as well as the overly intrusive practices of the newspa-
per industry, Brandeis and Warren insisted that new protections had to be devised
to safeguard the “sacred precincts of domestic life.” In using such phrases, the
authors drew from the common understanding of the home as much more than a
building or physical space. Thus they observed that it was insufficient merely to
protect tangible property; instead, the intangible property associated with the
home, such as a man’s interactions with his family, personal conversations, and
peace of mind, also deserved to be secured from exposure. After all, Brandeis and
Warren wondered, how could the common-law adage that “every man’s house is
his castle” retain any meaning if a man could not guard his home against imperti-
nent prying, just as he had always had the right to defend it against physical tres-
pass?
The conservative views of privacy advocates like Brandeis and Warren drew
sharp criticism from contemporary radicals such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman. In
Women and Economics (1898), Gilman castigated the illogical assumptions made
by those who celebrated the privacy of the home. These fantasies, Gilman
observed, omitted the frequently resentful servants who witnessed the intimacies of
the rich, and they also failed to acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of
society lived in cramped common rooms in which family members could not
escape from each other. From Gilman’s perspective, the pleasant refuge that

276
Home
\
appeared under the banner of “Home, Sweet Home” was no more than an illusion,
especially for women. While the management of the household turned the home
into a “museum” for women who had money enough to hire servants, the endless
round of domestic chores reduced it to a “workshop” for those who did not. How-
ever, according to Gilman, what made the home most suffocating to women was
that wives were entirely dependent on their husbands and thus prevented from
exploring any significant aspect of the wider world. The home was, she acknowl-
edged, the birthplace of every worthwhile activity, but it was transformed into a
deadening prison for women because they were denied the freedom to engage in
any meaningful way in the larger society.
Gilman’s critique of the conventional home foreshadowed the efforts of 1970s
feminists to call attention to the darker aspects of domesticity. However, Brandeis
and Warren’s conception of the home as an inherently soul-sustaining retreat more
or less won the day in the twentieth century, thanks in large part to the advertising
industry. Elevating popular preoccupation with domestic life to new heights, adver-
tisements for appliances, furniture, and other must-have merchandise constantly
reinforced the nineteenth-century vision of the home as the place where individuals
find self-fulfillment. Indeed, if there was one message that middle-class Americans
heard more than any other during the past one hundred years, it was that the great-
est joys can be had within the properly furnished, smartly equipped, tastefully dec-
orated, fully secured, and well-stocked private home. 
Detailed advice on how to live out the American dream in the ideal home was
not dispensed exclusively by private industry. The government played an active
role, not only in convincing those who could to reject boarding houses and apart-
ments in favor of single-family dwellings, but also in educating homeowners on
how to position a house on a lot, decorate specific rooms, and landscape the prop-
erty to maximize family privacy. For example, in Better Homes for America, a typ-
ical government pamphlet issued in 1922, President Calvin Coolidge declared,
“There are two shrines at which mankind has always worshipped, must always
worship: the altar which represents religion, and the hearthstone which represents
the home.” In light of this age-old principle, it seemed to Coolidge that Americans
had already spent plenty of effort on public works, and that it was time to turn the
great energies of the country toward the construction and beautification of private
homes, dwellings that were solid and permanent, but modest enough to be afford-
able to all. 
Although Coolidge’s dream of a nation of homeowners has yet to be fully real-
ized, the home-building industry, dominated by huge mail-order companies such as
Aladdin, Sears Roebuck & Co., and Montgomery Ward sprang up to meet the ris-
ing demand for cheap, single-family houses during the first half of the twentieth
century. Aladdin, for instance, offered every man his own ready-made “castle” for
under $500 in 1909, and Sears delivered approximately 100,000 mail-order houses
all over the country between 1908 and 1940. In the aftermath of World War II, the
government touched off another round of massive development by financing the
building of millions of tract houses in suburban areas, setting the stage for subur-
ban sprawl in more recent years. The promise embodied in this frenzy of home
building was not simply that middle- and working-class Americans or, more specif-
ically, the majority of white families would own their own homes, but that the bulk

Home
\
277
of the population would have a chance to conform to the ideal of the ostensibly
normal family, with a male breadwinner at its head and a stay-at-home mother to
care for their children. This optimum arrangement represented much more than
mere prosperity. In fact, it was a way of life that was worth enormous sacrifice, as
exemplified by a widely circulated government poster issued in the 1940s featuring
a white family with two obviously loving parents and three wholesome children
seated at their kitchen table eating corn. “This is America!” the copy beneath the
image reads, “where the family is a sacred institution, where children love, honor
and respect their parents, where a man’s home is his castle. This is your America.
Keep it Free!” 
This idealized image of domesticity, which was reinforced by scores of televi-
sion shows and commercials throughout the 1950s and 1960s, came under heavy
fire from the women’s liberation movement of the 1970s. Railing against the popu-
lar vision of the home as the place where women naturally find fulfillment, femi-
nists pointed out that living in a man’s castle, having no recourse against sexual
coercion, no respite from housework and child care, limited access to education,
and little chance to earn an independent income was not conducive to happiness.
“The personal is political!” became a popular feminist refrain as increasing num-
bers of women argued that traditionally private matters such as rape and domestic
violence needed to be exposed to the public scrutiny that privacy defenders had
tried so hard to avoid. Along these lines, well-known feminists such as Betty Fre-
idan and Gloria Steinem argued that sexual inequality stemmed not only from the
active exclusion of women from the higher levels of business, academia, and gov-
ernment, but also from the dependency, boredom, and, in many cases, physical and
emotional pain they suffered within the home. 
In stark opposition to idealized conceptions of the domestic circle, many 1970s
feminists derided the life of the typical housewife as a brainless existence built on
sexual submission, vapid consumption, and deep-seated anxiety about meaningless
routines. Women’s rights activists declared, first in consciousness-raising groups
and then in public demonstrations, that sexual equality would not be achieved until
women enjoyed parity on both sides of the public/private dichotomy, not only
receiving equal pay for equal work, access to higher education, and unfettered
opportunity in every profession, but also casting off primary responsibility for
childrearing and other domestic cares. 
The women’s liberation movement has frequently been blamed for the subse-
quent disappearance of the stereotypical housewife, that is, a mother who did not
work outside the home. However, the deep recession of the mid- to late 1970s,
which was characterized by an unprecedented combination of high unemployment
and rising inflation, played a much larger role in destroying the ability of single-
income families to achieve home ownership. During this period, in a trend that has
continued ever since, millions of women moved into the paid workforce, not
because feminists urged them to do so, but because most families could no longer
expect to survive, let alone own their own homes, by relying on one income.
The notion of the home as a haven from the larger society may be unrealistic,
but it has profoundly influenced legal approaches to the right to privacy over the
last few decades. For example, in his frequently quoted dissent in Poe v. Ullman,
367 U.S. 497 (1961), Justice John Harlan Marshall maintained that the importance

278
Home
\
of the home as the center of family life was so profound that the grounds for its
protection flowed from a variety of constitutional rights. Drawing from Poe and
similar cases in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), the Supreme Court
held that choices made by married couples in respect to family planning are con-
tained within a zone of privacy into which the government should not intrude.
Echoing Brandeis and Warren’s sentimental phrases about the “sanctity of the
domestic circle,” William O. Douglas, who wrote the majority opinion, asserted,
“Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and
intimate to the degree of being sacred.” According to Douglas, the marriage bond
deserves special protections because it transcends other, apparently more mundane
concerns: “It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in
living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet
it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.”
The poetic sentiments expressed in Griswold presented feminists with a
dilemma: on one hand, the decision advanced the cause of reproductive freedom;
on the other, it did so by drawing the usual curtain around the nursery and the bed-
room, thereby reasserting the home as a place removed from and, in significant
ways, superior to larger social, economic, and political realities. This apolitical or
anti-political definition of domestic relations has bedeviled privacy theorists—
especially those committed to equal rights for women, gays and lesbians, and other
marginalized groups—ever since. Feminists and gay rights advocates have, for the
most part, supported the line of Supreme Court cases that built on Griswold
because these rulings explicitly extended the right to privacy to unmarried persons,
women, and homosexuals and, consequently, offered these groups protections that
had previously been denied to them. However, feminist scholars have also called
attention to the ways in which Griswold and similar decisions failed to address the
problematic aspects of privacy.
For example, in a series of landmark cases, including Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405
U.S. 438 (1972), Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), Planned Parenthood v. Casey,
505 U.S. 833 (1992), and Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), the Court reaf-
firmed, with important modifications, the right to privacy outlined in Griswold, but
it did so by casting a similarly gauzy light on the private sphere, evoking the home
as a seemingly problem-free zone in which issues of violence, abuse, poverty, and
inequality apparently impose no limits on the capacity of individuals to act upon
their existential desires. Thus, in Casey, in a passage that has since been ridiculed
by conservatives such as Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court upheld earlier rulings on
the sanctity of the home by observing, “At the heart of liberty is the right to define
one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of
human life.” The problem with these sentiments, from the standpoint of feminist
theory, is not that they are false, but that they set up the private sphere as the realm
in which we realize ourselves as human beings. However, as Charlotte Perkins Gil-
man asserted over a century ago, and as feminists have repeated since, self-realization
is simply not a private activity, regardless of the extent to which individuals might
benefit from the possession of rights to privacy. In short, many feminists argue,
even if the right to privacy has shaken off its anti-feminist heritage, it must be
acknowledged that democracy, at least as an organized system of government, can-
not be practiced in the privacy of people’s homes.

Hoover, J. Edgar (1895–1972)
J. Edgar Hoover was born on January 1, 1895, in Washington, D.C., the son of a
lowly civil servant employed in the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Hoover grew
up and lived his entire life in the nation’s capital. Forgoing a traditional college
education, he attended night school at George Washington University Law School
(working during the day at the Library of Congress), receiving an LLB in 1916 and
an LLM in 1917. Although he graduated shortly after Congress declared war on
Germany in World War I, Hoover did not serve in the military but instead, in July
1917, accepted a draft-deferred appointment in the alien registration section of the
Department of Justice. In 1918 he was appointed an assistant to the attorney gen-
eral and in 1919 headed the department’s recently created General Intelligence
Division, where he compiled dossiers on thousands of radical activists and played a
key role in planning and orchestrating the Palmer Raids of January 1920. Promoted
to assistant director of the Bureau of Investigation in 1921, Hoover was appointed
acting bureau director in May 1924, after Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone had
fired the current director, William Burns, an appointment made permanent in
December 1924. Hoover served as bureau director (renamed the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) in 1935) until his death on May 2, 1972.
Hoover’s appointment as bureau director in May 1924 occurred following a
series of highly controversial revelations that bureau agents and the bureau’s most
recent director had abused power during World War I and the early postwar years.
These included bureau monitoring of political and labor union activists and investi-
gating members of Congress who had played key roles in triggering a congres-
sional investigation into the Teapot Dome scandal, a scandal that involved senior
officials in the current Harding administration. As director, Hoover instituted a
series of reforms to improve the quality of bureau personnel and to preclude future

280
Hoover, J. Edgar (1895–1972)
\
abuses of power. In the process, he refurbished the bureau’s reputation and helped
forge a highly professional and respected law enforcement agency. Sensitive to pre-
vailing states’ rights fears, and to the adverse publicity and congressional inquiries
that had tarnished the early bureau, Hoover acted to project an image of the FBI
agent as an apolitical professional. Then, during the 1930s, he purposefully culti-
vated both the print media and Hollywood to convey the image of the so-called G-
man, the efficient professional who always got his man and respected the law and
the Constitution. 
None of this meant that Hoover had abandoned monitoring radical activists, as
exemplified by the central role he played in orchestrating the 1920 Palmer Raids.
Nor, given his personal moralistic views, was the judgmental director indifferent to
the sexual indiscretions of American citizens. Attuned to the moralistic politics of
the 1920s, as captured in the enforcement of the Prohibition Amendment and the
rise of religious fundamentalism, Hoover authorized the creation of a discrete
“obscene file” in March 1925 to ensure more successful prosecution of purveyors
of obscenity and pornography. Creation of this central file ensured a permanent
repository of salacious literature and the ability to engage the support of social con-
servatives. In a companion action, during the late 1930s Hoover himself led highly
publicized vice raids in Miami, Florida, to apprehend and prosecute prostitutes and
their customers, ostensibly because local police and civic officials protected houses
of prostitution. 
The combination of Hoover’s moralistic and anti-radical sentiments underlay his
leadership of the FBI and the attendant practice of collecting and maintaining files
recording the illicit sexual and political activities of American citizens and alien
residents. He devised sophisticated filing procedures to preclude discovery of FBI
practices such as the collection of noncriminal information, the resort to intrusive
but illegal investigative techniques, and the purposeful dissemination of derogatory
information to the media, members of Congress, and officials in the military and
the White House. Hoover thus created an agency that both promoted law enforce-
ment and engaged in political containment. These practices began informally but
were refined and expanded during the Cold War years. The FBI director was then
able to tap into concerns about ostensible security threats, such as subversion and
homosexuality, without any meaningful oversight. The culmination of these prac-
tices came in the 1950s, when Hoover launched a Mass Media program (1955) and,
then, in 1956 the first of five Counter Intelligence Programs (COINTELPRO),
whereby derogatory information about radical activists and suspected subversives
was publicly leaked to raise doubts about their loyalty and moral character. In the
authorization language of the formal COINTELPRO, the purpose was to “harass,
disrupt, and discredit.” In 1951, capturing the homophobia of the time, which
viewed homosexuals harshly and as vulnerable to blackmail, Hoover also launched
a formal Sex Deviate program to purge homosexuals from federal employment and
from influential posts in the private sector. The FBI director’s interest in illicit sex-
ual activities was not confined to homosexuals, but extended to heterosexual con-
duct. This has been indirectly confirmed by the massive files that he maintained in
his office about the sexual activities of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Senator and later President John F. Kennedy, various members of Congress, and
First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Some information was obtained through illegal wire-

Hoover, J. Edgar (1895–1972)
\
281
taps and bugs, while other information was gleaned from unverified rumors and
malicious gossip.
The FBI director was able to finesse any inquiry into his collection of and efforts
to act upon such personal information. On the one hand, by creating a secret office
file, Hoover could truthfully deny that the FBI maintained derogatory personal
information about prominent Americans in its central records system. Hoover also
had FBI officials compile summary memoranda (i.e., not files) detailing any infor-
mation that FBI agents had collected about the “immoral and subversive” activities
of members of Congress; these memoranda were also not maintained in the FBI’s
central records system but rather in the administrative unit.
During Hoover’s tenure as FBI director, many suspected that he collected per-
sonal and political information about political activists, including members of Con-
gress, and used this information to advance his own political objectives. Indeed,
during an interview in the late 1970s with Ovid Demaris, Emanuel Celler (the
former chair for 22 years and member for 40 years of the House Judiciary Commit-
tee) specifically attributed Hoover’s power to the fact that he was the head of an
agency that, in turn, had tremendous power, including the power of surveillance
and the power of information control, over the lives and destinies of everyone in the
nation. Hoover had a dossier on every member of the House and every member of
the Senate. Despite his powerful congressional position with the attendant ability to
subpoena FBI records and testimony, Celler never launched an investigation to
confirm his suspicions. Had he done so, Hoover could have truthfully denied that
the FBI compiled dossiers on members of Congress, since there were none in the
FBI’s central records system. Nor, in truth, given the FBI’s limited resources, could
the FBI affect the lives and destinies of everyone in the nation. Yet Hoover did not
need to exercise such powers; it sufficed that members of Congress, the public, and
the media believed that he could. Similarly, radical activists might not have sus-
pected that they were targets of specific FBI containment efforts. Hoover’s success
in immunizing FBI operations from public scrutiny had a chilling effect on public
debate while permitting FBI officials to violate privacy rights.
Hoover’s death in May 1972 predated congressional investigations, first in 1973
into the Watergate break-in and then in 1975 into the U.S. intelligence agencies
through the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities (known as the Church Committee). These
investigations shattered this wall of secrecy. Responding to these dramatic revela-
tions, Congress enacted the Privacy Act of 1974 and authored a series of amend-
ments to the 1966 Freedom of Information Act that permitted citizens to obtain
access to FBI records, with a resultant documentation of the scope of Hoover’s vio-
lation of privacy rights and of the methods he had employed to preclude discovery.
Hoover’s iconic status was shattered to the extent that he himself became the victim
of a salacious, best-selling biography written by Anthony Summers and published
in the 1990s. Without solid evidence, the book portrayed Hoover as a homosexual
and transvestite, and alleged that his sexual orientation had caused him to be black-
mailed into not prosecuting organized crime.

House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)
The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) was formed on May
26, 1938, and abolished in January 1975. The committee was created to investigate
disloyalty and “subversive activities.” Initially, HUAC’s investigations were
directed primarily at right-wing groups, including a number of pro-fascist organi-
zations and the Ku Klux Klan. However, these investigations were generally short
and perfunctory. Under the direction of Chairman Martin Dies, Jr., the committee
(informally known as the Dies Committee) quickly adopted an anti-Communist
agenda, investigating the infiltration of American institutions by Communists and
Soviet sympathizers. Ironically, the committee’s founding co-chair, Samuel Dick-
stein, would himself be named as a Soviet operative by the VENONA Project, a
top-secret effort to decode Soviet communications. 
Today, many consider the HUAC hearings to be the political equivalent of witch
hunts. However, HUAC played a crucial role in defining Congress’s power to
investigate the private associations and activities of American citizens. The com-
mittee developed a number of techniques that would later be adopted by Senator
Joseph McCarthy’s Government Operations Committee. Sweeping allegations
were made. Witnesses were pressured to reveal the names of former and current
associates, and those who refused were often charged with contempt. Being ques-
tioned as an “unfriendly witness” or being mentioned during HUAC hearings was
considered an indication of guilt. Even the mere association with suspect organiza-
tions was considered enough to prove one’s disloyalty, setting the standard for guilt
by association.
During the prewar years and the early years of World War II, HUAC’s activities
were focused on developing legislative policy and investigating the Communist
influence within labor unions and government programs. The first legislation pro-
posed by the committee was the Voorhis Act that was signed into law in 1940. The
act had two parts. First, it required groups representing foreign governments to be
registered with the U.S. attorney general’s office. Second, it required the registra-
tion of paramilitary groups and organizations that advocated the forcible overthrow
of the U.S. government. The Voorhis Act did not include criminal penalties for
membership in these organizations. 
The Voorhis Act was quickly followed by Alien and Registration Act of 1940
(generally referred to as the Smith Act), which was far more sweeping. Not only
did the Smith Act make it illegal to organize, join, or affiliate oneself with the
groups listed in the Voorhis Act, but it also broadened the definition of what was

House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)
\
283
considered subversive activity. Anything advocating the overthrow of the govern-
ment, or that presented the overthrow of the government as necessary or desirable,
was rendered criminal. Furthermore, those found printing, publishing, teaching, or
publicly displaying such material with the intent to overthrow the government
could receive a prison sentence of up to 20 years. Although critics argue that the
law violates the First Amendment, in cases such as Yates v. United States and Noto
v. United States, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld its constitutionality,
though it has advocated a more limited interpretation of the act.
Spurred by a number of sit-down strikes by automobile workers, Dies launched
investigations into organized labor beginning in 1938. Among the first organiza-
tions to be investigated by the committee were the newly formed Congress of
Industrial Organizations (CIO) and a number of its local chapters. The result of
these investigations was a shift in CIO policy so that unions could be expelled if
they were deemed to be “consistently directed toward the achievement of the pro-
gram purposes of the communist party” (CIO constitution, Article VI). Eleven
unions had been expelled from the CIO as “communist dominated” by 1950.
Among these unions was the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers
Union of America (UE), which represented every General Electric and Westing-
house plant in the United States.
HUAC began hearings in Chicago to investigate the Communist influence
within the steel workers union in 1939. Only two years prior, Chicago had been the
site of an unprovoked police attack on striking steel workers that had resulted in 10
strikers being killed and another 90 injured. HUAC placed the blame for such acts
of violence on Communists, who were undermining union goals. However,
HUAC’s claims of Communist influence were so sweeping that they acted more as
an ideological attack against organized labor than a practical attempt to excise rad-
ical revolutionaries from the union ranks.
During this period, HUAC also held a number of investigations into Communist
infiltration of government agencies. One of the earliest hearings involved the Fed-
eral Theater Project (FTP), a program started by President Franklin D. Roosevelt
during the Great Depression to employ out-of-work theater workers. Among those
that were brought before the committee as unfriendly witnesses was Project Direc-
tor Hallie Flanagan. Committee members implied Flanagan had Communist lean-
ings, citing her support for controversial theatrical productions and her tour of
Russian theaters while studying in Europe during the 1920s. It was also during this
hearing that one HUAC member embarrassed himself by asking Flanagan if the
Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe had been a member of the Commu-
nist Party. The HUAC hearings on the FTP would ultimately lead to that program
being shut down in 1939.
Perhaps the pinnacle of HUAC investigations into government agencies was
the case of Alger Hiss. In 1948, President Truman publicly called HUAC’s
attempts to weed out Communists a “red herring.” HUAC used its investigation
of Alger Hiss, at the time a high-level State Department employee, to reaffirm its
place within American politics. Hiss was convicted of perjury and was perceived
to be a Soviet agent, although that would never be proven. The hearings also
made HUAC committee member Richard Nixon a major political player on the
national scene.

\
In the late 1940s, HUAC shifted its attention to Hollywood. The committee
believed the film industry had a unique capacity to shape public discourse and that
it was heavily infiltrated by Communists and Soviet sympathizers. For nearly a
decade, HUAC subpoenaed members of the film industry—both as friendly and
unfriendly witnesses—and demanded they disclose whether they were members of
the Communist Party and name any acquaintances who were Party members.
Among the most famous witnesses were a group of filmmakers and screenwriters,
dubbed the Hollywood Ten, who refused to answer questions regarding their union
and political affiliations. They argued that the committee’s questions violated pri-
vacy-related constitutional principles, including those regarding the secret ballot
and freedom of association. The Hollywood Ten were cited for contempt of court
and sentenced to one year in prison. The Supreme Court refused to hear their
appeal.
The hearings resulted in the creation of the Hollywood blacklist, an effort spear-
headed by such cinematic luminaries as John Wayne and Ronald Reagan. The
blacklist denied those believed to be Communists or Communist sympathizers
from working in Hollywood or being members of one of the industry’s labor
guilds. Thousands of producers, directors, actors, screenwriters, and technical
workers were blacklisted, including the Hollywood Ten. While some were able to
continue their careers in the theater, or continue working using non-blacklisted col-
leagues as cover, many struggled to piece shattered lives back together. The black-
list remained in place until 1956, when actor/producer Kirk Douglas gave the
screenwriting credit for his film Spartacus to Dalton Trumbo, one of the Holly-
wood Ten.
By the 1960s, the committee had shifted its focus from Hollywood to the new
wave of social activist movements. Among the groups investigated was the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which pushed for the use of federal
intervention in support of the civil rights movement. Representative William
Colmer of Mississippi asserted that SNCC was “aiding the Communists to enslave
the world” (HR 738, 89th Cong., 2nd Sess.). Portrayals of the group in mainstream
media contradicted this claim, showing SNCC’s public disdain for Marxist-
Leninism, or for any other organized ideology. Instead, SNCC’s efforts to involve
the federal government in support of civil rights appear to have been the more prac-
tical reason for the HUAC investigation. Several HUAC committee members,
including William Tuck and Edwin Willis, actively resisted federal intervention,
including efforts to enforce Brown v. Topeka Board of Education. Members of
SNCC who were called before the committee invoked the Fifth Amendment.
Other HUAC investigations during this time focused on public school teachers
in San Francisco, anti-war protesters in Berkeley, members of the Progressive
Labor Party, and even working mothers in California and Ohio. These investiga-
tions were increasingly viewed as publicity stunts by the general public, and were
heavily criticized by the media for prying into the private political beliefs and asso-
ciations of witnesses. The public perception of HUAC was further eroded as wit-
nesses made a mockery of hearings; for example, social activist Abbie Hoffman
appeared before the committee wearing a clown suit. The committee was renamed
the Internal Security Committee in 1969 in an attempt to reinvent itself. The com-
mittee’s influence continued to wane, and it was abolished in the beginning of

Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984)
\
285
1975. While often viewed as a dark part of American history, HUAC served as a
flashpoint in the debate on privacy, national security, political freedom, and free-
dom of association.

Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984)
The Supreme Court first addressed whether the Fourth Amendment applies to
searches of prison cells in its 1984 decision Hudson v. Palmer. Palmer, a prisoner
in a Virginia state correctional institution, underwent a “shakedown search” of
his cell. Correctional officers regularly conduct shakedowns to look for contraband,
especially drugs, homemade alcohol, and “shanks,” or homemade weapons. In
Palmer’s case, officers found a ripped pillowcase, which was considered contra-
band. Although possessing a ripped pillowcase is far less serious than possessing
a weapon, officers search for and confiscate such items because prisoners are not
permitted to keep more than a certain number of towels and clothing items in
their cells at any one time. They are also not permitted to alter state property.
These rules are designed to keep inmates from using extra or altered items to
facilitate escape attempts or make homemade alcohol and weapons. The rules
also help institutions maintain an adequate inventory of clothing, bed sheets, and
towels.
Palmer was charged with destroying state property and ordered to reimburse the
state. He filed a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983, claiming that Officer
Hudson had conducted the search in order to harass him, thereby violating his
Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches. He also alleged Hud-
son violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause because he inten-
tionally destroyed the pillowcase during the cell search, thereby depriving Palmer
of property he had a right to possess. The trial court granted Hudson’s motion for
summary judgment, agreeing with the officer that Palmer had no case. The court of
appeals, however, reversed on the issue of whether Palmer’s Fourth Amendment
rights had been violated. The appellate court ruled that inmates have a limited right
to privacy in their cells and should be protected against searches conducted solely
to harass or humiliate them.
In Hudson’s appeal to the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the search of
Palmer’s cell violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable
search. In an important decision that has had a significant impact on the rights of
prisoners, the Court ruled the Fourth Amendment does not apply to cell searches
because prisoners do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their cells.
The Fourth Amendment only protects places and things in which a person has a
reasonable expectation of privacy. The Court found that privacy is incompatible

286

\
with the need to maintain prison security and surveillance. The Court noted, how-
ever, that its decision does not give officials the right to destroy inmates’ property
or use cell searches to harass prisoners.
The Hudson v. Palmer case allows officials to conduct cell searches with few
restrictions. Officials can conduct a cell search without probable cause, reasonable
suspicion, or even a hunch that an inmate possesses contraband. In fact, officials
conduct shakedowns on a routine basis and are not required to give prisoners prior
notice or seek consent. Cell searches can be quite extensive, with officials opening
up and emptying closed containers, shifting mattresses around, and rifling through
a prisoner’s personal papers, books, and magazines. Officials are not required to
conduct a cell search with the prisoner present.
Cell searches are often flashpoints between inmates and officials. A cell is an
inmate’s home and the most personal space he or she has inside a correctional
institution. A cell is where an inmate keeps family photos and letters, legal papers,
and food purchased from the commissary. A prisoner might have been permitted to
have a typewriter, radio, hotplate, or television in the cell, and all of these would be
subject to search. A cell search is not always a gentle and orderly event, and an
inmate’s cell can be left in some mess after it is over. Officers can be rough with
an inmate’s belongings during the search. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has
made it almost impossible for a prisoner to challenge a cell search. Unless an
inmate can establish that the search was intentionally conducted to harass him or
her—evidence can be difficult to collect—the search is not restricted by the
requirements of the Fourth Amendment.

Human subjects protections
Human subjects protections in biomedical and social research intersect with pri-
vacy issues in three areas: the conflict between informed consent procedures and
confidentiality assurances; legal issues pertaining to the researcher and the privacy
of research data; and the public or private provenance of research data funded by
governmental agencies. The first issue concerns the privacy of the research respon-
dent’s life, and the second and third concern the privacy of the researcher’s data.
Human subjects protections refer to standards and procedures set in place to
ensure that unnecessary harm is not inflicted on research subjects (the harms/benefits
ratio); that their participation is confidential; and that they are informed of, and con-
senting to, the research. These protections are in place at every level of research, from

federal funding agencies to university departments and classrooms, and pertain to
both funded and unfunded research. Additional protections are added when research
subjects are not fully consenting adults: those under 18, pregnant, incarcerated crimi-
nals or patients, the elderly, or the developmentally disabled.
Over time, human subjects protections have expanded from biomedical to social
science research, and—within the social sciences—from experimental studies to
interviews, ethnographic applications, surveys, and even historical research. The
origins of public concern with the protection of human subjects can be found in
various forms of biomedical experimentation that took place in the twentieth cen-
tury, most notably those occurring in Hitler’s Germany and in the Tuskegee Insti-
tute’s 1932–1972 syphilis study in the United States. In both these instances, and in
many others all around the world, people were subjected to physically harmful—
even fatal—biomedical experimentation without their knowledge or consent.
Today, if biomedical research might harm research subjects, the subjects must be
informed of and consent to such harm; furthermore, any harm to individuals must
be counterbalanced by benefits to other individuals or to the community.
In social science research, harm is not physical but may be psychological or social:
emotional disturbance as a consequence of the conduct of the research, or violations of
privacy that occur as a result of the dissemination of research data or publication.
Emotional harm is most likely in two kinds of research situations: interviews on dis-
turbing topics and deceptive research, in which the subject is left feeling duped or stu-
pid. Deceptive research as a problem in human subjects protections came into focus in
the early 1970s with the publication of Laud Humphreys’s book Tearoom Trade. In
this book, Humphreys violated his respondents’ privacy in two ways: he observed
their sexual acts in public restrooms, and he posed as an interviewer on a different
topic to get marital and other information from them. Although deceptive research is
permissible under some circumstances, today these circumstances are very limited.
Violations of respondents’ privacy may lead to emotional harm if any such vio-
lation has consequences such as legal action or stigmatization—this is particularly
problematic if the research is on sensitive subjects such as sexual behavior, crimi-
nal activity, or illegal drug use. Human subjects protections have, however, been
extended into areas of research that are not as sensitive, for example ethnographic
research on public behavior, on the grounds that all forms of experimentation or
observation are violations of privacy.
Ironically, privacy protections may come into conflict with another standard of
research protection: the requirement for informed consent. Informed consent pro-
cedures involve a considerable amount of written, signed, and stored documenta-
tion that, by its very existence, can threaten respondents’ privacy and possibly
produce negative consequences. Respondents have been known to refuse to partici-
pate in research where they have to sign their names to consent documents, seeing
the signing of the documents as a violation of their privacy.
The second area in which privacy is at issue in social science research is that of the
legal status of research data, especially data derived from interview or field research.
Protected by the First Amendment, a journalist may interview anyone she/he chooses
to, use the interviewee’s name in a subsequent article, and make stigmatizing assess-
ments of the interviewee—so long as these assessments are “the truth.” An ethnogra-
pher studying the same setting in the same city is not protected by the First

288
Human subjects protections
\
Amendment and so would have to seek permission and informed consent from the
respondent, and give assurances of confidentiality (anonymity may be promised in
survey research, but in interview or field research the respondent is not anonymous).
Both the journalist’s notes and the ethnographer’s field notes may be subpoenaed, but
there is no privacy protection in law for the ethnographer’s information. 
The Brajuha, Scarce, and Leo legal cases in the 1980s and 1990s involved
attempts to subpoena sociology graduate students’ field notes—concerning,
respectively, a restaurant that had burned down, a radical environmental group, and
police interrogation rooms. While Leo did turn over his field notes to authorities,
thus violating his promises of confidentiality to those contacted and their right to
privacy, both Brajuha and Scarce refused. In the Brajuha case, the subpoena
demands were dropped, but Scarce spent 159 days in jail. 
The third issue in the relationship between privacy and research is the public
versus private nature of the data gathered by publicly funded research, and thus its
availability to researchers other than the principal investigator. Although unfunded
research data, such as field notes, may be subpoenaed, other researchers have no
legal right to them. In contrast, research that is publicly funded is, in theory, the
property of the public rather than of the private citizen or agency that conducted the
research. There is a “gentle agreement” in place that the researcher may “own” the
data for a year to analyze and write it up, but after that it will be made available
upon request. But in practice, and especially with qualitative research that cannot
promise absolute anonymity, the issue of informed consent has been used by gov-
ernmental agencies to restrict other researchers’ access to data. Even data gathered
with careful informed consent procedures in place have been denied to researchers
because they might be parsed for private information about respondents.
The essence of research with human subjects is the tension between the respondents’
privacy and the public’s right to knowledge; journalism is subject to the same tension,
but with a different, First Amendment set of resolutions. In the case of research, there is
also the question of the researcher’s data as public or private with respect to the law, and
as public or private property in relation to public funding. Human subjects guidelines
have expanded and have been challenged over the past half century, and a continuation
of developments and challenges can continue to be expected.

Identity fraud
There are several varieties of identity fraud, including application fraud and
account takeover. Application fraud occurs when a thief obtains new credit cards
and loans in another person’s name. The imposter might also open telephone and
electrical utility accounts, rent an apartment, get a mobile phone, or buy a car or
home. Victims are not likely to notice application fraud for many months because
the thief uses a different address for the monthly account statements. Victims usu-
ally find out when they apply for credit cards or a loan and are rejected because
they have a low credit rating—the result of the imposter’s unpaid bills and past-
due accounts. This type of fraud is sometimes called new account fraud or true
name fraud.
Account takeover occurs when the thief obtains the account number of the vic-
tim’s existing credit or bank account. The thief might steal the victim’s wallet con-
taining credit cards or find credit transaction slips in trash containers. A thief who
knows how to hack into a business’s computer system can obtain credit account
numbers over the Internet. Dishonest employees have been known to copy the
data from the magnetic strip of a customer’s credit card onto a handheld device
called a skimmer and later download the account number and expiration date to a
computer. The thief can use the account information for Internet shopping and can
also create counterfeit credit cards with the data. This type of fraud is also known
as existing account fraud. It is usually discovered when the victim notices charges
on the monthly bill and reports them to the credit card company.
Criminal identity theft occurs when the imposter is arrested for a crime and pro-
vides the victim’s name to law enforcement. For nonviolent crimes like traffic vio-
lations and shoplifting the individual is usually released and told to appear in court
later. Then, when the imposter fails to appear for the court hearing, the judge issues
a warrant for the arrest of the innocent person. It is often difficult for the victim to
prove that he or she is not the person who committed the crime. In the workplace,
employment identity theft is perpetrated when the imposter assumes the name and/
or Social Security number (SSN) of another person. This usually involves undoc-
umented immigrants or individuals who want to hide a criminal record.

Identity fraud
\
Millions of individuals are victims of account takeover and application fraud
each year. A 2003 survey by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that over
10 million individuals were victims in the previous year. A follow-up to that survey
was published in 2006 by Javelin Strategy and Research and the Better Business
Bureau. It found that nearly 9 million individuals in the United States were victims
in the prior 12 months. Approximately two-thirds of victims in both surveys expe-
rienced account takeover, while one-third were victims of new account fraud. The
FTC survey estimates that nearly 5 percent of American adults, or 1 in 20, discov-
ered they were a victim of identity fraud in the past five years. 
Over half of all victims do not know how the imposter was able to obtain their
personal information in order to impersonate them. But of those who know the
identity of the perpetrator (36 percent of the Javelin study’s sample), half of the
perpetrators were relatives, friends, neighbors, or in-home employees or were oth-
erwise closely associated with the victim. The Javelin survey estimates that the loss
to businesses was $56.6 billion in 2006. The average cost per fraud victim was
$6,383, although federal law protects victims from having to pay the imposter’s
bills. 
Statistics do not adequately describe the impact of identity fraud on its victims.
Even though each case is different, the experiences of victims are similar. Victims
typically must invest a great deal of time to regain their financial health. Many
must take time off from work to make the necessary phone calls, write letters,
report to law enforcement, and follow up with the credit-reporting bureaus and
credit issuers. Some situations require victims to hire an attorney. Many victims
report they do not get effective help from the credit grantors, banks, and credit
bureaus. They describe difficulty in reaching the credit-reporting agencies and may
be treated disbelievingly by some creditors. Victims must also deal with collection
agencies, and many report being treated abusively by debt collectors. Victims may
be threatened with lawsuits, garnishing of wages, and having their homes repos-
sessed. 
Identity fraud has increased in recent years for several reasons. It is easy for
criminals to obtain the information needed to impersonate others in the financial
marketplace. Financial companies have adopted the SSN as the key customer iden-
tifier. All the imposter needs is an individual’s name and SSN in order to fill out an
application for credit. Finding the individual’s date of birth is not difficult because
of free resources on the Internet. The imposter usually fabricates the other data ele-
ments on the application form. Identity thieves use a number of ploys to obtain
SSNs and other identifying information. They steal wallets, which often contain
Social Security cards or other documents with the SSN in them. Thieves also steal
mail in search of documents that contain financial account numbers and Social
Security numbers. They sift through the trash outside of businesses and residences
to find documents containing personally identifiable information. Fraudsters also
employ phishing to get financial account numbers and SSNs directly from unsus-
pecting individuals. They obtain the e-mail addresses of millions of individuals and
send messages that purport to be from the consumer’s bank or credit card company. 
The practices of credit issuers also facilitate identity fraud. Many retailers invite
their customers to apply for credit on the spot, often offering them a significant dis-
count on the items they have just purchased as an incentive. Within minutes, the

Identity fraud
\
291
merchant is able to check the applicant’s credit score and extend credit to the shop-
per. Such opportunities do not entail exhaustive authentication procedures, making
instant credit one of the more popular strategies for identity thieves. 
Another reason identity fraud has skyrocketed is that most law enforcement
agencies do not have adequate staff and resources to investigate the crimes and
apprehend the criminals. Not only are such investigations highly labor-intensive
and time-consuming, but most cases involve multiple jurisdictions. Local law
enforcement agencies are traditionally bound to their own city or county, even
though a typical identity fraud case can extend to numerous cities, counties, and
even states. As a result, identity thieves are rarely apprehended and sentenced. If
they are, penalties are minimal and may include only brief prison sentences com-
pared with those for violent crimes. 
In recent years Congress and many state legislatures have strengthened the pen-
alties for identity fraud. According to the FTC, in the past decade all of the states
have adopted laws that criminalize identity fraud. In 1998 Congress passed the
Identity Fraud and Assumption Deterrence Act, which makes it a federal felony to
knowingly use the identification of another person with the intention to commit an
activity that violates federal or state law. The law also established an identity fraud
clearinghouse within the FTC. 
The 2003 amendments to the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act include several
provisions that address victim assistance and credit industry practices. The Fair and
Accurate Credit Transactions Act, or FACTA, gives consumers nationwide annual
access to their credit reports at no charge. In 2003, California enacted a law requir-
ing that individuals be notified when a data breach has occurred involving sensitive
personal information—specifically, SSNs, driver’s license numbers, or financial
account numbers. In the years since then nearly half of the states have adopted sim-
ilar legislation. California was also the first state to adopt a law enabling individu-
als to place a security freeze on their credit reports. Considered by victims’
advocates to be the most effective form of protection, a credit freeze prevents credit
granters from accessing individuals’ credit reports. Creditors typically check the
credit reports of applicants before extending credit to the individual. When an indi-
vidual establishes a security freeze, the creditor is unable to check the credit report
and rejects the imposter’s application. A dozen states have followed California’s
lead in enacting security freeze laws.
In 2005 Congress considered nearly a dozen bills addressing identity fraud, data
security, and Social Security number restrictions. With names like Identity Theft
Protection Act and Personal Data Privacy and Security Act, the bills would extend
many of the provisions adopted by state legislatures to the entire nation. While
there are obvious benefits to expanding identity fraud protection to consumers
nationwide, many privacy advocates are critical of the preemption clauses in those
bills because they would in effect strike down state laws that are stronger than leg-
islation enacted by Congress. By the end of the 2005 legislative year, Congress had
not adopted any identity theft–related bills, although more activity was expected
for 2006.

Industrial espionage
Industrial espionage refers to the clandestine acquisition of desirable business
practices and/or technology by one company from another. By contrast, economic
espionage refers to the clandestine acquisition of desirable business or government
practices and/or technology by a foreign government or a company with the assis-
tance of a foreign government. These definitions assume a clear separation
between business and government, which is not always the case. Different coun-
tries at different times have been in “learning roles” instead of “innovating roles”;
in other words, some nations’ economies are copying or “learning” industry orga-
nization and production techniques. The United States was once in a learning role,
learning about industry organization from England. A more recent example is the
so-called East Asian Tigers (a term referring to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore,
and South Korea) learning from industrialized nations to facilitate the emergence
of their late industrial period. This example, however, is neither industrial espio-
nage nor economic espionage. Espionage must be a direct instance of a company
having some specific item, process, idea, project, or technology actually copied for
the benefit of some other company or companies. 
The U.S. Congress has become interested in this type of economic interaction
and has passed the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA). This legislation gives
the United States the explicit ability to prosecute specific acts of espionage both
foreign and domestic. It is meant to provide more tools for the defense of an
increasingly globalized information network. It was advocated by both the U.S.
government and industry leaders. The legislation defines economic espionage with-
out the distinction mentioned above. Instead, all acts of theft are considered eco-
nomic espionage. This legislation has already been used to prosecute individuals
and groups. The Avery Dennison adhesive technology case is an example. Avery
Dennison is a major producer of adhesive products such as stamps and diapers. In
1999, Pin Yen Yang and his daughter were found guilty of paying an Avery Denni-
son employee, Dr. Ten Hong Lee, to provide them with secret procedures and pro-
duction methods. Pin Yen Yang was the president of a Taiwanese company that
could make direct use of the technology and production techniques.
The EEA is an illustration of a global trend of states to define economic interests
as issues of national security. Strangely, this has increased, not decreased, with the
end of the Cold War. Intellectual property rights have become more important as
the United States has assumed the role of sole superpower; it has become the vic-
tim, in some ways, of its own success. Its products (pharmaceuticals, for example)
are the main target and model for many other nations and foreign corporations. It is
struggling, then, to tighten security on its own copyrights. Direct industrial espio-
nage is one way in which these breaches of copyright are occurring. 

Inevitable discovery
\
293
Industrial espionage includes attempts to steal any business, financial, eco-
nomic, scientific, technical, or engineering information. These categories include
patterns, plans, designs, compilations, program devices, formulas, prototypes,
methods, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangi-
ble. It does not matter how the information is stored, be it memorized, copied, pho-
tographed, or transmitted. The most prosecutable type of industrial espionage is a
direct copying of material by an individual or several individuals. Recent prosecu-
tions have involved the hiring of spies in companies or paying off employees of a
company for spying activities. 
Technology and science have also drastically changed both the perception and
implementation of industrial espionage with the advent of the Internet. Financial
records, prototypes, processes, plans, and so on are increasingly integrated into
computer networks. As a result, increased pressure to tighten security has been
placed on developed economies and corporations. It is likely that keeping up with
network security (which includes surveillance of those who have access to net-
works) will continue to increase in importance as the globalized business networks
continue to integrate technologically.

Inevitable discovery 
The inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to evidentiary rules requiring
that evidence be suppressed because it was obtained improperly. If the evidence
obtained in violation of one’s constitutional rights would have eventually been dis-
covered despite the constitutional violation, it will be admitted in court.
The U.S. Supreme Court created the doctrine requiring courts to suppress evi-
dence as the tainted “fruit” of unlawful governmental conduct in its ruling in Sil-
verthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385 (1920). In that case, the Court
ruled that not only should the illegally obtained evidence be suppressed, but that
other incriminating evidence derived from the primary evidence (the “poisonous
tree”) should be suppressed as well. The Silverthorne Court, however, limited its
holding, advising that the subsequently discovered evidence does not automatically
become “sacred and inaccessible.” The Court directed, “If knowledge of [such
facts] is gained from an independent source, they may be proved like any others.” 
In Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963), the Court reaffirmed and
extended the exclusionary rule to evidence that was the indirect product or “fruit”
of unlawful police conduct. Once again, however, it emphasized that illegally
obtained evidence need not always be suppressed, stating, “We need not hold that
all evidence is ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ simply because it would not have come
to light but for the illegal actions of the police. Rather, the more apt question in
such a case is ‘whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evi-
dence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that

294
Informational privacy
\
illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the pri-
mary taint.’” 
While both these cases involved search and seizure violations of the Fourth
Amendment, the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine has extended to the viola-
tions of the right to attorney guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, (see, e.g., United
States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967)), as well as to violations of the protections
against self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment (see, e.g., Murphy v. Waterfront
Comm’n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 79 (1964)). 
The foundation for the exclusionary rule is that the “drastic and socially costly
course” is needed to deter the government from trampling on the constitutional
and statutory protections of its citizens. In adopting the rule, the Supreme Court
has held that the way to ensure those protections is to exclude evidence even when
it means that obviously guilty persons will go unpunished for their crimes. In
short, prosecutors are not to be allowed to take advantage of the government’s ille-
gal conduct.
The inevitable discovery doctrine is intended to guarantee that law enforcement
and prosecutors are not put in a worse position simply because of some earlier error
or misconduct. Thus, the Supreme Court has held that if the government can estab-
lish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information or evidence ultimately
or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, then the exclusion of
that evidence will have no deterrent value, and the evidence should be admitted. As
the Court noted in Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984), “Exclusion of physical
evidence that would inevitably have been discovered adds nothing to either the
integrity or fairness of a criminal trial. . . . Fairness can be assured by placing the
State and the accused in the same positions they would have been in had the imper-
missible conduct not taken place.”

numbers, bank account information, and addresses, but also where they work and
how much they earn. This type of information is the kind of data that identity
thieves, telemarketers, researchers, and countless others would like to get their
hands on. This information is maintained in government databases and is secured
from release to the general public. The Freedom of Information Act allows for
such data to be shared by other agencies within the government so long as the indi-
vidual is protected.
This information sharing is no different from a commercial bank sharing certain
customer or account information with other divisions within its holding company.
Similarly, when financial institutions hire third-party contractors, they must take
special steps to maintain the privacy and security of their customers’ financial
information. The IRS is no different. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 cre-
ated Section 6206 of the IRS Code, allowing the IRS to use private companies as
contractors to assist in collecting the estimated $12 billion in unpaid taxes owed to
the U.S. government. This collection agency outsourcing is a cheap and efficient
way for the government to collect unpaid taxes, as these contractors would keep
only 25 percent of the revenues they collect. However, these contractors would also
be privy to the records of the individuals who owe taxes. This is one additional
security layer that must be maintained in order to protect information concerning
the public.
The Internal Revenue Code, the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act protect the rights and the privacy of taxpayers. Under the Federal Infor-
mation Security Management Act, federal government agencies are required to
prepare annual reports about their security procedures to the Tax Administration.
The Internal Revenue Service also performs evaluations, called Privacy Impact
Assessments, on computer systems and software applications to identify any holes
in the system that could leak personally identifiable information to outside
sources.
The Internal Revenue Service and other agencies maintain the privacy of indi-
vidual taxpayer information and protect this information from release to the public.
These organizations, however, have the right to analyze taxpayer data in aggregate
for the purpose of decisionmaking. By evaluating an entire population of taxpayer
data, the Internal Revenue Service can draw conclusions and create reports on
trends and statistical analysis. These reports never reveal any specific information
pertaining to an individual taxpayer and thus maintain an individual’s privacy. Only
government employees who are held to the same data security standards used to
protect individual data would perform these analyses.
The Internal Revenue Service may disclose individual taxpayer data from their
data systems only with the written consent of the taxpayer in question. The excep-
tions to this rule are many; they focus mainly on providing such data to government
agencies outside the scope of the Internal Revenue Service. The United States
Census Bureau, for example, may access individual data strictly for the purpose of
planning and performing statistical analysis with data from other agencies as
allowed by Title 13. Individual taxpayer data may be provided to an individual as
long as adequate written assurance is provided that these records will not be
released and will be used strictly for statistical purposes with results that do not
lead back to any single individual. If such a release of individually identifiable data

296
Internal Security Act of 1950
\
should occur, then the person who had received the data from the Internal Reve-
nue Service would be subject to fines and possible imprisonment. Data on an
individual may also be provided, without consent, to law enforcement agencies
for prosecuting criminal and civil activities so long as the director of the law
enforcement agency makes assurances that the data will not be released to the
general public.
Any instance in which the Internal Revenue Service releases individual data is
logged in a central database by the IRS along with the date, nature, and purpose of
disclosure to any person or agency for each record. These transcriptions are main-
tained for a period of not less than five years. This database is designed to assist in
the determination of whether individual information has been released and who
would be held responsible in the event of a leak.
Once an individual prepares his or her tax return and sends it to the local IRS
processing center, there is the expectation that this information remains private.
However, the U.S. government is able to use the information provided on the tax
return in many ways. Most commonly, the data are aggregated to assist U.S. gov-
ernment agencies in making better decisions in all areas of the government.

Internal Security Act of 1950
The Internal Security Act was passed in 1950 during the height of anti-Communist
hysteria in the United States. The act was aimed at furthering a conservative anti-
Communist agenda that sought to eliminate Communist influence in American pol-
itics and society through coercion. The act is widely regarded by scholars as one of
the most egregious attacks on the freedoms of speech and association in American
history. Not only was it an attempt to criminalize a particular ideology, but also an
assault on private associations that involved no actual criminal activity. The act
remained on the books until 1990, and many of its provisions were reinstated with
the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools
Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT
Act).
The Internal Security Act made it illegal to pursue a Communist or totalitarian
political agenda and required all Communist organizations to register with the U.S.
Attorney General. Any organizations that failed to register could be brought before
the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) and forced to register as Commu-
nist. Registered organizations were required to label their publications and broad-
casts as originating from a Communist organization. Furthermore, members of
registered organizations were denied employment in the government or in private
firms with federal defense contracts and were prohibited from applying for or using
passports.

The act also contained a number of provisions dealing with immigration and
naturalization. Aliens who were at any time members of or affiliated with a Com-
munist or totalitarian party were denied entry to the United States. Those already in
the United States could be deported without a hearing. Naturalized citizens could
have their citizenship revoked if they joined a registered Communist organization
within five years of becoming a citizen. Additionally, aliens who were members of
newly registered Communist organizations could be denied naturalization unless
they were able to prove that they had left the organization within three months of
its being registered. 
Finally, judicial standards for search and seizure, the use of informants, wire-
tapping, and other forms of surveillance were relaxed. The act also allowed the
president to declare an “internal security emergency,” during which time the Attor-
ney General was empowered to detain anyone who “probably would engage in, or
conspire to engage in, acts of espionage or sabotage.” There were provisions for
administrative hearings, but not court trials. In this way, Communist organizations
remained formally legal, but mechanisms were institutionalized that allowed the
indefinite detention of their members without any criminal act being committed
and with limited judicial oversight.
Anticipating that the law would lead to a wave of arrests (the Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) had compiled a list of 26,000 individuals it considered a
threat), Congress earmarked $775,000 to establish six detention camps in Arizona,
Florida, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and California. However, although several thou-
sand people were arrested during the 1950s, their numbers never reached the
expected level. The 1950 version of the act was actually more restrained than the
version initially passed in the House in 1948. This initial version held no provisions
for judicial oversight, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, and barred the legal
rules of evidence. Furthermore, the 1950 version was passed over the veto of Presi-
dent Truman, who believed the law to be a significant move toward totalitarianism.
As a result, an internal security emergency was never declared, and so the provi-
sions that required it were never implemented.

Commissioned in 1969 by the U.S. Department of Defense as the Advanced
Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the Internet was designed to
serve as a decentralized military communication system that would continue
working even if parts of it suffered a military attack. Technically, therefore, the
Internet is a decentralized worldwide system of computer networks that allows
for the exchange of data among networked computers through a technology
called packet switching and through standardized protocols that enable this
exchange. Through packet switching, messages (in the form of e-mails, audio,

298
Internet
\
video, or other file formats) are broken down into small packets of digital infor-
mation, each with address and reassembly instructions, to be sent via the most
efficient routes to their destination, where they are reassembled. By breaking
messages down into smaller packets that can travel independently, packet switch-
ing technology takes optimal advantage of bandwidth and enables data exchange
among millions of networked computers with unprecedented speed, reach, and
interactivity. 
Because of these qualities, the Internet has in many countries and communi-
ties become the primary means by which individuals, communities, governments,
civil society organizations, businesses, and other entities communicate and inter-
act. Between the early 1990s, when the Internet first became available for public
and commercial use, and 2006, it has grown to encompass almost 1 billion users.
These users take advantage of a multitude of communication technologies that
constitute the Internet, such as the World Wide Web, electronic mail, Instant
Messaging, and Usenet groups, to engage in a wide range of activities. All of
these online activities involve interactions among individuals, corporations, civil
society organizations, businesses, and other entities, during which personal data
about individuals can be tracked, collected, archived, shared, copied, manipu-
lated, transferred, or exposed—often without the individual’s knowledge. For
example, different technologies can track website users’ visits, as well as visits to
previous and subsequent websites; what they read; how much time they spend on
a given article; what they buy, and where and when they buy it; what ads they
view and for how long; what personal data, including financial data, they enter
into web forms; what software they are using; and what e-mails they read, includ-
ing when and where (in what city) they read them and to whom they forward
them. Online newspapers, for example, have records of the political or other
interests of their readers, and online bookstores have records of what books their
customers have viewed or purchased (on any topic, including health topics,
finances, etc.). 
The Internet privacy landscape has become so confusing and increasingly
sophisticated that some have decided it is hardly possible to continue to expect any
form of data privacy. Others agree that the Internet could indeed become the ulti-
mate data surveillance technology, but add that the technology does not itself
allow the exploitation of personal data; rather, the Internet technologies as well as
the public policies that regulate their design and use reflect the interests of different
stakeholders in access to personal information or in its protection. The ways in
which these interests are negotiated in the context of the Internet have significant
implications for a person’s right to self-determination; personal safety (especially
for victims of crimes, e.g., of domestic violence); medical and financial privacy;
risk of suffering identity fraud; opportunities for free political deliberation, dis-
sent, and activism; and access to employment opportunities.
This entry provides an overview of the nature and trends in Internet privacy and
focuses on three questions. First, how has the Internet reshaped the privacy land-
scape; second, how does Internet privacy affect different stakeholders, and what
new organizations and entities have emerged to advance the divergent interests of
these stakeholders; and third, what main technical tools, concepts, and practices
have emerged to track and access or protect personal data?

I. How the Internet Has Reshaped the Privacy Landscape.
The Internet is redefining the privacy landscape through both its technical
design and the social uses of this design. First, the Internet allows for massive
access to and instantaneous surveillance of millions of messages. It thus allows for
new ways of scanning and intercepting large amounts of data or packets as opposed
to a simple connection between two points of a traditional phone line or a printed
letter. 
Second, compared with paper-based data records, privacy on the Internet has
changed through the proliferation and transferability of personal data as the tech-
nology allows personal data to be processed and manipulated in ways previously
unimagined. Data can now easily be shared, copied, searched, mined, compiled,
compared, matched, combined, or transferred worldwide at the click of a mouse,
leading to a proliferation of personal data and the development of what some pri-
vacy researchers have termed a “digital persona”—a collection of an individual’s
data available in digital form. 
Third, the Internet has changed privacy as a result of the stickiness of digital
data. Not only has personally identifiable information proliferated on the Inter-
net, but once there, it tends to be difficult to remove. For example, data may reside
on servers to which individuals have no access, remain cached (stored for easy
retrieval) in search engines, or have been copied and sent on to other sites or dis-
cussion forums. Hence, the data remain in the system, creating a permanent search-
able record, so that the extent to which individuals can control their data is
decidedly reduced. 
Fourth, privacy on the Internet is characterized by a lack of transparency in data
collection practices. Given the particular interests of businesses in collecting per-
sonal data from Internet users for marketing, advertising, and other commercial
purposes, as well as the interests of thieves in obtaining personal financial data,
technologies designed to collect personal data from Internet users have prolifer-
ated; and for the most part, such technologies have been designed to make data col-
lection unnoticeable. Fifth, because of the variety of opportunities for online
personal data collection, methods for data compilation, and uses for the data, the
Internet raises the stakes of privacy. More data are at stake more frequently for
more uses—many of them unauthorized by the individual.
In essence, privacy issues are different for the Internet compared with previous
paper-based data storage and communication systems both quantitatively and qual-
itatively, because personal data proliferate, can be manipulated for an unprece-
dented array of uses, are more difficult for individuals to control, can be collected
more easily without a person’s awareness, and, for all these reasons, entail more
severe consequences for individuals. 
II.The Stakes in Internet Privacy.
Individuals have a great interest in controlling access to their personal data
because their data can be collected without their awareness, can be copied and
transferred easily to anyone, and can be mixed and matched with any other data
available about them. One of these consequences is identity fraud or theft, a class
of crime in which a person’s personal data (e.g., ID numbers, address, or financial
information) is used by someone else who assumes the identity of that person in

300
Internet
\
order to obtain credit or money or to commit a crime in that person’s name. For the
victims of identity theft, reestablishing their credit record or clearing a criminal
record in their name can be both time-consuming and costly. With identity fraud
now the fastest-growing crime in many countries, the costs associated with it have
skyrocketed to billions of dollars, not to mention the emotional distress victims
may experience. 
In addition, individuals have a great stake in protecting their personal informa-
tion from access by governments or other individuals, especially if they are
engaged in social, political, or environmental activism and use the Internet to
express dissenting views, to organize public deliberations with fellow citizens, or
to fight for social justice. Perhaps even more important, citizens who believe that
their personal information or whereabouts can be easily tracked and monitored
may abstain from expressing dissenting views or engaging in civic activism. As a
result, a lack of data privacy may inhibit free speech and open democratic delibera-
tion.
The extent to which personal data about individuals is available can also have
important implications for the interaction of individuals with businesses as custom-
ers or as employees. As customers, for example, individuals may find that their
creditworthiness for important purchases such as homes or cars depends on the
amount and type of information a business has about them. Moreover, personal
data collected by businesses, such as airlines, are also used increasingly by govern-
ments. As employees, individuals may find that their opportunities for employment
or promotion increasingly depend on the amount and type of information busi-
nesses are able to collect from various sources as well as by monitoring them at
work.
To advance the privacy rights of individuals, a number of nonprofit organiza-
tions and privacy advocacy organizations have emerged that track privacy trends
and legislation, educate citizens about privacy, lobby governments, testify in legis-
lative hearings, and contest legislative proposals that may infringe on individual
privacy rights. 
Conversely, businesses have strong interests in personal data for a number of
reasons. On the one hand, the success of Internet commerce depends on the level of
control customers have over their personal data. In fact, some studies have shown
that customers shy away from Internet commerce or abandon their online shopping
carts if they are unsure about their privacy, resulting in billions of dollars of lost
business. On the other hand, businesses depend on personal data about customers
to rate their creditworthiness, to target marketing and advertising strategies, or—in
the case of the software and entertainment industries—to track customer use of
software and digital files (e.g., music files, CDs, and DVDs). In addition, busi-
nesses also depend on personal data from employees to make hiring and promotion
decisions (e.g., by using credit ratings, medical data, and criminal records or by
monitoring web surfing, e-mail use, keystrokes, or desktops of employees). 
This increased interest in and need for personal data on the Internet have given
rise to entire industries devoted to the collection, sale, or protection of personal
data. For some businesses, collecting or selling personal data has become the main
source of revenue. For example, online marketing and advertising businesses col-
lect information about web browsing and purchasing patterns of customers in order

Internet
\
301
to compile and sell customer profiles and to deliver targeted advertising to these
customers. Similarly, large commercial data brokers have emerged to collect and
combine all available personal data about individuals to provide employment and
background checks for businesses, including insurance and marketing companies,
as well as for government law enforcement agencies. For these industries, uncon-
strained access to and use of personal data is an important source of profit. How-
ever, as businesses, these data collection entities are not accountable to the public,
so individuals do not know what information is being collected about them or how
it is being used. 
Other industries that have great stakes in accessing people’s personal informa-
tion, specifically in tracking their use of digital files, are the software industry and
the content or media industry (e.g., film and music producers and publishers).
Because software, music files, movies, books, and other content in digital format
can be easily copied and shared, these industries are concerned about copyright
infringement and, therefore, have a great interest in tracking how their customers
use digital media and content files. To address this need, a technology industry has
emerged around digital rights management. Digital rights management (DRM), the
controls and constraints copyright holders place on the use of their digital files, has
a number of privacy implications. Some DRM systems, for example, require users
to identify themselves with a username and password to gain access to files. As a
result, the systems are able to track the files that a particular individual watches or
reads. Other DRM systems use the default of assigning a randomly generated
“Globally Unique Identifier” (GUID) to a computer, which can then be used to
keep track of the downloading and playing of media files on that particular com-
puter—a technology that is used, for example, by the Microsoft Media Player soft-
ware.
However, some DRM software can leave Internet users particularly vulnerable
to privacy invasion. The widely publicized case of Sony’s digital rights manage-
ment software on its music CDs demonstrates this well. The company had installed
XCP (Extended Copy Protection) software on a number of its recent CDs to pre-
vent its customers from making more than three backup copies of a particular CD.
The software installed itself in the operating system of the customer’s computer
and consistently monitored all processes, putting great stress on the customer’s
hard drive. Moreover, to hide its existence and its monitoring activities, the XCP
software used rootkits, a technology designed to hide files, software codes, and
running processes from systems and diagnostic and anti-spyware software. This
technology allowed Internet malware, software intended to control or harm a per-
son’s computer, to remain hidden from users’ view as well, increasing users’ vul-
nerability to such malware. The XCP software also came without uninstall
features. Those customers who were able to find the XCP software and tried to
uninstall it risked damaging their operating system and CD-ROM drives. When
Sony finally supplied an uninstaller, one of its components remained active, which
left customers even more vulnerable, allowing any website the customer would
visit to potentially take over the customer’s computer. 
Obviously, businesses have a great stake in access to individuals’ personal infor-
mation and tend to favor policies that allow self-regulation of privacy practices in
engaging with customers. Moreover, regulations requiring provisions for customers

302
Internet
\
to access, correct, or erase their personal information in business databases could
be costly. To advance these interests in self-regulation, businesses have formed lob-
bying associations such as the Privacy Alliance to influence legislators in the
United States and Europe. In addition, they have developed voluntary “privacy
seal” programs, such as TRUSTe and BBBOnline, to implement self-regulation ini-
tiatives. The TRUSTe program, one of the most popular self-regulation initiatives,
provides oversight and a resolution process in addition to guidelines for privacy
policy development. For example, the program allows users to notify TRUSTe of
any apparent misuses of the TRUSTe mark and offers to investigate complaints. Yet
TRUSTe is funded by some of the corporations it serves, resulting in a conflict of
interest if the program were to investigate one of its sponsors. BBBOnline is
another industry-sponsored self-regulation initiative that is similar to TRUSTe but
adds the customer recourse options of the Better Business Bureau. In addition, the
program features monitoring services, consumer dispute resolution, and a compli-
ance seal. Consequences for noncompliance include seal withdrawal, bad publicity,
and referral to government enforcement agencies. However, the program does not
provide legal redress mechanisms. 
Governments likewise have a great stake in the personal information of individ-
uals. For example, they use this information to fulfill their duties such as providing
law enforcement services, regulating traffic, and providing social services, but they
can also use them to monitor political activists, dissidents, or government protest-
ers. In addition, governments create legislation to mediate the interests of individu-
als and businesses in accessing and protecting personal data. 
To pursue their missions, governments have used both technologies and public
policies to respond to the changing data privacy landscape on the Internet. One of
the most famous examples of technology development for access to personal infor-
mation for law enforcement is the Carnivore software developed by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Together with other software packages in the
FBI’s Dragonware software suite, Carnivore was able to sniff out or identify, reas-
semble, and analyze data packets from individuals based on certain information
(e.g., the individual’s computer Internet Protocol (IP) address or a certain set of
keywords) in order to search through the data of suspects. Carnivore has now been
replaced with commercially available packet sniffers. 
Another well-known technological proposal to provide easy access to the per-
sonal data of individuals was the so-called Clipper chip proposed by the Clinton
administration. This encryption initiative was designed to set a standard for the
encoding of voice transmission, and a similar chip called Capstone was envisioned
as a standard for the encoding of Internet data. In both cases, the government envi-
sioned holding the keys to the encryption code in order to facilitate access to the
encrypted data of individuals once legal authorization had been granted. The initia-
tive was met with protest nationally as well as internationally, and has since been
abandoned.
Combined with technological approaches, governments have also developed
legislation to regulate the extent and the circumstances under which the personal
data of individuals can be accessed by government agencies to pursue their objec-
tives in the changed Internet privacy landscape. For example, the Electronic Com-
munication Privacy Act of 1986 regulates government access to electronic

Internet
\
303
communication in transit and in storage, requiring government agencies to obtain
warrants or court orders to intercept or access electronic communications of indi-
viduals. Other laws have expanded regulations to cover access to personal data in
the Internet context as well. To ensure the ability of law enforcement to wiretap
phone calls over the Internet, for example, the Federal Communications Commis-
sion ordered broadband and Internet telephony (VoIP) providers to make their sys-
tems wiretap friendly. In this way, the Commission extended the 1994
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) to VoIP as
well, although CALEA was originally designed to require public switched tele-
phone network service providers to make technological accommodations to facili-
tate wiretapping by law enforcement. 
More recently, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appro-
priate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA
PATRIOT Act) has also expanded law enforcement access to personal Internet
data. For example, the act increased the range of data types (e.g., session times and
duration) about individuals the government can request from Internet service pro-
viders (ISPs). The act also redefines wiretapping to include not only dialed phone
numbers but also the addresses of websites and e-mail messages. In addition, the
act authorizes roving wiretapping (intercepting and accessing data trails that an
individual leaves regardless of his or her location) and requires the cooperation of
public organizations such as libraries with such wiretapping. For example, it
requires that librarians hand over Internet sign-up records such as URLs and e-mail
data, as well as session data such as keywords typed into search engines.
In addition to creating legislation to support their missions in the changed Inter-
net privacy landscape, governments also create legislation to negotiate the interests
of all stakeholders. For this purpose, governments have taken different approaches
depending on their legal traditions and on the role privacy has played in the legal
system. For example, the European Union, which includes personal privacy as a
fundamental human right in its Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
Union, has favored a comprehensive approach to electronic data protection.
Accordingly, the 1995 European Data Protection Directive guarantees the right
of individuals to control their personal information.
In the United States, several thousand data privacy laws are proposed every year
at the federal and state levels and several hundred are implemented. For example,
the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) applies specifi-
cally to children under the age of 13, requiring commercial websites to obtain
explicit parental consent before collecting personal information from children.
Some legislation is targeted at particular practices or technologies such as restrict-
ing the secret installation of unwanted software on a person’s computer or requir-
ing businesses to notify individuals if their data have been exposed as a result of a
security breach. 
III.Technologies and Practices Designed to Capture and Access Internet Users’ Information.
When people use the Internet, personal information about them is captured and
accessed in a number of ways. First, the general Internet activity of users is logged
and captured on their computers, on the websites they visit, and on their ISP’s serv-
ers. Second, as they use specialized web services, such as search engines, e-commerce

304
Internet
\
websites, Internet telephone services, or file-sharing services, users leave trails of
personal information that can be captured and used for various purposes. Third,
Internet users encounter increasingly sophisticated technologies designed for the
sole purpose of accessing and monitoring their personal information and Internet
activities.
Trails of Personal Data Captured from General Internet Use. When individuals
use the Internet, the trails of information they leave are captured not only by their
computers, the websites they visit, and their ISPs, but also by website registration
protocols in the form of the WHOIS database. 
Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Netscape, and Mozilla Firefox capture
Internet users’ web surfing patterns in a number of ways. Browsers capture a his-
tory of the sites a user visits, creating a record indicating when each site was vis-
ited. In addition, browsers store the addresses of previously visited websites for a
set period of time in the drop-down address bar. Moreover, computers store web-
sites and images in a cache, a storage area for copies of Internet files, so that they
load faster and do not have to be retrieved again and again. The computer hard
drive also stores temporary Internet files, usernames, passwords, and other infor-
mation. All of this information can be easily accessed by anyone who gains access
to the user’s computer.
Clickstream data, sometimes called clickpath data, is a logged record of what a
person does while visiting a website. A clickstream can contain all the pages users
visit, the time users spend on a given page, the date and time of their visit, the order
in which they view the pages of a website, the search terms they enter, the site they
came from, the site they depart to, the addresses of their received and sent e-mails
and user’s server address, screen resolution, browser preferences, operating sys-
tems, and downloads. Clickstreams can be traced by ISPs and by websites. Often
used to determine how effective or attractive particular website features are to visi-
tors, clickstream data are of great interest to marketers and advertisers. An entire
industry has sprung up to produce software that analyzes visitor clickstreams and
produces live graphic representations of user activities on the website.
Internet service providers are companies that provide individuals, organizations,
or businesses with Internet access, including e-mail and web hosting. Accordingly,
ISP log files can contain a record of all of this activity of an Internet user (e.g.,
what e-mails users wrote to whom and when, what websites or files they down-
loaded and when, which chat rooms they visited, or with whom they engaged in
Instant Messaging (IM) conversations). If requested by law enforcement, ISP
records in the United States must be stored for up to 90 days according to the Elec-
tronic Communication Transactional Records Act of 1996. However, the debate
continues over whether ISPs should be required to keep these logs for a certain
amount of time and, if so, for how long. Recently, the USA PATRIOT Act has
increased the range of data types to be handed over to law enforcement officials. 
Internet users who wish to have their own website with their own domain name,
such as their family or company name, must request and register the domain name
with a Domain Name Registrar, a company that is authorized by ICANN (the Inter-
net Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the nonprofit organization
charged by the U.S. government with managing the Internet domain name system
and other technical processes. A domain name is an easier-to-remember textual

Internet
\
305
representation of an Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is a somewhat compli-
cated string of numbers (e.g., 17.254.3.183) assigned to every computer on the
Internet as a unique ID—somewhat like a telephone number. The Domain Name
Registrar makes sure the domain name is unique and enters it with the matching IP
address into a central registry so that other users can find the website or send e-mail
to the user. 
In addition, current ICANN procedures stipulate that domain name registration
requires accurate personal contact information from the website domain owner,
which, along with the technical information, is to be entered into a publicly avail-
able WHOIS database currently overseen by Network Solutions, Inc. Although
originally intended to help network administrators look up technical details and
contact information for websites to solve technical problems, the WHOIS database
presents privacy problems for website owners because anyone can find out their
personal contact information. For example, if a family maintains a website with the
photos of children, a pedophile would need only to query the WHOIS database to
find out where the family lives. Similarly, if a political dissident group maintains a
website, the government could access the WHOIS database to retrieve the contact
information concerning the person who registered the site. Public display is the
default setting; sometimes, for an additional fee, however, registrars will list alter-
native proxy contact information to keep the user’s personal contact information
out of public view. However, there is considerable debate over whether individuals
should have the right to register domain names without having their personal con-
tact information publicly available in the WHOIS database. In February 2005 the
National Telecommunication and Information Administration, for example, pro-
hibited private registrations for domains employing the .us suffix. 
Trails of Personal Data Captured by Using Specialized Internet Services. When
using various specialized Internet services such as search engines, online shopping
websites, VoIP, or file-sharing networks such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies,
individuals leave a trail of personal data that can make them vulnerable to privacy
invasions. 
Search services can present privacy problems because search terms can be
logged together with the computer’s IP address in web logs. Moreover, if search
engines use authentication (i.e., ask users to log in with their username and pass-
word), they can create a profile of a user’s search history. The most widely used
search engine, Google, for example, offers a personalized search service that
allows users to log in and keep track of their searches. While the search engine
allows users to delete items from their search history, these items are usually erased
only from the web, not from Google’s internal systems. Like other data, all of the
search data can be subpoenaed by governments, as the recent case of the Bush
administration’s subpoena of search data from Microsoft Network (MSN), Yahoo!,
America Online, and Google shows. In an effort to achieve its law enforcement
objectives in the area of Internet pornography, the administration requested data
about the searches of millions of search engine users.
Moreover, search engines offer a broad array of services that allow them to inte-
grate user information from multiple activities. Google offers a wide range of such
converging services, all of which have increasingly complex privacy implications.
For instance, in addition to its personalized search service, Google’s Gmail e-mail

306
Internet
\
service allows for unlimited storage of e-mail messages—more data that can be
scanned for a profile, which can then be matched with billing information from
Google’s planned payment services. In addition to the increasing convergence of
services (and hence user data) in the hands of one entity, geographic search ser-
vices of satellite images tied to the Global Positioning System (GPS), such as
Google’s new Google Earth search, have raised privacy concerns about the ability
of such a function to facilitate stalking and tracing an individual’s whereabouts,
especially once resolution improves.
Similarly, on e-commerce websites such as the online bookstore Amazon.com,
users are profiled based on their purchasing habits, product reviews, wish lists, and
gift shopping. Recently, the company announced a new profiling technology
designed to create databases of gift recipients, guessing their personal information
(gender, age, interests, etc.) based on the gifts being sent to them. In this way, the
company is creating user profiles even of those who never use the site, but who
simply happen to be the recipient of a gift sent by an online shopper. As a result,
these individuals may not even know that someone is creating a profile of their per-
sonal information, let alone be able to correct the information in the profiling sys-
tem. 
Using microphones and headsets, users can telephone each other directly via
their computers, or they can connect from their computers with analog telephone
users. Most VoIP systems route phone calls through a central server so that they
can be easily tapped or rerouted to law enforcement officers requesting access to
them. To ensure the capability of wiretapping VoIP phone calls, the Federal Com-
munications Commission in the United States recently ordered broadband and
VoIP providers to accommodate wiretaps. 
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies and software such as KaZaA, Gnutella, or
Grokster allows computers to both share files from their hard drives and access
files on the hard drives of other computers, or peers, in a network using the same
P2P software and hence having the same file-sharing capability. In other words,
computers with the same P2P software can choose to connect with any other com-
puter in the same network. However, P2P software requires active security manage-
ment that many users are not aware of. As a result, users may—without their
knowledge—be sharing files or allowing others to access their computer functions.
In addition, P2P software has often been infected with spyware without any warn-
ing notifying users that they are downloading unwanted software along with the
P2P software.
P2P networks are also increasingly being used for VoIP services such as the
popular Skype program, which also allows for instant messaging (IM), searching,
and file sharing. P2P-based VoIP systems allow users to network each other’s com-
puters to obtain free VoIP, which raises its own set of privacy issues. Although
Skype, unlike regular telephone services or server-based VoIP, is encrypted, it is
currently not clear how secure that encryption is. Also, while Skype does not
record voice conversations, it keeps histories of IM exchanges, which could be read
by spyware programs or other intruders. And although Skype uses P2P networks to
transmit phone calls, a central server-based system is used for authentication, so
users could easily be tracked by law enforcement officials or by others interested in
analyzing network traffic and finding out who is calling whom.

Technologies and Practices Designed to Access Data from Internet Users. In
addition to web services capturing and compiling personal information about users,
other technologies and practices are designed for the sole purpose of accessing or
monitoring Internet users’ personal information—usually without their knowledge
or consent. 
Cookies are small text files of information sent from a web server (a networked
computer that stores information that users from other computers can request
through their web browsers, e-mail software, and other software programs) to an
Internet user’s computer while the user is visiting a website. For the most part,
these text files contain a unique ID assigned to a user by a website. The ID can be
linked to the activities the user engages in while visiting the website, and these
activities can then be logged in a database linked to the cookie ID. The cookie file
is stored on the user’s computer and can be accessed by the server every time the
user requests information (e.g., clicks a link on the website). Some cookies are
stored permanently on the user’s computer (until the user deletes the cookie or it
reaches its set expiration date) while others, called session or transient cookies, are
set to be erased once the browser is closed. Cookies are usually designed to keep
track of what a user does on a website, to store and remember information entered
(e.g., a username and password, products purchased, credit card information), to
customize advertising to user preferences, to keep track of purchases in an online
shopping cart, and to monitor how many times an ad has been viewed. Although
Internet users can adjust their browser settings to refuse cookies, they would be
excluding themselves from most services, since most websites use cookies. 
Usually only the website that sent the cookie can read it. However, some web-
sites, especially those of marketing and advertising companies, which provide ad
placement services to other websites, place cookies that can be used to track users’
activities across many websites. These so-called third-party or tracking cookies
usually serve to ensure that ads are targeted at the interests of the website visitor;
for example, a user who has clicked on baby toys will likely get ads for other baby
products. However, these third-party cookies have also been used to create profiles
of user surfing habits and interests. For example, Doubleclick, the most prominent
Internet marketing company, can track every website a person visits, every article
he or she reads, every purchase he or she makes, and so on. The company could
also link an Internet user’s entire purchase history and other data to a person’s con-
tact information and then sell such a database. This was the plan of Doubleclick
when it merged with Abacus, a mail-order management company, in order to create
comprehensive customer profiles—a plan it had to abandon after a loud public out-
cry and a class-action suit. 
Web bugs (also called one-pixel gifs, web beacons, tracking bugs, or transparent
gifs) are small invisible images—usually only 1Þ1 pixel and kept in the color of the
web page or e-mail background—that are often used in combination with cookies
to track who has visited a web page or read an e-mail message (only e-mail mes-
sages in html format), how much time they spent on it, and how often they have
read the page. They are, for example, frequently used by spammers to determine
whether their spam e-mail has been read and whether the e-mail address is active.
When a website with a web bug is called up or a message with a web bug is read,
the browser or the e-mail system automatically requests the web bug image from

308
Internet
\
the server, thus letting the sender know that the page or e-mail message is being
read. 
Web bugs have also been used by companies (e.g., Rampellsoft) to develop a
service for e-mail users who would like to know, without the addressee’s knowl-
edge, whether or not, when, and where their e-mail was read. To spy on the
addressee’s response to their e-mail, senders add “.didtheyreadit.com” to the recip-
ient’s e-mail address to route it through the DidTheyReadIt server, which then
attaches a web bug and maintains a connection with the recipient’s mail server to
track how long the e-mail message remains open on the recipient’s server. It can
monitor how often the recipients (including those to whom the e-mail was for-
warded) open the e-mail, how long they keep it open, and what IP address they are
using, which can also be traced to a geographic location such as a city.
Packet sniffers are programs designed to monitor the traffic on a computer net-
work. These programs look at, or sniff, each packet of information on the network
and are able to monitor who reads and sends what e-mail to whom with what con-
tent, or who downloads what web pages with what content. They can be set to look
for specific words or other data or to simply monitor all data flow. They are fre-
quently used to monitor employee communication in the workplace. The best-
known packet sniffer is Carnivore (discussed previously).
Spyware is a type of malware—a piece of software (including viruses, worms,
etc.) designed to take control of another person’s computer, to inflict damage on a
person’s computer, or to execute other tasks without the consent or awareness of
the victim. For example, some types of spyware act as keystroke loggers on a
user’s computer, lock the computer, restart it, read files on the computer, or turn on
the computer’s microphone and transmit the user’s voice over the Internet. 
Spyware is designed to observe Internet users’ activity without their knowledge
and to obtain their personal data. Users usually install the software unknowingly
when opening e-mail attachments, sharing files in P2P technologies and networks,
or downloading so-called free software such as screen savers, cellular telephone
ring tones, and browser upgrades from the Internet. They can also become the vic-
tim of browser attacks when they accidentally come across the website of a spy-
ware distributor and thereby have the spyware forced on them. They can also
contract the spyware from viruses or worms.
Spyware can monitor a user’s e-mail, web browsing habits, and keystrokes (and
hence record passwords, credit card information, or any other personal data entered
into web forms). The software can also reroute payment information to a fraudu-
lent website, tamper with firewalls or anti-virus protection software, serve pop-up
ads, redirect dial-up access to an expensive long-distance service, alter home page
settings, or change search engine results. These types of software are usually
designed for commercial gain in some form—for example, to steal financial and
other personal data for identity theft or to collect personally identifiable informa-
tion about users’ shopping habits, preferences, or web browsing patterns for mar-
keting and advertising purposes. In addition, spyware programs take up processing
power, slow down the user’s computer, and are the primary basis for requests for
technical support.
Spyware can be particularly difficult to detect because it is designed to conceal
its existence and activities often in the form of rootkits—technologies designed to

Internet
\
309
hide files, software codes, and running processes from systems and diagnostic and
anti-spyware software. At the same time, spyware is designed to make it difficult to
uninstall, with such attempts sometimes resulting in damage to the computer sys-
tem. Given the pernicious and covert nature of spyware, it is perhaps not surprising
that, according to a 2004 survey by America Online and the National Cyber-Security
Alliance, more than 80 percent of survey respondents were found to have spyware on
their computers, with almost 90 percent of these respondents being unaware of it.
Phishing is the crime of sending fraudulent e-mails, presumably in the name of
banks or e-commerce websites such as eBay or PayPal, to trick e-mail recipients
into entering their personal information (including passwords, user names, address
information, and credit card numbers) to a fraudulent website. Both the e-mail and
website are usually designed to appear authentic, which makes it difficult for vic-
tims to detect the fraud. In addition to using e-mails, phishers attempt to collect
personal data on other websites, for example, by fraudulently misrepresenting
themselves as potential employers to job seekers on career websites. Phishers
either sell the stolen personal data in online markets or use it directly to obtain
credit, make purchases, or pursue criminal activities in the victim’s name. 
Pharming is the deceptive practice of redirecting Internet users to fraudulent
websites without their knowledge to trick them into entering their personal infor-
mation into the fraudulent site. To redirect users without their knowledge, hackers
e-mail a virus to victims to alter the Domain Name System (DNS) entries, the list
of names that are matched to specific IP addresses (e.g., “apple.com” for
“17.254.3.183”), for previously accessed websites stored on the victim’s computer.
Hackers may also attack the entire DNS server and alter its list of domain names, in
which case all users who believe themselves to be going to eBay, for example,
actually end up at a fraudulent website.
IV.Technology to Protect User Information or to Make Data Collection More Transparent.
Just as a whole industry has developed to monitor and track people and to col-
lect their personal information, another industry has developed to provide solutions
to privacy invasion, so-called privacy-enhancing technologies (PET). For example,
in addition to common firewall systems—usually hardware and/or software
designed to prevent unauthorized access to a computer—some companies offer
anti-spyware programs (e.g., Microsoft Windows Defender), which search the
computer for hidden spyware and alert users to unauthorized software downloads.
Others offer software to identify web bugs or to manage cookies—so-called cookie
busters. Yet others provide services for protecting users’ anonymity while brows-
ing and e-mailing, or for encryption (e.g., software provided by the company
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), a technology that translates data into an unreadable
format using a secret code or format accessible only to the intended recipient). 
In addition, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international nonprofit
consortium devoted to the development of technology standards for the World Wide
Web, has developed a standard called Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) that
provides Internet users with more transparency and control regarding the data collec-
tion processes of websites. Using P3P-enabled browsers, users can compare their pri-
vacy preferences with those of the websites they are visiting and forgo visiting
websites whose privacy standards do not meet their expectations. However, P3P does

310
Internet protocol (IP) address
\
not enable users to influence the privacy practices of the website for their visit or to
access, correct, or erase their data; nor does it provide recourse for users who feel that
their privacy has been violated.
As a packet-switching technology that brings together almost a billion people
into a shared communication network, the Internet offers new opportunities for
interaction, including new opportunities for sharing and accessing personal data in
unprecedented numbers and ways. These opportunities redefine the emerging
Internet privacy landscape by allowing for massive access to increasingly prolifer-
ating and easily transferable data that can be difficult for users to retract and con-
trol and that are often collected without their awareness. At the same time, the
Internet raises the stakes in data privacy. More data can be collected in more ways
for more uses than ever before, affecting individuals’ access to employment oppor-
tunities, health services, and freedom of political dissent and deliberation, in addi-
tion to opportunities for governments and businesses to pursue their missions. It is
the negotiation of these stakes through policies and technologies that ultimately
shapes the emerging and constantly changing Internet privacy landscape.

Privacy in the United States means many things, although it was perhaps best
summed up by Judge Thomas Cooley as the “right to be let alone.” Privacy
torts—areas of law enabling individuals to sue for monetary damages because of
intrusions or communications harmful to privacy—originated in part from percep-
tions of journalistic misbehavior, making it possible for individuals to sue journal-
ists, advertisers, and others for “invasion of privacy.” 
In 1890 two Boston law partners—Samuel D. Warren and future Supreme Court
justice Louis D. Brandeis—published the Harvard Law Review article “The Right
to Privacy.” The article did not advocate a constitutional right, but rather argued
that a new, independent legal action for invasion of privacy could be found by tak-
ing pieces of existing tort law, including trespass to property and defamation. War-
ren and Brandeis wrote in a famous passage, “The press is overstepping in every
direction the obvious bounds of propriety and decency.” They asserted that gossip
was a trade pursued with “industry as well as effrontery. . . . Modern enterprise and
invention have, through invasions upon privacy, subjected . . . [modern man] to
mental pain and distress far greater than could be inflicted by mere bodily injury.” 
In 1890 a brash invasion of privacy led to a famous early lawsuit. Abigail Rober-
son sued the Rochester Folding Box Co. for $15,000 after she found a picture of
her face decorating a box of Franklin Mills flour along with the slogan “The Flour
of the Family.” New York’s highest court ruled that Roberson could not collect
damages because there was no law protecting privacy, adding that the legislature
could create one. New York’s legislature responded to the public dismay and to
newspaper editorials denouncing the Roberson decision by passing a statute in
1903 that made it a tort and a misdemeanor to use someone’s name or likeness
without the person’s permission for “trade purposes.” Other states did not wait for
legislative action. In 1905 the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in a case involving an
unauthorized testimonial in an advertisement for life insurance that there is a legal
interest preventing the use of pictures of individuals without their consent.
Privacy in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries has been a continuing
concern and political issue. Since 1905 legal definitions of privacy torts expanded

haphazardly, sometimes by legislative enactment and often by judicial or “common
law” adoption of the concept. In 1960 Dean William L. Prosser of the University of
California School of Law, America’s foremost torts scholar, wrote a remarkably
influential California Law Review article, “Privacy,” defining four somewhat over-
lapping areas of law in a manner readily accepted by both state and federal courts:
intrusion, false light, appropriation, and publication of private matters.
Intrusion on a person’s physical solitude includes trespass, eavesdropping, and
wiretapping or other interception of electronic communication. Prosser included
window peeping in his definition, but his view from 1960 could not foresee all of
the problems that would come to be associated with the use of increasingly sophis-
ticated electronic devices, including “bazooka microphones,” miniature cameras,
computers, cellular telephones, and the Internet. This Prosser category, by the
late twentieth century, had assumed a journalism-specific label, “newsgathering
torts.” 
The key intrusion precedent involves a Life magazine reporter and a photogra-
pher who made an unethical deal with authorities to entrap an unlicensed medical
practitioner. The Life staffers got into the practitioner’s home under false pretenses,
with the woman reporter claiming that she had a lump in her breast. The reporter
had a transmitter in her purse, which broadcast her conversations with the practitio-
ner, a plumber named A. A. Dietemann, to a nearby automobile, where representa-
tives of the district attorney’s office and of the California State Department of
Health listened and made a tape recording. Life published an illustrated article, and
the information gathered by the reporter and photographer was used to convict Die-
temann of the unlicensed practice of medicine. Dietemann then sued the magazine
for invasion of privacy.
Life attorneys argued that electronic devices and hidden cameras are indispens-
able tools of investigative reporting. Writing for the U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth
Circuit, in Dietemann v. Time, Inc. (1971), Judge Shirley Hufstedler upheld a small
jury award of $1000 against the magazine for invasion of privacy. The award was
small, but the message was clear: “investigative reporting is an ancient art,” exist-
ing long before electronic devices and miniature cameras. The First Amendment,
Hufstedler declared, provides journalists with no immunity from torts or crimes
committed in the gathering of news.
That principle applies to journalists and others who invade privacy by means of
old-fashioned eavesdropping, or who use high-tech means to intercept cell phone
messages, voicemails, or electronic mail messages via the Internet. Photographers
and videographers are permitted to capture images in public spaces; they are not
permitted, however, to intrude into private spaces or to use sophisticated telephoto
lenses or microphones that can pick up conversations at a distance far beyond the
range of human hearing. The egregiously aggressive shadowing of celebrities by
“paparazzi” photographers, even on public thoroughfares, can be banned by judi-
cial order. There are no trustworthy legal defenses if the tort of intrusion occurs. In
this and other privacy torts, if a jury is convinced that a plaintiff’s legitimate
“expectation of privacy” has been violated, a verdict against the media is likely.
False light (fictionalization) was defined by Prosser as placing someone in a
false but not necessarily defamatory light in the public eye. This is the privacy
tort closest to defamation of a person’s reputation, and it is the only area of inva-

sion of privacy law where proof of truth is a viable defense. The key precedent
here involved a woman, Margaret Mae Cantrell, who was included in a reporter’s
story even though he had not spoken with her. The reporter gave the impression
that he had talked to her about her life six months after her husband had been
killed (along with 43 others) when a bridge collapsed. The story for the Cleve-
land Plain Dealer said that the reporter saw the woman “wearing the same mask
of non-expression” that she had worn at her husband’s funeral. The Supreme
Court of the United States agreed that this constituted an actionable knowing and
reckless falsehood. 
Media employees’ deceptiveness with sources is related to the false light tort.
For example, the producers of NBC-TV’s Dateline news magazine convinced a
truck driver and his employer that the program was going to focus positive atten-
tion on the trucking industry. Instead, the program declared that American high-
ways are a trucker’s killing field. A U.S. Court of Appeals allowed the case to go to
trial for negligent representation and false light. 
The false light tort’s similarity to defamation is illustrated by a lawsuit against
Life magazine by the James J. Hill family. The Hill family had been held hostage
for a day by three escaped convicts, who terrorized but did not harm the family. A
best-selling novel based on a highly similar situation, The Desperate Hours, was
made into a play, and a Life photo-essay headlined “True Crime Inspires Tense
Play” depicted actors from the play in their roles as the son and one of the convicts.
The Supreme Court found that individuals who bring false-light lawsuits involving
newsworthy accounts must meet the libel standard of proof set in New York Times
v. Sullivan (1964); that is, the plaintiffs claiming “false light” in a situation of pub-
lic interest must prove “actual malice”—publication with knowing falsity or with
reckless disregard for the truth. As Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., wrote for a
divided Court in Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374 (1967), “Material and substantial
falsification is the test.” 
That ruling, however, might not withstand courts’ twenty-first–century impa-
tience with broad claims of First Amendment rights for news media. Also, there is
concern over the false-light tort because it overlaps reputational interests protected
by defamation law. As of 2005 all but 10 states recognized false light. In 1994 a
convict’s whimsical lawsuit gave the Texas Supreme Court the opportunity to
renounce the tort. Clyde Cain sued Hearst Corporation’s Houston Chronicle for
reporting that Cain might have killed eight people. Cain sued because he had killed
only three. This led the highest civil court in Texas, by a 5-4 vote in 1994, to aban-
don the false-light tort because it duplicates the tort of defamation “while lacking
many of its procedural limitations.”
Celebrities have property rights in their likenesses or images. Successful suits
have been brought by baseball players for unauthorized use of their likenesses on
baseball “trading cards” or for videotaping, without permission, entertainment per-
formances (including being shot from a cannon, in the case of Zacchini v. Scripps-
Howard Broadcasting (1977). Entertainers provide fertile grounds for parodies, but
courts have not been uniformly protective of heavy-handed social commentary or
humor. A jury awarded $403,000 to TV celebrity Vanna White of the Wheel of For-
tune game show, finding that a Samsung Electronics advertisement featured a robot
too closely resembling White.

\
 “Sound-alike” ads also cause problems. When entertainer Bette Midler—“the
Divine Miss M”—refused to perform a song from her repertoire for a Ford Motor
Company advertisement, Ford’s advertising agency (Young & Rubicam) hired a
singer to mimic the star’s voice. Ms. Midler won $400,000.
The general rule in privacy lawsuits, as in libel law, holds that “the dead can’t
sue.” However, the estates of deceased celebrities, including Elvis Presley, mystery
author Agatha Christie, rock star Janis Joplin, and Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
have on occasion successfully asserted “descendibility.” That means that a celeb-
rity’s estate can at times control and profit from the commercial exploitation of
aspects of the famous dead person’s appearance or performances. 
Prosser defined this tort as the revelation of private information violating ordi-
nary decencies, for which truth is no defense for the publisher. Newsworthiness,
however, can be a potent defense, as Oliver Sipple learned from his effort to sue the
San Francisco Chronicle. In 1975 decorated U.S. Marine veteran Sipple became a
national hero and made international news while watching a parade featuring Pres-
ident Gerald Ford. When Sarah Jane Moore pointed a pistol at the president, Sipple
grabbed her arm, defeating her assassination attempt. A Chronicle columnist wrote
that San Francisco’s gay community was proud of Sipple’s courage. Sipple argued
that publication of his sexual orientation invaded his privacy, suing the Chronicle
and the Los Angeles Times for damages totaling $15 million. His lawsuit failed
when a California appellate court found that Sipple was such a newsworthy subject
of public interest that he could not pursue his claim of invasion of privacy. 
If private facts about a person become part of an official public document, dis-
closure of those facts will not support a lawsuit against the news media. Even dis-
closure of a rape victim’s identity—the kind of revelation that reputable media
organizations generally avoid on ethical grounds—is not actionable if the informa-
tion is gained from an official public record, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Cox
Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975), a ruling later broadened in
Florida Star v. B. J. F. (1989). Although private-facts lawsuits are difficult to win
against news media, growing judicial impatience with intrusive news media proce-
dures and public concerns over the evaporation of privacy may well make both
judges and juries more supportive of privacy lawsuits. In the 1980s, the Oakland
(California) Tribune published a truthful but tasteless gossip column revealing that
Toni Diaz, the first woman student body president at the College of Alameda, was
born Antonio Diaz and had undergone a sex change operation. After the case lan-
guished for years in the California courts, an appellate judge ruled that the question
of newsworthiness in this matter should have been submitted to a jury. The newspa-
per ended the lawsuit with a six-figure out-of-court settlement to Ms. Diaz.
In the search for new weapons to use against the media, “intentional infliction of
mental injury,” sometimes styled “negligent infliction,” appeared to be a powerful legal
concept in the mid-1980s. The ancient law of libel has developed hard-to-overcome
defenses, as have the far newer privacy torts. Larry Flynt’s Hustler magazine pub-
lished a scurrilous parody advertisement, clearly marked “ad parody—not to be taken
seriously,” asserting that Rev. Jerry Falwell’s first sexual experience took place in an
outhouse with his mother when both were drunk. Falwell sued for intentional inflic-
tion of mental injury. He also added the more traditional tort areas of defamation and
invasion of privacy to his petition.

\
315
The jury in the Falwell case decided that the parody ad was not libelous because
no one would believe it. The jury likewise found that the parody was not an inva-
sion of privacy, but concluded that Rev. Falwell should be awarded $200,000 for
intentional infliction of mental injury, an outcome upheld by the Fourth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals.
The U.S. Supreme Court, however, found that First Amendment values pro-
tected even this repugnantly offensive parody advertisement involving a public fig-
ure. Writing for a unanimous Court in Hustler v. Falwell (1988), Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist concluded that any system of civil damages that might be
used to teach Flynt a lesson also would endanger the long American tradition of
political cartoons or speech critical of public officials or public figures. This deci-
sion discouraged attempts using emotional distress lawsuits against the media to
leap over established defenses in libel and privacy law.

Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967)
The 1967 Supreme Court decision in Katz v. United States revolutionized the
interpretation of the Fourth Amendment regarding the extent to which a constitu-
tional right to privacy applies against government interference. The ruling estab-
lished a new paradigm for evaluating the balance between searches and privacy by
establishing that the Constitution protects people, not places. The decision demon-
strated the Court’s progress in understanding law and technology, and established a
zone of privacy even in accessible areas existing within the public realm.
In Katz, law enforcement agents obtained evidence of an illicit gambling opera-
tion by attaching an electronic listening and recording device to the exterior of a
public phone booth used by a bookie. Rejecting previous twentieth-century Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence geared toward the protection of property and the rule
that a trespass to a traditional zone of privacy such as the home or the person was
necessary for a violation of the reasonable expectation of privacy, the Court took
the revolutionary position that a search may occur even in the absence of a physical
penetration of a place. Property rights gave way to the expectation of privacy. The
determining question was not whether the telephone booth was a constitutionally
protected area, but whether Katz, the bookie, acted in a manner exhibiting the
desire to maintain the privacy of his conversation. Thus, although the government’s
activities in Katz involved no physical intrusion, they were found to have violated
the privacy on which Katz justifiably relied, thereby constituting a search and sei-
zure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. 
The technologically savvy Court held that the fact that the electronic wiretap-
ping device employed to intercept Katz’s conversation did not penetrate the wall of
the phone booth had no constitutional significance. The existence of a recognizable
privacy interest turns on whether a person has a subjectively reasonable expectation
of privacy in the place or thing searched or seized, and whether society is willing to
recognize it as objectively reasonable. The Court articulated that Katz had such a
subjectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his conversation
within a public yet temporarily enclosed phone booth, and his expectation was one
\
\

318
Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967)
\
that society was prepared to recognize as reasonable. By entering the phone booth
and closing the door, Katz sought to exclude his words (not his physical being)
from others. These actions allowed him to reasonably presume that the govern-
ment’s conduct in recording his conversation violated his justifiable expectation
that the content of his conversation would not be broadcast to the world, even
absent physical intrusion into the phone booth. This decision extended the scope of
the Fourth Amendment beyond the persons, houses, papers, and effects cataloged
therein and guaranteed a previously unrecognized privacy right. The right to be let
alone by others was officially recognized under the Constitution.
Although the Katz decision was a tremendous victory for privacy advocates, its
impact is somewhat limited. A person’s entitlement to protection is not absolute or
unrestricted. Protection requires both an actual, subjective expectation of privacy
and an objective, reasonable expectation of privacy that society as a whole would
be willing to accept. 
The Katz holding revolved around the collection of private information without
notice through a technological invasion. Thus, its scope is largely limited to content
versus non-content material. Non-content materials are not subject to the same
extension to the zone of privacy protections. For example, pen register devices,
which capture addressing materials rather than content, are outside the scope of the
Fourth Amendment (United States v. NY Telephone (1977)). Monitoring or tracking
devices that collect location data also may not be included within the zone of pri-
vacy protection. Cell-site data fall between content and non-content material. Pri-
vacy advocates consider it content material because it is not specifically included in
the provisions listing information accessible by subpoena under the Stored Communi-
cations Act (SCA). Law enforcement personnel argue that cell-site information pro-
vides merely location or tracking material and therefore is clearly non-content
information. Their argument is bolstered by the fact that this information is typically
collected by the cellular telephone companies for billing and routing purposes. The
companies do not collect content information as part of their regular business practice. 
Furthermore, the Katz decision did not extend Fourth Amendment protection to
the government’s recovery of private information from third parties (Couch v.
United States (1973)). The Fourth Amendment has never protected a wrongdoer’s
misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing
will not reveal it (Hoffa v. United States (1966)). The mandate that the Fourth
Amendment protects people and not places did not extend coverage to that level.
Account information held by banks (United States v. Miller (1976)), telephone
companies (Smith v. Maryland (1979)), and Western Union (In re Grand Jury Pro-
ceedings (1987)) has been declared unprotected material because the customer vol-
untarily conveyed the information to a company and “exposed” the information to
its equipment in the ordinary course of business. In so doing, the customer assumed
the risk that the company would reveal the information to police or others. 
Likewise, the Katz decision has not extended absolute protection to the collec-
tion of private information without notice in public areas where privacy is believed
to be protected. The government’s intrusion onto an open field (Oliver v. United
States (1984)) without a warrant is not proscribed by the Fourth Amendment even
if the open field is private property (California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207 (1986)).
Information that is exposed knowingly in an enclosed backyard to the naked eye

over great distances by aerial surveillance is not protected (Dow Chemical Co. v.
United States (1986)). The rule is that if curtilage (the zone of privacy that one
expects to be present around a dwelling or industry site) is open to view, police
may observe it from a public area. However, if technology is used that discloses
intimate associations, objects, or activities, that conduct may constitute a search
implicating Fourth Amendment protection.
The issue concerning the use of enhancement technology has been temporarily
resolved by the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Kyllo, 533 U.S. 27
(2001). In Kyllo, the government used a thermal sensor or imaging device on a
private residence to detect activity and movement via heat patterns to establish
probable cause that the home contained a hydroponic marijuana growing operation.
Applying the Katz two-pronged test, the Court concluded that Kyllo did have a
subjective expectation of privacy in the heat emissions within his home since the
thermal imaging technology had the potential to reveal more than the contraband
growing operation. Protected information, such as when the lady of the house was
bathing, could also be revealed. Furthermore, the subjective privacy expectation
was objectively reasonable and one that society would be willing to recognize.
Hence, the interior of house was off limits to any technology, no matter how unob-
trusive the technology, provided that the technology was not in general use. This
conclusion was reached partly on the basis that the technology of thermal imagers
cannot penetrate walls and partly because the devices are not commonly available
to the general public. This decision offers minimal and temporary protection to pri-
vacy advocates since technology rarely remains static and eventually migrates into
the general public domain. 
Per the Katz decision and its progeny, the element of property rights is but one
factor in determining whether expectations of privacy are legitimate. It is more
meaningful and appropriate to examine the actual interests involved, an individ-
ual’s liberty balanced against the government’s need for effective law enforcement.
The Katz decision is an attempt, in a technologically advanced society, to reaffirm
the bedrock constitutional provision that searches conducted outside the judicial
process, without prior approval by a judge, are per se unreasonable under the
Fourth Amendment—subject only to a few specifically established and well-delin-
eated exceptions.

Keystroke loggers
\
Keystroke loggers 
A keystroke logger, or key logger, is a small device that monitors each keystroke
by a user on a keyboard. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) refers to the
device as a “Magic Lantern.” The key logger program records each of the user’s
keystrokes and uploads the information over the Internet periodically to the person
who installed the program. A key logger program can be installed by someone who
wants to monitor activity on a particular computer, such as by parents who want to
monitor their children’s activities on the Internet. It can also be downloaded unwit-
tingly as virus spyware through a remote Trojan horse. 
Privacy advocates are primarily concerned about the ease of installation of the
device and its capability to circumvent encryption by reading the keystroke logs.
The device may be installed by a person opening an electronic mail  attachment or
by landing in the recipient user’s e-mail box. The second major concern relates to
its ability to capture content, free of judicial oversight, by recording the secret keys
that a person uses to encrypt messages or computer files. The equipment may be
installed under the authority of a traditional search warrant as opposed to a wire-
tapping order because the key logger device does not capture or intercept the com-
munication as it is being transmitted over a telephone or cable line while the
modem is in operation. 
Since the program is practically impossible to detect, there is no way to protect
information from being disclosed without authorization and potentially leaked or
used in an illicit manner. On the positive side, key loggers are user specific, as
opposed to black box programs, which monitor regional communication activities.
Furthermore, key loggers reveal a target’s key and key-related information so that
access to indecipherable documents can be secured. Timely attainment of informa-
tion of this sort is crucial to law enforcement in investigating and preventing seri-
ous terrorist plots or criminal acts.

Landlord and tenant
In terms of privacy, the relationship between landlord and tenant in the United
States is an unbalanced one. In general, laws in all 50 states protect the business
interests of the landlord (i.e., the right to find a desirable tenant and to protect his or
her property) rather than the right to privacy of the tenant. Renting provides a chal-
lenge to privacy, as these owners’ right to protect the rental property often requires
that tenants give up their right to be let alone in their residence or business. Most
states provide some protection from unnecessary landlord intrusions; however, in
order to rent, tenants give up their privacy to credit ratings and reports as well as
background checks, which often give landlords access to both personal and finan-
cial information about prospective tenants. 
Tenants are granted several rights that relate to privacy in rental properties. First,
landlords do not have the right to trespass. Landlords in all states are allowed to
enter their properties without their tenants’ permission only in case of emergencies
that threaten life or property, to make repairs or improvements, and to show prop-
erty to prospective tenants or buyers. Second, landlords are not allowed to invade
tenants’ privacy through harassment, voyeurism, or surveillance. Finally, in all but
three states, tenants have the right to the “covenant of enjoyment” requiring land-
lords to provide a safe and clean living environment. 
Some states have taken additional steps to protect tenants’ right to privacy by
requiring landlords to give prior reasonable notice before entering for non-
emergency reasons. Unfortunately, this protection varies considerably from state to
state, and over half of all states do not have a statute or do not provide notice guide-
lines in their statutes. States that do require landlords to give reasonable notice
require landlords to give notice 12 to 48 hours prior to entry. Most states also allow
courts to decide whether or not landlords gave reasonable notice depending on the
circumstances. States do not necessarily require landlords to give written notice
and do not always specify the time of day when landlords may enter the property.
Delaware specifies that entry must occur between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., and California
requires entry during normal business hours.

Landlord and tenant
\
Although tenants have the right to disallow their landlords from entering their
residences, especially if the latter do not follow state laws, these rights are very
limited. All states grant landlords the right to access, especially if they give reason-
able prior notice, and grant landlords the right to evict and/or end the tenancy if
tenants refuse to let landlords into their residences. Tenants who do not have long-
term leases or who do not live in states that require landlords to provide cause for
ending tenancy are even more at risk if they do not cooperate with their landlords.
Landlords in these cases can terminate residency agreements without cause. 
Landlords are not the only individuals who may have a legal right to invade a
tenant’s residence. Local and state public health and safety inspectors may also
enter a tenant’s residence if they have a warrant or get cooperation from the land-
lord. Landlords in states with reasonable notice are still required to provide prior
notice before letting the inspectors into the residences. Local and state police offi-
cials may also appeal to landlords to gain entry into rental units, but must also pro-
duce a warrant or show probable cause of criminal activity. Landlords who allow
other people in without proper notice or tenant consent are legally liable if there is
damage to or loss of property. In general, tenants’ rights are better protected when
the right of entry and reasonable notice is specified in the lease. 
In addition to routine maintenance and inspections, landlords in most states have
the right to enter residences if they suspect a resident of unlawful behavior. In par-
ticular, landlords are held responsible for protecting their other tenants and their
neighborhood from drug dealing or other dangerous activities. Moreover, landlords
not only are allowed to violate tenants’ privacy if they believe there is drug use or
dealing occurring on the premises, but are financially and legally encouraged to do
so. Landlords who ignore crime violations face lawsuits from tenants hurt by other
tenants; local, state, and federal fines based on nuisance civil laws; criminal
charges; and, in some cases, loss of property. For example, laws in Rhode Island
and Missouri allow tenants to break their leases if landlords refuse to evict tenants
suspected of drug dealing or other illegal activities. 
Landlords do not have the right to harass tenants or their employers at work for
rent payments or other non-emergency reasons. Fair housing laws also prevent
landlords from harassing tenants due to their sex, race, ethnicity, disability, marital
status, and religion. Most states give landlords the right to control the number of
people living within their rental properties, but some landlords use overzealous
measures to enforce those limits, which may be considered invasion of privacy. For
example, requiring tenants to register overnight guests can be considered an unrea-
sonable invasion of privacy. 
Although most state laws protect tenants’ right to privacy from landlords’ entry
into their residences and business, tenants have little protection from landlords’
access to prospective tenants’ personal information. Landlords are legally encour-
aged to obtain information about prospective tenants through proof of identity and
work status, rental applications, references, credit reports, background checks, and
even casual questions. The amount of information landlords are able to obtain to
identify “good tenants” is virtually unlimited, and most laws that protect personal
information in both consumer and government databases allow landlords access.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003
give landlords legal access to tenants’ credit history. Landlords have access to a

Landlord and tenant
\
323
tenant’s bank account, credit history, rent payment history, student loans, and car
loan payments for the past seven years. They also have access to a tenant’s convic-
tion and, in some states, arrest history, eviction history, lawsuit participation
record, and bankruptcy filings. 
In most states, landlords not only have access to this information but may also
charge prospective renters’ fees to do credit checks. While most states protect ten-
ants from fraudulent credit fees, tenants need to get either written or oral notice of
the purpose of the fee and will need to check their credit reports to make sure the
landlord did the credit check. Landlords are granted access to such information
because it is assumed that credit, criminal, and prior rental relationships will pro-
tect landlords from renting to people who are likely to fail to pay rent and who pose
a danger to rental properties. Thus, landlords are allowed to refuse to rent to pro-
spective tenants who have bad credit, criminal histories, or inadequate income to
afford rent for the property. However, if landlords use information obtained in the
credit history to reject prospective tenants, they are legally required to notify them
of the reasons and of their right to see their credit reports. 
Tenants do not have access to landlords’ or managers’ credit histories and must
rely on their own research to assess the desirability of a landlord. Just as landlords
have a financial incentive to check their prospective tenants’ backgrounds, a renter
has an incentive to check the landlord’s background to assess the likelihood that the
landlord will mismanage the property or have to sell it. Legally, tenants must assess
the ability of landlords to manage their properties based on the physical condition
of the facilities and by asking other tenants and neighbors about the landlord or
manager. 
In addition to credit checks, landlords have the right to do further background
checks on prospective tenants, including checks called investigative consumer
reports. These checks have become more popular due to the increasing accessibil-
ity of individuals’ personal information on the Internet. Credit bureaus may also
interview friends, neighbors, and associates of prospective tenants to gain more
information about their character, reputation, and living habits. Some credit-report-
ing companies now offer checks that reveal tenants’ medical histories, including
mental institutionalization and current medical conditions; therefore, landlords can
select possible tenants on the basis of their health, their sexuality, their personal
habits, and other personal characteristics. In addition to criminal records reported
by credit reports, landlords may access court records regarding criminal activities
committed by prospective tenants, including state and Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation (FBI) databases of sexual offenders and child molesters. Although access
varies by state, most landlords have access to local registries of sex offenders to
enable them to protect their rental business. 
As with credit checks, landlords can use background checks to screen out what
may be deemed as undesirable tenants. However, landlords must universally apply
credit and background checks to all tenants or they may face discriminatory
charges under fair housing laws. Thus, landlords cannot impose criminal checks
based on an applicant’s race, gender, or perceived national origin. For instance,
landlords cannot ask only Latino applicants about their work status, require only
Arab applicants to provide proof of citizenship, or choose only single or younger
applicants as subjects for background checks. This protection makes it less likely

324
Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)
\
that landlords will do deeper background checks since they are unlikely to afford
the expense of such checks on all tenants. In addition, landlords must notify the
tenant about why they rejected their application if the rejection was based on the
background check. Landlords must also file “adverse action reports,” which give
reasons for rejecting applications, imposing higher deposits, or requiring cosigners
on a lease. These reports are necessary only if the landlord used a credit or tenant
screening service. Thus, landlords who use the Internet or do personal checks are
not required to disclose why they rejected a prospective tenant. 
Unfortunately, despite state laws that protect tenants’ right to privacy, violations
are often very difficult to enforce. Tenants without long-term leases or rent control
have few protections from landlords if they pursue lawsuits. Tenants are encour-
aged to document all violations in writing and to write to landlords about com-
plaints before taking legal action. Tenants can sue landlords for trespassing,
invasion of privacy, breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and infliction
of emotional distress. Although it is often hard for tenants to win cases, tenants
who are able to show repeated trespassing, sexual harassment, or other problems
with landlords can be successful at winning both civil and criminal cases against
landlords. Unfortunately, if a tenant cannot prove a breach of covenant of quiet
enjoyment by the landlord, moving, which often carries a financial burden, may be
the only real recourse.

Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)
In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the U.S. Supreme Court made up for its prior—
now admitted—mistake in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), by uphold-
ing a challenge to the constitutionality of a Texas sodomy statute that made adult
consensual same-sex behavior a crime, even when performed in private. This vindi-
cation of the “Millian” notion of a self-regarding (i.e., private) act was brought
under the Court’s interpretation of the liberty interest protected by the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court’s majority opinion, however,
focused only on intimate sexual relations between consenting adults. Thus, it may
not be exceptionless. For instance, whether a constitutional challenge to a criminal
law prohibiting the private possession of a controlled substance would survive con-
stitutional muster is by no means clear. 
Similarly uncertain is how the case might apply in a challenge to criminal laws
prohibiting prostitution and the sale of adult pornography. Even with respect to
state recognition of same-sex marriage, the majority was careful to state that the
present case did not address that issue, which a future case might present, since
the issue before the Court was neither the granting of any special recognition nor
the establishment of an entitlement. Perhaps more surprisingly, it is not clear how the

Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)
\
325
Court’s decision impacts criminal sodomy proscriptions in the Uniform Code of Mil-
itary Justice since courts traditionally afford judicial deference to military decisions
as falling outside their expertise and involving a separate society composed of non-
commissioned and commissioned officers. 
Notwithstanding these limitations, however, Lawrence is dispositive of the
Court’s recognition that noncommercial sexual relations among consenting adults
in the civilian area can no longer be criminalized under the Court’s current inter-
pretation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Con-
stitution. Here it is important to take note of Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion,
which stated, “In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past half
century . . . show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantive protection to
adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to
sex.” This recognition that such decisions bear constitutional dignity is the most
salient point of the opinion.
The facts in Lawrence were almost identical to those in Bowers, except the sod-
omy concerned anal sex, not oral sex, and there was a different legal—though still
unrelated to the charge of sodomy—reason for the police entry into the home. One
very interesting aspect of the case is that it came down just 17 years after a similar
Georgia statute was upheld as constitutional in Bowers. Kennedy dealt with this
issue by showing that Bowers was wrong when decided and remains wrong today.
This suggests that the Court really had changed its mind on the question of the con-
stitutional protection afforded to adult consensual same-sex intimate relationships.
Herein lies dissenting Justice Scalia’s concern that Lawrence may open the door to
eventual constitutional recognition of same-sex marriage. The change in descrip-
tion is important also because the move from act to relationship suggests a much
more powerful grant of normative recognition to the parties’ own self-identification.
This is evident in Kennedy’s observation that “[t]he case does involve two adults
who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices
common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their
private lives.” Another important difference between the two cases is that in
Lawrence, the Court seemed willing to pay more attention to extralegal and nonle-
gal sources than had been done by the Bowers Court, suggesting that for only the
second time in recent history a new body of outside source material was being
brought into the area of U.S. constitutional interpretation. This widening of the
range of sources the Court would consider brought a strong rebuff from Scalia and
a nonbinding resolution in the House of Representatives against such further out-
reach. It has also become the subject of a question asked by Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee members of nominees to the Court.
In Lawrence, the Court explicitly overruled Bowers. Writing for the majority,
Kennedy grounded his opinion in several earlier cases, including Griswold v. Con-
necticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), all of which
were privacy cases in the Millian sense and all of which had been available to the
Bowers Court, but which were distinguished there on the narrow reading that they
concerned marriage or procreation. Kennedy’s majority opinion read those earlier
cases more broadly to recognize a fundamental liberty interest in intimate relation-
ships protected by the Due Process Clause. Kennedy’s majority opinion in effect
displaced what dissenting Scalia noted was the previous view of the Court (and, no

326
Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)
\
doubt, was still the view held by himself, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and probably
Justice Thomas), that a particular practice traditionally viewed as immoral could be
“a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.” To the contrary,
Kennedy’s broader due process interpretation would seem to suggest that, absent a
showing of real harm, moral opinion couldn’t be a determinative criterion.
Kennedy’s interpretation of the Due Process Clause in Lawrence would have
been out of step with current law, however, if Bowers were still to be considered
good law. As Lawrence and Bowers are not logically reconcilable, Bowers’ status
as controlling law had to be overcome. Justice Stevens’s dissent in Bowers showing
in what way the majority had gone wrong would now become the controlling law.
It was necessary for the Court to find Bowers to be wrongly decided because, under
a certain version of legal realism (under which American law is sometimes seen to
operate), once Bowers was decided it became part of the very law that Kennedy had
to interpret. Indeed, even from the position of a natural law theorist, Kennedy’s
decision would be problematic if Bowers were deemed morally correct.
As a ground for overturning Bowers, Kennedy showed that the suppositions deter-
mining that decision—views of Western civilization toward homosexuality—were
incorrect and inadequate ways of explaining both the law that preceded it and the law
ensuing from it. First, Kennedy examined the history and weak enforcement of sod-
omy statutes that preceded Bowers. Second, he noted that the prior development of
the Model Penal Code—put forward by legal scholars of the American Law Institute
and adopted in some variation by the legislatures of a number of states—disavowed
making private, consensual, adult sexual activity criminal. Third, the post-Bowers
case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833
(1992), re-affirmed Roe v. Wade and thus continued the recognition that the Due Pro-
cess Clause protected deep-seated values in personal autonomy and human dignity.
Finally, Kennedy focused on various recent international human rights documents
and decisions affirming privacy and equality rights for gays and lesbians.
What is striking is that Kennedy’s opinion in Lawrence is difficult to fit into a
standard positivist model of law, like that of English philosopher H. L. A. Hart.
This difficulty exists because Hart not only treats positivism as separating law from
morality and providing an analytical analysis of concepts, but also treats it as estab-
lishing formal criteria for determining what the law is. In other words, if a statute
or case decision has the correct pedigree, it is the law regardless of whether we like
its content. Kennedy’s view is arguably, however, more consistent with that of
American philosopher Ronald Dworkin because Kennedy attempts to balance pre-
viously established principles against those raised in Bowers. However, the Dwor-
kin model cannot easily explain why the weight of relevant principles may now
have shifted. Internal principles, including those directing courts to take account of
society’s changing views, are themselves relative to such change. What Kennedy
did not do was articulate a clear way of answering these questions within the
American constitutional framework. While Kennedy’s decision may appear intu-
itively correct, the task of formulating such an articulation of how to answer these
questions within the American constitutional framework is still incomplete. In part,
this may be because such changes in a principle’s weight reflect society’s changing
idea of the classes to whom these principles applied. Still, connecting that change
to law in a way that is not ad hoc requires some deeper view of rationality that must

underlie both law and morality. Neither Kennedy’s opinion, nor any of the other
concurring or dissenting opinions, addressed that deeper view.

Library records
The privacy and confidentiality of library patrons’ use of library services and
materials are protected both by statute in many national, state, and provincial juris-
dictions and by the policies and ethical codes of many libraries and professional
library associations. The American Library Association (ALA) defines privacy as
“the right to open inquiry without having the subject of one’s interest examined or
scrutinized by others” and confidentiality as the condition that exists “when a
library is in possession of personally identifiable information about users and
keeps that information private on their behalf.”
Protection of patron privacy was a core value of library practice in many coun-
tries long before digital technology was introduced and used to automate such
library operations as maintaining circulation records. As in other sectors of society,
however, the importance of privacy and confidentiality in library use has grown as
information technology has both automated traditional functions and—via net-
working—become the primary vehicle for delivering library catalogs, indexes,
journals, and reference services. For library users in many parts of the world, most
interactions with a library are now mediated through technology capable of track-
ing and storing their questions, searches, and reading choices. In the United States,
in particular, the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the legislative
responses—especially the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
(USA PATRIOT Act)—have raised important questions about the relationship
between privacy rights and national security. 
In the United States, state and federal laws have provided, directly and indi-
rectly, some protections for the records of library patrons. Whether or not a library
is publicly funded (by state or local governments) will typically determine how and
to what degree it must offer its users legal protections for their data privacy. Public
libraries and state-funded institutions such as university libraries generally fall
under this protection, while private libraries owned and run by nonprofit organiza-
tions or commercial entities may not. 
Federal law does not specifically protect or define the privacy rights of users of
libraries. Broadly stated protections of the rights of the citizenry to their personal
privacy can be understood to also cover library users’ information to some degree.

328
Library records
\
The U.S. Constitution provides a framework for the development of laws that pro-
tect citizens’ privacy without specifically mentioning privacy. The Fourth Amend-
ment’s “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures” is a good example. Court cases
have interpreted the wording of the Constitution to grant protections to its citizens
in a variety of ways, as have new laws enacted to define those rights. An example
of such a law is the Privacy Act of 1974, which helped develop the concept of fair
information practices for the handling of personal information by the federal
government. 
State statutes, by contrast, typically provide some specific protections against
the disclosure of records maintained or collected by publicly funded libraries.
Under California state law, for example, personal information maintained by librar-
ies is kept confidential, as are circulation records that include any information that
would “identify patrons borrowing particular books and other material.” A New
York state statute defines more broadly and directly the kind of patron records and
personal information that is protected and kept confidential, from circulation
records to database searches and interlibrary loan requests, except as required for
the running of the library, by proper permission of the library user, or by court
order. The state of Texas exempts library records from its Open Government/Ethics
statutes. 
State statutes generally allow for disclosure of patron information under specific
circumstances—for example, to library personnel for the running of the library, to
the user or a designated proxy, or to legal entities when required by court order or
subpoena. Overall, however, state statutes offer a degree of protection to the data
generated by library users in their interactions with library resources and services.
These data include personal status information like date of birth, address, and tele-
phone number. Other protected data include information about whether the patron
has checked out materials or viewed websites and the kind of assistance the patron
has requested from library staff or automated services. 
The passage of the USA PATRIOT Act amended over 100 sections of 15 federal
statutes and lowered the bar for access to otherwise protected information of
library users. These alterations now give federal agents access to “any tangible
things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items)” even if the
person being investigated is merely a “suspect in a current investigation.” The act
also prohibits the disclosure of the federal request for the records or tangible items.
The codes of many national and international library associations tie privacy
rights to intellectual freedom as core values of the library profession. In its State-
ment on Libraries and Intellectual Freedom, the International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutions (IFLA) states that library users “shall have the right
to personal privacy and anonymity. Librarians and other library staff shall not dis-
close the identity of users or the materials they use to a third party.” Similarly, the
American Library Association states that privacy “is essential to the exercise of
free speech, free thought, and free association” and that “rights of privacy are nec-
essary for intellectual freedom and are fundamental to the ethics and practice of
librarianship” (“Privacy: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights”). Its Code
of Ethics declares that librarians must “protect each library user’s right to privacy
and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources

\

consulted, borrowed, acquired, or transmitted.” Without assurance of privacy, the
ALA argues, library users may be inhibited in their intellectual inquiries: questions
posed at a reference desk; books requested, borrowed, or read; or Internet searches
performed. 
Furthermore, according to the ALA, patrons “have the right to use a library
without any abridgement of privacy that may result from equating the subject of
their inquiry with behavior.” Automated methods of information tracking make it
possible to develop detailed intellectual profiles from the inquiries of individual
patrons, and patrons who are aware of this possibility may be deterred in their
inquiries. Moreover, these profiles can easily be misinterpreted, leading to errone-
ous conclusions regarding an individual’s purposes or intentions in making an
inquiry. Library privacy policies therefore typically focus on safeguarding person-
ally identifiable information rather than minimizing physical surveillance.
As noted above, the USA PATRIOT Act requires libraries to produce any tangible
items upon demand by a law enforcement agent. Insofar as these items may bear per-
sonally identifiable information, the act conflicts with the ALA’s traditional position
on patron privacy and confidentiality. In response, the ALA developed a privacy tool-
kit to help libraries understand, develop, and implement local privacy protection poli-
cies. In this toolkit, the ALA urges libraries to ensure that their policies limit the
degree to which personally identifiable information is monitored, collected, dis-
closed, and distributed; avoid creating unnecessary records; discard records once they
are no longer needed for efficient operation of the library; and avoid practices that
place personally identifiable information in public view. 
Increasingly, the information resources provided by libraries to their users—
including electronic journals, citation databases, and online reference software
(sometimes called “chat”)—are hosted not on the library’s own computer servers
but on computers owned by the publisher or vendor. This may result in information
being collected about library patrons without their knowledge and outside the con-
trol of the library that pays for the services. A statement by the International Coali-
tion of Library Consortia (ICOLC) calls upon vendors of such electronic services
not to disclose “information about any individual user of its products. . . , including
information about the specific content of a user’s searches, to a third party without
the permission of that individual user, except as required by law” (2002). At the
same time, various library associations encourage individual libraries to ensure that
their subscription contracts (licenses) include guarantees that vendors will maintain
the confidentiality of usage data, including information relating to the identity of
specific users and uses.

Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967)
The private right to marry whom one chooses has been at the heart of due pro-
cess judicial cases since the early 1960s. Laws that generally limit one’s choice in
marriage or that tend to restrict the rights of a class of persons to marry will not be
upheld unless the state can show a compelling interest in the restriction or in main-
taining the classification. Loving v. Virginia represents an early Supreme Court case
that established the fundamental constitutional right to marriage and the notion that
laws restricting this right should be subject to the strictest of scrutiny under the Due
Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution. The Supreme Court unanimously decided Loving v. Virginia, and
Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion. 
The decision in Loving v. Virginia concerned the legality of anti-miscegenation
statutes, which were laws that banned the mixing of different ethnicities, especially
in marriage. The Supreme Court declared the Virginia statutes unconstitutional and
thus ended all race-based legal restrictions on marriage in the United States. At the
time Loving v. Virginia was decided, Virginia was one of 16 states that prohibited
and punished marriages on the basis of racial classifications. 
In June 1958, Mildred Jeter, an African American woman, and Richard Lov-
ing, a white man, were married in the District of Columbia. Both were residents
of Virginia but were forced to legalize their marriage in another state due to Vir-
ginia’s anti-miscegenation statutes. The laws at issue in this case absolutely pro-
hibited a white person from marrying any person of another race or ethnicity.
After their marriage in the District of Columbia, the Lovings returned to Virginia
and resided in Caroline County. In October 1958, the Circuit Court of Caroline
County charged the Lovings with violating Virginia’s ban on interracial mar-
riage. They pleaded guilty to the charge and initially were sentenced to one year
in jail. The trial court of Caroline County, however, suspended the Lovings’ one-
year jail sentence on the condition that the couple leave Virginia and not return
for a period of 25 years.
To challenge the trial court’s sentence in Virginia, the Lovings filed a motion in
the state trial court on November 6, 1963, requesting that the judgment be set aside
on the grounds that the laws in Virginia banning interracial marriage violated the
Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This amendment provides for
equal protection of the laws and that no state shall deprive any person of life, lib-
erty, or property without due process. The Lovings’ motion to dismiss the judg-
ment was denied by the state trial judge and was later affirmed by the Virginia
Supreme Court of Appeals. The Lovings’ case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court in April 1967.

The Supreme Court decision in Loving v. Virginia was significant because it
established marriage as a fundamental constitutional right of privacy for all citizens
that could not be restricted by laws that denied the right based solely on racial clas-
sifications. Laws that use only race to determine the validity of marriage violate the
Equal Protection Clause and also deny citizens of due process by depriving the
individual of the freedom of choice of whom to marry. 
Concerning the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, there
were two Virginia state statutes under which the Lovings were convicted and sen-
tenced that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned. These statutes were part of a com-
prehensive body of law aimed at prohibiting and punishing interracial marriages.
The first statute provided that if any white person and “colored” person left the
state of Virginia for the purpose of being married and with the intention of return-
ing to cohabitate as man and wife, they shall be punished under the laws of the
state. The second statute punished both parties of an interracial marriage with a fel-
ony conviction and confinement in the penitentiary for a period of one to five years.
These and other parts of Virginia’s statutory scheme making interracial marriage
illegal originated from the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. 
With respect to marriage, privacy, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee
of equal protection, the state of Virginia first argued for the validity of state statutes
based on classifications deemed appropriate by state legislatures to regulate the pri-
vate choice of marriage. The court decisions in Virginia that found the Lovings’
marriage illegal held that since marriage was traditionally subject to state regula-
tion without federal intervention, the regulation of marriage should be left to exclu-
sive state control under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Furthermore, the state of Virginia argued that the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment means only that state penal laws dealing with interracial
elements must apply equally to members of each race. The miscegenation statutes
at issue, according to the state of Virginia, punished both parties to the interracial
marriage equally and to the same degree. 
In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision
and held that statutes banning interracial marriage violated the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thus were unconstitutional. According to
the Supreme Court, state powers to regulate marriage are not unlimited and that the
mere equal application of a statute containing racial classifications does not remove
the statute’s legality from the commands of the U.S. Constitution. The purpose of
the Fourteenth Amendment was to remove “invidious racial classifications” from
all forms of law. Whether the statutes punished both races equally was irrelevant
since the restriction served no compelling state interest other than racial discrimi-
nation. Citizens are entitled to make the private choice of whom to marry free from
arbitrary state regulation. In contrast, where discrimination is not based on racial
classifications, the courts will tend to ask whether there is any rational foundation
for discrimination and often will defer to the wisdom of state legislatures. 
The opinion delivered by Chief Justice Warren was significant for issues of pri-
vacy and marriage because in cases following Loving v. Virginia any law that
attempts to draw distinctions according to race would be subject to the most rigid
scrutiny to determine constitutionality. The type of scrutiny to be applied to statutes
restricting fundamental rights based solely on race had important implications for

332
Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967)
\
how the court system in the United States would decide issues relating to privacy
following the opinion. There was no doubt that Virginia’s law banning interracial
marriage rested exclusively upon distinctions based on racial classifications. Since
these types of statutes must pass the most rigid scrutiny in order to be found consti-
tutional, it must be shown that the laws in question are necessary to the accom-
plishment of some state objective that is independent of racial discrimination.
While the state of Virginia attempted to argue that the scientific evidence concern-
ing interracial marriage was substantially in doubt, the Supreme Court found that
there was no legitimate overriding purpose to the anti-miscegenation statutes inde-
pendent of “invidious racial discrimination” that could justify the classification.
The clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, according to Chief
Justice Warren, was to eliminate all official state sources of racial discrimination in
the U.S. legal system, and this was assuredly necessary in laws that attempted to
regulate the most private choices of citizens. 
Concerning how the statutes deprived the Lovings of liberty without due process
of law, the Supreme Court explained that the freedom to marry is a vital personal
right that is “essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness” by all citizens. To deny
this important private right based on unsupportable racial classifications was
directly subversive of the principles of equality guaranteed in the Fourteenth
Amendment. Following Loving v. Virginia, there was no doubt that decisions
about whether or not to marry, and whom to marry, were, at least for hetero-
sexuals, personal and private rights residing solely with individuals, and could
not be restricted by any law or regulation.

Manners
Manners refer to the quality of a person’s conduct and comportment, particu-
larly toward others. Manners express degrees of politeness, regard, and respect
toward others. Manners are also believed to indicate something about the character
of the person who exhibits them. Manners are moral matters; people are obliged to
observe how they treat others, and in return, they are judged by their mannerly con-
duct. Manners are learned through socialization and are typically governed and
sanctioned informally through interactions in everyday life. 
Common sense suggests that manners are internalized, deep-seated, and
ingrained in people’s character. Thus, people have good or bad manners. An indi-
vidual who displays good manners minimally demonstrates basic regard and cour-
tesy toward others, if not deference and respect. Having no or bad manners may be
indicated by the absence of behaviors that display positive regard or respect, as
well as by conduct toward others that is perceived as impolite, disagreeable, or
rude. While manners primarily characterize a person’s actions toward others, they
are also interpreted as reflecting the character of the individual displaying them. In
everyday usage, having good manners may indicate that an individual is refined,
urbane, or privileged; whereas having no or bad manners may indicate that one is
common, coarse, or of a lower social class.
However, it may not be that simple. Sociologists such as Erving Goffman sug-
gest that individuals deliberately manipulate their conduct, including their man-
ners, to enhance their self-image and status by gaining others’ approval. Everyday
life is replete with such performances of the self. In both the commonsense and
sociological views, manners may be more about the self than the other; through a
person’s actions toward others, the individual displays the self. 
What is considered good or bad manners is to a great extent culturally and his-
torically variable and relative; this does not negate the principle that being polite
and respectful of others is a basic expectation of ordinary social life in most times
and places. Common courtesies such as saying “thank you” for services rendered,
waiting one’s turn in line, or apologizing for negligible slights toward others are
\
\

334
Manners
\
widespread. Everyday courtesies usually require people to pay attention to the feel-
ings of others, acknowledging and displaying regard for them when in their pres-
ence. However, these daily courtesies also include practicing “civil inattention,”
ignoring and disregarding others engaged in private behaviors in publicly shared
settings, as well as displaying tact—disregarding minor, accidental behavioral
transgressions of others to spare them embarrassment. Thus, there are times when
people should pay attention to others and times when they should purposefully not
pay attention to others. For instance, while it is considered polite to greet one
another, it is considered impolite to eavesdrop on someone’s conversation, to
glance at someone using a urinal in a public restroom, to stand too close to some-
one making a financial transaction at an automatic teller machine (ATM), or to
draw public attention to the presence of food in someone’s teeth.
In showing respect toward others, maintaining the proper equilibrium between
attention and inattention highlights another tension—social proximity; manners
oblige us to distinguish and maintain the distinction between private and public
spheres. While good manners might encourage inquiring about the well-being of
another, such as by asking, “How are you?”, they also discourage inquiring too
deeply or engaging in gossip about others, as well as imposing one’s own private
matters on others. Good manners also prescribe a degree of spatial distance. Taking
the seat right next to the lone person on a bus is likely to be perceived as an inva-
sion of personal space. Being courteous to others requires negotiating a delicate
balance between public and private spheres and interest and disinterest, as well as
honoring an appropriate degree of social and spatial proximity. 
Exhibiting good manners purportedly functions to harmonize social interaction
and to facilitate civility in shared public space. Learning manners also purportedly
helps individuals draw boundaries between acceptable public and private conduct.
Recent technological advances have blurred this boundary and have created the
potential for new forms of discourtesy. Impolite or uncivil conduct in impersonal
forums such as Internet communications has given rise to “netiquette.” Similarly,
conversing on the telephone, once confined to the private sphere, now is often quite
public. The widespread ownership of cellular telephones enables users to carry on
private conversations in public. While infractions of what is considered polite
behavior are typically informally sanctioned, the incessant ringing of cell phones in
public places such as restaurants, libraries, theaters, museums, and classrooms has
become such a nuisance that many such public places have established formal poli-
cies governing their use. In addition, the inappropriate use of cell phones is
regarded by some as a public menace. The potentially danger of using cell phones
while driving has led to laws proscribing their use in automobiles. Also, for the
first time, in 2005 the Sprint Corporation sponsored the declaration of July as
“National Cell Phone Courtesy Month.” 
Increasing stress associated with a fast pace of life, combined with congested
public space, is credited with producing new forms of ill-mannered conduct, esca-
lating formerly ordinary foul gestures while driving to the status of “road rage.”
These social conditions and others, such as changing gender and sexual norms,
have also led to ambiguity regarding what bodily parts can be properly exposed in
public. Attempts to formally regulate the increasing exposure of the body, includ-
ing private parts, in public have failed more often than they have succeeded.

Though still a highly contentious issue, it is no longer unusual for women to
breastfeed their children in public. Most states in the United States now have
breastfeeding laws that both permit and circumscribe breastfeeding in public
places. Some states, such as Illinois, permit women to breastfeed at any public or
private location; others, such as Virginia, allow breastfeeding in public places
only on state-controlled property, permitting private property owners to establish
their own policies. In 2005 the Virginia General Assembly made international
news for considering a bill to criminalize “droopy drawers,” the trend among
youth of wearing pants or skirts so low that underwear hangs visibly over the top.
Changing norms governing the body and sexuality have also given rise to new
terms for behavior once considered appropriate only in private, such as “public
displays of affection.” 
Changing norms of privacy have challenged previously held standards of
politeness and courtesy in the other direction as well. During the colonial period
in the United States, prospective married couples were expected to post a
“bann” in the public square announcing their engagement and inviting public
comment and objections from members of the community. Today, publicly voic-
ing an objection to a couple’s engagement would be considered not only impo-
liteness but interference. Today, the public vows of marriage are deemed private
matters.
Manners ostensibly function to show respect for others to enable people to
peacefully coexist, to be civilized. Civility obliges people to exercise self restraint,
as suggested by the phrase that a person can “disagree but not be disagreeable.”
Critics have protested that manners have been invoked to maintain a “negative
peace,” to minimize open conflict or quash disagreement or dissent, and to deny
individual expression. In the name of manners, people may be expected not to dis-
agree, however agreeably, because disagreement itself might “cause a scene,” or to
accept practices that serve as a pretense for maintaining hierarchical social roles
and class distinctions or that justify social inequality. The expectation that men
should open doors for women and that black men should avoid direct eye contact
with white women have been framed as chivalrous, cast in protectionist terms for
all parties, and contested as sexist and racist.
Finally, the business of manners is big business. From advice columns to maga-
zines, books, and institutes, specialists in the art of manners are devoted to civiliz-
ing people, helping them avoid faux pas, and cultivating habits that bestow an air of
confidence, grace, and success in every social and professional occasion. The
ephemeral boundary between public and private guarantees that minding one’s
manners will remain an elusive pursuit.

McCarthyism
\
McCarthyism
The term “McCarthyism” was first used in a cartoon by Herbert Bloom pub-
lished on March 29, 1950, in the Washington Post. It initially referred to an extreme
form of conservative anti-Communism, associated with Senator Joseph McCarthy,
aimed at identifying and eliminating domestic Communist threats to the U.S. gov-
ernment. This anti-Communist agenda was often pursued at the expense of basic
civil liberties such as freedom of association and the right to privacy. McCarthyism
is also used to refer to a more general cultural and political milieu in which con-
cerns about national security and the threat of Communism took precedence over
the protection of civil liberties and personal privacy. Generally associated with the
Red Scare of the 1940s and 1950s, the term is still sometimes used pejoratively by
political dissenters who believe government policies are encroaching on the basic
rights of citizens. 
McCarthyism, narrowly defined, began in 1950 when Senator McCarthy gave a
speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, proclaiming that he had a list of known Com-
munist loyalists who worked in the State Department. As a broader cultural and
political phenomenon, it can be traced back to the 1930s. During this period a fun-
damental shift occurred in which liberal anti-Communism was abandoned in favor
of a conservative anti-Communist agenda. The initial response by the U.S. govern-
ment to the growth of American Communism was to undermine the Communist
Party by integrating several of its key issues into government policy. By increasing
the federal government’s involvement in dealing with poverty, unemployment, and
social inequality, liberal anti-Communists hoped to make Communism a less
appealing alternative. However, by the late 1930s, conservative anti-Communists
had gained significant influence in both the Democratic and Republican parties and
introduced a number of strategies aimed at eliminating Communist threats through
coercion rather than appeasement. 
The formation of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in
1938 marked the arrival of conservative anti-Communism on the national political
scene. HUAC played a central role in redefining domestic Communism from a mat-
ter of political opinion to one of national security, setting the stage for McCarthy’s
rise to prominence. HUAC was the driving force behind the Alien and Registration
Act of 1940, which criminalized the advocacy of revolutionary political ideologies
and association with organizations that engaged in such advocacy. Furthermore,
HUAC initiated a series of highly publicized hearings aimed at exposing the infil-
tration of Communists and Soviet sympathizers into American institutions and
organizations, including the federal government and labor unions. In these hear-
ings, HUAC members made sweeping, often unsubstantiated allegations. They
offered a portrayal of American Communism that was severely distorted yet plausible
enough to be persuasive. In this way, the HUAC hearings established a set of strat-
egies that would be adopted by the Permanent Investigating Subcommittee of the
Government Operations Committee chaired by McCarthy. But they also contrib-
uted to the dehumanization of Communists within American culture, portraying
them as ideological outlaws that deserved to be punished.
The year 1950 marked the beginning of the McCarthy era proper. In the mid-
dle of that year, North Korean military forces invaded South Korea. Though the
United States’ involvement in the conflict was defined as a police action, it

McCarthyism
\

became a constant reminder that the Cold War was not simply a clash of ideolo-
gies, but had tangible costs. On the domestic front, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
were charged as Soviet spies for providing the Soviet Union with highly classified
information on the development of atomic weaponry. Their arrests provided the
ammunition conservative anti-Communists needed to legitimize their attack on
domestic Communism. Congress was able to pass the Internal Security Act of
1950, which further restricted organizations and members of organizations deemed
Communist. Also during this year, the newsletter Counterattack became the first
publication listing entertainers believed to be Communist Party members or “fel-
low travelers”—a term used to refer to those with opinions and associations similar
to those of Communists. 
It was in the beginning of this year that McCarthy made the famous speech in
which he proclaimed that he had a list of names of known Communists in the State
Department, thus taking center stage in the anti-Communist movement. McCarthy
quickly became the most sought-after political spokesperson for the Republican
Party, receiving over 2000 invitations to speak at events leading up to the 1950
elections. He, along with many other Republicans, turned Communism into a
major issue in the elections by labeling many Democratic candidates as soft on
Communism. These charges were only moderately successful, as local issues
tended to weigh more heavily on voters, and several Democratic candidates (such
as Brion McMahon of Connecticut and Thomas Hennings of Missouri) won
despite personal appearances for their opponents by McCarthy.
Charges of Communism by McCarthy and other extremists escalated during
1951 and 1952. Secretary of Defense George Marshall was accused of passively
facilitating and even conspiring with Communists within the executive branch.
Actor-director Charlie Chaplin was publicly accused of being Communist by
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover and eventually
had his visa revoked while he was out of the country on vacation. Extensive hear-
ings by HUAC and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS) continued to
investigate Communist influence within government agencies and labor unions,
and among high-profile celebrities and artists. During this time, HUAC alone spent
108 days in hearings encompassing 34 separate investigations. Yet the activities of
these two committees would be overshadowed by McCarthy’s Government Opera-
tions Committee hearings, which began in 1953 and would last through the early
part of 1954. Though limited to the investigation of government agencies and
employees, McCarthy’s obstreperous personality and over-the-top tactics attracted
a great deal of attention from the media, as did his sweeping claims of Communist
infiltration.
The overarching purpose of these congressional hearings was twofold. Conser-
vative anti-Communists used them to influence the broader social standards of
political orthodoxy versus heresy in the United States. Yet they also were aimed at
discrediting and marginalizing specific individuals. The hearings themselves could
not convict suspect witnesses of any crimes and, in fact, had no practical legislative
purpose. However, they were used to condemn individuals without adhering to the
standards of due process. Hundreds of witnesses were fired by their employers and
blacklisted in their industries. The hysteria spurred by the hearings also led to other
forms of repression against perceived Communists and political dissidents. The

338
McCarthyism
\
most infamous was the Hollywood blacklist, which caused the expulsion of thou-
sands of actors, directors, writers, and technical workers from their labor guilds and
denied them employment in Hollywood movie productions. 
The response to the anti-Communist extremists by presidents Truman and Eisen-
hower was inconsistent. Both presidents adopted a conservative anti-Communist
agenda, though one more moderate than that pursued by McCarthy. Truman did
cooperate with the Tydings Committee, which was set up to investigate McCarthy
and the validity of his claims, and viewed the activities of some loyalty boards to be
un-American; yet he also gave numerous speeches on the threat of domestic Com-
munism. His administration continued to emphasize the arrests of Communists and
pushed for the loyalty standard for the termination of employment to be changed
from “reasonable grounds” to “reasonable doubt.” The latter resulted in the termi-
nation of 565 public employees who had previously been vindicated in hearings
before the Loyalty Review Board (LRB).
During the beginning of Eisenhower’s term, the president continually appeased
McCarthy. His administration launched investigations for the denaturalization of
10,000 citizens and for the deportation of 12,000 aliens. It also expanded the ability
of the executive branch to dismiss federal employees on loyalty issues, resulting in
1500 more employees being terminated (90 percent without receiving any form of
hearing). However, by mid-1953 the administration began publicly denouncing
McCarthy and openly challenging his attempts to investigate the American clergy
and the CIA. Truman and Eisenhower did eventually challenge McCarthy, but both
played significant roles in increasing the hysteria associated with McCarthyism.
McCarthy remained a powerful political player for only a few more years. As
1953 wore on, his image worsened in the national media, particularly in television
interviews. Media personalities such as newscaster Edward R. Murrow increas-
ingly ran stories that were critical of McCarthy’s tactics, further damaging his pub-
lic reputation. The climax of McCarthy’s self-destruction came during the televised
McCarthy-Army hearings on June 24, 1954. As McCarthy made another of his
crass accusations of Communist leanings, Senator Joseph Welch interjected, “Have
you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?” The
Senate chamber erupted in applause, and its reverberations were felt by television
viewers across the country. McCarthy lost much of the public support he had previ-
ously enjoyed, and the Senate voted to condemn him on December 2. 
McCarthyism itself would continue on for another two years. However, it too
was crippled in the aftermath of the McCarthy-Army hearings, as television was no
longer permitted to air the congressional hearings that had fueled the anti-Commu-
nist hysteria among the general public. The McCarthy era is generally considered
to have ended in 1956, when a series of Supreme Court cases (including Slochower
v. Board, 351 U.S. 551 (1956) and Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536 (1956)) began to
curb the repressive policies initiated under the guise of national security and to
reinstate basic civil liberties.

Mere Evidence Rule
Mere evidence is evidence seized from a person’s home that the government has
no property interest in and that is intended only to be used as evidence against the
property owner. Mere evidence cannot be the fruits or instrumentalities of a crime
or contraband. Mere evidence was the subject of an evidentiary rule adopted by the
Supreme Court in 1921 and abandoned in 1967. The rule prevented the admission
of such evidence at trial. The intent of the rule was to prevent the compelled self-
incriminating testimony of the homeowner. The rule barred the issuance of a
search warrant when the goal was only to seize mere evidence. Instead, whether a
search was conducted with a warrant, or without a warrant but under the appropriate
circumstances, authorities could only seize fruits and instrumentalities of a crime
or contraband.
The rule had its genesis in Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298 (1921). In
1918, Gouled was suspected of conspiring to defraud the government in dealings
for clothing and equipment needed for the war effort. The government induced an
Army private who was a friend of Gouled to secure access to Gouled’s office and
records. The private did just that and, while Gouled was out of the room, seized
several documents that were later offered in evidence against Gouled. Gouled had
no idea the documents had been removed. After the first seizure, the government
obtained two different search warrants and seized additional documents to use
against Gouled at trial.
The Supreme Court had no difficulty resolving the case. It ruled that none of the
documents had been properly admitted against Gouled. The initial search and sei-
zure by the Army private were both unreasonable and unconstitutional. 
The two search warrants used to seize the additional documents were proper on
their face, as the documents were identified as instrumentalities of a crime. The
problem for the Court lay in the nature of the documents seized. The Court noted,
“There is no statement . . . of the contents of these papers, but it is said of them
only, that they belonged to Gouled, that they were without pecuniary value, and
that they constituted evidence more or less injurious to the defendant.” 
The Court relied on common law and prior Supreme Court rulings to find that
only “stolen or forfeited property, or property liable to duties and concealed to
avoid payment of them, excisable articles and books required by law to be kept
with respect to them, counterfeit coin, burglars’ tools and weapons, implements of
gambling ‘and many other things of like character’ might be searched for in home
or office, and if found might be seized.” But search warrants could not be lawfully
“used as a means of gaining access to a man’s house or office and papers solely for
the purpose of making search to secure evidence to be used against him in a crimi-
nal or penal proceeding.”
The Court did note that there was no special protection for papers. Indeed, it
listed several circumstances under which papers could legally be searched for and

340
Mere Evidence Rule
\
seized, such as searches for stolen or forged papers, lottery tickets when it is illegal
to possess them, or even contracts when their seizure will prevent further fraud. In
this instance, however, the Court held that the seizure of papers solely for the pur-
pose of using them as evidence against their owner was the equivalent of the
owner’s forced testimony against himself and was constitutionally protected. The
Court’s position was, in essence, based on property interests. When the govern-
ment’s property interest was superior to that of a homeowner, search and seizure
was appropriate. When the government had no property interest in the items,
search and seizure was unlawful.
In 1967, as the Supreme Court rejected the rule in Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S.
294 (1967), Justice Brennan noted that in the years between 1921 and 1967, the
mere evidence rule “spawned exceptions so numerous and confusion so great, in
fact, that it is questionable whether it affords meaningful protection.” Indeed, by
1967 the court had extended privacy rights to prohibit seizure “of the very items
which at common law could be seized with impunity: stolen goods, instrumentalities,
and contraband.” 
The facts in Warden were interesting, although, in truth, they did not play an
overwhelming role in the Court’s decision. During the early morning hours on
March 17, 1962, an armed man stole $363 from Baltimore’s Diamond Cab Com-
pany and ran. Two taxi drivers outside the office saw the man flee and followed.
During the chase they gave their dispatcher a description of the man and provided
the address of the home the man had entered. The dispatcher relayed the information
to police. Within minutes, police arrived at the scene and were given permission by
the suspect’s wife to search the home. 
Officers searched through the two residential floors and the basement of the
home looking for the suspect. He was found in an upstairs bedroom in bed pretend-
ing to be asleep. In other parts of the home, officers found guns hidden in a running
toilet and the clothes the suspect had worn during the robbery in a washing
machine. Ammunition for one of the guns was found under the suspect’s mattress.
Ammunition for another gun was found in a bureau. All the evidence was admitted
at trial. On appeal in a habeas action, the federal Court of Appeals ruled the search
proper, but the clothing was immune from seizure since it was mere evidence and it
should not have been admitted at trial.
The Supreme Court rejected the argument, noting
Nothing in the language of the Fourth Amendment supports the distinction between
‘mere evidence’ and instrumentalities, fruits of crime, or contraband. . . . Privacy is
disturbed no more by a search directed to a purely evidentiary object than it is by a
search directed to an instrumentality, fruit, or contraband [and] nothing in the nature
of property seized as evidence renders it more private than property seized, for example,
as an instrumentality; quite the opposite may be true. Indeed, the distinction is wholly
irrational, since, depending on the circumstances, the same ‘papers and effects’ may
be ‘mere evidence’ in one case and ‘instrumentality’ in another.
Justice Brennan explained that the proposition that the Fourth Amendment was
designed to protect property rights had long been discredited. Instead, he declared,
“We have recognized that the principal object of the Fourth Amendment is the pro-
tection of privacy rather than property.” To achieve the balance frequently needed, he

Mere Evidence Rule
\
341
explained the court had adopted the “remedy of exclusion.” The idea that government
must prove a superior property interest to justify a search and seizure was a fiction
that obscured the fact that government had a serious interest in solving crime.
The Court held that “[t]he requirements of the Fourth Amendment can secure
the same protection of privacy whether the search is for ‘mere evidence’ or for
fruits, instrumentalities, or contraband.” It added that the possibility of suppression
when rights are violated actually provides more protection to individuals because it
allows them to assert constitutional protections without claiming any property
interests. In effect, privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment were seen to be
superior to property rights.
Privacy advocates, however, would not cheer the decision. Warden was argu-
ably the death knell for any claim that the search of a person’s home for evidence
constituted an impermissible effort by government to force the homeowner’s
self-incriminating testimony. Indeed, the long-held notions of what constituted
self-incrimination or testimony have fallen by the wayside as the courts will now
allow seizure of conversations, voice and handwriting exemplars, demonstrative
evidence, fingerprints, blood and urine samples, and fingernail and skin scrap-
ings. In some instances, these seizures can be made without a warrant provided
the government can show that its special needs are met.
The decision also effectively opened the doors of any home when officers can
show probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime, fruits or instrumentalities
of a crime, or contraband might be found in that home. The reliance on suppression
provides little protection for the homeowner who didn’t want the sanctity of the
home invaded in the first place.
Finally, a third consequence of Warden’s rejection of the mere evidence rule was
that it opened the door for police to search the homes of third parties—people not
personally suspected of committing crimes—for evidence to be used in the prose-
cution of another. This extension was confirmed in Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436
U.S. 547 (1978), in which the Court held
Under existing law, valid warrants may be issued to search any property, whether or
not occupied by a third party, at which there is probable cause to believe that fruits,
instrumentalities, or evidence of a crime will be found. Nothing on the face of the
Amendment suggests that a third-party search warrant should not normally issue. The
Warrant Clause speaks of search warrants issued on “probable cause” and “particu-
larly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” In
situations where the State does not seek to seize “persons,” but only those “things”
which there is probable cause to believe are located on the place to be searched, there
is no apparent basis in the language of the Amendment for also imposing the require-
ments for a valid arrest—probable cause to believe that the third party is implicated in
the crime. 
If the mere evidence rule still applied, the privacy of those third parties would
be protected since the searches authorized by Zurcher would only be for mere
evidence.

Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX)
The Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange, or MATRIX, pro-
gram was an attempt by state government to use data mining to fight crime and
terrorism on the national and local levels following the attacks of September 11,
2001. MATRIX was a consortium of law enforcement and state agencies that
joined law enforcement records with other government and private-sector data-
bases in an attempt to find patterns, relationships, and links among people. The
MATRIX project was administered by the Institute for Intergovernmental
Research, funded under the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office
of Domestic Preparedness ($8 million) and the Department of Justice’s Bureau
of Justice Assistance ($4 million), and managed by the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement. 
The MATRIX program utilized the private data aggregation company Seisint
Inc. and its locate-and-research tool called Accurint. The system digitally identi-
fied and tagged over 3.9 billion public records containing information and data on
almost everyone within the United States. The program applied Factual Analysis
Criminal Threat Solution (FACTS), which gave law enforcement the ability to
query available public records even with incomplete information like partial license
plate numbers or incomplete names. This massive data reservoir was then analyzed
and scored to generate leads and expedite investigations. The resulting information
was then shared with law enforcement. 
The computer-generated scores created by the MATRIX program were referred
to as a terrorism quotient or a high factor score for terrorism. Their purpose was to
profile individuals to prevent terrorist attacks. The accuracy and potential impact of
MATRIX’s identification system was significant. The program claimed to have suc-
cessfully identified five of the 9/11 hijackers and to have assisted the independent
agency National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in tracking missing and
abducted children. 
Immediately after 9/11, the project was encouraged by the mandates set forth in
the 2002 Attorney General’s Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise,

Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX)
\
343
and Terrorism Enterprise Investigations. The guidelines empowered the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to carry out general topical research, including
conducting online searches and assessing online sites and forums, to the same
extent as the general public as long as the research was relevant to the purpose of
facilitating or supporting the discharge of investigative responsibilities. Initially, 16
states joined the project. State participation diminished when it was learned that
state-owned data had to be transferred to private MATRIX system administrators,
which violated state privacy laws. Eventually the system was altered so that the
information was stored in a remote, state-maintained and secured database as
opposed to the MATRIX central data repository.
The MATRIX program was heavily criticized. Challenges were made to the
quality of the data and the difficulty for individuals to correct faulty data. Critics
complained of vast amounts of easily accessed, potentially private information.
Other concerns included the characteristics used to profile individuals and the
possibility that the government could, with the assistance of analytical software,
conduct electronic searches on people whom they had no reason to suspect of
criminal or illegal behavior. MATRIX supporters believed that the program
served as an investigative tool with sufficient regulatory control to guard against
indiscriminate surveillance on individuals or to engage in inappropriate or unau-
thorized use. In 2003, however, the program was terminated and condemned as a
state-level version of the discredited federal-level “Total Information Awareness”
project, which queried both public and private records, including mailing lists and
credit histories.

NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 44 (1958)
In 1956 the attorney general of Alabama brought a suit to the state circuit court
of Montgomery, Alabama, challenging the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People (NAACP) for violation of a state statute requiring foreign
corporations to qualify before doing business in the state. As part of its strategy to
enjoin the NAACP from operating, Alabama required the association to reveal to
the state’s attorney general the names and addresses of all its members and agents
in the state. The NAACP, a nonprofit membership corporation based in New York,
had not complied with the statute, believing itself exempt. The suit sought both to
prevent the association from conducting further business within the state and,
indeed, to remove it from the state altogether. Referring to the association’s
involvement with the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and its role in funding and
providing legal assistance to black students seeking admission to the state univer-
sity, the suit charged that the association was “causing irreparable injury to the
property and civil rights of the residents and citizens of the State of Alabama for
which criminal prosecution and civil actions at law afford no adequate relief.” On
the day this suit was filed, the circuit court agreed to issue an ex parte order
restraining the association from conducting business in the state or from taking
steps to qualify it to do so.
The association responded by moving to dissolve the order on the grounds that
its activities within the state did not merit its qualification under the statute, and
that the state’s suit was intended to violate its rights to freedom of speech and of
assembly as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. Before a hearing
date was set, the state issued a subpoena for much of the association’s records,
including bank statements and leases, but most notably the names and addresses of
the “agents” or “members” of the association in Alabama. In its response to the
lawsuit, the NAACP admitted that it was in breach of the statute and offered to
attain qualification to continue business if that part of the ex parte order was lifted;
because the association did not comply with the order to produce its records, how-
ever, that motion was denied and the association was held in contempt and fined
\
\

346
NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 44 (1958)
\
$10,000. The contempt order allowed for reduction or remission of the fine if the
production order was complied with within five days, after which the fine would be
raised to $100,000.
Contending that the state could not constitutionally force disclosure of the
records, the association moved to dismiss the contempt judgment once more.
According to Alabama case law, however, a petitioner could not seek a hearing to
dissolve an order until it had purged itself of contempt. 
The United States Supreme Court reversed the first contempt judgment. The
Alabama Supreme Court then claimed that the U.S. Supreme Court had relied on a
“mistaken premise” and reinstated the contempt judgment, which the U.S.
Supreme Court again reversed. The NAACP moved to try the case on the merits;
this motion was denied and again appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
remanded the case to Alabama, ordering the federal district court to try the case on
the merits if the Alabama court system continued to refuse to do so. The Alabama
circuit court finally heard the case on the merits, and decided the NAACP had vio-
lated Alabama law and ordered it to stop doing business in the state; Alabama
appeals courts upheld this judgment, refusing to hear the NAACP’s appeals on con-
stitutional grounds. Finally, the fourth time the case was heard by the U.S. Supreme
Court, it granted certiorari and itself decided the case on the merits rather than
remanding it to the balking Alabama court system, which had taken five years to
get this far.
In an opinion delivered by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, the Supreme Court
decided in favor of the petitioners, holding, “Immunity from state scrutiny of peti-
tioner’s membership lists is here so related to the right of petitioner’s members to
pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in
doing so as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.” It further
held that freedom of association with organizations dedicated to the “advance-
ment of beliefs and ideas” is an inseparable part of the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Because the action of the state of obtaining the names of
the association’s membership would likely interfere with the free association of its
members, the state’s interest in obtaining the records was superseded by the consti-
tutional rights of the petitioners.
The main principle that may be distilled from this case is that a vital relationship
exists between freedom to associate and privacy in one’s associations (U.S.C.A.
Const. Amend. 14). Justice Harlan held that the order requiring the association to
produce records including the names and addresses of all members and agents was
a denial of due process as it entailed the likelihood of a substantial restraint on
members’ exercise of their right to freedom of association.

National Crime Information Center
\

National Crime Information Center
The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a computer database of
criminal justice information established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) in 1967. The purpose of the NCIC system is to provide criminal justice agen-
cies with access to cross-jurisdiction information about crimes and criminals. The
original database was designed to provide law enforcement agencies with informa-
tion on wanted persons, federal fugitives, and stolen property. Since then, the NCIC
has expanded considerably to include information on missing persons, unidentified
bodies, criminal history records, individuals who are believed to pose a threat to the
president, foreign fugitives, gangs, and terrorists. Over the years the system has
grown and new databases have been added. There are currently 17 separate databases
maintained by the NCIC, containing more than 34 million records. It is available to
federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and is operational 24 hours a day,
365 days a year.
More than 80,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide have access to NCIC,
and the number of transactions processed at the center has expanded dramatically
over the years. In its first year of operation, NCIC handled 2 million transactions.
During fiscal year 2005, NCIC processed over 1.6 billion transactions, for an aver-
age of 4.5 million transactions a day. This is close to an 18 percent increase in vol-
ume compared with 2004. The NCIC is often described as a federal-level database,
but it is actually a system where data are contributed and maintained by individual
state and local law enforcement agencies through a multilayered computer network.
Information from agencies is intended to be timely; for example, when an agency
makes an arrest, it submits all applicable arrest information within 24 hours. Agen-
cies must also update the status of records (i.e., court disposition) as persons are
processed through the system. The NCIC continues to incorporate the latest
technological innovations. Currently the system is in the process of updating its
technological capabilities to handle more information such as digital versions of
fingerprints and photographs. 
There are protections in place that limit access to agencies that have authoriza-
tion. All records in the NCIC are protected from unauthorized access through
administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Some of these safeguards
include restricting access to those with a need to know for performance of their
official duties, and using locks, alarm devices, passwords, and/or data encryption.
As the amount of information on persons in the NCIC has expanded, issues of
information accuracy and privacy have come under scrutiny. The Privacy Act of
1974 requires the FBI to make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy and com-
pleteness of records in NCIC system. Recently, however, the Justice Department
has exempted the system from the accuracy requirements of this act. This is troubling
to many, as there was a general understanding upon the passage of the act that the
FBI would proceed with the NCIC database only if it complied with the act’s obli-
gations. Now the FBI is seeking to abandon that agreement, asserting that it is
impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely,
and complete. 
The lack of FBI commitment to the NCIC’s accuracy represents a significant
departure that has implications for individuals with records in the NCIC database.
There have been documented cases of arrests made on the basis of inaccurate

348
National identity cards
\
information supplied by the NCIC. Furthermore, the legitimacy of the system itself
as a law enforcement tool is jeopardized. As the number of cases in which inaccu-
rate NCIC information is used to make arrests increases, so will the chances that
these inaccuracies will be used in a court of law to challenge the legality of the
arrests.

National identity cards
In the United States, the creation of a national identifier system has been
debated between national security advocates and civil libertarians for many years.
Advocates suggest that a national ID is a means to unmask potential terrorists and
guard against illegal immigration. Critics cite that the requirement of a national
identifier will seriously jeopardize privacy rights. Historically, civil libertarians
have won the debate. Extension of the Social Security number (SSN) to the status
of a universal identifier has been rejected continuously since its inception in 1936.
Both the Reagan administration and the Clinton administration have supported the
opposition to a national identifier. The administration of George W. Bush, however,
has expressed support for the national identifier concept.
The primary concern is that access to the information will be sought and secured
by various unauthorized individuals. In addition, there is fear that the technology
will be used in inappropriate ways to monitor citizens’ movements and to harass
and discriminate against minorities or certain suspect categories of people. In short,
a national ID system would create a single, large, centralized database of personal
information on all citizens. The potential privacy implications are profound. The
storage of personal information in unrelated or non-centralized databases is an
important protection to privacy. In a free society a law-abiding citizen can compart-
mentalize the particulars of his or her life, keeping personal matters separate from
business affairs, for example. The consolidation of these “compartments” into one
database can create the potential for significant problems if an error occurs. No
longer will one’s credit rating be the only aspect of life affected by a mistake in
one’s financial records. With the existence of a national ID system, an individual’s
entire life could be disrupted until the inaccuracy is corrected.
The lack of an official national ID system did not stop Congress from passing
the Real ID Act of 2005, which established federal requirements for state driver’s
licenses and identification cards for those who live or work in the United States.
The Act does not take effect until May 2008. Critics contend that the Real ID Act
will convert one’s driver’s license into a de facto national ID card. 
Additional concerns have been raised. The Act apparently requires that the new
IDs include all of the information on current state-issued licenses and identification
cards, including a digital photo for the purpose of entering the information into

National Security Agency
\
349
multistate databases. To obtain the new ID, several types of documentation must be
produced verifying one’s name, date of birth, SSN, principal residence, and legal
status in the United States. Only street addresses can be used; the use of a post
office box as one’s local address is prohibited. Thus, the law precludes homeless
persons and those who, for safety reasons (e.g., potential domestic violence vic-
tims, police, and judges), currently withhold their addresses. Further, the IDs must
use a common machine-readable technology that meets the requirements set forth
by the Department of Homeland Security so that the information contained therein
can be linked with all other state motor vehicle departments and can be easily
incorporated in other federal databases. Additionally, the bill allows Homeland
Security to add requirements in the future, possibly including the use of biometric
identifiers. Critics fear that radio frequency identification (RFID) tags or
enhanced bar codes will be included among the required features of the new IDs.
Such tags could give the government the ability to track the cardholder’s movements.
The identification card will be required in order for a person to obtain a valid
driver’s license, to gain access to a federal government service, to collect Social
Security or other health benefits, to visit federal buildings, or to utilize banking or
airline services. Although the government will confirm the data and issue the cards,
there is no guarantee that the information included on the cards will be unavailable
to commercial entities. It is common knowledge that some states allow their license
data to be sold to third parties. Furthermore, the act does not include safeguard pro-
visions such as encryption or methods to prevent the data from being remotely
scanned.

National Security Agency
The National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) was created
in 1952 through an executive order issued by President Harry S Truman. A division
of the United States Intelligence Community, the NSA is considered to be America’s
code-breaking organization, established to protect the United States from threats to
national security. The NSA employs some of the nation’s most gifted mathemati-
cians, who use Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) to decipher electronic transmissions
intercepted from satellites. These transmissions can be communications via the
Internet, telephone, fax, radio, or any other means of coded communication.
Working in conjunction with the Department of Defense, the NSA has become
one of the largest divisions in government intelligence. The classified nature of
this agency’s work has raised concerns about issues of privacy. Although the word

350
National Security Agency
\
“privacy” is not mentioned explicitly in the U.S. Constitution, privacy rights have
been supported based on the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments. In relation to the
NSA, privacy can be understood to constitute protection against the disclosure of
personal information. An individual’s right to privacy is important because it impedes
discrimination and fraud and provides protection from abuses of government power.
Due to the NSA’s secrecy, its objectives and impacts are unclear. Nevertheless,
we can be confident that the NSA affects Americans’ rights and expectations of
privacy.
The original purpose of the NSA was to conduct military surveillance on foreign
powers during World War II. This was accomplished through the interception and
deciphering of foreign communications. Since the end of World War II, surveil-
lance responsibilities of the NSA have shifted to focus on small, organized groups
within the United States. Now, in addition to monitoring foreign communications
for military purposes, the NSA focuses on drug smugglers and terrorists. Surveil-
lance of small groups within the United States has often resulted in the random use
of wiretapping. Also referred to as domestic spying, these wiretaps permit gov-
ernment offices to monitor domestic communication for traffic patterns. Traffic
patterns indicate when, how often, and with whom communication occurs. Random
wiretaps have raised concerns that Americans’ civil liberties are being infringed
upon when the NSA monitors communication without consent or judicial warrant.
Moreover, the effectiveness of wiretaps has not been demonstrated. 
Electronic eavesdropping, in particular, is a contentious issue. On one hand,
cases based on evidence from wiretaps are often dismissed in court on the grounds
of invasion of privacy. On the other hand, the NSA and other U.S. intelligence divi-
sions defend their actions by insisting that they maintain national security. For
example, during World War II the NSA’s deciphering of a Japanese code enabled
the United States to win the “Battle of Midway.” This military success ironically
brought public attention to the previously secret procedures of the NSA. This
awareness led many Americans to feel apprehensive about the NSA’s potential to
violate their privacy. 
Privacy advocates cite the “Keith” case (United States v. United States Dist. Ct.,
444 F.2d 651, 6th Cir. 1971), where District Court Judge Damon J. Keith ruled that
the U.S. government has no authority to spy, without a warrant, on private citizens
within the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld this deci-
sion on June 19, 1972. However, some in the executive branch have argued that this
decision applies only to domestic, not foreign, communication. Consequently, they
contend that the president maintains constitutional power to authorize electronic
surveillance without consent or warrant in order to protect national security. A
direct result of this debate has been increased congressional oversight of the NSA.
Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA),
which requires that the government obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance on
U.S. soil. Warrants for surveillance must be issued by the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court. Warrants are granted based on probable cause that an individ-
ual is affiliated with a foreign power and a threat to national security. 
However, presidential authority, justified by executive order, overrides Congress.
Executive authority can be used to permit the installing of wiretaps without a warrant.
In these cases, FISA has authorized surveillance warrants even after wiretaps have

Nineteen Eighty-Four
\
351
been installed and monitored. These procedures have been upheld in court on
grounds of national security. In addition, executive orders authorizing eavesdropping
for national security reasons have not provided safeguards, guidelines, or limitations
in conducting surveillance without consent. Executive orders that are not subject to
judicial scrutiny prevent the development of judicial precedent on questions of
domestic surveillance.
Civil liberties are often weakened when presidential authority circumvents the
legislative and judicial branches. Although it can be argued that the lack of judicial
regulation indicates that the NSA does not infringe upon civil liberties, the idea of
unchallenged executive power remains a concern to privacy advocates. For example,
President George W. Bush was accused of violating FISA when he authorized,
without obtaining a warrant from the court, electronic eavesdropping on individuals
allegedly linked to Al Qaeda within the United States. Nevertheless, broad presi-
dential authority, granted by executive order, has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court. Charges that wiretaps were a violation of privacy were dismissed. The Court
deemed the surveillance of individuals allegedly linked to Al Qaeda as necessary
and appropriate to protect national security. 
Proponents of electronic surveillance often emphasize the instances where
wiretapping has been used to apprehend terrorists, win wars, and protect national
security. Opponents argue that electronic surveillance is a violation of civil liberties.
Also of concern is that the NSA’s surveillance program violates the separation of
powers established in the U.S. Constitution. The top-secret nature of the NSA,
combined with broad presidential authority, is a significant privacy concern. The
NSA has often been credited with protecting national security, yet there is strong
support for the premise that the capability of the NSA to regulate privacy simulta-
neously poses a serious threat to civil liberties.

O
O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 509 (1987)
Dr. Magno Ortega, respondent, a physician and psychiatrist, was an employee of
a state hospital and had primary responsibility for training physicians in the psychi-
atric residency program. In 1981 hospital officials, including Executive Director
Dr. Dennis O’Connor, became concerned about possible improprieties in his man-
agement of the program, particularly with respect to his acquisition of a computer
and charges against him concerning sexual harassment of female hospital
employees and inappropriate disciplinary action against a resident. While he was
on administrative leave pending investigation of the charges, hospital officials,
allegedly in an effort to inventory and secure state property, searched his office and
seized personal items from his desk and file cabinets, which were then used in
administrative proceedings resulting in his discharge. The hospital’s investigation
included multiple searches of his office and the seizure of a number of items. The
items were used in proceedings before the California State Personnel Board to
impeach the credibility of witnesses who testified on Dr. Ortega’s behalf. No for-
mal inventory of the property in the office was ever made, and all other papers in
the office were placed in boxes for storage. Dr. Ortega filed an action against the
hospital officials (petitioners) in federal district court under 42 U.S.C §1983, alleg-
ing that the search of his office violated the Fourth Amendment. On cross-motions
for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment for the petitioners,
concluding that the search was proper because there was a need to secure state
property in the office. Affirming in part, reversing in part, and remanding the case,
the court of appeals concluded that Dr. Ortega had a reasonable expectation of
privacy in his office and that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The court
held that the record justified a grant of partial summary judgment for the respon-
dent on the issue of liability for the search, and it remanded the case to the district
court for determination of damages.
Did the supervisor’s search of the office violate Dr. Ortega’s “reasonable expec-
tation of privacy” guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment? The court discussed
whether probable cause is an inappropriate standard for public employer searches

\
of employees’ offices. The court undertook a balancing test of governmental and
private interests and determined that the public interest is best served by a Fourth
Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause. The
court stated that it “recognized the plethora of contexts in which employers will
have an occasion to intrude to some extent on an employee’s expectation of privacy.”
Also, “[t]he governmental interest justifying work-related intrusions by public
employers is the efficient and proper operation of the workplace.” The rationale
appears to be that governmental agencies would be less efficient and the general
public would suffer if employers were required to have probable cause before
searching an employee’s desk for the purpose of locating a file or office correspon-
dence. The court reasoned that it makes little sense to apply the criminal concept of
probable cause when the search is simply to retrieve a file or execute a routine
inventory conducted by public employers for the purpose of securing state property.
“To ensure the efficient and proper operation of the agency, therefore, public
employers must be given wide latitude to enter employee offices for work-related,
non-investigatory reasons.”
Searches and seizures by government employers or supervisors of the private
property of their employees are subject to Fourth Amendment restraints. An expec-
tation of privacy in one’s place of work is based on societal expectations that have
deep roots in the history of the amendment. However, the operational realities of
the workplace may make some public employees’ expectations of privacy unrea-
sonable when an intrusion is by a supervisor rather than a law enforcement official.
Some government offices may be so open to fellow employees or the public that no
expectation of privacy is reasonable. Given the great variety of work environments
in the public sector, the question of whether an employee has a reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Although the record did
not reveal the extent to which hospital officials may have had work-related reasons
to enter Ortega’s office, a majority of the district court agreed with the determi-
nation of the court of appeals that the respondent had a reasonable expectation of
privacy in his office, or at least in his desk and file cabinets.
For a search conducted by a public employer in areas in which an employee has
a reasonable expectation of privacy, what is a “reasonable” search depends on the
context in which the search takes place and requires balancing the employee’s
legitimate expectation of privacy against the government’s need for supervision,
control, and the efficient operation of the workplace. Requiring that a search
warrant be obtained whenever an employer wishes to enter an employee’s office,
desk, or file cabinets for a work-related purpose would seriously disrupt the routine
conduct of business and would be unreasonable. Moreover, requiring a probable-
cause standard for searches of the type at issue here would impose an intolerable
burden on public employers. Intrusions on the constitutionally protected privacy
interests of government employees for non-investigatory, work-related purposes, as
well as for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the
standard of reasonableness under all circumstances. Under this standard, both the
inception and the scope of the intrusion must be reasonable.
In the procedural posture of the case, the court stated that it cannot be deter-
mined whether the search of Dr. Ortega’s office and the seizure of his personal
belongings satisfied the standard of reasonableness. Both courts were in error

Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170 (1984)
\
355
because the summary judgment was inappropriate. The parties were in dispute
about the actual justification for the search, and the record was inadequate to allow
a determination of the reasonableness of the search and seizure.
To summarize, in a 5-to-4 decision, the court held that the search did not violate
the Fourth Amendment. The court held that “the realities of the workplace” made
some expectations of privacy among public employees unreasonable when the
intrusion is by a supervisor rather than a law enforcement official. Work-related
searches, the court found, were “merely incident to the primary business of the
agency,” and a warrant requirement would “seriously disrupt the routine conduct of
business.” The court thus held that a standard of “reasonableness” was sufficient
for work-related intrusions by public employers.

Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170 (1984)
This case was a consolidation of two cases involving similar facts. In the first
case, officers received reports that Ray Oliver was growing marijuana on his farm
in rural Kentucky, and went to investigate. They drove past Oliver’s home to a
locked gate that featured a “No Trespassing” sign but had a footpath around one
side. The agents walked around the gate and then along the road and found a field
of marijuana over a mile from Oliver’s house. Oliver was charged with possession
and manufacture of a controlled substance. He sought to suppress admission of the
evidence discovered by the officers as a product of an unlawful search and seizure.
The district court granted the motion and suppressed the evidence, determining that
Oliver had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area of the farm that was
searched. Relying on Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), the district court
found that because of the locked gate and the “No Trespassing” sign, Oliver “had
done all that could be expected of him to assert his privacy in the area of farm that
was searched.” The state appealed; a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed and then, upon an en banc rehearing, reversed the district court.
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Katz decision had not impaired the
“open fields doctrine” put forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Hester, allowing
officers to enter and search a field without a search warrant.
In the second case, officers in Maine received an anonymous tip that Richard
Thornton was growing marijuana in the woods behind his home. The officers

356
Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170 (1984)
\
entered the woods by means of a footpath between Thornton’s home and the home
of a neighbor. They discovered two marijuana patches, surrounded by chicken wire
and “No Trespassing” signs, in the woods behind Thornton’s home. The officers
obtained a search warrant based on this information and went back to seize the
marijuana as evidence against Thornton. The district court granted Thornton’s
motion to suppress the fruits of the second search, concluding that the initial war-
rantless search was unreasonable because Thornton had posted “No Trespassing”
signs and “the secluded location of the marijuana patches evinced a reasonable
expectation of privacy.” The Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the decision.
The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari.
In an opinion delivered by Justice Powell, the Court reversed both lower
courts’ decisions suppressing the evidence. The Court relied on its earlier deci-
sion in Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, 58–59, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898
(1924), in which it first recognized the “open fields” doctrine. In Hester, the Court
held that “the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people
in their ‘persons, houses, papers, and effects,’ is not extended to the open fields.”
The Court stated that the decision in Hester was based on the explicit language of
the Fourth Amendment, which indicates with some precision the places and things
its protections encompass. The Court further stated that its interpretation of Hester
and open fields was consistent with the “right to privacy” concept extant in Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence as put forth in Katz. The Court argued that the touch-
stone of Fourth Amendment analysis is whether a person has a constitutionally
protected “reasonable expectation of privacy”; the Fourth Amendment does not
protect a merely subjective expectation of privacy, but only those expectations that
society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. The Court contrasted those areas in
which a person has an expectation of privacy against open fields, opining that open
fields “do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment
is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance. There is no
societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities, such as the cultivation
of crops that occur in open fields.” The Court held that open fields are, as a practical
matter, accessible to the public and the police in ways a home, an office, or com-
mercial structure would not be. Nor do fences or “No Trespassing” signs effec-
tively bar the public from viewing open fields. Moreover, “the public and the
police lawfully may survey the lands from the air. For these reasons, the asserted
expectation of privacy in open fields is not an expectation that ‘society recog-
nizes as reasonable.’” 
The Court cautioned courts against a case-by-case analysis for these types of
situations because it would not provide a workable accommodation between the
needs of law enforcement and the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment.
Likewise, courts should not consider whether the individual chooses to conceal a
“private” activity as the correct test for legitimacy. Rather, in holding that Oliver
and Thornton had no legitimate expectation that their open fields would remain
free from warrantless intrusion by government officers, the Court defined the cor-
rect inquiry as “whether the government’s intrusion infringes upon the personal
and societal values protected by the Fourth Amendment.” The Oliver court stated
that it was reaffirming Hester and clarifying the rule therein—that an individual
may not legitimately demand privacy for activities conducted out-of-doors in

Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928)
\
357
fields, except in the area immediately surrounding the home, otherwise known
as the curtilage. The Court remanded the cases back to the district courts and
held that “from the text of the Fourth Amendment and from the historical and
contemporary understanding of its purposes, . . . an individual has no legitimate
expectation that open fields will remain free from warrantless intrusion by govern-
ment officers.”

Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928)
In the 1928 case of Olmstead v. United States, the Supreme Court found no
violation of the Fourth Amendment when federal government agents wiretapped
individuals’ telephone lines without first obtaining a judge’s approval. Prosecutors
used the telephone conversations that the wiretaps intercepted to convict the
individuals of Prohibition era crimes. Justice Louis Brandeis disagreed with the
Court’s ruling and wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that constitu-
tional protections must adapt to new technologies. In addition to predicting
some of today’s threats to privacy, Justice Brandeis eloquently articulated the
“right to be let alone.” He described the right to privacy as the most compre-
hensive and valued of rights. Although the Olmstead decision did not prevent
unauthorized government surveillance of telephone conversations, it defined the terms
of a debate about how to conceive of and protect privacy under the Constitution. 
Olmstead and 20 other men were convicted by a federal jury in Washington state
of conspiring to violate the National Prohibition Act. During the period of 1920 to
1933, when Prohibition was written into the Constitution, federal law made it illegal
to transport and sell intoxicating liquors. Olmstead was convicted and sentenced to
four years in prison for managing a large-scale illegal importing business that
transported liquor by boat from British Columbia to Seattle and then distributed it
to numerous customers. The evidence produced during the trial showed that the
conspiracy sometimes sold 200 cases of liquor a day and that it likely generated
millions of dollars in sales each year. In addition, it appeared that local police,
rather than rooting out the crime, were involved in it themselves. 

358
Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928)
\
During the trial, wiretaps produced almost all of the incriminating evidence
against Olmstead and the other defendants. Federal Prohibition agents had installed
the wiretaps on telephone lines leading from the homes and offices of the conspirators,
and they had listened in, without detection, over a period of several months. Olm-
stead objected when prosecutors sought to have the agents testify about the tele-
phone conversations they had overheard. He argued that the wiretaps violated the
Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures because
the government agents had not obtained a judge’s approval before wiretapping.
Olmstead argued that wiretapped evidence acquired in violation of the Fourth
Amendment should not have been allowed in his trial. 
By the time the Supreme Court heard the case, the trial court had denied
Olmstead’s request to keep the evidence obtained by wiretaps out of the trial, and
two out of the three judges on the federal appellate court that reviewed the trial
court’s decision had affirmed it. The appellate court majority reasoned that listening
into the telephone conversations that traveled over wires to and from the defendants’
private homes and attorney’s office was just like looking through windows or an
open door into those spaces. The appellate court wrote that, even if wiretapping
should be considered an “unethical intrusion upon the privacy of persons who are
suspected of crime, it is not an act which comes within the letter of the prohibition
of constitutional provisions.” 
The third judge on the appellate panel, Judge Rudkin, disagreed with that analogy
and would have accorded telephone conversations the same constitutional protec-
tion as sealed letters. In an 1877 case entitled Ex parte Jackson, the Supreme Court
had written that government agents could not open sealed letters in the mails unless
they obtained a proper warrant under the Fourth Amendment. In that case, the
Court viewed sealed letters obtained from the postal system as being entitled to the
same constitutional protection as papers obtained through the searches of private
homes. In his dissenting opinion, Judge Rudkin argued that the constitutional pro-
tection accorded private papers and sealed letters should be extended to telephone
conversations, since there are no meaningful distinctions “between a message sent
by letter and a message sent by telegraph or telephone.” Because private papers or
sealed letters obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment cannot be used in a
trial, the conversations obtained in the Olmstead case should have been kept out of
the trial as well. Judge Rudkin expressed concern about the practice of using such
wiretapped evidence in trials and wrote that “[i]f ills such as these must be borne,
our forefathers signally failed in their desire to ordain and establish a government
to secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity.” 
When it reviewed the appellate court’s decision, the Supreme Court faced the
question of whether to treat telephone conversations as analogous to sealed letters,
and thus entitled to Fourth Amendment protection, or to agree with the lower
courts that telephone conversations were constitutionally unprotected. Six out of
the nine justices, a majority, declined to extend the protection accorded mail to
telephone conversations, because they did not view the Fourth Amendment’s pro-
tection as extending to intangible conversations intercepted without a physical
invasion of private property rights. 
The Fourth Amendment provides that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall

Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928)
\
359
not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by
Oath or Affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized.” 
In writing the majority opinion, Chief Justice Taft identified the Fourth Amend-
ment’s historical purpose as preventing “the use of governmental force to search a
man’s house, his person, his papers and his effects; and to prevent their seizure
against his will.” According to Chief Justice Taft, the constitutional language limits
the amendment’s protection to material things, such as persons and papers, and
does not extend to intangible conversations. He wrote that it does not constitute a
search or seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes when agents gather evidence by
hearing, in the same way that there is no search or seizure when agents gather
incriminating evidence by merely seeing it. Chief Justice Taft also rejected the
analogy between sealed letters and telephone conversations posited by Judge Rudkin.
In addition to the fact that letters are tangible things and telephone conversations
are not, the chief justice viewed the mail as special because the Constitution pro-
vides for the postal system and Congress requires that all mail be sent through that
system. Those features did not characterize either the telephone or the telegraph.
Chief Justice Taft argued that the telephone wires form a network more like a high-
way system than the postal system. 
The chief justice went on to explain that in prior cases the Fourth Amendment
had protected people when they were searched or their papers or effects were
seized, or when agents conducted an “actual physical invasion” of a house to obtain
evidence. Although many of the defendants in Olmstead had been in their homes or
offices when their telephone conversations were intercepted, government agents
had installed the wiretaps without physically invading the defendants’ private prop-
erty. Wiretaps targeting private homes had been placed on the street outside, and
the office wiretap was installed in the basement of a large building that was appar-
ently not owned by the conspirators. Although urged to regard the wiretapping as
equivalent to agents hiding themselves in the defendants’ houses to listen to their
conversations, Chief Justice Taft took an entirely different approach. He wrote,
“The reasonable view is that one who installs in his house a telephone instrument
with connecting wires intends to project his voice to those quite outside, and that
the wires beyond his house and messages while passing over them are not within
the protection of the Fourth Amendment.” 
The majority opinion ties Fourth Amendment protection to whether or not the
government agents had “trespassed,” or unlawfully entered the defendants’ private
property. In doing so, the Supreme Court used property law rules to limit constitu-
tional privacy protection. The majority expressed concern that if the police could
violate the Fourth Amendment without conducting a physical intrusion, then the
scope of protection would be dramatically extended. Over time, the trespass rule
was elaborated so that Fourth Amendment analysis was triggered whenever agents
intruded upon a “constitutionally protected area.”
Three justices disagreed with the majority’s decision, and although each wrote a
separate opinion, Justice Brandeis’s dissent has become the most famous. Justice
Brandeis rejected the majority’s narrow reading of the Fourth Amendment and
instead advocated a flexible interpretation of its text to encompass situations that
the drafters of the constitution neither considered nor imagined. The Fourth

360
Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928)
\
Amendment was designed to prevent government officers from breaking into
homes by force to seize papers, and was drafted with that threat to privacy in mind.
Referring to electronic surveillance, however, Justice Brandeis wrote that, at the
time, “[s]ubtler and more far-reaching means of invading privacy have become
available to the Government. Discovery and invention have made it possible for the
Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain
disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.” If the constitutional protections
were confined to the old methods of invading privacy, Justice Brandeis warned,
those protections would have little value. 
Justice Brandeis predicted that the majority’s interpretation of the Fourth
Amendment would leave unaddressed even greater threats to privacy in the future.
“The progress of science in furnishing the Government with means of espionage is
not likely to stop with wire-tapping,” he wrote. Justice Brandeis seemed to antici-
pate the development of networked personal computers when he predicted that
“[w]ays may some day be developed by which the Government, without removing
papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be
enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home.” The justice
also accurately predicted that “[a]dvances in the psychic and related sciences may
bring means of exploring unexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions.” Justice
Brandeis concluded his disturbing picture of the future with the rhetorical question
“Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of indi-
vidual security?” 
In arguing that the underlying purpose of the Fourth Amendment rather than its
literal language should guide the Court, Justice Brandeis articulated an understand-
ing of privacy that has been enormously influential. He wrote, “The makers of our
Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness.
They recognized the significance of man’s spiritual nature, of his feelings and of
his intellect. . . . They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts,
their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the Government, the
right to be let alone—the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued
by civilized men.” Justice Brandeis concluded that the Fourth Amendment protects
against “every unjustifiable intrusion by the Government upon the privacy of the
individual.”
Justice Brandeis rejected both the majority’s refusal to liken telephone conversa-
tions to sealed letters and its suggestion that Fourth Amendment protection
required a physical trespass under property law. As to the former, Justice Brandeis
found the distinctions between telephone calls and sealed letters to be irrelevant,
and he noted that telephone conversations had an even stronger claim to protection
than sealed letters had. According to Justice Brandeis, because wiretaps indiscrim-
inately capture all conversations between the target of the wiretap and those with
whom he or she converses, “The evil incident to invasion of the privacy of the tele-
phone is far greater than that involved in tampering with the mails.” 
Because Justice Brandeis found unauthorized wiretapping to violate the Fourth
Amendment, he regarded it as “immaterial where the physical connection with the
telephone wires leading into the defendants’ premises was made.” In other words,
the government invaded the defendants’ privacy rights even if they did not violate
their property rights. Justice Brandeis also regarded as irrelevant whether the

Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928)
\
361
government agents were motivated by their interest in enforcing the law: “The
greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-
meaning but without understanding.” In addition, Justice Brandeis expressed out-
rage that the Supreme Court refused to exclude the evidence derived from wiretaps
when the wiretaps themselves violated state law. “If the Government becomes a
lawbreaker,” he warned, “it breeds contempt for law; . . . it invites anarchy.”
A few years after Olmstead was decided, Congress passed §605 of the Commu-
nications Act of 1934, which made wiretapping a federal crime even though it did
not violate the Constitution. Although the new law explicitly prohibited law
enforcement’s use of wiretaps, government agents disregarded the law and continued
to use wiretaps and the evidence they disclosed. Few prosecutions were brought
against those who conducted illegal wiretaps, and none were brought against
government agents under the federal law. Some argued that illegal wiretapping
would be pervasive until it was recognized to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
That happened in 1967, when the Supreme Court held that wiretapping and
eavesdropping did in fact fall under the protection of the Fourth Amendment. A
few years before, the Supreme Court had extended Fourth Amendment protection
to the intangible conversations that the Olmstead court had been unwilling to protect,
but it did so in the context of a physical intrusion. In Katz v. United States, 389
U.S. 347 (1967), the Court extended Fourth Amendment protection to government
eavesdropping that occurred without a physical trespass, declaring that “the Fourth
Amendment protects people—and not simply ‘areas.’” In his concurring opinion,
Justice Harlan formulated the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test to replace
the “constitutionally protected area” test. Although the former test has been subject
to criticism, it stands as the touchstone of Fourth Amendment protection. While the
decision in the Katz case untethered rights under the Fourth Amendment from
private property rights, courts have more readily found constitutionally protected
privacy interests in the home than outside of it. As for statutory law, Congress
passed the Wiretap Act in 1968, which codified the constitutional requirements
established by the Supreme Court the year before. 
Justice Brandeis’s dissent in Olmstead expanded our understanding of the right
to privacy from one based in tort law to one enjoying constitutional protections. His
eloquent articulation of the right to be let alone has often been quoted elsewhere,
including the opinions from other cases that have expanded constitutionally pro-
tected privacy. For example, it was cited in the famous cases of Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and Whalen v. Roe, both of which charted new
ground in defining the parameters of a constitutionally protected privacy right. 
The Olmstead case illustrates the difficulty of bringing privacy protections in
line with new technologies. The various opinions each compared new practices to
ones for which there were established precedents, but demonstrated that there are
often several possible analogies, and different choices can mean different legal
results. As the first case considering the constitutionality of electronic surveillance,
Olmstead began the ongoing discussion about how much privacy we should expect
in new communications technologies when the government decides it wants to listen
in.

Open meetings laws
All 50 states and many localities as well as the federal government have enacted
open meetings laws, or “Government in the Sunshine Acts,” as these laws are often
called. Disclosures at such meetings, however, may threaten personal privacy. For
this reason, many open meetings laws permit the closing of meetings to protect
personal privacy. Enactment of these laws followed a public right-to-know movement
in the 1960s and 1970s. Those campaigns also led to the passage of public records
laws. Open meetings laws were adopted by several states prior to the passage in
1976 of the federal Government in the Sunshine Act.
This federal open meetings law illustrates the general aspects of these laws and
demonstrates how they protect personal privacy. These laws rest on the proposition
that the government’s business should be conducted in public. The federal act
requires that the deliberations of councils, commissions, and other public agencies
headed by multi-member bodies be open to the public. These laws secure one’s
right to observe deliberations, not the right to participate in them. For example, in
the federal Government in the Sunshine Act Congress contemplated that the public
would observe meetings in the same room as agency members. These laws also
assumed that representatives of the media would play an important role in reporting
the actions of government officials.
The disclosures accompanying the observation of government deliberations not
only inform the public and temper the decisions of boards and commissions, but
also provide personal information about individuals discussed in these meetings.
The disclosure and publication of personal information about individuals is a
potential threat to their privacy; therefore, many, if not most, of these laws include
provisions intended to protect personal privacy. A common provision allows meetings
or portions of meetings to be closed to the public and the press. 
One of the exemptions in the federal Government in the Sunshine Act exemplifies
this protection. An agency covered by the law may close a meeting that is likely to
disclose information of a personal nature if disclosure “would constitute a clearly
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Not all state provisions contain a pri-
vacy exemption, however, and even among those that do, some define privacy
differently than federal law. Thus, the scope of privacy protection may vary.
The exemption contained in the federal Government in the Sunshine Act is sim-
ilar to one contained in the federal Freedom of Information Act. In the Sunshine
Act, the exemption extends to “information of a personal nature,” which means

Opt-in vs. opt-out
\
363
information applicable to a specific person. If such information is likely to be
disclosed at an open meeting, that meeting should be closed if the disclosure would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. 
The language requires that the interest in privacy be weighed against the public
interest in disclosure of the information as part of the process of deliberation.
Moreover, the language demonstrates that the balance is clearly in favor of the
interest in privacy. Under this test, however, Congress suggested that it might be
appropriate to close a meeting in certain circumstances to protect from observation
a discussion of a person’s health or drinking habits and an assessment of a person’s
professional ability in connection with review of a person’s finances to determine
eligibility for financial assistance. 
A person’s status as a public official may affect the character of privacy protection.
For example, the privacy interest of a high government official may be less than that
of a lower-ranking official or of a private person. The lesser privacy interest of a high
government official whose conduct is discussed at a public meeting reflects the
greater public interest in the conduct or qualifications of such an official.
Another, narrower exemption permits the closing of a meeting when the deli-
berative body is to discuss whether to accuse a person of a crime or to formally to
censure that person. Public discussions of these matters can invade the persons’
privacy and harm his or her reputation even if the agency decides not to make the
accusation or to impose the formal censure.

Opt-in vs. opt-out
Opt-in and opt-out are two methods for exercising the choice principle of fair
information practices. The choice principle states that personal information
should not be collected for one purpose and shared or used for other purposes that
are unrelated to the reason the information was originally collected unless the
individual consents. For example, if a company collects customer information to
complete a sale and subsequently uses that information to send the customer adver-
tisements, or if it sells or rents its customer mailing list to other companies, it needs
to offer the customer a choice. 
With opt-out, consent is implied unless the individual objects to the new use,
which means that it is the individual’s responsibility to notify the organization
that he or she objects to having personal information used or shared for other
purposes. With opt-in, organizations may not share or use personal information
for unrelated purposes unless the individual gives explicit consent. One form of opt-
in is “permission marketing,” where marketers ask permission before they send

364
Orwell, George
\
advertisements to prospective customers. On the Internet, some of the distinctions
between opt-out and opt-in have blurred, as both forms of choice may be pro-
vided as part of any online transaction; the individual decides whether or not to
check a single box. 
In the United States, there is a general consensus that opt-in should be used in
cases where sensitive personal information is involved. Opt-out is viewed as appro-
priate for marketing uses of personal information, except when medical information
or information collected from children is involved. The Health Insurance Port-
ability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires that all organizations
covered by the law obtain written authorization for any use or disclosure of protected
health information that is not related to health care treatment, payment, or operations
of the health care organization. Opt-in is required, for example, before health infor-
mation may be disclosed to an employer or used for marketing. The Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) requires any website targeting
children under 13 years of age to obtain parental consent before the child’s infor-
mation may be disclosed to third parties. 
Recent U.S. laws, for example, mandate opt-out for certain third-party uses of
financial information (e.g., the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999,
also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), commercial electronic mail unre-
lated to a transaction or a subscription (CAN-SPAM Act), and most telemarketing
calls (the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call Registry). The Direct Marketing
Association’s Privacy Promise is a self-regulatory program that requires all DMA
members to honor consumer requests to opt out of having their customer informa-
tion transferred to others for marketing purposes or receiving solicitations from the
member company. 
For global commerce, the U.S. Department of Commerce negotiated Safe Harbor
principles with the European Union (EU) in 2000 to allow American companies to
transfer personal information from European citizens outside of the EU. The Safe
Harbor agreement requires companies to offer opt-out if personal information is to
be disclosed to a third party or used for any purpose that is incompatible with the
purpose for which the information was originally collected. For sensitive informa-
tion, opt-in must be offered. The European definition of sensitive information is
broader than the American definition and includes information on health, racial or
ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, union membership, or an individ-
ual’s sex life.

Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990)

Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990)
In Osborne v. Ohio, the United States Supreme Court established the special
reasons why child pornography is not subject to any meaningful constitutional
protections under the First Amendment (or the Fourteenth Amendment as applied
to the states). This case clarified the uncertain scope of the right to possession of
obscene material under the First Amendment. This landmark case extensively
addressed the sociological data supporting an absolute ban on child pornography,
regardless of any individual privacy rights in keeping such obscene material. Not
surprisingly, the case is widely quoted by the United States Supreme Court and
virtually every other lower court in the country in most cases involving challenges
to child pornography criminal statutes.
The issue in the case was relatively straightforward. Writing for the majority,
Justice White explained that the primary issue in the case was whether the state of
Ohio could proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography in light of
the Supreme Court’s earlier decision in Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969). In
that touchstone case, the Court struck down a Georgia law outlawing the private,
home possession of obscene material based on the First Amendment. Despite this
earlier decision in Stanley, the Court found that possessing and viewing child
pornography is uniquely different and therefore not entitled to any constitutional
protection.
To begin, Justice White recognized that an earlier decision issued by the
Supreme Court had already established that the value of permitting child pornography
to exist is “exceedingly modest, if not de minimis.” Even accepting the defendant’s
argument that he had a First Amendment interest in viewing and possessing child
pornography, Justice White found the facts of this case were distinct from the issue
in Stanley “because the interests underlying child pornography prohibitions far
exceed the interests justifying the Georgia law at issue in Stanley.” As Justice
White explained, “The difference here is obvious: The State does not rely on a
paternalistic interest in regulating Osborne’s mind. Rather, Ohio has enacted [its
child pornography law] in order to protect the victims of child pornography; it
hopes to destroy a market for the exploitative use of children.” 
To bolster this unique difference, Justice White examined the extensive, uncon-
tested research about the life-altering damage caused to a child by his or her parti-
cipation in child pornography. He noted that the legislature of Ohio had decided to
make child pornography illegal because of its irreparable harm “to the physiological,
emotional, and mental health of the child. That judgment, we think, easily passes
muster under the First Amendment” (495 U.S. at 109). He also pointed out that
crippling the child pornography market necessitated laws targeting all levels of the
market, including production, distribution, and possession. He noted that to reduce
the supply, it was legitimate for the state to curb the demand by making child
pornography highly illegal and subject to extreme penalties. Equally compelling to
the decision was the fact that “the material produced by child pornographers
permanently record[s] the victim’s abuse. The pornography’s continued existence
causes the child victims continuing harm by haunting the children in years to
come.” Finally, he noted the sad statistic that pedophiles often encourage and
seduce children to participate in child pornography by showing them other
works of child pornography. For all of these reasons, the majority found that

366
Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990)
\
child pornography laws punishing the mere private possession of such material
were constitutionally acceptable. As Justice White phrased it, “Given the gravity of
the State’s interest in this context, we find that Ohio may constitutionally proscribe
the possession and viewing of child pornography.” 
In this case, the individual’s right to privacy was unquestionably different from
the situation in Stanley. In the realm of the First Amendment, some types of material
or speech are said to be “unprotected” within the meaning of the Constitution.
Examples include “fighting words” or “obscenity.” In Stanley, the issue was simply
the state’s interest in preventing an adult from reading obscene material in the
privacy of his home. The state’s interest was thus considered relatively low, and the
individual’s right to absolute privacy in the comfort of his home was deemed
enormously high. Ultimately, this case was entirely different based on the critical
difference in the type of obscene material. The Supreme Court found a special
danger posed by child pornography to the children trapped within its production.
This distinction made all the difference in this case, and although the majority
seized on a technicality to force the state of Ohio to clarify how it charges defen-
dants under its law, the overall attack on child pornography remained intact. It
continues to be quoted extensively in modern cases.

Paparazzi
Paparazzi is the term used for freelance news photographers who specialize in
candid photos or video of celebrities. Celebrities often complain that paparazzi
invade their privacy or endanger them through the use of telephoto lenses and
aggressive newsgathering techniques. Paparazzi were initially seen as responsible
for the car crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. That incident, in
turn, spawned several attempts in the United States to limit access by photographers
to celebrities.
The term “paparazzi”  comes from a character in Frederico Fellini’s 1960
motion picture, La Dolce Vita. Paparazzo, played by Walter Santesso, was a
photographer who exhibited some of the characteristics now associated with his
name. The U.S. publication Time first used the term in a 1961 article titled
“Paparazzi on the Prowl” and described this new European phenomenon as a
“ravenous wolf pack of freelance photographers who stalk big names for a living
and fire with flash guns at point-blank range,”  and who create scenes by goading
celebrities into “arm-flail[ing] rage[s]”  to produce salable photographs.
Americans were not immune to paparazzi. By the late 1960s, these photographers
routinely stalked celebrities in the United States, selling their photos on both sides
of the Atlantic. One constant target was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis—widow of
President John F. Kennedy—and her young children, Caroline and John, Jr. One
photographer, in particular, made Onassis his life’s work. At one point this photo-
grapher, Ron Galella, caused John, Jr., to fall off his bicycle. In another incident,
Galella hid behind the coatrack in a private restaurant to photograph Onassis. On
other occasions, he endangered Onassis and the children as they swam, trespassed
in the children’s schools, jumped at the family in the dark, and generally made their
lives miserable. Eventually Onassis was able to get a restraining order against him,
which he violated. In 1972 Galella was found guilty of harassment, assault, com-
mercial exploitation, and invasion of privacy.
Jacqueline Onassis did not want the attention of Galella or of any other
paparazzi. Other celebrities, however, have had a less clear relationship with these
\

\
photographers. Paparazzi have both helped to create, and capitalized on, a culture
that values celebrity. Many people carefully follow the details of their favorite
celebrities’ lives, including the celebrities’ relationships and daily activities. Most
celebrities voluntarily participate in this through public appearances and interviews
that provide exposure, which helps to continue their celebrity status. But the public
wants more information, and the paparazzi provide it, usually through photos taken
under less-controlled circumstances than the celebrities’ preferred interviews and
arranged appearances. Those circumstances, however, routinely infringe upon
celebrities’ privacy.
Paparazzi encroach upon celebrities’ privacy in two key arenas; public and private.
In the United States, the law limits anyone’s privacy rights while that person is in
public. When a celebrity—or any person—is in public or in a place where they
cannot claim a reasonable expectation of privacy, anyone else generally has the
right to photograph them. Because of this legal protection, paparazzi cluster in public
places—outside buildings, on sidewalks—where they expect to see celebrities. The
paparazzi then follow celebrities, sometimes quite closely and aggressively, for
“candid”  photos. In most situations, this behavior is legal, if not ethical.
A different legal and ethical issue surrounds photos taken in private settings,
usually with the use of telephoto lenses. Celebrities—and others—can generally
expect privacy when they are in places not normally seen or frequented by the public,
including inside private buildings and on private property, if that property is far
from public property. In the United States, it is usually illegal to take photos of
individuals in private places, at least if they have taken steps—closing curtains or
building fences, for instance—to try to gain privacy. Nevertheless, many paparazzi
continue to try to photograph celebrities wherever they are.
Diana, Princess of Wales, was a prime target of paparazzi during and after her
marriage to Britain’s Prince Charles. From the time of her marriage to Charles in
1981, celebrity-oriented media followed Diana’s every move. After the couple’s
separation and divorce, paparazzi attempted to get photos of Diana with the men
she dated. In August 1997 she and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, were killed in Paris
when their car crashed as their driver attempted to evade paparazzi on motorcycles.
Worldwide outrage against the paparazzi was immediate, with editorials in the
United States calling them “vultures,”  “bottom feeders,”  “jackals,”  and “reptilian.”
Diana’s brother confronted the issue directly, saying, “I always believed the press
would kill her in the end. But not even I could imagine that they would take such a
direct hand in her death as seems to be the case. . . . It would appear that every
proprietor and editor of every publication that has paid for intrusive and exploitative
photographs of her, encouraging greedy and ruthless individuals to risk everything in
pursuit of Diana’s image, has blood on his hands today”  (Sharkey, 19). Although
criticism muted somewhat when it was determined that Diana’s driver—who was
also killed—was drunk and driving at up to 120 miles per hour, paparazzi generally
had suffered a substantial blow to their already poor reputation.
The months following the Princess of Wales’s death saw legislative attempts to
curtail paparazzi activity in the United States. In California, one bill would have
barred photographers from going within 15 feet of unwilling subjects, and state
senator Tom Hayden, the ex-husband of actress Jane Fonda, suggested licensing
photographers and creating a “Commission of Inquiry into Paparazzi Behavior.”

In the U.S. House of Representatives, Representative Sonny Bono, himself a
celebrity and paparazzi target, introduced the “Protection from Personal Intrusion
Act”  just 10 days after Princess Diana’s death. This legislation barred “harassing”
behavior, defined as following a victim who had a reasonable expectation of pri-
vacy, for the purposes of taking a photo, video, or sound recording that would then
be sold for profit. The punishment would have been between one and 20 years in
prison. The following year, after Bono’s death in a skiing accident, U.S. senators
Russ Feingold and Orrin Hatch introduced the “Personal Privacy Protection Act,”
which would have outlawed following someone with the intent to take a photo for
later commercial gain, when that following caused fear of bodily harm to the
subject. While none of these bills at the state or federal level became law, they
demonstrated the concern that lawmakers had with paparazzi and invasions of privacy.
California did, however, react to Princess Diana’s death by redefining existing
privacy laws. Trespass and intrusion laws were changed in 1998 to include an
offensive physical or electronic trespass or assault “with the intent to capture any
type of visual image . . . [of another person] engaging in a personal or familial
activity”  (Invasion of Privacy to Capture Physical Impression). In 2006 that law
was amended specifically in reaction to several incidents involving celebrities and
paparazzi. The amended statute—signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
himself a paparazzi target—increased penalties to three times the actual damage
caused by the incident and forfeiture of any money made from sale of photographs
or video from the incident. The changes also made publishers—not just
paparazzi—liable. A number of legal scholars have suggested that the statute as
amended violates the U.S. Constitution.

Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 48 (1973)
In Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 48 (1973), the United States
Supreme Court decided the validity of an injunction against the showing of allegedly
obscene movies in adult theaters. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Warren
Burger decided that the Constitution did not prevent the state of Georgia from
regulating allegedly obscene material shown to the public in an adult theater, so
long as the Georgia regulations met First Amendment obscenity standards as
required by the Supreme Court’s decision in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15
(1973).
The case arose over the ongoing showing of allegedly adult, obscene movies by
two Atlanta, Georgia, movie theaters. The state of Georgia sought to have the

370
Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 48 (1973)
\
showing of these films halted by filing an injunction with the court. The evidence
revealed that the two theaters were clearly marked as adult movie theaters, and
there was no evidence suggesting that minors were either allowed in or excluded
from the commercial theaters. Upon viewing the films, the Georgia Supreme Court
decided, “The films in this case leave little to the imagination. It is plain what they
purport to depict, that is, conduct of the most salacious character.”  That court
found that the films were “hard core pornography,”  and that the showing of the
films could be stopped by an injunction “since their exhibition is not protected”  by
the First Amendment. After a series of decision in the state courts of Georgia, the
issue found its way to the United States Supreme Court.
Chief Justice Burger began by insisting that the Supreme Court did not want “to
tell the States what they must do, but rather to define the area in which they chart
their own course in dealing with obscene material. This Court has consistently held
that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment as a limitation on
the state police power by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.”
He further stated the majority “categorically disapprove the theory . . . that
obscene, pornographic films acquire constitutional immunity from state regulation
simply because they are exhibited for consenting adults.”  He pointed to “an unbroken
series of cases extending over a long stretch”  that “the primary requirements of
decency may be enforced against obscene publications.”  Thus, from the very
beginning, it was clear that Chief Justice Burger was not prepared to unconditionally
protect the constitutional right of adults to watch pornographic films in a commer-
cial, public movie theater.
To undercut the protection for pornography, Chief Justice Burger emphasized
that “there are legitimate state interests at stake in stemming the tide of commer-
cialized obscenity, even assuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards
against exposure to juveniles and to passersby.”  Focusing on this issue, he listed
the following as legitimate state interests at stake: “the interest of the public in the
quality of life, the total community environment, the tone of commerce in the great
city centers, and possibly, the public safety itself.”  To bolster the importance of
limiting pornography to protect this final interest, Chief Justice Burger cited a
congressional study establishing “at least an arguable correlation between obscene
material and crime.”
In response to the challenge that there was not any conclusive evidence estab-
lishing a measurable effect on crime or any harm to society from movies such as
this, the majority responded by deferring to the legislative branch on policy issues.
The Supreme Court refused to extend itself into the realm of making judgment calls
based on statistics, and it declined the opportunity to question the methodology of the
Georgia legislature in formulating its justifications for reducing pornography in the
public sphere. As Chief Justice Burger phrased it, “We do not demand of legisla-
tures scientifically certain criteria of legislation.”
Focusing on privacy, Chief Justice Burger also noted the diminished privacy
interest of an individual outside one’s home. Quoting a sociologist, he noted that
although the privacy within one’s home should not be disturbed, the privacy of all
other individuals in the public is affected if we allow pornography to run rampant
in theaters. Thus, despite the argument in favor of the private right to view movies
in public, the Supreme Court also focused on the alternative privacy right of the

Partner notification
\
371
vast majority of the public to be free from pornography in the public sphere. This
was a new angle to the Supreme Court’s discussion of the right to view pornogra-
phy, and it proved to be persuasive.
Further, the Supreme Court also rejected that “totally unlimited play for free
will”  was a constitutionally recognized right for individuals to exercise. Instead,
the majority focused on the numerous ways in which the First Amendment is lim-
ited despite its seemingly “absolute”  nature. This restriction of rights carried on to
the majority’s classification of the movie theater in this case. The Supreme Court
answered the claim that the right to view a pornographic film did in fact constitute
a private, and not a public activity, by concluding that “the idea of a ‘privacy’ right
and a place of public accommodation are, in this context, mutually exclusive.”
Ultimately, the majority found that the state regulation would be legitimate so
long as the Georgia regulation complied with the holding in Miller v. California,
concerning the three-part test for constituting obscenity. Summarized, these three
parts are (1) the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (2) the
work depicts, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by
applicable state law; and (3) taken as a whole, the work lacks serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value. The majority reaffirmed “obscene material has
no protection under the First Amendment.”  To this end, the majority “directed [its]
holdings, not at thoughts or speech, but at depiction and description of specifically
defined sexual conduct that States may regulate within limits designed to prevent
infringement of First Amendment rights.”

Partner notification
Historically known as contact tracing and modernly renamed partner counseling
and referral services (PCRS), partner notification generally refers to the practice
used by public health officials or counselors to assist persons with infectious condi-
tions to identify and notify their unknowing sexual, drug-sharing, or other partners
of the partner’s potential risks of infection. Partner notification involves significant
privacy concerns among individuals and their partners because (1) individuals infected
with various conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases,
emerging infections like SARS) are asked to identify their partners, which itself is

372
Partner notification
\
private information; and (2) partners are informed of their potential exposure to
infectious agents in ways that may infringe on the health information privacy
interests of the infected individuals. To remedy these privacy concerns, public
health authorities work to protect individual privacy while providing enough infor-
mation to partners to allow them to avoid infection.
Partner notification is a common public health and safety intervention because it
offers significant benefits to individuals with infectious conditions, their partners, and
the community. Through partner notification, persons who may be unaware are
informed of their potential exposure to infectious conditions. Notified partners are
often advised to be tested, counseled about safe behaviors to avoid future exposures,
and in some cases, offered medical treatment. Partner notification begins when per-
sons infected with identified conditions are encouraged by public health authorities
or private health care providers to volunteer specific information about their partners.
Under this protocol, the infected individual, a doctor, or a public health counselor
then informs known partners of their possible exposure to an infectious condition.
Newly informed partners are referred for counseling, testing, and social and medical
services as necessary, thus completing the partner notification cycle.
Partner notification as a public health practice has traditionally recognized that
maintaining patient confidentiality is critical in accomplishing public health
objectives and respecting individual autonomy. Still, the privacy implications
underlying partner notification are profound. Individuals with an infectious disease
may resist participating in partner notification efforts because they believe identify-
ing their partners will or may result in a breach of privacy. Principles of law and
ethics, however, suggest that individual privacy rights do not extend so far as to
jeopardize the health of others. It is illegal and unethical, for example, for a person
with HIV to knowingly expose others to this condition through unsafe sexual or
needle-sharing practices. These partners have a right to know about those risks of
which they are otherwise unaware. Ideally, partner notification is designed to be
conducted anonymously—that is, the identity of the infected individual is not
released to the partner. Partner notification counselors are required to maintain the
privacy and security of an individual’s identity under federal and state constitu-
tional, statutory, and regulatory laws. This does not mean that the partner will not
be able to identify the infected individual. For example, a spouse may be able to
reasonably conclude that her husband has exposed her to HIV when anonymously
informed of this situation by a public health counselor. Although not the intent of
the counselor, the result is that private health information (the husband’s HIV status)
is disclosed and his privacy interests are infringed.
Partner notification is thus challenged based on the privacy interests of those
infected and on the grounds that it is violates constitutional, statutory, and common
law privacy protections. These challenges regularly fail in light of the overriding
governmental interests in preserving the public health, the voluntary nature of partner
notification, and the non-applicability of privacy protections that are usually
trumped by legislative or other legal provisions authorizing partner notification.

Password protection
Passwords are a commonly used mechanism for controlling access to secured
resources. Users who have valid passwords can identify themselves to the system
and gain access to the secured area. The system simply denies access to individuals
without the proper credentials. Passwords, although commonly used in computer
systems, date from ancient times. Soldiers guarding protected gates would chal-
lenge any person who approached them for a password. Only those who were able
to give the appropriate response were allowed to “pass” through. In contemporary
times, passwords form one of the cornerstones of electronic security and serve as a
primary tool in preventing unauthorized access to secure resources such as file sys-
tems, electronic mail servers, databases, networks, bank accounts, automatic
teller machines (ATMs), and the like.
Each access-restricted resource typically has an access control matrix, which is
essentially a list of identities; successful corroboration of an identity with the help
of the password allows a user to gain access to that resource. Most systems do not
store the actual passwords in plaintext for obvious security reasons; instead, systems
store the passwords in a cryptographically protected format. One such format is a
cryptographic hash such as SHA-1. Although there are several established ways for
proving identity using a password, the simplest way involves a user sending the
password in plaintext over an encrypted channel to the secure resource, which then
locally computes the hash of the password and compares it with the stored value.
More sophisticated methods include challenge-response based protocols and zero-
knowledge proofs.
Although password-based protection is widely used in computer system secu-
rity, this kind of protection is vulnerable to a number of attacks. Most commonly,
password-based protection systems are prone to guessing or to dictionary-based
attacks since most people pick passwords that are easy to remember and therefore
are easy for attackers to guess as well. Additionally, a number of social engineering–
based attacks are also possible. For example, if a system forces the users to pick
very complex passwords, many people will write them down on paper to keep them
handy. If the system forces the users to change their passwords frequently, the users
tend to re-use old passwords to avoid memorizing a new one each time. Thus a
password protection scheme needs to maintain a fine balance between ease of use
and security.
Password-based protection schemes, while widely used and very convenient,
have some inherent limitations. These schemes place a large burden on individual
users to maintain and protect their passwords from attackers. It is difficult for an
individual user to remember and maintain several difficult-to-guess passwords and
protect these from various social engineering and phishing attacks. More sophisti-
cated identification schemes, which overcome some of the limitations of password-
based protection schemes, involve biometrics or cryptographic smart cards.

Paternity
There is a long history of legal precedents for paternity and privacy. As early as
1923, in Meyer v. Nebraska, the United States Supreme Court broadened the scope
of the Fourteenth Amendment and established the tradition of procreative liberty,
ruling that the state cannot interfere with one’s decision to establish a family. Further,
Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) stated that parents can raise their children in the
manner in which they see fit. There have also been numerous cases, such as Skinner v.
Oklahoma (1942), Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), Eisenstadt v.
Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), and Carey v. Population Services International (1977),
that specified the private nature of the decision to use or not to use contraceptives.
Two other landmark cases were Stanley v. Illinois (1972), which gave parents the
fundamental right to associate with and raise their children, and Moore v. City of
East Cleveland (1977), which stated that family can be defined more broadly than
as a traditional nuclear family.
While these legal precedents have protected the idea of several types of privacy
and several types of paternity issues, they have also been challenged. Recent issues
have arisen because there are practices that explicitly ignore privacy issues, there
are gaps in laws, different laws can contradict one another, or courts can interpret
laws differently. Some laws explicitly ignore privacy issues and do not directly
relate back to any legal precedent. For example, a violation of maternal and paternal
informational privacy can be seen in one state’s in-hospital paternity establishment
program, where a new mother’s mere mention of the name of a man as a possible
father gets recorded by hospital personnel and passed on to the state office of child
support enforcement, which then tracks down the man.
Another example is the 2001 Sexual History Newspaper Requirement in Florida,
also known as the Tell All Adoption Law, or what critics called the “Scarlet Letter
Law,”  which was aimed at single mothers who were putting their babies up for
adoption and were unsure of the fathers’ identities. In an advertisement, the mother
had to disclose her name, age, height, hair and eye color, race, and weight; her child’s
name, date and place of birth, and—if it were the address that was unknown—the
father’s name. Moreover, the mother had to publish her sexual history: a descrip-
tion of every potential father and the dates and places of their sexual encounters. The
ad had to run once a week for four weeks in a newspaper in each city or county in
which conception might have taken place in the year before the child’s birth. The
point of such a law was for the father to be able to claim the child before it was put up
for adoption, but the ads did not produce any wayward fathers. Six mothers brought
the first suit to court in 2002, and the judge denied the motion for a declaratory judg-
ment. He held that the two mothers who had conceived as a result of rape were not
subject to the law, but the law was constitutional for the other four women. In 2003,
however, the Florida appeals court struck down the law.

Paternity
\
375
There have also been attempts explicitly aimed at controlling paternity through
the invasion of informational privacy. For example, Iowa anti-choice advocates
videotaped women on their way to abortion clinics in 2002. In the same year,
authorities in Storm Lake, Iowa, tried to get Planned Parenthood to turn over
records of pregnancy tests because they were trying to find out about a dis-
membered newborn. Although Planned Parenthood refused, a judge upheld the
subpoena on the grounds that pregnancy tests are not covered by doctor-patient
confidentiality since nonmedical personnel can perform them. And in 2005, the
Kansas attorney general sought to open medical records of two abortion clinics as
part of his investigation of child rape and illegal late-term abortions. The records
were not opened as the court decided in 2006 that this would be a breach of patient
privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA).
Other legal decisions have sought to control paternity through the invasion of
decisional privacy, or the freedom to make autonomous choices about our private
lives. In opposition to U.S. Supreme Court decisions that procreation is a basic
human right, in 2001 a Texas district judge threatened a life prison sentence and
ordered a man not to have sex with anyone until he was married, expressing fear
that he would be a deadbeat dad. Concurrently, the Wisconsin Supreme Court
sustained a lower-court ruling that would jail a man for eight years if he fathered
another child without proving that he could support all his children.
Laws also constrain decisional privacy and go against procreative liberty when
they define who cannot be parents. There are restrictions on gay people who do not
necessarily have legal recognition of their relationships with their children, such as
non-biological mothers seeking second-parent adoption. Other examples may
come from state law that can determine when natural parents are unfit. Further, in
one child custody case, a father ordered genetic testing of the mother to see if she
had certain diseases in efforts to define her as an unfit mother. Forced medical testing
would also have been an incursion into the mother’s physical privacy, as well as her
informational and decisional privacy.
Finally, over the past ten years nearly every state or federal welfare program has
included a family cap that prohibits an increase in benefits for additional children.
Some states have proposed legislation offering incentives for men to get vasectomies,
for women on welfare to use long-lasting contraceptives, and for recipients to
participate in family planning counseling. Not only is this verging on invading
physical privacy, especially for low-income and/or nonwhite individuals, but the
women’s informational privacy is also being breached through requiring them to
divulge confidential information to the state in reporting whether they are sexually
active and able to become pregnant. A 2002 Pennsylvania ruling, aimed at control-
ling paternity through forced procreation, gave a boyfriend the right to bar his
former girlfriend from getting an abortion. The decision was eventually overturned,
but critics remark that cases aimed at controlling fertility invade both physical and
decisional privacy and ring of either positive or negative eugenics—promoting or
deterring procreation among certain segments of the population. Defying Pierce v.
Society of Sisters (1925), laws also exist that specify how to parent, leading to
possible breaches of both physical and decisional privacy. Some states have laws
on prenatal screening and can even charge a woman with “prenatal abuse”  or

376
Patient rights
\
“wrongful life”  if she refuses the testing or exposes her fetus to prenatal dangers.
The United States Office of Technology Assessment also found that some health
insurance companies have attempted to withdraw their coverage if the women
involved did not get prenatal testing. Along the same lines, some believe that a
woman’s physical privacy is breached when her body is no longer considered a
private sphere through such procedures as fetal surgery, where she becomes
secondary as her health is put aside and the fetus gains almost full patient rights
through medical and legal representation.
In other instances, it has been difficult to apply extant court cases to new practices.
For example, there have been different interpretations as to who is actually the
mother in surrogate motherhood—is it the adoptive mother, the genetic mother
(egg donor), or the gestational mother? In another example, employers may collect
genetic information about employees and their children, yet there are few laws
about access and disclosure. Further, research studies may obtain information
about a person that includes information about the person’s family members with-
out their consent. As a side note, some also worry about breaches in privacy given
that data from these studies can be hacked.
The above cases and examples outline breaches of privacy regarding paternity;
there are also practices that attempt to protect this kind of privacy, although some
have come into question. In 1998 a Georgia court sealed information about a
woman who claimed she was the illegitimate child of a celebrity by citing invasion
of privacy and the resulting embarrassment, yet the Georgia Supreme Court over-
ruled this decision. Others claim that some privacy protections for paternity may
have negative repercussions, such as the application of patient privacy in the delivery
room whereby the medical staff may not know that the woman giving birth conceived
through ovum transfer. This can cause confusion with blood typing and result in
more procedures for mother and baby.

Patient rights
In the clinical context, the right to privacy refers to a myriad of expectations that
include the right to be let alone, the right to physical privacy, the right to have the
confidentiality of personal and sensitive information maintained, the right not to
have medical procedures imposed without consent, the right to have treatment
choices respected and not interfered with, the right to access personal information in

Patient rights
\
377
a medical record, and the proprietary right to aspects of a person’s identity such as
genetic information, pictures of oneself, and biological material that may lead to prog-
eny (sperm, ova, and embryos). Privacy-related rights are protected by common law and
federal and state regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Account-
ability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Agencies such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Healthcare Organizations require affiliated institutions to comply with patient pri-
vacy guidelines. Patient bills of rights have been adopted by such entities as the Amer-
ican Hospital Association and introduced for legislation in the United States.
The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly protect privacy, but several constitu-
tional amendments, including the First, Third, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments are
interpreted to create various privacy rights. A federal commitment to individual
privacy is reflected in state privacy laws and case laws pertinent to patient care. In
Sanchez-Scott v. Alza Pharmaceuticals, a woman claimed her privacy was invaded
when a male pharmaceutical representative was in the examination room during a
breast exam. Her oncologist misled the patient by suggesting that the representative
was there in a clinical capacity. The California Appeals Court agreed that her privacy
rights had been breached.
Patients reasonably expect health care providers to respect their privacy for at
least two reasons. First, health care providers need private information for the purpose
of treating patients. Disclosure of information to anyone who has a questionable role
or no role in patient care would be exploitative. Second, patients will not seek help
from clinicians if they do not believe sensitive information is kept in confidence;
therefore, patient privacy is pertinent to public health and safety.
In the interest of their health, patients grant health care providers access to private
domains, rendering patients vulnerable to exploitation if health care professionals do
not respect patient confidentiality. Confidentiality is a centuries-old medical
obligation reflected in the Hippocratic Oath: “What I may see or hear in the course
of the treatment . . . which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep to
myself.”  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires
health care providers to obtain patients’ consent to disclose or use personally
identifiable information (e.g., name and date of birth) or to release medical infor-
mation to entities not directly involved in medical services or billing. HIPAA
attempts to balance good patient care, which requires patients to relinquish some of
their privacy, with patients’ interests in keeping such information confidential. The
act requires health care institutions to implement reasonable protections for privacy
and confidentiality, and to inform patients of their privacy rights and the institution’s
privacy practices.
There are five realms of patient privacy that receive special attention in the law
and bioethics: reproductive issues, end-of-life issues, infectious diseases, mental
health issues, and genetic issues. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), by
supporting the right of clinicians to provide information and instruction about
contraception, established that state interference in reproductive decisions often
violates a patient’s right to privacy. An exception is when a woman’s privacy right
competes with the state’s interest in protecting a viable fetus. According to Roe v.
Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), state abortion laws must protect a woman’s right to an
abortion until the fetus can live outside the woman’s womb, or when continuing the
pregnancy threatens the life or health of the woman.

378
Patient rights
\
Patient information about abortion procedures is considered highly sensitive.
When, in preparation for a trial, the Department of Justice subpoenaed records of
patients who underwent abortion procedures, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that
the damage to patients and facilities where abortions were performed outweighed
the probative value, even when identifying features were removed from the
records.
Privacy rights are also often invoked regarding end-of-life decisions. The Patient
Self-Determination Act of 1991 and state natural death acts protect patients’ rights
not to have treatments imposed against their wishes, and pertain especially to
end-of-life treatment decisions. Patients may refuse resuscitation, tube feeding,
dialysis, and ventilators in order to allow a natural death to occur. 
More controversial is assisted suicide, in which competent patients ask physi-
cians to write prescriptions for lethal medications in order to end their own lives. In
the United States, Oregon is the only state where physician-assisted suicide is legal
for terminally ill patients. Cases have been brought to other states’ supreme courts
in attempts to liberalize patient rights. In 1997, Charles E. Hall, a patient with HIV,
asked the Florida court to place an injunction that would stop the state’s attorney
from prosecuting Mr. Hall’s doctor if he helped Mr. Hall commit suicide in the
future. The injunction was granted in the lower court by appealing to Florida’s
privacy law that states “every natural person has the right to be let alone and free
from governmental intrusion into his private life.”  The Florida Supreme Court
ultimately disagreed with the lower court. The appeals for privacy in end-of-life
decisions are similar to those for reproductive and sexual privacy practices: the
manner in which one lives one’s life is personal, and individuals have the right not
to have their end-of-life choices interfered with.
Patients expect higher standards of privacy and confidentiality with regard to
information about infectious diseases, particularly sexually transmitted diseases,
and psychiatric treatment. This is because of the potential harms that can come
from disclosure, which include stigmatization, discrimination within and outside of
the workplace, and inability to qualify for health insurance. Many state laws stipulate
that health care institutions must ask patients for special authorization to release
HIV, substance abuse, and mental health information.
There are limits to privacy protection when a person’s disease may impact the
health of others. Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV must be reported
to local public health agencies for the purpose of surveillance, investigation, and
intervention, and these disclosures need not be authorized by the patient. Still, only
minimal patient identifiable information should be disclosed. In these cases the
public health interest outweighs the patient’s right to privacy.
Genetic information and testing also heighten privacy concerns. A genetic test
might be used to predict a person’s susceptibility to a disease such as breast cancer
or Huntington’s disease. Without strict confidentiality standards, insurance companies
or employers might discriminate against patients based on predilection for a
disease the person does not even have and may never contract. A number of states
have anti-genetic-discrimination laws, and federal bills have been introduced in the
Senate and House. Legal protection is important because patients may want genetic
information to make prophylactic treatment choices or, as in the case of Huntington’s

Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980)
\
379
disease for which there is no cure, to make life plans. Such information impacts not
only the patient but other family members who may carry the same gene.
Similarly, privacy is important in prenatal genetic testing. Parents’ choices to
terminate or continue pregnancies based on the results of genetic tests are considered
as private as other reproductive decisions. Privacy issues are also raised in predictive
genetic testing, where a female patient may need genetic information from a relative
to determine her predilection for a specific disease such as breast cancer. The
patient’s family member may not want to know if she has the breast cancer gene,
especially if she is currently healthy. Further, even without testing family members,
when one family member confirms he or she has a gene associated with a disease,
it raises questions about the genetic disposition of other family members. Because
of these complicated patient right and privacy issues, genetic counseling is recom-
mended for all patients who seek prenatal or predictive genetic testing.
Privacy is an essential patient right because without it, patients might be reluctant
to share personal and sensitive health information with their care providers. In this
way, patients’ rights to privacy help protect their health.

Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980)
In January of 1970, after two days of investigation, New York detectives had
assembled sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to believe that Theodore
Payton had murdered the manager of a gas station a few days earlier. On January
15, 1970, six officers arrived at Payton’s home with the intent to arrest him without
a warrant. Although there were significant signs and noise indicating that someone
was in the residence, there was no answer to the officers’ knock on the door.
Emergency assistance arrived a short time later, and the officers used crowbars to
enter the residence. No one was home, but in plain view was a shell casing that
was seized and later admitted into evidence against Payton at his trial. Payton later
surrendered and moved to suppress the casing. At the time in New York, there
existed a statute that allowed police officers to enter a private residence without a
search warrant and with force, if necessary, to make a routine felony arrest.
The trial judge held that the warrantless entry into Payton’s home was allowed
under the New York Code of Criminal Procedure. Furthermore, the judge held that
the shell casing seized in plain view was properly seized. The rationale behind the
judge’s decision was that he found exigent circumstances justified the officers’ failure
to announce their presence before entering the residence. However, the judge failed

380
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies
\
to decide whether the circumstances justified the failure to obtain a warrant, and
rather concluded that the state statute supported the entry.
The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the New York statute was a
violation of constitutional protections. The Court decided that the statute was, in
fact, unconstitutional. The Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the states
through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits police from making a warrantless
and nonconsensual entry into a suspect’s home to make a felony arrest. The Court’s
opinion pointed out that it was arguable that the warrantless entry to arrest Payton
might have been justified by exigent circumstances. However, none of the New
York courts relied on such justification. In fact, the New York statute circumvented
the justification and treated such arrests as routine arrests.
Physical entry of the home, and the violation of the right to be secure in one’s
own house, is the chief evil against which the wording Fourth Amendment is
directed. Entries into a house without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.
The protection of the Fourth Amendment of an individual’s privacy is clearly in
regard to the dimension of one’s individual home. A person can retreat into his or
her home and maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy. Without any exigent
circumstances, a person is safe in his or her home, and the person’s interest in the
sanctity of his or her home outweighs governmental interests. In this case, there
existed no exigent circumstances. Rather, there existed only a state statute that
circumvented the requirement of exigent circumstances.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies
Developed for their decentralized capabilities, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies
are computer networks that use nodes instead of the classic server-and-client
model. These nodes are individual computers (peers) functioning together as
equals, with both server and client forming a P2P network. One of the key aspects
of this model is its distributive nature. That is, because the users are acting as
severs as well as clients, the burden of bandwidth, storage space, and computing
power is redistributed among the peers active on the network. This redistribution
also eliminates single points of failure in the system because the network is not

Pen register
\
381
relying on a central server to store and distribute data. Because of this aspect, Peer-
to-Peer technologies have recently been used in the realm of scientific research.
These networks can be used to run large programs or process large amounts of
data.
A P2P network gives a user the ability to share any information stored on his or
her hard drive with any other user on the network. With the rise of Napster in 1999
and its eventual collapse in 2001, P2P technologies became famous for enabling
the sharing of music in the form of MP3s. Since Napster’s demise, P2P networks
have expanded to become a black market for the distribution of software, movies,
e-books, pictures, and other unlicensed digital media. In the late 1990s, the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA) led the fight to eradicate file sharing. They saw the use of P2P
networks for these purposes as a clear violation of intellectual property rights and a
direct threat to the future of their industries. Others in the technology community
cited the U.S. Supreme Court case of Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios Inc. (the
Betamax decision), which essentially placed the burden of the law on the copies
and copiers of intellectual property and not on the medium on which they were
copied, indicating that individuals are responsible for piracy, not the P2P network.
P2P technology can be extremely hazardous to those using it. P2P networks can
leave the computers in a network vulnerable to hackers and a number of forms of
computer attacks. When connected to the P2P network, anyone with the right tools
can access personally identifiable information that may be stored on a computer,
such as credit card numbers, passwords, and personal correspondence. From
copyrighted material being openly available to others to viruses and spyware, there
have been a host of problems associated with this sharing medium.
P2P and other decentralized networks of peers have been used since Usenet in
1979 and FidoNet in 1984 and have grown considerably in popularity and use since
their inception. With the advent of Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) and academic
P2P networks such as LionShare, P2P technologies are becoming more main-
stream and secure but are still subject to many privacy and security concerns.

Pen register
The term “pen register”  refers to a device or process that records or decodes all
non-content dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an
instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted.
The phrase “trap-and-trace”  references a device or process that captures all non-
content incoming electronic or other impulses that identify the originating number
or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to
identify the source of a wire or electronic communication. In telephone surveil-
lance, pen registers record the telephone numbers of outgoing calls made from a

382
Pen register
\
phone line, and trap-and-trace devices or processes record the telephone numbers
of incoming calls made to a phone line. These devices are almost always referred to
in tandem, and are treated as one in legal literature.
In 1979 the Supreme Court held that the use of these devices did not involve the
Fourth Amendment since the devices do not intercept or acquire the contents of
communications as defined by 18 U.S.C. ß2510(8). These devices are capable only
of receiving signaling information like pulses and tones, not sound. In fact, these
data are placed on a different channel from the voice conversations, so the resulting
technological barrier prevents the device from inadvertently accessing phone
conversations.
Congress responded to the potential privacy issues resulting from unwarranted
intrusions caused by the government’s use of these devices with the Electronic
Communication Privacy Act (1986). The ECPA establishes that law enforcement
officials must request authorization from a judge prior to using these devices on a
specific target. Authorization for installation will be granted whenever the government
certifies that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal
investigation. Probable cause is not required. Nor is there any requirement that the
target of the investigation ever be notified that such a device was used or that an
application was ever sought. Furthermore, since the Fourth Amendment is not
involved, there is no exclusionary remedy for unlawful usage.
With the advent of technology and the evolving need for Internet surveillance,
Congress passed Section 216 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) in an effort to update pen-register legislation
for the Internet age. Section 216 modified certain ECPA provisions so that pen
registers and trap-and-trace devices applied to Internet surveillance. The act
required some mandatory reporting on the use of government-installed pen registers,
but it also significantly expanded the government’s surveillance powers by allowing
for nationwide orders. These regulations extended the content and non-content
theory by analogy to all electronic communications, including Internet communi-
cations. In other words, the content of telephone and Internet communications is
now governed by the full warrant standards applicable to general wiretaps, whereas
the non-content information like dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling infor-
mation is governed by the pen register law. The government has developed new
surveillance technology and methods for obtaining Internet pen register information,
such as the Carnivore (DCS1000) system. However, the government usually just
requests the information directly from an Internet service provider.

Personally identifiable information
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a unique piece of data or indicator
that can be used to identify, locate, or contact a specific individual. Permitting
identification or recognition of a unique person is what distinguishes PII from other
types of personal information (information that may be sensitive, embarrassing, or
offensive that an individual may wish to control, keep private, or not have disclosed
to others without consent).
Examples of PII are wide ranging and include an individual’s name; geographic,
physical, or postal address; phone number; electronic mail address; bank or credit
account numbers; and Social Security number. PII is sometimes defined by exclusion.
For example, PII is not data that are merely statistical or aggregate information that
does not identify a particular person. Information that is not directly linked to an
individual, such as any information that is collected anonymously, is not categorized as
PII. Some examples of information that can be collected anonymously include
statistical information, state of residence, age, gender, race, purchases, or salary.
Personal information such as last names, fingerprints, personal profiles, or
Internet Protocol addresses are not by themselves PII. However, personal information
from various sources can be pieced together to create PII. For example, an Internet
Protocol address does not, by itself, identify a specific person. However, if the
Internet Protocol address is combined with an Internet service provider’s customer
records that show which customer has been assigned to that address, the combined
information becomes PII and may allow someone to identify, locate, or contact that
specific individual customer.
PII is collected, stored, used, and shared by individuals, organizations, and
institutions, including government entities. Exchange of PII is necessary to facilitate
many activities, communicate, obtain benefits and services, and transact business. PII
is necessary to performing various economic functions related to an individual,
such as payroll, human resources, marketing, and banking.
While PII has always been in existence and used in a variety of contexts, its
value as a commodity has increased with advances in information technology.
The Internet and other technologies, including advancements in database and
data-mining software and processes, have enabled faster and easier collection
and exchange of PII. In addition, emerging information technologies have
expanded the uses and value of PII in both commercial and noncommercial applica-
tions. Emerging technologies have permitted the development of new business mod-
els, including data brokers, and have facilitated the ability of marketing
companies to share PII for profit. As a result, there has been an explosion in tar-
geted marketing techniques that may be considered intrusive and may involve
individuals’ privacy rights. Examples include spam e-mail and telemarketing.
Moreover, emerging technologies have expanded the definition of PII in the digital
environment to include information that, if disclosed, could result in identifying an
individual physically or electronically.

Personally identifiable information
\
PII is used in combination with other information to predict an individual’s
tastes, interests, and future behavior. Predictive analysis and profiling increasingly
have been employed in the commercial and law enforcement sectors. PII, com-
bined with other personal information such as consumer purchases, can create an
accurate electronic dossier or digital persona that can forecast how an individual
might spend money or leisure time, how an individual may be inclined to vote, or
an individual’s propensity to commit crimes. Thus, PII used in this context has
great commercial, governmental, and political importance.
While much PII is voluntarily disclosed by the person to whom it pertains, PII
can also be disclosed and used without the person’s knowledge or consent. There
are serious ramifications to that person’s privacy when PII is maintained by entities
that do not take adequate security measures to protect personal information from
unauthorized use or disclosure. Such acts may result in identity fraud, stalking, or
other crimes as well as possible injury to a person’s physical safety, finances, or
reputation.
PII is stored on various objects like Social Security cards, drivers’ licenses,
passports, and credit cards. Because of the proliferation of new technologies
and business models, PII will be increasingly stored on biometric devices,
smart cards, and even medical emergency devices (for example, radio fre-
quency identification (RFID) chips, that may be carried by or implanted in
patients). These media may employ security measures that reduce the possibil-
ity that the included PII will be compromised and subject to unauthorized use
or disclosure.
There is no comprehensive federal law protecting the privacy of PII. Further,
there are slight variations in the meaning of PII when used in different legal con-
texts. The term “personally identifiable information”  is mentioned in a number
of federal and state statutes, but federal law provides few actual definitions. The
Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 provides
one useful explanation. It describes PII as “information concerning an identified
individual that, if disclosed, will result in contacting or identifying such an indi-
vidual physically or electronically.”  The U.S. Department of Education’s defini-
tion of PII, as applied to student educational records under the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), includes “(a) The student’s
name; (b) the name of the student’s parent or other family member; (c) the
address of the student or student’s family; (d) a personal identifier, such as
the student’s social security number or student number; (e) a list of personal char-
acteristics that would make the student’s identity easily traceable; or (f) other
information that would make the student’s identity easily traceable.”  The
Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 does not define PII, but it states
that PII “does not include any record of aggregate data which does not iden-
tify particular persons.” 
In passing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA), Congress recognized that medical treatment requires the exchange of
personally identifiable, often highly sensitive, medical information. The HIPAA
Privacy Rule defines “individually identifiable health information”  as data that
involve an individual’s physical or mental condition or payment for health care
services and that also identifies the individual or creates “a reasonable basis to

Phishing
\
385
believe the information can be used to identify the individual.”  In addition to defining
this form of PII, HIPAA mandated that every covered service provider provide
“reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to
ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the information.”  The HIPAA Privacy
Rule provides patients the right to access and amend their records. Patients also
have the right to ask for disclosures, and limit the use and disclosure of their
personal health records by health care entities.
The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, otherwise known as the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), provides certain protections for the collection,
use, and disclosure of customers’ personal financial information by financial
institutions and others who receive such information. While GLBA does not
expressly define protected financial information, financial records often contain
data that are capable of identifying a specific person, and thus this information
constitutes PII. Under the GLBA, consumers must be given notice as to the financial
institution’s information-sharing policies and practices. Consumers also have the
right to limit some, but not all, sharing of their personally identifiable financial
information with others.
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was enacted to limit
the information, including PII, which commercial websites may collect from
children online. Operators of commercial websites must provide clear and unam-
biguous notice of their privacy policies. COPPA also requires businesses to obtain
parental consent to collect, store, and use PII from children.
In this age of global commerce, domestic companies are increasingly seeking
efficient data processing outside the United States. As a result, a number of companies
have out-sourced business processes to vendors in foreign countries, many of
which have limited or no privacy protections for PII. These vendors are contracted
to process a wide range of records containing PII, including medical research data
and tax return information. Because out-sourced PII may be more vulnerable to
unauthorized use or disclosure resulting from limited foreign protections, there is
increasing concern that regulatory mechanisms need to be updated to protect PII in
the global digital environment.

Plain view doctrine
This doctrine allows the admission of evidence seized by law enforcement officers
during a warrantless search. It also allows the admission of evidence discovered
and seized by police during a search authorized by a warrant even when the warrant
did not specifically cover the items seized. In some instances, it is also interpreted
to allow a warrantless search. In order to seize an item in plain view, there must be
probable cause to believe the item is evidence of a crime, the instrumentality of a
crime, or contraband. Although the doctrine usually applies to objects that can be
seen, it is frequently argued that it may be extended to items that can be smelled,
heard, tasted, or felt.
One of the earliest Supreme Court cases to address the question of what an
officer can do when contraband is in plain view was Steele v. United States, 267
U.S. 498 (1925). In that case, two federal Prohibition agents watched through an
open garage door as cases of whisky were unloaded for storage. They had no
warrant, but they used their observations as the basis to obtain one. Despite the
nature of the primary “search,”  the court authorized the subsequent warrant and
approved the eventual seizure of more than 200 cases of whisky and gin, two
50-gallon drums of whisky, several 5-gallon jugs, and dozens of filled whisky bottles.
The violation of privacy, however, was not addressed.
Steele was distinguished from Taylor v. United States, 286 U.S. 1 (1932), in
which probation agents had been able to look through a garage window and had
seen boxes of liquor. In that instance, rather than get a warrant, the agents broke
into the garage and seized 122 cases of whisky. The Supreme Court called that
seizure a violation because the officers did not first seek a warrant after observing
the contraband in the garage.
Officers’ ability to seize contraband observed while looking through a doorway
from inside a home received the Supreme Court’s approval in Ker v. California,
374 U.S. 23 (1963). In that case, officers were arresting Ker in his living room
when they looked through a doorway to the kitchen and saw a brick of mari-
juana sitting on a scale. Seizure of the drug, despite the fact that there was no
search warrant, was upheld. “The discovery of the brick of marijuana did not
constitute a search, since the officer merely saw what was placed before him in
full view.” 
The plain view doctrine has been applied by the courts in many instances of
warrantless seizures. An officer who accompanies a student to the student’s dorm
room to get an identification card may lawfully seize marijuana seeds and a pipe in
plain view (Washington v. Chrisman, 455 U.S. 1 (1982)). Officers securing a home
after arresting a robbery suspect may seize evidence of the robbery, such as cloth-
ing worn by the suspected robber, when it is on the floor in plain sight (Maryland v.
Buie, 494 U.S. 325 (1990)). 
The court extended the plain view doctrine to automobiles in Harris v. United
States, 390 U.S. 234 (1968), a robbery case. There, after legally impounding Harris’s
car, an officer opened a car door to close the window to protect the interior from rain
that had begun to fall. In opening the door, the officer found a robbery victim’s regis-
tration card that was later used as evidence against Harris. The Court ruled: “Once

Plain view doctrine
\
387
the door had lawfully been opened, the registration card, with the name of the rob-
bery victim on it, was plainly visible. It has long been settled that objects falling in
the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are
subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.”  According to the Court, the
same logic applies if an officer stops a car for a traffic violation but sees contraband
on a car seat (see, e.g., Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730 (1983)). 
What if the item is not exactly in “plain view” ? In New York v. Class, 475 U.S.
106 (1986), officers stopped a speeder and needed to locate the vehicle identifica-
tion number of his car. One officer opened the car door to look on the doorjamb for
the number and then realized the number for that model car was on the dash. To see
the number, the officer moved some papers out of the way. In doing so, he uncov-
ered a gun handle. Police seized the gun and Class was arrested for illegal posses-
sion of a handgun. In allowing the admission of the gun as evidence, the Supreme
Court stated, “A citizen does not surrender all the protections of the Fourth
Amendment by entering an automobile. Nonetheless, the State’s intrusion into a
particular area, whether in an automobile or elsewhere, cannot result in a Fourth
Amendment violation unless the area is one in which there is a “constitutionally
protected reasonable expectation of privacy.”
For many years, the Supreme Court required that discoveries under the plain
view doctrine must be inadvertent. As the Court noted in Coolidge v. New Hamp-
shire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971), 
What the “plain view”  cases have in common is that the police officer in each of
them had a prior justification for an intrusion in the course of which he came inad-
vertently across a piece of evidence incriminating the accused. The doctrine serves to
supplement the prior justification—whether it be a warrant for another object, hot
pursuit, search incident to lawful arrest, or some other legitimate reason for being
present unconnected with a search directed against the accused—and permits the war-
rantless seizure. Of course, the extension of the original justification is legitimate
only where it is immediately apparent to the police that they have evidence before
them; the “plain view”  doctrine may not be used to extend a general exploratory
search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emerges.
Nevertheless, the Supreme Court did away with the requirement that the discov-
ery be “inadvertent”  in Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). In Horton, after
an armed robbery, a police officer obtained a warrant to search a suspect’s home for
items stolen during the robbery. To obtain the warrant, the office had expressed a
desire to search for stolen property and weapons used during the crime. For
unknown reasons, the warrant only allowed a search for stolen property. While exe-
cuting the warrant, the officer found none of the stolen items, but found and seized
weapons used during the crime. The Court held there were no violations of the
defendant’s privacy rights in this case since a valid warrant had been issued. There-
fore, seizure of the guns was authorized under the plain view doctrine, even though
it was clear the discovery was not “inadvertent.” 
In applying the decision in Horton, courts have basically adopted a three-part test
to determine if the plain view doctrine applies: (1) was the officer engaged in lawful
activity at the time; (2) was the object’s incriminating character obvious and not hid-
den; and (3) did the officer have lawful access to the object—was it in plain view?

There have been cases where the courts have refused to extend the plain view
doctrine, the most notable of which is Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987). In
that case, police responded to Hicks’s apartment after a bullet fired through his
floor hit an occupant in an apartment a floor below. Officers arrived to search for
the shooter, other possible victims, and the weapons used. While looking around
the squalid living quarters, however, an officer saw an expensive stereo that seemed
out of place given the condition of the apartment. The officer moved the stereo
equipment to take down serial numbers. Then, when he called the police station, he
learned that the turntable had been taken in an armed robbery. Hicks was charged
with armed robbery after it was determined all the stereo equipment had been taken
in the same heist.
The Hicks Court took a two-step analysis to determine the plain view doctrine
did not protect police in this case. First, it ruled that moving the equipment to get
the serial number was a search “separate and apart from the search for the shooter,
victims, and weapons that was the lawful objective of his entry into the apartment.”
The second question was whether the search was “reasonable”  under the Fourth
Amendment. The Court found that the search was unreasonable because the officer
did not have probable cause to believe the stereo equipment had been stolen. The
officer’s reasonable suspicion did not equate to probable cause.

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a software program designed to make digital data
more secure through encryption and authentication, particularly for data communi-
cations. It was developed in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann as freeware, and it was the
first widespread program to use asymmetric, public key, encryption algorithms to
ensure privacy of data during transmission. Mainly for performance reasons, PGP
uses the public key to encrypt the shared secret key, which is in turn used to encrypt
the data. Public-key encryption relies on there being two keys for any data transmis-
sion, a private key and a public key. The user of such software can disseminate the
public key widely, as it does not help an individual discover the corresponding private
key or decrypt intercepted messages to which that person is not entitled. The use of

Prisoners
\
389
public-key encryption systems depends on there being a “web of trust,”  or a public-
key infrastructure (PKI) that can provide validation for users of the system. This is
one of the major drawbacks for widespread public use of such systems. An early
impediment to the growing Internet community’s adoption of PGP was the rela-
tively complex structure and installation requirements. The software is usually used
for the encryption of electronic mail, although current versions offer wide flexibility
in their data security and authentication options.
The initial release of the code led to a criminal investigation for export viola-
tions. The United States government saw strong encryption as ammunition for
export purposes, and thus subject to licensing and export restrictions. Although the
case against the primary author, Phil Zimmermann, was dropped in 1996, a number
of issues relating to national security, freedom of expression, and the ability to
restrict the distribution of computer code were raised by this episode. There were
also some early issues with the use of the International Data Encryption Algorithm
and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm (IDEA and RSA), with claims that their
use was in breach of patent. Following the incorporation of the company, PGP was
acquired by Network Associates, Inc., in 1997, but reformed as PGP Corporation
in 2002. The Internet Engineering Task Force has adopted OpenPGP as a proposed
standard that may be implemented by anyone without a license. There are also
some free programs available that employ strong encryption, such as GnuPG and
freeware versions of the commercial PGP.

Prisoners
Privacy is at a premium for the incarcerated. Many prisoners in America’s
jails and prisons live in large dormitories with beds lined up next to each other.
Sometimes their beds are separated by partitions. They share group lavatory
and shower facilities. Many prisoners live in cells with other inmates who also
share an unenclosed sink and commode. Most prisoners eat their meals in a
common area. They are assigned jobs that group them with other inmates and
have little control over their assignments or with whom they work. Recreation
facilities are designed to accommodate groups of prisoners. Prisoners who live
in single cells are housed in cellblocks or pods, where multiple cells are built
next to each other and in rows above and below each other. Although they may
not be able to see other inmates directly, prisoners can hear others talk and
shout around them. 
Adding to the lack of privacy in their living, working, and recreation arrange-
ments is constant supervision by correctional staff. Correctional officers regularly
patrol cellblocks, dormitories, chow halls, recreation areas, and job sites. They
watch group showers and lavatories. They peer into cells and may witness prisoners

390

\
using commodes, and dressing and undressing. Other staff members watch closed-
circuit television monitors with images from cameras positioned in critical places
throughout the facility. Included among the most significant pains of incarceration is
losing the right to engage in basic and intimate human activities in private.
When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Cooper v. Pate (1964) that federal
courts must be accessible to prisoner lawsuits that allege violations of constitutional
protections, a prisoners’ litigation revolution was unleashed. Naturally, prisoners
filed lawsuits challenging policies that limited their privacy interests. Few of those
lawsuits have been successful.
In Rhodes v. Chapman (1981), for example, prisoners double-celled in a maxi-
mum security prison alleged that housing more than one inmate in a cell originally
designed to accommodate one violated the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and
Unusual Punishment Clause. The Supreme Court ruled the Constitution does not
require that inmates be housed in single cells. Although the Eighth Amendment
argument was based on the deleterious effects of overcrowding, the Court’s deci-
sion seriously impacted the privacy interests of prisoners as well. 
Until the Supreme Court decided Procunier v. Martinez (1974), prison adminis-
trators freely censored prisoners’ incoming and outgoing mail for a myriad of rea-
sons, including the right to censor material they thought expressed inflammatory
political, religious, and political views. In 1974, the Supreme Court found such
unfettered censorship violated the First Amendment rights of people who corre-
sponded with prisoners. The Court acknowledged that legitimate security concerns
give administrators the right to read mail sent and received by inmates, but the
Court concluded that censorship is warranted only if it furthers a substantial gov-
ernmental interest, and it must be no greater than necessary. In addition, when cen-
sorship is warranted, administrators must extend notice to both internal and
external correspondents and give them a right to appeal. Even though correctional
administrators retain the right to read prisoner correspondence, Procunier is signif-
icant because it protected prisoners’ rights to send and receive uncensored mail. 
Issues involving inmate correspondence, however, continued to trouble the
courts. The Supreme Court relied on a different legal standard than it applied in
Procunier v. Martinez to consider whether prohibiting prisoners from correspond-
ing with other prisoners violated the Constitution. In Turner v. Safely (1984), the
Court concluded such a regulation could be supported by legitimate security con-
cerns and upheld its constitutionality. In Thornburgh v. Abbott (1989), the Court
applied the legal standard used in Turner to uphold the constitutionality of regula-
tions prohibiting inmates from receiving publications that authorities judged were
detrimental to institutional security, even though there was no evidence that refus-
ing to deliver them served a substantial governmental interest and was the least
restrictive means available. In explaining its decision, the Court noted that the strict
Procunier v. Martinez test, which required correctional authorities to demonstrate
that correspondence regulations served a significant governmental interest, only
applied to mail sent by prisoners to individuals outside the institution. That mail
presented a lower security risk than mail sent to prisoners. The legality of regula-
tions governing the mail inmates receive can be evaluated under a lesser standard:
does the regulation further a legitimate governmental interest in providing a secure
institution? The Thornburgh decision gives officials significant discretion to

Prisoners
\
391
restrict what inmates can read. The Turner decision allows officials to institute a
blanket ban on inmate-to-inmate correspondence. 
Although the Fourth Amendment protects against “unreasonable searches and
seizures,”  the scope of that protection is significantly diminished for anyone who
is incarcerated. Officials regularly search cells and dormitories for contraband and
weapons. In Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984), the Supreme Court ruled that
officials may conduct those searches without a prisoner’s consent or knowledge,
and for any reason or no reason at all. Prisoners simply do not have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in their housing areas. In addition to having their “houses”
searched, prisoners are also subject to regular searches of their bodies. From walk-
ing through metal detectors, to pat-down searches of outer clothing, to strip
searches (which often include visual inspection of a prisoner’s body cavities), pris-
oners’ bodies have no Fourth Amendment protections. As long as a pat-down or
strip search is conducted in a professional manner and not done to harass or humil-
iate an inmate, officials have enormous discretion to conduct such searches for vir-
tually any reason. Even individuals detained in jail, even though they are not yet
convicted and are still presumed innocent, have no Fourth Amendment protection
against body-cavity searches. As a consequence, strip searches and visual body-
cavity searches are quite common in both jails and prisons. Much less common are
searches inside a prisoner’s body cavity, such as probing his or her mouth, genital
areas, or a stomach using an x-ray device. These more intrusive searches require
reasonable suspicion that a crime or serious rule violation has occurred, and that
the examination is necessary. These examinations must also be conducted profes-
sionally and in a sanitary manner. Although not legally required, medical personnel
generally conduct such a search.
Both men and women serve as correctional officers, and equal employment laws
prohibit restricting their job assignments to same-sex prisons. Consequently, male
officers work in women’s units and women work in men’s units. Several prisoner
lawsuits have alleged that cross-sex supervision, which includes supervising
inmate living areas and conducting pat-down and strip searches, violates their
right to privacy. Some courts have supported a prisoner’s right to be protected
from unrestricted cross-sex supervision and have limited the situations under
which it can occur, including limiting when members of the opposite gender can
conduct searches or be assigned to certain housing areas. Other courts have sup-
ported correctional officials who argue a prisoner’s right to privacy takes a back
seat to institutional security and affording equal employment opportunities to cor-
rectional staff. Several courts have ruled that cross-gender searches of female
inmates raise different legal issues from cross-gender searches of male inmates. As
a result, there are a variety of different policies on cross-gender supervision in pris-
ons and jails across the United States.
Having HIV-positive prisoners has raised serious privacy issues for correc-
tional administrators. The U. S. Supreme Court has not addressed these issues,
but several lower federal courts have rendered decisions on specific questions.
One of the most important issues has been whether correctional officials can or
must require prisoners to be tested for HIV. Some prisoners have argued that
mandatory testing is necessary to ensure their health. Other prisoners have main-
tained that mandatory testing sounds constructive, but it violates the Fourth

392
Prisoners
\
Amendment and puts at risk a prisoner’s right to have his or her medical condi-
tion kept private. In the close and intense prison environment, there are few
secrets that even careful administrators can protect. Related to HIV testing is the
legality of segregating HIV-positive inmates from the rest of the inmate popula-
tion. Segregation not only reduces inmates’ opportunities to participate in prison
programs, but it also effectively advertises their medical condition to the prison
community. It also makes them vulnerable to assault by other inmates and harass-
ment by staff. In Harris v. Thigpen (1991), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the constitutionality of mandatory HIV testing of all prisoners admitted to
Alabama’s prisons as well as the policy segregating HIV-positive inmates. The
court concluded that neither mandatory testing nor segregation violate the cruel
and unusual punishment clause. The court refused to rule, however, that manda-
tory testing was required by the Constitution. Several other federal courts have
also ruled that agencies are free to institute mandatory testing programs but are
not required to do so. In addition, most courts have ruled that correctional agen-
cies may chose to segregate HIV-positive inmates or mainstream those who do
not pose a security risk to the general population. 
The law is less clear about if and under what circumstances authorities can
reveal a prisoner’s HIV-positive status when he or she has not been placed in segre-
gated housing. It has been settled that officials violate the Constitution’s Cruel and
Unusual Punishment Clause if they reveal a prisoner’s HIV-status to humiliate a
prisoner or put that prisoner at risk of attack. It is less certain if officials violate the
Constitution when they reveal a prisoner’s HIV-positive status in order to protect
other prisoners or staff. Although there are cases that recognize an inmate’s consti-
tutional right to privacy regarding medical conditions, many courts have ruled the
right is limited by polices that serve legitimate security and safety interests. 
It is obvious that prisoners’ privacy rights are extremely restricted under the
Constitution. Courts have struggled with defining the scope of those restricted
rights, but there is little disagreement that the scope is quite narrow. Unlike other
areas where prisoner lawsuits have been quite successful in reforming correctional
polices and practices—including freedom of religious expression, use of due pro-
cess in the disciplinary process, access to legal materials, and the right to adequate
health care—fundamental and overriding security needs generally trump privacy
concerns. Courts are reluctant to second-guess administrators in these matters, and
there is every indication this trend will continue.

Privacy, definition of
Privacy concerns exist in every society, erupting in daily life as problems of eti-
quette, ethics, religion, and law. Illuminated by recent scholarship, discussion, and
debate, privacy is no longer the opaque concept it once seemed. The boundaries of
privacy are readily discernible through close attention to its ordinary applications.
Privacy is as privacy does, and what it mainly does is describe and demand limits
on the appropriation of others’ peaceful seclusion, personal information, intimate
choices, and identities. 
An exact definition of privacy remains elusive. Lawyers have said that the gist of
privacy is the “right to be let alone.”  Philosophers have shown that privacy often
means “inaccessibility to others’ senses and surveillance devices.”  Privacy means
“control over personal information”  for policy makers designing data protection
and electronic communications practices. Outside of narrow academic circles, con-
structing an exact definition of privacy has proven less important than addressing
concrete claims for privacy protection. Seclusion, solitude, anonymity, confidenti-
ality, modesty, intimacy, secrecy, autonomy, and reserve—securing these social
goods is what privacy is all about. 
In contemporary American parlance, losses of what is called “privacy”  include
rude house guests overstaying their welcomes, and nosy employers reading
employees’ personal electronic mail. They include court decisions denying same-
sex couples the legal right to marry, and identity thieves stealing Social Security
numbers. Privacy takes on a straightforward aspect when we see that, despite the
problem of pinning down an overall philosophical definition, appeals to privacy
tend to fall into one or more of four recurring categories reflected in the previous
examples. We do well to distinguish physical privacy, informational privacy, deci-
sional privacy, and proprietary privacy. 
Overstaying house guests result in a loss of physical privacy. Solitude can be
vital to privacy in a physical or spatial sense. Although no guarantor of repose,
the home is the heart of private life, and a domain culturally marked for the
enjoyment of the highest expectations of physical privacy from strangers. The
desire for physical privacy often drives complaints about unlawful search and
seizure, peeping toms, trespass, and “ambush” journalism. Bodily integrity,
which comes up in discussions of everything from medical care and roadside
sobriety checkpoints to assault and battery, is an additional important physical
privacy concern.
Employers who read employees’ personal e-mail messages without a legitimate
business purpose offend morals and manners, violating expectations of informa-
tional privacy. Confidentiality, data protection, data encryption, data security,
secrecy, anonymity, and adherence to fair information practice standards comprise
the informational dimension of privacy.
Opposition to same-sex marriage illustrates a denial by government of decisional
privacy. Not without special controversy in jurisprudential circles, the term “privacy”
has come to denote freedom from government interference with personal life. Like it

or not, the rights of individuals, married couples, and families to direct their own
lives are commonly styled as privacy rights. Disagreements about the proper lim-
its of decisional privacy fuel heated moral debates over gay rights, abortion, and
physician-assisted suicide. 
Identity thieves accessing personal financial data illustrate a loss of proprietary
privacy. Government regulators and the general public characterize identity theft as
a privacy problem because it entails seizing otherwise confidential information and
personal identifiers. In a related vein, the rights of celebrities and others to control
the attributes of their personal identities—their names, voices, trademarks, traits,
and DNA—are commonly styled as privacy concerns. 
Despite the tenor of its beginnings, the goal of this entry is not conceptual map-
ping alone. Rather, the goal is to introduce privacy by addressing the ambivalent
posture in which the United States now finds itself respecting informational and
physical privacy values. A nation of extensive privacy laws, with a history and cul-
ture of privacy protection driven by a concern for civil liberties and human rights,
the Unites States is also a nation in which people can be surprisingly indifferent to
privacy and lax about privacy protection. 
The United States is notable for the quantity and quality of its positive consti-
tutional, tort, and statutory privacy law. First, the United States Supreme Court
has recognized that five of the original Bill of Rights amendments and the Four-
teenth Amendment protect privacy interests. Second, in U.S. tort law, interests
against intrusion upon seclusion; public disclosure of private fact; publications
placing another in a false light; and misappropriation of a person’s name, like-
ness, or identity are potentially protected through civil actions styled as invasions
of privacy. Third, more recent than common law and provisions of the U.S. Con-
stitution, federal and state statutes protect interests in privacy. Access to health
records, educational records, financial transactions, electronic communications,
and children’s Internet use are all regulated by statute. Tax, video rental, library,
adoption, and many other types of records about individuals are private as a
result of state and federal informational privacy statutes. 
Much of the privacy law of the United States is designed to promote informa-
tional privacy, suggesting a nation with uniquely strong informational privacy com-
mitments. Yet the United States is currently notable as a polity inclined toward
sacrificing informational privacy as needed to meet short-term policy objectives
and toward voluntary self-disclosure to meet consumer and lifestyle objectives.
Assuming these empirical observations about the practices of privacy protection
are correct, how then do we make sense of the value gap between what the people
of the United States have written into their positive privacy laws and how they live
out their daily lives? When it comes to personal information, is the United States a
privacy-loving or a privacy-indifferent society?
Although this question is posed about a single country, the implications of the
inquiry are not parochial. People in other parts of the world, including Canada,
Great Britain, Europe, and Australia, plainly value informational privacy. Informa-
tional privacy is valued in Africa, Asia, and South America, too. What counts as a
privacy intrusion and why privacy is important varies considerably from place to
place. As customs, traditions, religions, and resources vary, so, too, will attitudes
about privacy. An American woman may demand health information privacy for

Privacy, definition of
\
395
the sake of her autonomy. An Iranian, Pakistani, or Kenyan woman may demand
medical privacy for the sake of her modesty, religious obligation, or reputation. 
Not only is privacy held as a value around the world, but there are privacy laws
on the books in countries around the world. Few countries rival the U.S. in the
quantity of privacy laws enacted for the sake of shielding personal data from non-
consensual public disclosure. But quality is telling, too. European Union countries
and Canada arguably surpass the U.S. in the vigorous enforcement of informational
privacy rights governing financial or other personal data. In Canada, professional
public privacy commissioners tend to privacy law enforcement. A “Directive of the
European Parliament and the Council of Europe on the Protection of Individuals
with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such
Data” (see European Data Protection Directive) went into effect in October
1998. It called for European Union member states to enact policies that protect the
right to privacy in the processing of personal data. Laws currently in place in mem-
ber states forbid certain types of data collection and demand that information gath-
ered in commerce be limited to authorized users and uses. In much of Western
Europe, individuals have more control over whether financial, race, religion, eth-
nicity data can be shared.
In any country there can be gaps between positive privacy protections on the one
hand, and political and cultural practices on the other, and for a variety of reasons.
Concerns about national security played a major role in the relaxation of civil liber-
ties in the United States after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on
September 11, 2001. Terrorism, genocide, civil war, and HIV/AIDS have led con-
temporary governments around the world to more intrusively monitor personal
conduct. 
To the extent that popular culture, technology, and changes in gender roles
are driving down the taste and market for privacy, one could expect to see
changes in the value placed on various dimensions of privacy in countries other
than the United States. The willingness to have personal conversations on cellular
telephones in public places is not just a U.S. phenomenon, nor is it only American
women who are delivering sexual services and babies live on the World Wide Web.
Why care if privacy is poorly protected or too readily given up? Why does pri-
vacy matter? Some of the traditional answers to this question are that privacy pro-
motes values of personhood, intimate relationships, autonomy, tolerance, and
limited government. Privacy creates and enhances a sense of individual person-
hood. Opportunities for privacy allow people to express themselves, relax, reflect,
and thereby develop as individuals. Privacy allows for the independent develop-
ment and exercise of moral judgment. Opportunities for privacy enable people to
keep some persons at a distance, so that they can enjoy intense intimate relation-
ships with others, including friends, families, and spouses. Privacy allows the indi-
vidual or groups of like-minded individuals the ability to plan and live out their
own lives. Privacy makes it possible for people to determine their own destinies.
Privacy rights against government ensure that government will remain limited and
unobtrusive, as liberal democracy requires. Privacy rights ensure that those who
disagree with us will not be permitted to impose their personal values and prefer-
ences on us, or force us to live as they live. Decisional privacy that sets individuals
free to make their way—and their own mistakes—is good for society, too. As John

Stuart Mill argued in On Liberty, toleration promotes the full-flowering of individ-
ual artistic, spiritual, and commercial genius. Mill’s principle of liberty rejected
accountability to the state for “self-regarding”  conduct. Persons are not answerable
to the community for conduct that is truly self-regarding, that is, not significantly
harmful or injurious to others. 
1. Bountiful Constitutional Privacy Law
Privacy has value. By virtue of the federal Constitution, Americans have enjoyed
protection of privacy since the founding of the nation in the late eighteenth century.
The word “privacy”  does not appear in the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court
has interpreted five of the ten original Bill of Rights guarantees and the Fourteenth
Amendment as protective of privacy. Furthering family and group privacy, the First
Amendment guarantees freedom of religion and freedom of association. The Third
Amendment prohibits military appropriation of private homes.
Also protective of the home and its contents, the Fourth Amendment prohibits
arbitrary search and seizure of persons and property. In the 1960s, the Supreme
Court gave the term “privacy”  a central role in the interpretation of the Fourth
Amendment. Whether at home, in bed, or in a phone booth, citizens have a right to
a “reasonable expectation of privacy,”  as determined by the Court in an impor-
tant group of cases concerning government search and seizure, the first of which
was Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967).
The Fifth Amendment prohibits compulsory self-incrimination, allowing for
privacy of thought and belief. The Ninth Amendment reserved unenumerated tradi-
tional rights to the people, including rights of bodily integrity, possession, and
independent decisionmaking associated with privacy. 
The federal Constitution was amended after the Civil War to reflect the abolition
of slavery. The new amendments included the Fourteenth Amendment, which
asserted that no state may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due
process of law. Designed to protect the rights of freed slaves, the general language
of the Fourteenth Amendment is now an important source of protection for sub-
stantive liberties sought by private individuals and families. In their written opin-
ions interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights, justices of the
Supreme Court have frequently invoked the concept of privacy as a substantive due
process value. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Supreme Court also gave the term “privacy”  an impor-
tant role in cases about the regulation of reproduction, sex, marriage, and personal
information. In Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), the Court held that
there is a fundamental right to privacy that prohibits laws criminalizing birth control.
In the Griswold decision, the Court argued that privacy has always been an implicit
constitutional value, residing in the “penumbra”  of the Bill of Rights. In Loving v.
Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), the Court recognized privacy and equality interests in
interracial marriage, and in Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969), it recognized
privacy interests in personal use of pornography at home. Increasingly after Roe v.
Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), in which the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment
was a source of a fundamental right to privacy strong enough to block the categorical
prohibition of abortion, the Fourteenth Amendment has become the major legal tool
for persons asserting controversial privacy rights against government. Whalen v. Roe,

Privacy, definition of
\
397
429 U.S. 589 (1977), recognized a Fourteenth Amendment privacy interest requiring
confidentiality and security to protect prescription drug use data collected by the state. 
Constitutional privacy jurisprudence has been successfully applied in some
landmark “right to die”  cases, most notably in a New Jersey state supreme court
case, In Re Quinlan, 355 A.2d 647 (1976), although not consistently in other deci-
sions. The Supreme Court held in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health,
497 U.S. 261 (1990), that states may require families, prior to terminating life sup-
port, to demonstrate by “clear and convincing evidence”  that a family member in a
hopeless vegetative state would have wanted to die under those circumstances. In
2006, the Supreme Court upheld an Oregon statute permitting physician-assisted
suicide, but declined in Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793 (1997), and Washington v.
Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997), to recognize a right to physician-assisted suicide
that would invalidate all state laws making it a crime for doctors to end the lives of
terminally ill patients. In the question of the right of people to engage in consenting
homosexual relations, the Court held in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003),
that the Constitution does not to permit states to criminalize adult homosexual sod-
omy. On the other hand, lower courts have repeatedly held that states may criminal-
ize prostitution, rape, and domestic violence consistent with the constitutional right
to privacy. 
The Court’s substantive due process jurisprudence fell on to hard times in the
1980s and 1990s, but an influential body of Supreme Court privacy precedent
remains. Like the federal Constitution, many U.S. state constitutions include
implicit privacy protections by virtue of provisions modeled after the federal Bill of
Rights. In the period after 1970, many states, including Alabama, California, and
Florida, amended their state constitutions to include explicit provisions guarantee-
ing privacy rights. In some instances state courts have held that state constitutions
offer stronger protections against intrusion, interference with decisionmaking, and
surveillance than those afforded by the federal constitution.
II. The Common Law Contribution
Constitutional law is only one aspect of America’s legal devotion to privacy. Com-
mon law doctrines inherited from English common law protected aspects of personal
privacy at our nation’s inception. For example, the trespass tort deterred physical pri-
vacy invasions. Judge Thomas Cooley’s A Treatise on the Law of Torts (1880) iden-
tified a right of personal immunity, a right to be let alone from which the privacy tort
descended. Some noteworthy early cases recognized that women have a legitimate
sphere of immunity in areas surrounding their modesty. In DeMay v. Roberts, 46
Mich.160, 9 N.W. 146 (1881), a Michigan judge declared a right to the privacy of
childbirth. In Manola v. Stevens (1890), a New York judge granted an actress an
injunction against publication of a photograph of herself in tights. 
In Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis’s famous 1890 article, “The Right to Pri-
vacy,”  these two Boston lawyers called for the creation of a new legal right to pri-
vacy, a right of “inviolate personality.”  Inspired by the article, a privacy tort was
first recognized by American judges in the early twentieth century.
In Pavesich v. New England Life Ins. Co., 50 S.E. 68 (1905), the tort law privacy
right was fully born. No state’s supreme court officially recognized the right to pri-
vacy until 1905 when the Georgia high court in Pavesich allowed a man whose

398
Privacy, definition of
\
photograph was used without his consent in an insurance advertisement to assert a
right of privacy. In Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co. (1902), the New York
court declined to create a right to privacy as a remedy for a woman whose photo-
graph was used without her consent in an advertisement. However, the New York
Civil Rights Act, Sections 50–51, was quickly enacted in 1903 and created a right
against commercial appropriation of name or likeness in response to the Roberson
case. The statute has remained on the books.
Today the common law of privacy recognizes four basic physical, informa-
tional, and proprietary privacy rights (but no decisional privacy right as such),
first distinguished by William L. Prosser. Recognized by the American Law
Institute’s Restatement of Torts (2d) (1964), the four privacy rights are rights
against (1) intrusion upon seclusion, (2) publication of embarrassing private
facts, (3) publicity placing a person in a false light, and (4) appropriation of name
likeness and identity.
A distinctive feature of the common law privacy torts is that, subject to excep-
tions for newsworthy publications and First Amendment freedoms, they permit
lawsuits against persons who intentionally and in a highly offensive manner pub-
lish or disclose intimate truth. The right to privacy aims to protect persons whose
feelings and sensibilities are wounded by having others discover truthful but
embarrassing or intimate matters of fact as a consequence of highly offensive con-
duct. The Restatement presentation of the four torts has been adopted by statute or
precedent in a number of states.
III. A Statutory Privacy Movement
The salience of tort and constitutional privacy law in daily life is eclipsed by the
prominence of federal and state privacy statutes. In the 1960s the Cold War, the Viet-
nam conflict, and racial turmoil heightened concern about the government’s tech-
niques of espionage, surveillance, and social control. The surveillance technologies
used for spying could also be used to monitor ordinary citizens and suspected crim-
inals. The government’s ability to discern the details of private lives through covert
wiretapping, powerful lenses, microphones, and cameras made citizens concerned
about the fate of freedom and democracy. Congress enacted the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Street Act in 1967, permitting, but setting limits on, wiretapping
and certain other forms of surveillance. 
Concerns about data banks containing personal profiles emerged in the 1970s.
The potential for unfair use of personal information and misinformation stored in
commercial and government data banks led to the enactment of several federal
laws, including the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Pri-
vacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, and the Right to Financial Privacy Act 1978. A
national commission formed by federal lawmakers, the U.S. Privacy Protection
Commission, published its two-volume report, Personal Privacy in an Information
Society, in 1977. 
The report recommended a list of fair information practices governing the col-
lection, storage, and use of personal information about individuals. Under various
models of fair information practices, standards such as these should be met to the
extent possible: (1) the existence of data systems containing personal information
should not be a secret; (2) personal information should only be collected for narrow,

Privacy, definition of
\
399
specific purposes; (3) personal information should only be used in a ways that are
similar to and consistent with the primary purposes for its collection; (4) per-
sonal information should be collected only with the informed consent of the
persons about whom the information is collected or their legal representatives;
(5) personal information should not be shared with third parties without notice or
consent; (7) for the sake of accuracy and relevancy, the duration of storage of per-
sonal information should be limited; (8) individuals should have access to personal
information about themselves and should be permitted to correct errors; and (9)
those who collect personal data should ensure the security and integrity of personal
data and systems.
Originating before widespread computer use, ideals of fair information prac-
tices are thriving today. Of course, lawmakers are at liberty to pick and choose
which, if any, fair information practice standards they will incorporate into statutes.
Existing state statutes protect the privacy of many types of communications,
including telephone communications that could be recorded or intercepted by
police or private investigators. Statutes enacted by lawmakers in individual states
protect the privacy of information contained in many types of business and profes-
sional records. Access to adoption records, criminal histories, and library records
is commonly regulated under state law. The private sector has begun to adopt fair
information practices in business practices. In the 1990s, private firms engaged in
the electronic commerce industry established TRUSTe and similar privacy seal
organizations to certify that companies operating over the World Wide Web
pledged to adhere to fair information practice standards, such as providing privacy
notices informing site users of privacy policies and practices.
The federal government began to enact national laws in the 1970s in response to
developments in computer, surveillance, and other technologies. Some statutes
were simply a response to heightened awareness of privacy interests unrelated to
technology, such as awareness of privacy interests in traditional school records.
Primarily as a result of the Internet and further developments in communications
technologies, recent decades have witnessed further growth in the number and vari-
ety of state and federal statutes, short of a European Union–style privacy law, pro-
tecting informational privacy and embodying fair information practices standards.
On May 22, 2000, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released its third report on
the state of online privacy protection, “Privacy Online: Fair Information Practices
in the Electronic Marketplace.”  The report called for legislation, perhaps similar to
European Union laws, to protect consumers’ online privacy. 
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) went into
effect in 2000. It prohibits commercial websites from gathering personal infor-
mation from children under 13 without parental consent. However, no U.S. stat-
ute comprehensively regulates Internet privacy. In the absence of such
legislation, the FTC, which regulates certain online business practices, has
become a significant enforcer of existing privacy-related trade practices and stat-
utes. The U.S. telemarketing industry balked at the FTC’s establishment of a
highly popular national Do-Not-Call registry that limits commercial vendors
from calling the homes and cell phone numbers of people who register with the
government, arguing that government should not coerce privacy through com-
mercial speech restrictions.

Privacy, definition of
\
The United States government holds a vast quantity of personal information
gathered in the course of census taking, tax collection, military management, law
enforcement, intelligence gathering, and the administration of health, labor, and
human services programs. The Privacy Act of 1974 was enacted in direct response
to the increased use by government of computers to collect, store, and analyze per-
sonal information. Although the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) opens gov-
ernment records to the public, FOIA works in tandem with the Privacy Act and
exempts from disclosure medical, personnel, and similar files. Many agency regu-
lations and statutes (the tax code, for example) limit access to personal information
held by the federal government. 
Off-line and online, personal information is also gathered and stored by the pri-
vate sector. Privacy law includes comprehensive statutes enacted by Congress,
mainly after 1974, governing, for example, the privacy and confidentiality of bank-
ing and financial records, school records, video rentals, and telephone calls. This
legislation limits access to records and communications, but also regulates the
basis for lawful government and other third-party accesses. The most important
statute regulating communications is the Electronic Communication Privacy Act
of 1986 (ECPA), formerly known as Title III. It requires judicial approval for secret
access to telephone calls, e-mail, and voice mail. 
Additional major privacy legislation includes Title V of the Financial Services
Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), and provisions of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) that regulate
access to health information held by physicians, hospitals, insurers, and researchers.
IV. A Culture of Accountability
Privacy law is plentiful, flourishing, and even expanding. A competing trend,
accountability for private life, has become a salient feature of contemporary
American culture. The accountability the public demanded of President Bill
Clinton (see Clinton-Lewinsky scandal) and the civil rights leader Reverend
Jesse Jackson for the details of their extramarital affairs are just two examples. 
Some observers attribute the new accountability for sex to feminism’s rallying
cry that the “personal is political.”  Many feminists indeed reject classic liberal
conceptions of accountability. Feminists are among those who are skeptical about
the existence of realms of action and conduct without significant, relevant impact
on others. Purely self-regarding conduct is, indeed, something of a myth. People’s
lives are importantly interconnected and interdependent. If someone uses cocaine,
neglects his or her children, gambles, has unprotected sex, or drives a gas-guzzling
automobile, that person’s seemingly personal choices affect others. Some feminists
entirely reject liberalism, but even feminists who are liberal feminists disagree
sometimes with other liberals about when conduct is hurtful to others, by locating
meaningful externalities where classical liberals find none. From their perspective,
lives are importantly interconnected and interdependent.
Much accountability to the state and private sectors for personal life has been
the historic rule. Accountability for personal matters is older than feminism, cell
phones, and reality television. The organization of American society has always fea-
tured diverse requirements that individuals report, explain, justify, face sanctions for,

Privacy, definition of
\
401
and routinize their private lives. The breadth of accountability for personal life that
emerged in the United States in the late twentieth century is nonetheless remarkable 
The new accountability reflects an overdue public response to the social conse-
quences of harmful conduct in nominally private spheres of sex, family, and health.
After 1980, concerns about rampant domestic violence, sexual violence and
crimes, and gender inequality intensified accountability demands. Over the ensuing
decades, changes in American legal doctrines, law enforcement policies, and the
judiciary met some of the pleas for fair intervention and sanctions made by femi-
nists and others. In the wake of the AIDS epidemic, new levels of accountability
between sexual partners gained public acceptance. At the same time that a public
health crisis was intensifying, the media was signaling in response to government
and celebrity sex scandals that the public could demand accountability for sex. A
president accused of sexual harassment and adultery would not be sheltered from
exposure. Leaders are accountable for their judgment and character; and the public
is entitled to trust its government.
Adding to the mix, a popular culture of self-disclosure emerged. Accountability
for private life is often voluntary. Individuals from all walks of life now believe that
speaking openly about intimacies is socially permissible and advantageous, if not
an outright imperative of responsible family ties, friendship, and citizenship.
V. A Sacrifice of Civil Liberties
Jurists and scholars who assert that privacy is important uniformly agree that
privacy rights are not absolute. No one can have or expect to have all of the privacy
he or she may want, even in a free, liberal society based on market principles.
Sometimes protecting privacy is simply impractical. It is common for courts to
“balance” privacy interests against interests in, inter alia, law enforcement, public
health and safety, national security, business, efficiency, and the public’s right to
know. Courts have held that even where privacy interests are fundamental, they can
be overcome by compelling state interests. And courts do not regard some contro-
versial types of privacy-infringing surveillance, such as placing cameras on public
street corners to deter crime, as invasions of privacy at all. 
Since the events of September 11, 2001, the concept of “homeland security”  has
come to play a role in public life. The mandate of homeland security requires step-
ping up practices of search and surveillance in the name of national defense, mili-
tary necessity, criminal law enforcement, and public health and safety. Sometimes
privacy concerns are set aside in the context of homeland security simply because
invading privacy is the more efficient or pragmatic way to get or seek information.
In 2006, the administration of President George Bush admitted to secret communi-
cations monitoring of American citizens, justified by the importance of swift action
to deter potential terrorists. President Bush claimed constitutional powers and Con-
gressional authorization. Opponents labeled the program illegal domestic spying in
the name of what was supposed to be a war on terrorism. Opponents pointed out
that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) established a court
and a process that afford government authorities an expeditious means to obtain
judicial approval for sensitive covert communications surveillance. Moreover, the
Fourth Amendment and the federal wiretapping laws enacted as the Electronic

402
Privacy, definition of
\
Communications Privacy Act (formerly Title III) prohibit and punish domestic spy-
ing without a warrant or court order. 
VI. The Privacy Give Away
As some civil libertarians claim, privacy is being taken away. But clearly physi-
cal and informational privacy is being given away all the time. In 1999 a nurse
chose to broadcast her double mastectomy live over the Internet, in order to edu-
cate the public about breast cancer. In 1998 a married woman chose to share the
delivery of her third child with other expectant parents by delivering her baby live
over the Internet. Men and women have chosen to train cameras on the interiors of
their dwellings and then sell or give away real-time images of their daily lives.
While their cameras and computers broadcast images of themselves to others, they
have no physical privacy to speak of, and others possess otherwise private informa-
tion about their home life. The adult entertainment industry reflects the willingness
of performers and sex workers to sell access to bodily intimacies. The law barely
and inconsistently seeks to enforce public decency standards geared toward com-
pelling privacies in this area. 
Consumers willingly give away personal data, hoping to reap benefits of dis-
counts for travel and merchandise. They also do it simply for the sake of conve-
nience, for example, to make a credit card purchase on line. Knowing the risk of
identity fraud, consumers and vendors take precautions to protect personal
information transmitted on line. Nonetheless, consumers are remarkably free
when it comes to sharing personal data. Even though financial services compa-
nies expressly offer the option to opt out of personal data information sharing
with the organization’s business partners, most consumers do not bother. When
retail clerks ask shoppers for their phone numbers and zip codes when they make
off-line purchases, many consumers readily comply out of a felt need to be coop-
erative, even though such disclosures are merely routinely requested not
required. 
VII. Reconciling the Contradictions
On the one hand, the United States is awash in informational privacy laws. On
the other hand, American culture is characterized by expectations of accountability
for personal life and people’s dispositions to willingly give up personal informa-
tion, even when doing so is avoidable, risky, and undignified. What explains this
apparent contradiction? 
The gap between strong positive legal norms protective of privacy and the cul-
tural surrender of privacy to government, business, and the general public makes
sense if it is assumed that the underlying aim of privacy law is to protect privacy to
the extent that people want it protected. So positioned, the United States, then, is
less in the business of imposing privacy than of seeing to it that people have the pri-
vacy they want. 
Imposed, coerced informational and related physical privacies are far from rare
in the United States, however. Exotic dancers may be required to wear G-strings
and pasties against their will, and people are not allowed to live in glass houses.
Lawyers are required to keep client information confidential and so are physicians.

Privacy, definition of
\
403
Yet coerced professional confidences are not inalienable rights, and they can be
overridden by a decision to disclose made by a competent client or patient.
Privacy laws creating inalienable information privacy rights are few and far
between. One example, however, are informational privacy rules imposed on chil-
dren. Young children, fit beneficiaries of government paternalism and parental pro-
tection, cannot themselves waive the privacy protections of the federal Children’s
On-line Privacy Protection Act or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
The message of U.S. privacy laws is that privacy rights are extremely important
because they protect individual, relational, and political goods people generally
value. But why not have privacy laws that protect important individual, relational,
and political goods that people do not happen generally to value, but perhaps
should? This is a normative question of some importance. Is it a good thing that
U.S. privacy law, and the privacy law of other Western nations, is at bottom more
privacy neutral than not? It is privacy neutral in the sense that the law does not, in
the final analysis, insist upon privacy for adults. The underlying goal of privacy law
is evidently to foster the ideal of freedom of choice, and to thereby fight subordina-
tion, moralism, or paternalism. 
Focusing on the privacy-neutral stance of U.S. privacy law makes it easier to
comprehend the willingness to weaken privacy law as needed in the name of
national security, public safety, and public health. The national and popular com-
mitment is to choice, not to privacy itself. When faced with a policy priority of any
magnitude, violating expectations of privacy can easily be read as merely removing
an opportunity for one specific choice in a nation otherwise rich with choices.

Privacy, philosophical foundations of
There is wide agreement that most Americans take privacy seriously, value it
highly, and worry about its erosion. Unfortunately there is little agreement as to
what privacy is, what it does protect, and what it should protect. The term “pri-
vacy”  is used frequently in everyday language as well as in philosophical, politi-
cal, and legal discussions, yet there is no single definition or analysis or meaning of
the term. There has been extensive discussion of privacy in the philosophical litera-
ture. While this discussion does not provide definite answers, the ideas set forth in
this entry provide alternative philosophical definitions or defenses of privacy, and
can help illuminate various understandings of what the concept of privacy is, what
it means, and why it has value. [Portions of this paper are drawn from discussions
in my book In Pursuit of Privacy: Law, Ethics, and the Rise of Technology (Cornell
University Press, 1997) and my paper, “Privacy,”  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philos-
ophy (2002).]
I. Historical Roots of Privacy
The concept of privacy has broad historical roots in anthropological and sociolog-
ical discussions about how extensively it is valued and preserved in various cultures
and societies. For example, Margaret Mead and other anthropologists have shown the
ways different cultures protect privacy through concealment, seclusion, or restricting
access to secret ceremonies. Alan Westin has also surveyed studies of animals dem-
onstrating that a desire for privacy is universal and not restricted to humans. 
Discussions of privacy by Mead and Westin give rise to the question of whether
or not privacy as a concept is relative. Ferdinand Schoeman has pointed out that the
question of whether or not privacy is culturally relative can be interpreted in two
ways. One question is whether privacy is deemed valuable to all peoples, or
whether its value is relative to cultural differences. A second question is whether or
not there are any aspects of life that are inherently private and not just convention-
ally so. In response to the first question, most writers have come to agree that while
almost all cultures appear to value privacy, cultures vary in their ways of seeking
and obtaining privacy, and probably do differ in the extent to which they value pri-
vacy. There has been far less agreement on the second question. Some have argued
that matters relating to one’s innermost self are inherently private. Philosopher Jef-
frey Reiman states, “I can sum up that value [of privacy] as: the protection of free-
dom, moral personality, and a rich and critical inner life.”  Yet characterizing
privacy and its value more succinctly and less vaguely has remained an elusive
task. Thus it may well be that one of the difficulties in defining or characterizing
the realm of the private is that privacy is a notion that is strongly culturally relative,
contingent on such factors as family structure and economics as well as on the
technology available in a given cultural domain.
Beyond anthropological and sociological references, the concept of privacy also
has historical origins in well-known philosophical discussions. Perhaps the best
historical examples of allusions to privacy in philosophical texts date as far back as
writings by Aristotle. As Jean Bethke Elshtain has argued, a wide array of thinkers
“of the Western political tradition assumed and deployed some form of a distinc-
tion between the public and the private as conceptual categories and as private and
public imperatives, to conceal as well as reveal. As conceptual categories, public

and private ordered and structured diverse activities, purposes, and dimensions of
human social life and thinking about that life.”  For Aristotle, the public/private
dichotomy was interpreted to differentiate political and domestic spheres of life.
Sometimes the split between public and private has reflected a differentiation
between property held in the public domain and property held by individuals. Also
the public/private distinction has at times been understood to reflect differences
between the appropriate scope of governmental regulation as opposed to self-regu-
lation by individuals. While explained in different ways, each of these views
describes some type of public/private dichotomy.
Aristotle differentiated two distinct spheres of life. He saw the polis as the seat
of government and the province of political activity, a public sphere where the pro-
ceedings of government in a city-state were developed. This public political arena
was one where men, but not women or slaves, could participate in the functions of
government. Aristotle describes man as a political animal who joins with others to
participate in the polis. In contrast, separate from this public sphere was the oikos,
the private or domestic sphere of the family, the private home or household where
women and children lived and functioned, although men were the masters of their
households in the oikos.
John Locke provided a second example of an allusion to privacy when he distin-
guished public and private property in his Second Treatise on Government (1690).
According to Locke, in the state of nature all property is held in common by all, and
no person has exclusive rights to the earth and all the bounty produced by nature.
However, each person has a right to his own person and a right to self-preservation.
Moreover, each individual has a right to extend his property rights through labor.
Thus what one mixes one’s labor with becomes one’s own private property and is dis-
tinct from that owned publicly in common by all. There are other contexts in which
there is a separation between public and private realms in Locke’s Second Treatise,
although the relationship between the two spheres there is more complex. For exam-
ple, those who voluntarily and mutually consent to form a political society and gov-
ernment thereby use public means to assure protection of their private ends, namely
the protection of life, liberty, and property in the broadest sense. 
A third historical example of a distinction between public and private in philosoph-
ical literature is evident in John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty, where Mill distinguished the
appropriate realm of governmental authority as opposed to the realm reserved for self-
regulation. Mill states and defends his famous harm principle, that the only reason
government or society is justified in infringing on individual liberty is to prevent harm
to others. In doing so, he focuses on that realm of activity where one’s behavior affects
others, and where government may intervene to prevent harm, namely a sphere of
action that is open to public scrutiny. This realm is distinguished from the sphere of
actions that affect oneself only, or if they affect others, only with their free, voluntary,
and undeceived consent. This latter sphere of activity, self-regarding actions, is the
arena where governmental or social interference is unjustified, and thus this sphere of
action is not legitimately open to public concern and is in this sense private. Mill is
well aware that there are serious difficulties in determining how to distinguish those
actions that he would call self-regarding from other-regarding actions. Nevertheless,
his harm principle presupposes that there are two distinct realms, one where the gov-
ernment can legitimately interfere, and one where it can not.

\
These examples demonstrate that what is viewed as private in these different
contexts varies: privacy can refer to forbidden views or knowledge, restricted
access, a domestic sphere separate from government, property that one may call
one’s own that does not belong to others, and a domain inappropriate for govern-
mental interference, to list just a few. In each case, however, the underlying
assumption is that there is a boundary marking off that which is public from that
which is private. 
II. Categorizing the Philosophical Literature on Privacy
Early treatises on privacy appeared with the development of privacy protection
in the law from the 1890s onward. The legal discussion of privacy began with the
famous Harvard Law Review essay by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, titled
“The Right to Privacy,”  and their justification and recognition of a new privacy
right in tort law that was made largely on various moral grounds. The philosophical
debate concerning definitions of privacy intensified and became more prominent in
the second half of the twentieth century. This literature helps us distinguish
descriptive accounts of privacy, detailing what is in fact protected as private, from
normative accounts of privacy, defending its value, and both why and the extent to
which privacy should be protected. In these discussions, some treat privacy as an
interest with moral value, something that is a good thing to have, while others refer
to it as a right, moral or legal, that ought to be protected by society or by law or by
both. Clearly one can be insensitive to another’s privacy interests without violating
any right to privacy, if there is one.
One way of understanding the growing philosophical literature on privacy is to
view it as divided into two main categories, which can be called “reductionism”
and “coherentism.”  Reductionists are generally critical of privacy, while coherent-
ists defend the coherent and fundamental value of privacy interests. Ferdinand
Schoeman introduced somewhat different terminology, which makes it easier to
understand this distinction. According to Schoeman (1984), a number of authors
have believed that 
there is something fundamental, integrated, and distinctive about the concerns tradition-
ally grouped together under the rubric of “privacy issues.”  In opposing this position,
some have argued that the cases labeled “privacy issues”  are diverse and disparate, and
hence are only nominally or superficially connected. Others have argued that when pri-
vacy claims are to be defended morally, the justifications must allude to principles
which can be characterized quite independently of any concern with privacy. Conse-
quently, the argument continues, there is nothing morally distinctive about privacy. . . . I
shall refer to the position that there is something common to most of the privacy claims
as the “coherence thesis.”  The position that privacy claims are to be defended morally
by principles that are distinctive to privacy I shall label the “distinctiveness thesis.” 
Theorists who deny both the coherence thesis and the distinctiveness thesis argue that in
each category of privacy claims there are diverse values at stake of the sort common to
many other social issues and that these values exhaust privacy claims. The thrust of this
complex position is that we could do quite well if we eliminated all talk of privacy and
simply defended our concerns in terms of standard moral and legal categories.

Privacy, philosophical foundations of
\
407
These latter theorists may be referred to as reductionists, for they view what are
called privacy concerns as analyzable or reducible to claims of other sorts, such as
infliction of emotional distress or property interests. They deny that there is any-
thing coherent or distinctive about privacy, and they deny that there is anything use-
ful in considering privacy as a separate concept. They conclude, then, that there is
nothing fundamental or special or illuminating about privacy interests.
Probably the most famous reductionist view of privacy was presented by Judith
Jarvis Thomson in 1975. According to her well-known argument, there is no right
to privacy, or at least there is nothing special about privacy, because any interest
protected as private can be equally well explained and protected by other interests
or rights, most notably rights to property and bodily security. First noting that there
is little agreement on what privacy is, Thomson then examines a number of cases
that have been thought to be violations of the right to privacy. Thomson argues that,
on closer inspection, all those cases can be adequately explained in terms of viola-
tions of property rights or rights over the person, such as a right not to be listened
to or a right not to be touched. Ultimately the right to privacy, in Thomson’s view,
is merely a cluster of rights, and those rights in the cluster are always overlapped
by, and can be fully explained by, other property rights or rights to bodily security.
The right to privacy, in her view, is “derivative”  in the sense that there is no need to
find what is common in the cluster of privacy rights. Privacy is derivative in its
importance and justification, according to Thomson, since any privacy violation is
better understood as the violation of a more basic right. 
Numerous commentators such as Thomas Scanlon have argued strongly against
Thomson’s critique of privacy. Scanlon has persuasively countered that it is surely
as plausible that just the reverse of Thomson’s view is true, and that rights such as
those of ownership or even liberty are “derivative”  from privacy rights. Scanlon
apparently finds this ordering likely since he believes there is something unique
and of special value to privacy.
Many other theorists have agreed with Scanlon (i.e., Inness, Rachels) in rejecting
reductionism’s claim that privacy is reducible to other values, and have argued that pri-
vacy is a coherent concept. In this view, there is something fundamental and distinctive
about the various claims that have been called privacy interests. Ruth Gavison, for
example, claims that most individuals believe privacy is a useful concept, and accord-
ing to Gavison, privacy has value as a coherent and illuminating concept. Those who
endorse such a view may be called coherentists. Nevertheless, it is important to recog-
nize that coherentists have quite diverse although sometimes overlapping views on
what it is that is distinctive about privacy and what links diverse privacy claims.
III. Coherentists on the Meaning and Value of Privacy
Although most theorists have taken the coherentist view that privacy is a mean-
ingful and valuable concept, their characterizations and defenses of privacy differ.
Narrow views of privacy focusing on control over information about oneself that
were defended by Warren and Brandeis in their 1890 law review article and by
other legal theorists such as William Prosser have also been endorsed by more
recent commentators, including Charles Fried and William Parent. Westin also

408
Privacy, philosophical foundations of
\
describes privacy as the ability to determine for ourselves when, how, and to what
extent information about us is communicated to others. 
Perhaps the best example of a contemporary defense of this view of privacy as
control over information about oneself is put forth by Parent in two related papers.
Parent urges that he proposes to defend a view of privacy that is consistent with
ordinary language and does not overlap with or confuse the basic meanings of
other fundamental terms. He defines privacy as the condition of not having undoc-
umented personal information known or possessed by others. Parent stresses that
he is defining the “condition”  of privacy as a moral value for people who prize
individuality and freedom, and not as a moral or legal right to privacy. Personal
information is characterized by Parent as factual (otherwise it would be covered by
libel, slander, or defamation), and these are facts that most persons choose not to
reveal about themselves, such as facts about health, salary, weight, or sexual orien-
tation. Personal information is documented, in Parent’s view, only when it belongs
to the public record, that is, in newspapers, court records, or other public docu-
ments. Thus, once information becomes part of a public record, there is no privacy
invasion in future releases of the information, even years later or to a wide audi-
ence, nor does snooping or surveillance intrude on privacy if no undocumented
information is gained. In cases where no new information is acquired, Parent views
the intrusion as irrelevant to privacy, and better understood as an abridgement of
anonymity, trespass, or harassment. In sum, there is a loss of privacy, in Parent’s
view, only when others acquire undocumented personal information about an
individual. 
Parent’s account of privacy has the valuable feature of defending privacy as a
coherent concept, and he also takes the view that there is something unique, funda-
mental, and of special value in privacy. But his characterization of privacy has
some troubling consequences. First, once information becomes part of a public
record, then the individual concerned has no recourse if there is any further publi-
cation of the information because it is not a privacy violation, even if it occurs far
in the future and involves a much wider distribution. That seems counterintuitive,
especially if the original disclosure is made in error or is accomplished through
moral wrongdoing. Second, even insidious snooping will not count as a privacy
invasion on Parent’s account if all the information gathered is already a part of the
public record. And unjustified spying will not give rise to a privacy intrusion if no
new undocumented knowledge is acquired. Methods of acquiring information are
not always determinative of a privacy invasion, but the mode of acquisition cannot
be said to be irrelevant, as is apparently the case on Parent’s view. Insidious snoop-
ing and unjustified spying seem to give rise to reasonable claims of a privacy inva-
sion even if no new knowledge is gathered or if whatever is learned is already part
of a public record. Third, Parent’s emphasis on what is as a matter of fact a part of
the public record, seems to ignore or blur the important distinction between a
descriptive sense of privacy and a normative concept of privacy encompassing what
is worthy of protection. 
Edward J. Bloustein, in an article written partly as a defense of the Warren and
Brandeis law review essay on privacy, also argued that there is a common thread in
the legal cases protecting diverse privacy issues. Despite appearing in a law review,
the article gives a philosophical defense of privacy that is perhaps best seen as

Privacy, philosophical foundations of
\
409
being very Kantian. According to Bloustein, Warren and Brandeis failed to give a
positive description of privacy; however, they were correct that there was a single
value connecting the privacy interests, a value they called “inviolate personality.”
In Bloustein’s view it is possible to give a general theory of individual privacy that
unifies and reconciles its divergent strands, and then conclude that “inviolate per-
sonality”  is the social value protected by privacy. It defines one’s essence as a
human being, and it includes individual dignity and integrity as well as personal
autonomy and independence. Respect for these values is what grounds and unifies
the concept of privacy. Bloustein defends the view that privacy rights are important
because they protect against intrusions demeaning to personality and against
affronts to human dignity. Using this analysis, Bloustein urges that privacy viola-
tions leave an individual open to scrutiny in a way that leaves one’s autonomy and
sense of self as a person vulnerable, violating one’s human dignity and moral per-
sonality. Invasion of privacy is best understood, in sum, as an affront to human dig-
nity. Although Bloustein admits the terms he uses are somewhat vague, he defends
this analysis as conceptually coherent and illuminating.
A third coherentist and more common view have been to argue that privacy and
intimacy are deeply related. In one account defended by numerous philosophers,
including Thomas Gerety and Richard Gerstein, privacy is valuable because intimacy
would be impossible without it. Charles Fried, for example, defines privacy narrowly
as control over information about oneself. He extends this definition, however, by
arguing that privacy has intrinsic value and is necessarily related and fundamental to
one’s development as an individual with a moral and social personality able to form
intimate relationships involving respect, love, friendship, and trust. Privacy is valu-
able because it allows one to control information about oneself, which in turn
allows one to maintain varying degrees of intimacy and define oneself and one’s
relations to others. Indeed, love, friendship, and trust are only possible if persons
enjoy privacy and accord it to each other. Fried argues that privacy is essential for
such relationships, and this helps explain why a threat to privacy is a threat to peo-
ple’s very integrity as persons. By characterizing privacy as a necessary context for
love, friendship, and trust, Fried bases his accounts on a moral conception of per-
sons and their personalities, on a Kantian notion of human beings with basic rights
and the need to define and pursue their own values free from the impingement of
others. Privacy allows us the freedom to define our relations with others and to
define ourselves. In this way, privacy is also closely connected with self-respect
and respect for others. 
Gerstein argues as well that privacy is necessary for intimacy, and urges that
intimacy in communication and interpersonal relationships is required for people to
fully experience their lives. Intimacy without intrusion or observation is required
for people to have experiences with spontaneity and without shame. Shoeman also
endorses these views and stresses that privacy provides a way to control intimate
information about oneself, and that it has many other benefits, not only for relation-
ships with others, but also for the development of one’s personality and inner self.
Julie Inness has also identified intimacy as the defining feature of intrusions prop-
erly called privacy invasions. According to Inness, intimacy is based not on behav-
ior but on motivation, and so intimate information or activity is that which draws its
meaning from love, liking, or care. It is privacy that protects one’s ability to retain

410
Privacy, philosophical foundations of
\
intimate information and activity so that one can fulfill one’s needs of loving and
caring. 
A number of commentators have defended views of privacy that link closely
with accounts stressing privacy as required for intimacy, but they emphasize not
only intimacy but also the general importance of developing diverse interpersonal
relationships with others. James Rachels, for example, acknowledges there is no
single answer to the question of why privacy is important to us, because it can be
necessary to protect one’s assets or interests, or to protect one from embarrassment,
or to protect one against the deleterious consequences of information leaks, to
name just a few. Nevertheless, he explicitly criticizes Thomson’s reductionist view
and urges that privacy is a distinctive right. He basically defends the view that pri-
vacy is necessary to maintain a variety of social relationships, not just intimate
ones. Privacy accords us the ability to control who knows what about us and who
has access to us, and thereby allows us to vary our behavior with different people
so that we may maintain and control our various social relationships, many of
which will not be intimate. An intriguing part of Rachels’s analysis of privacy is
that it emphasizes ways in which privacy is not merely limited to control over
information, because individuals’ ability to control information and access to them-
selves allows them to control relationships with others, and thus is connected to
their decisions and behavior. 
Another group of theorists present a fifth coherentist view that characterizes pri-
vacy in terms of access, usually describing privacy as exclusive access of a person
to a realm of his or her own. Sissela Bok discusses the complex relationships
between privacy and secrecy, and she argues that privacy protects people from
unwanted access by others—either physical access or personal information or
attention. Ruth Gavison has defended this more expansive view of privacy in
greater detail. Her extended definition is “privacy is a limitation of others’ access to
an individual. . . . [An] individual enjoys perfect privacy when he is completely
inaccessible to others. . . . [I]n perfect privacy no one has any information about X,
no one pays attention to X, and no one has physical access to X.”  Noting that per-
fect privacy is impossible in any society, she argues that interests in privacy are
related to concerns over accessibility: what others know about us, the extent to
which we are the subject of the attention of others, and the extent to which they
have physical access to us. Thus the concept of privacy is best understood as a con-
cern for limited accessibility, and one has perfect privacy when one is completely
inaccessible to others. In sum, privacy can be gained in three independent but inter-
related ways: when one has secrecy because no one has information about one,
when one has anonymity because no one pays attention to one, and when one has
solitude because no one has physical access to one. Gavison’s view is that the con-
cept of privacy is this complex of concepts that are all part of the notion of accessi-
bility. Furthermore, she concludes that the concept is also coherent because of the
related functions privacy has, namely “the promotion of liberty, autonomy, self-
hood, and human relations, and the furthering the existence of a free society.” 
Anita Allen also characterizes privacy as denoting a degree of inaccessibility of
persons, their mental states, and information about them to the senses and surveil-
lance of others. She views seclusion, solitude, secrecy, confidentiality, and ano-
nymity as forms of privacy. She also urges that privacy is required by the liberal

Privacy, philosophical foundations of
\
411
ideals of personhood, as well as the participation of citizens as equals. While her
view appears to be similar to Gavison’s, Allen suggests her restricted access view
is broader than Gavison’s. This is in part because Allen emphasizes that in public
and private, women experience privacy losses that are unique to their gender. Not-
ing that privacy is neither a presumptive moral evil nor an unquestionable moral
good, Allen nevertheless defends more extensive privacy protection for women in
morality and in the law. Using examples such as sexual harassment, victim ano-
nymity in rape cases, and reproductive freedom, Allen emphasizes the moral sig-
nificance of extending privacy protection for women. 
IV. The Feminist Critique of Privacy
Despite these many defenses of privacy, discussion of the concept is compli-
cated by the fact that privacy appears to be both something we value in order to
provide a sphere within which we can be free from scrutiny, coercion, or the judg-
ment of others, and yet it also appears to function negatively, as feminists have
emphasized, as the cloak under which one can hide domination, degradation, or
physical harm to women and others. This is the feminist critique of privacy, namely
that granting special status to privacy is detrimental to women and others because it
is used as a shield to dominate and control them, silence them, and cover up abuse.
There is no single version of the feminist critique of privacy, yet it can be said in
general that many feminists have worried about what they view as this darker side
of privacy. If distinguishing public and private realms leaves the private free from
any scrutiny, then feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon are correct that privacy
can be dangerous for women when it is used to cover up repression and physical
harm to them by perpetuating the subjection of women in the domestic sphere and
encouraging nonintervention by the state. Elshtain and Gavison have suggested that
it appears feminists such as MacKinnon are, for this reason, rejecting the public/
private split, and are, moreover, recommending jettisoning or abandoning privacy
altogether. But as Elshtain and Gavison point out, this alternative seems too
extreme. A more reasonable view, according to Allen and my own analysis, is to
recognize that while privacy can be a shield for abuse, it is inadequate to reject pri-
vacy completely based on harm done in private. These accounts may be viewed as
one reply to the feminist critique of privacy, allowing that privacy can be a shield
for abuse, but can also be so valuable for women that privacy protection should be
enhanced, not diminished.
A total rejection of privacy makes everything public, and it leaves the domestic
sphere open to complete scrutiny and intrusion by the state. Yet women surely have
an interest in privacy that can protect them from state-imposed sterilization pro-
grams or government-imposed drug tests for pregnant women—and mandating that
results be sent to police, for instance—and that can provide reasonable regulations
granting rights against marital rape, for example. Thus collapsing the public/private
dichotomy into a single public realm is inadequate. What puzzles feminists is how
to make sense of an important and valuable notion of privacy that provides them a
realm free from scrutiny and intervention by the state, without reverting to the tra-
ditional public/private dichotomy that has in the past relegated women to the pri-
vate and domestic sphere where they are victims of subjection and abuse. The
challenge is to find a way for the state to take very seriously the domestic abuse

412
Privacy, philosophical foundations of
\
that used to be allowed in the name of privacy, while also preventing the state from
insinuating itself into all the most intimate parts of women’s lives. This means
drawing new boundaries for justified state intervention and thus understanding the
public/private distinction in new ways. 
V. The Scope of Privacy
A further issue that has generated disagreement, even among those theorists
who believe privacy is a coherent concept, is whether or not privacy cases in consti-
tutional law, involving personal decisions about lifestyle and family such as birth
control, interracial marriage, viewing pornography at home, abortion, and so on,
delineate a genuine category of privacy issues, or are merely concerns with liberty
of some sort. Parent explicitly excludes concerns about one’s ability to make cer-
tain important personal decisions about one’s family and lifestyle as genuine pri-
vacy issues, saying the cases focus solely on liberty. Reductionist Thomson shares
this view, as do others who characterize privacy narrowly as control over informa-
tion about oneself. Allen defines privacy in terms of access and excludes from her
definition protection of individual autonomous choice from governmental interfer-
ence, which she terms a form of liberty. Yet she refers to this latter protection as
“decisional privacy”  and says determining its category is purely a definitional
point and one of labels. Ultimately she believes interference with decisions involv-
ing procreation and sexuality raise the same moral concerns as other privacy intru-
sions that offend the values of personhood. 
The Supreme Court has claimed that there are two different dimensions to pri-
vacy: (I) an “individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters”  and (2)
an “interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions”  (see
Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599, 600 (1976)). Influenced by this reasoning, a
number of theorists have defended the view that privacy has broad scope, inclusive
of the various types of privacy issues described by the Court, even though there is
no simple definition of privacy. Most of these theorists have explored the links
between the types of privacy interests and the similarity of reasons for valuing
each. Some stress that privacy is necessary for one to develop a concept of self as a
purposeful, self-determining agent. Privacy enables control over personal informa-
tion as well as control over bodies and personal choices in order to develop and
maintain a concept of self (Kupfer). Some emphasize the importance of intimacy
for all privacy issues, noting the need for privacy to protect intimate information
about oneself, access to oneself, intimate relationships, and decisions about one’s
actions (Inness). Some focus on the importance of privacy as a set of norms that
allow one to control or restrict others’ access to oneself, as well as norms that
enable and enhance personal expression, choice, and the development of relation-
ships. Privacy provides protection against overreaching social control by others
through the others’ access to information as well as through their control over deci-
sionmaking (see Schoeman). DeCew argues that privacy is best understood as a
coherent cluster concept covering interests in control over information about oneself;
control over access to oneself, both physical and mental; and control over one’s abil-
ity to make important decisions about family and lifestyle in order to be self-expres-
sive and to develop varied relationships. These three interests are related and coherent
as a cluster because in each of these three contexts there are threats—threats of

Privacy, philosophical foundations of
\
413
information leaks, threats of control over individuals’ bodies, and threats to indi-
viduals’ power to make their own choices about their bodies and activities—that all
make individuals vulnerable and fearful that they are being scrutinized, pressured,
or taken advantage of by others. Privacy is a coherent concept with moral value
because it shields us by providing certain freedom—freedom from scrutiny, preju-
dice, pressure to conform, exploitation, and the judgment of others. 
Despite disagreements over the meaning and value of privacy, and the appropri-
ate scope of privacy protection, it is safe to conclude that most philosophers defend
the unique and fundamental value of privacy protection despite the difficulties
inherent in its definition and its potential use to shield abuse.

Privacy Act of 1974
The Privacy Act of 1974 was the first comprehensive privacy law enacted in the
world. It regulates the collection, use, maintenance, disclosure, and disposition of
personal information by U.S. federal executive branch agencies, and provides
rights to certain individuals about whom records are maintained. It establishes civil
and criminal penalties for violations of the law and assigns the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget as the agency responsible for providing guidance and overseeing
implementation by the other agencies. The Privacy Act recognizes that government
must collect information necessary to run its programs and carry out its various
missions, but it seeks to limit unnecessary intrusions or unfair practices associated
with government use of information.
Prior to passage of the Privacy Act, changes in American society generated
growing concern about the use of automated data systems to keep records about
people, especially by the federal government. At that time, the federal government was
one of few organizations that had significant personally identifiable information,
access to large data storage and processing capabilities, and the resources to use
them. The public concern about the issues posed by automation of personal record-
keeping systems prompted the secretary of what was then the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare to convene the Advisory Committee on Automated
Personal Data Systems. The Advisory Committee’s report recommended passage
of a code of fair information practices comprising five basic principles that
became the foundation for the act: (1) there must be no personal data recordkeep-
ing systems whose very existence is secret; (2) there must be a way for individuals
to find out what data about them are kept and how the data are used; (3) there must
be a way for individuals to prevent information about themselves obtained for one
purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without their con-
sent; (4) there must be a way for individuals to correct or amend records about
themselves; and (5) any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating
records including personally identifiable information must assure the reliability of
the data for their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuse of the
data.
The Privacy Act was passed on December 31, 1974, in the final week of the 93rd
Congress, in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Instead of the usual practice of
convening a conference committee of senators and representatives to reconcile dif-
ferences between bills passed by the two houses of Congress, staff members from
the key committees of the House and Senate put together the final bill that ulti-
mately was enacted. In lieu of the traditional accompanying conference report, the
staff produced a document, titled “Analysis of House and Senate Compromise
Amendments to the Federal Privacy Act,”  that was submitted to both houses of

Privacy Act of 1974
\
415
Congress and is generally considered more reliable than the original committee
reports as legislative history for interpreting the statute.
In passing the Privacy Act, there was a desire to circumscribe the scope of cov-
erage of the law. The law does not cover all personally identifiable information, nor
all such information held by the federal government, but only that which falls into
the ambit of certain key definitions. In general, the protections extend only to infor-
mation about an individual maintained by a United States federal executive branch
agency, connected to an identifier particular to the individual, and retrieved by that
identifier. Such information is said to be in a “system of records.”  
The act explicitly includes as examples of identifiers, in addition to name or
identifying number, a fingerprint, voice print, or photograph. For example, a sys-
tem of records might be a cabinet of files arranged alphabetically or by Social
Security number that would allow someone to retrieve the file about a particular
person directly. The same information filed chronologically would not be covered,
since getting to any particular individual’s record would potentially require search-
ing through the entire file cabinet to locate the record.
Only persons who are natural United States citizens or lawful, permanent resi-
dent aliens enjoy the protections of the act. Neither deceased persons nor organiza-
tions or businesses of any kind are covered, although in some cases sole proprietors
of businesses may have Privacy Act rights. Likewise, information in the custody of
the Congress, the Supreme Court, the immediate office of the White House, or a
state or local governments is not covered.
A system of records may be composed of paper or electronic files. However,
despite the fact that the law emerged as a result of concerns stemming from develop-
ments in automatic data processing, it was not written to accommodate modern,
sophisticated electronic records systems. In the era of databases searchable by key-
word, data mining, and other innovations, almost anything might be considered a
system of records. This issue was directly addressed by the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit in Henke v. Commerce (1996), when it held that it is not
just the ability to retrieve the records that involves the Privacy Act, but the fact that an
agency must actually retrieve records in order for a system of records to exist.
The major responsibility of agencies is to safeguard from improper disclosure
the information in its systems of records. The Privacy Act model established the
framework for many disclosure laws that succeeded it, setting up the basic rule that
an agency may not disclose information by any means without the written consent
of the subject individual unless the disclosure falls into one of a number of excep-
tions. The most often used statutory exception permits disclosures within an
agency to other employees who have a need for the information to carry out their
duties. Another commonly used exception permits disclosures that are required by
the Freedom of Information Act. There are also disclosure exceptions to accom-
modate law enforcement requests and court orders that meet certain standards; in
the case of “compelling circumstances”  affecting the health or safety of an individ-
ual; for carrying out censuses and other statistical uses; to the Congress or the
comptroller general; and to the National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA) for managing the process of accumulating permanently valuable records.
In addition to these specific statutory disclosure exceptions, the Congress enacted
another provision, the use of which permits agencies to add, via an administrative

416
Privacy Act of 1974
\
process, new disclosures that might be necessary to conduct business. This provi-
sion accommodates disclosures that were not contemplated and could not be pre-
dicted or anticipated at the time of passage of the act. The controversial exception,
called a “routine use,”  is a term of art that refers to a disclosure of a record outside
the custodial agency “for a purpose which is compatible with the purpose for which
it was collected.”  These generally fall into three categories: (1) those where there
is a direct connection to the reason for which the information was collected—
for example, disclosure to a contractor for contracted work; (2) those that are nec-
essary and proper—for example disclosure to a law enforcement agency to investi-
gate fraud in an agency’s program; or (3) those disclosures required by statute,
whether or not related to the program purpose of the system of records. An agency
wishing to add a routine use disclosure must publish notice of a new or signifi-
cantly altered routine use in the Federal Register, solicit comment from the public,
and report the disclosure to Office of Management and Budget and both houses of
the Congress. This ability to add new disclosures and broaden the use of personal
information through a simple administrative process has generated considerable
criticism.
Although widely thought of as merely an access and disclosure law, the Privacy
Act is more properly classified as an information resources management statute in
that it regulates how federal agencies collect, use, maintain, and dispose of signifi-
cant collections of records. The law limits an agency to collecting only that infor-
mation “relevant and necessary”  to its mission, and requires that information be
collected “to the greatest extent practicable”  from the subjects themselves when it
may be used as the basis of any significant decisions about them. It further requires
that the agency maintain the records in a manner that is accurate, relevant, timely,
and complete, and that it review the records for these characteristics prior to dis-
seminating them outside the agency. Agencies are required to establish rules of
conduct for their employees handling Privacy Act records as well as appropriate
safeguards to guard against anticipated threats to the security of the records.
To implement the code of fair information practice’s first principle that there
should be no secret recordkeeping systems, agencies are required to publish in the
Federal Register a notice about the existence and character of each system of
records. Such notices describe the name, location, and manager of the system of
records; the categories of individuals, sources of information, and types of records
maintained; the policies of the agency regarding storage, security, retention, and
disposal; the routine uses associated with the records, and the agency procedures
whereby subjects of the records can gain access or contest the content of the
records.
In addition, when collecting information, agencies are required to notify individ-
uals at the time of the collection about the authority for the collection, whether
responding is mandatory or voluntary, the purpose of the collection, the routine
uses, and the consequences, if any, that would result if the individual failed to
respond to the request.
Besides the right to these two types of notices, the Privacy Act affords individu-
als the right to see and, for a nominal fee, to obtain a copy of information main-
tained about them. It also affords individuals the right to request an amendment of
information that is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. In the case of an

Privacy Act of 1974
\
417
agency’s refusal to amend a record, an individual may request to add a concise
statement describing the reasons for disagreement with the agency. If an agency
refuses to provide access, make the requested amendment, or simply fails to
respond to a request, an individual may appeal for a further review, and the individ-
ual may also seek a civil remedy through a judicial review of the reviewing offi-
cial’s determination. 
In addition to civil actions related to access or amendment requests, an individ-
ual may bring suit against the agency in the district courts of the United States if an
agency fails to maintain records in accordance with the standards set forth in the
law, or fails to comply with any other provision of the act, and the individual suf-
fers some adverse consequence. An individual is entitled to actual damages sus-
tained, with a minimum recovery of $1000, plus costs and reasonable attorney fees.
However, it is extremely difficult to prevail in a civil action under the Privacy Act,
and not many suits are brought under the law. Success requires a showing of willful
and intentional misconduct, a connection between the agency’s failure to comply
and the harm done to the individual, and actual out-of-pocket damages.
Congress established criminal penalties for violation of the Privacy Act as well.
It is a crime for an officer or employee of an agency to willfully disclose Privacy
Act records knowing they are protected by the act. It is a crime to maintain a secret
system of records, that is, without having published the proper notice in the Federal
Register. Finally, it is a crime for any person—an employee of an agency, an indi-
vidual, or a corporate entity—to knowingly and willfully request or obtain a record
under false pretenses. Criminal violation of the Privacy Act is a misdemeanor and
carries a maximum fine of $5000. There are only two known prosecutions for crim-
inal violation of the Privacy Act. This is because it is difficult to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that a defendant knowingly and willfully disclosed information,
and because the penalties are scant compared to other priorities of the Justice
Department.
Under some circumstances, an agency may promulgate regulations to exempt
itself from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. Two general exemptions permit
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or any agency that performs as its princi-
ple function the enforcement of criminal laws to exempt itself from most of the
requirements of the Act. While the CIA may exempt any system of records under
this provision, a criminal law enforcement agency may only exempt those
records compiled for a criminal law enforcement purpose. An agency cannot
exempt itself from the provisions regarding disclosures; keeping and maintaining
an accounting of disclosures; publishing notice in the Federal Register; making
reasonable efforts to disseminate records that are accurate, relevant, timely, and
complete; prohibiting maintenance of records on how an individual exercises
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment; establishing rules of conduct for
employees and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards; or
establishing routine uses. 
Seven specific exemptions apply to particular types of information that an
agency may maintain, permitting an agency to exempt itself from the require-
ments to make the accounting of disclosures available to the subject; grant
access, amendment, and appeal rights; limit collection to only information that is
relevant and necessary; or describe the sources of categories of records in the

418
Privacy Act of 1974
\
Federal Register notice. The seven exemptions protect classified information;
investigatory material compiled for a law enforcement purpose that does not
meet the general exemption’s requirements; records of the Secret Service related
to protecting the president or others similarly protected; records required by stat-
ute to be maintained and used solely as statistical records; background investigation
records; civil service examination records; and military promotion evaluations. In the
case of the law enforcement, background investigation, and military evaluation
records, the exemption only extends to information that would reveal the identity of a
source who furnished information under a promise that his or her identity would be
held in confidence.
Section 7 of the Privacy Act contains provisions regarding the collection of
Social Security numbers. Section 7, unlike the rest of the act, applies to any federal,
state, or local government agency. It prohibits such an agency from denying an
individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because that individual
refuses to divulge his or her Social Security number. It also requires the agency to
furnish notice each time it solicits a Social Security number, detailing whether the
disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what authority the information is solicited,
and what uses will be made of it.
There are two significant exceptions to the first provision. A government
agency may deny an individual a right, benefit, or privilege for failure to divulge
a Social Security number (1) if the disclosure is required by a federal statute or
(2) if the disclosure was required by a statute or regulation adopted before pas-
sage of the Privacy Act, and the government entity was actually collecting and
maintaining Social Security numbers before that date. Many federal statutes
have been passed that permit governments to require Social Security numbers,
including drivers’ licensing, applying for federal loans and benefits, and tax
administration.

Privacy advocacy organizations
The 1980s marked the arrival of the information age with an explosion of infor-
mation and surveillance technologies that would fundamentally reconfigure the
social landscape. By the end of the decade, the convergence of computer and tele-
communications systems had expanded the capacity to collect, process, and dis-
seminate personal information at unprecedented rates. By 1990, a number of
privacy advocacy organizations had formed in response to the purported threats to
personal privacy these technologies had created. Organizations such as the Elec-
tronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Privacy International (PI), and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) have mobilized resources on a number of
fronts to influence privacy policy at the state, federal, and international levels.
Their efforts typically include lobbying for increased privacy protection, legal chal-
lenges, and the dissemination of information to the general public. As such, these
organizations play an increasingly integral role in the development of privacy pol-
icy in the United States and in the international community. 
One of the first privacy advocacy organizations formed in response to the
growth of information technologies was the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).
The group was founded in 1990 by former Grateful Dead songwriter, John Barlow;
Mitchell Kapor, the founder of the Lotus software company; and John Gilmore,
who was also involved in the creation of Sun Microsystems. The group gained
national attention because of the legal cases with which it became involved, including
the case of Steve Jackson Games. In this case, the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) seized computers and equipment from the gaming company while it
was investigating one of the company’s employees for hacking. The loss of equip-
ment nearly caused the company to go bankrupt. EFF helped Steve Jackson sue the
government, and it was ruled that the FBI had violated the Privacy Act of 1974
and the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986.
EFF focuses primarily on issues of digital rights, including free speech, privacy,
innovation, and consumer rights. Although its efforts are primarily focused in the
courts, it also advises policymakers, educates the media and the public, and funds
the development of “freedom-enhancing”  technologies. Its recent activities include
litigation against AT&T for violating the law and its customers by collaborating
with the National Security Agency (NSA) in its massive program to wiretap and
data-mine the communications of Americans. It also has filed suit against Sony
BMG for including undisclosed software on its CDs that reports customer listening
habits and installs hidden files on users’ computers that make them vulnerable to
third-party attacks. EFF has also recently released a report analyzing the unin-
tended ways that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act undermines free market
competition and hinders scientific research and technological development.
The year 1990 also marked the founding of Privacy International. This organiza-
tion was formed when over 100 privacy experts and human rights organizations
joined together to form a worldwide network oriented toward privacy protection.
Still one of the leading privacy advocacy groups in the world, PI is composed of a
wide range of individuals, including lawyers, academics, journalists, jurists, com-
puter scientists, and human rights activists. Primarily conceived as a watchdog over
surveillance by governments and corporations, PI focuses on issues of cybercrime,

420
Privacy advocacy organizations
\
freedom of information, ID cards, digital money, outsourcing, wiretapping and
encryption, and video surveillance. 
PI differentiates itself from many other privacy advocacy organizations with its
emphasis on an international approach to privacy policy. It has spearheaded public
campaigns in a number of countries to push for privacy policy reform. PI worked
closely with human rights groups in Thailand and the Philippines to campaign
against the establishment of national identity card programs. It has also been
active in lobbying former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe to
become more accountable through the adoption of freedom of information policies.
At the same time, PI monitors the activities of international organizations, such as
the European Union (EU) and the United Nations in order to focus international
attention on the policy initiatives of these organizations. 
Another leading privacy advocacy organization is the Electronic Privacy Infor-
mation Center (EPIC), which was founded in 1994 by lawyers Marc Rotenberg,
David Banisar, and David Sobel. The trio first gained public attention through their
successful public relations campaign against Lexis-Nexis, in which they were able
to force the company to close down a database that contained the Social Security
numbers of many individuals. Building on the success of this early effort, the three
lawyers established EPIC in order to raise public awareness of the emergent civil
liberties issues regarding privacy and freedom of expression associated with the
onset of the information age. Through advocacy, litigation, policy research, publi-
cations, and public education, EPIC has continued to further its program to protect
individual privacy rights. EPIC is currently involved in the national discussions on
the privacy implications of Department of Homeland Security’s activities regarding
electronic surveillance and border monitoring, and the Department of Transporta-
tion’s use of aviation passenger profiling, data mining, and radio frequency iden-
tification (RFID). Additionally, it maintains two of the leading websites on
privacy: epic.org and privacy.org (the latter of which is co-sponsored with Privacy
International).
The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC) was founded by Beth Givens in 1992
in order to increase awareness of consumer privacy issues. PRC offers services tai-
lored to the specific needs of consumers, members of the media, and legislators.
PRC offers consumers fact sheets on 31 issues in order to provide practical advice
and information about securing their privacy. Some of the issues included in these
fact sheets are telemarketing, financial privacy, identity theft, and employment
background checks. PRC also offers consumers a comprehensive listing of pri-
vacy laws and current legislation across the United States. It works closely with the
media and legislators by providing readily available access to staff members, main-
taining a listing of problems currently being experienced by consumers, and con-
necting journalists and legislators with consumers willing to be interviewed or
testify. Additionally, PRC publishes research reports on privacy issues and actively
lobbies for stronger privacy legislation.
In 1994 the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) was created by Jerry
Berman in order to develop practical solutions to enhance free expression and pri-
vacy in global communications technology. Located in Washington, DC, CDT has
become a powerhouse on Capitol Hill, partly because of its success in building coa-
litions between corporations and social activist groups (entities that are routinely at

Privacy and inequality
\
421
odds with each other regarding issues of privacy). This emphasis on reaching com-
promises between competing groups has caused the CDT to be viewed poorly by
some privacy advocates such as EPIC’s Marc Rotenberg. Nevertheless, many law-
makers respect the members of CDT because they are not only strong advocates of
privacy rights, but also because they actively engage in the political meetings in
which legislative language is created. CDT is currently involved in protecting pri-
vacy rights in a number of areas, including efforts to quash the use of spyware,
challenging the Department of Homeland Security for its disregard of the Privacy
Act, and developing legislation aimed at punishing copyright infringement while
still promoting innovation and protecting consumer rights. 
Finally, the Privacy Foundation (PF) provides another model for privacy advo-
cacy organizations. Unlike the other organizations discussed in this entry, PF is not
a private organization but a policy research center associated with the Sturm School
of Law at the University of Denver. The foundation focuses primarily on research,
particularly on analyses of communications technologies and services that may
pose a threat to personal privacy. It also conducts numerous public seminars and
helps members of the business community and privacy advocates in policy develop-
ment. PF’s endeavors have included an expansive research project investigating
employee monitoring in American workplaces and the analysis of the privacy impli-
cations of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA
PATRIOT Act).
The above organizations are among the most prominent privacy advocacy orga-
nizations in the United States. There are, however, hundreds if not thousands of
other advocacy groups that deal with privacy issues in the United States and
throughout the world, ranging from local grassroots groups to large national and
international privacy organizations. Furthermore, since the early 1990s, organiza-
tions such as the National Organization of Women (NOW) and the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) that focus on a wide range of social issues have increas-
ingly engaged in the debates on privacy. Together, all these organizations play an
important role in establishing and protecting individual privacy rights.

Privacy and inequality
Privacy raises many social issues. One insufficiently considered issue involves
implications for equality. The work of Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Michel Fou-
cault on the development of the modern state suggests that inequality is one result
of the use of technologies to collect personal information. This may involve moni-
toring workers or determining the characteristics of those processed by bureau-
cratic organizations, such as the military, schools, and hospitals. 

422
Privacy and inequality
\
The control over information—a defining characteristic of privacy—is a
resource related to, but with varying degrees of independence from, other scarce
social resources such as class, status, and power. Such resources are the basis for
stratification in society. As computers become ever more important, questions
about the extent and consequences of a “digital divide”  appear. Is society becom-
ing increasingly stratified on the basis of access to information? Privacy issues are
strands of this much broader tapestry. The connection between knowledge and
power is strong, even if, in spite of Enlightenment verities, there are times when the
richness and dynamic nature of social reality weakens or reverses the link. Yet, on
balance, differential access to information favors the privileged—whether individu-
als, groups, countries, or regions. 
Rules regarding who can collect personally identifiable information, what is
collected, the conditions under which it is gathered, and how it is used—and by
whom—are very much connected to social stratification. Many contemporary con-
cerns over privacy invasion involve large organizations and their employees and
customers, police and suspects, guards and prisoners, and professionals and cli-
ents, as well as interpersonal relations such as those between parents and children.
In these contexts the rules are relatively clear about who can ask or observe, and
who is expected to reveal or is entitled to conceal. Consider also the extreme imbal-
ance in caste and slave systems. Situations involving power differences with
respect to gender and ethnicity may also reflect information inequality. 
In these organizational patterns, stratification often exists within stratification.
The irony of control agents themselves being under surveillance is strengthened by
new technologies that indiscriminately record all in their path. Prison guards, for
example, are watched and recorded by the same means they use on inmates. In the
high-visibility conditions of wired shopping malls, guards never know when they
are being watched, overheard, or secretly tested.
 Rose Coser (1961) uses the felicitous phrase “insulation from observability”  to
describe the norms and resources that protect the actions of higher-status roles in
bureaucratic organizations. Observability is also affected by the extent to which
various kinds of personal information are aggregated or compartmentalized. One
aspect of this central to contemporary controversy involves the ability to merge dis-
tinct databases by using a universal identifier, whether referring directly to the per-
son’s identity or location, or through pseudonymous or anonymous means.
Beyond rules about who can ask or know and who must reveal, the literal avail-
ability of physical barriers to visibility needs to be considered. Contrast the
enclosed office with soundproof walls that a manager may have with the open cub-
bies of office workers. The homeless are “in public”  not only because they are on
city streets, but because they often lack the insulation of walls or automobiles that
prevent observation. 
Issues of scale and the extent of geographical dispersion vs. concentration in the
activities of daily life can also be noted. McCahill (2002) found significant differ-
ences in his study of two malls serving lower- and higher-status groups in England.
The first mall was adjacent to a geographically isolated public housing project, in
which the resources for daily living were highly concentrated. Shops, medical
facilities, and government offices were in the mall. In their rootedness and with a
lack of insulating resources, residents were under constant surveillance in their

Privacy and inequality
\
423
daily rounds when they shopped, saw a doctor, used the post office, made a tele-
phone call, or sat on a bench. In contrast, the more affluent and mobile patrons of
the upscale mall had many more options and in some ways greater privacy as a
result; for example, they had vehicles that made transportation to dispersed ser-
vices easier, backyards for recreation, phones within their homes, and the ability to
pay for deliveries.
The surveillance that crosses privacy borders can be analyzed with respect to
whether it is nonreciprocal or reciprocal. The former is one-way, with personal data
going from the watched to the watcher (e.g., to employers, merchants, doctors,
teachers, parents) and tends to reflect power and resources differences. In contrast,
reciprocal surveillance is bidirectional. But reciprocal need not mean equal. Thus
in a democratic society citizens and government engage in reciprocal but distinct
forms of mutual surveillance. Citizens can watch government through require-
ments for open meetings, freedom of information requests, and conflict of interest
and other disclosure statements. However, unlike government, citizens can not
legally wiretap, carry out Fourth Amendment searches, or see census or tax returns.
Citizens can obtain some information from the public records that corporations
must file. The corporation may require citizens to provide personal information in
return for goods and services, but it does not offer equivalent information about
those within its organization. Patients reveal a great deal to doctors, but beyond
seeing framed symbolic diplomas and licenses, generally are not offered doctors’
personal information.
In bounded settings such as a protest demonstration, there may be greater equiv-
alence with respect to particular means; for instance, police and demonstrators may
videotape each other—an example of symmetrical reciprocated surveillance. This
is seen in many settings of organizational conflict in which the contending parties
are roughly equivalent. Games such as poker involve this, as do some contractual
agreements and treaties (e.g., the mutual deterrence of nuclear arms control sought
through reciprocal watching). 
Symmetrical forms may be present even in the absence of formal agreements.
Spies or intelligence agents, whether working for countries, companies, or athletic
teams are often mirror images of each other. They offensively seek to discover an
opponent’s information and defensively attempt to protect their own. Yet, on bal-
ance, asymmetry in formal surveillance and information rights within hierarchical
organizations and other stratified settings remains. This asymmetry is not always
easy to see because it can be embedded in the physical and cultural environment.
Imaginative norm-breaching and bending experiments such as those conducted by
Steve Mann (2003), who used a visible webcam to film employees in stores who
themselves were using video cameras to watch customers, can help identify asym-
metries. In Mann’s research, the one-sidedness quickly became apparent when,
with no appreciation for the humor or irony in the situation in evidence, he was told
to leave the store.
The development and use of information-avaricious technologies tends to reflect
differential access to resources. On the average, privacy-invasive technologies
seem more likely to enhance the status quo and to extend inequality than the
reverse. The more privileged have an advantage in the development, control, and
use of technology. The uses of technologies for social sorting with respect to

424
Privacy and inequality
\
opportunities for employment, consumption, health care, and the allocation of sus-
picion are profound. 
The ability to control information is central to the borders of social groups. Pri-
vacy is a social as well as an individual value. For example, a legal oppositional
political group, or indeed any group, needs to be able to control information about
members, resources, and plans, and to feel that freedom of expression within the
group is respected. To the extent that a group’s borders are porous—punctured by
informers and intensive surveillance—its ability to act is weakened and democratic
ideals are undermined.
Consider the following thought experiment. What if those in developing
nations—the colonized, workers, the poor, subordinate ethnic groups, the physi-
cally and mentally ill, social service agencies, and those in prison—had the same
resources to develop and implement technologies to serve their needs that are avail-
able to developed nations, corporations, the military, police, and corrections?
Would there be different technologies and uses? What if the information technol-
ogy advances of the 1990s and later had been available during the more idealistic
and social-reform focus of the early and mid-1960s?
Depending on the component, privacy can be either a right to which all citizens
are entitled, or a commodity that must be paid for. Responding to demand, the mar-
ket system increasingly offers technologies and services for protecting personal
information—from shredders, to tools for finding hidden cameras, to home secu-
rity systems, to various software and privacy-protection services. To the extent that
privacy comes to be seen as a commodity for which how much you get depends on
how much you can or are willing to pay, the more privileged are clearly in a better
position to obtain it. They are also better situated to avoid being seduced by con-
sumer rewards into voluntarily giving up, in a sense selling, their privacy.
George Orwell, the author of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and the idea of
“Big Brother,”  was once asked, “Isn’t technology neutral?”  He is said to have
replied, “Yes, and so is the jungle.”  Yet as with the animals in another of Orwell’s
novels, Animal Farm, surveillance is more neutral for some than for others. It is
important to acknowledge the sense in which privacy-invasive technologies can be
and are neutral. Yet the actual use of a technology needs to be considered apart
from its potential use. Part of the neutrality or equality-of-technology argument is
equivalent to Anatole France’s observation that the rich and the poor are both for-
bidden to sleep under bridges or steal a loaf of bread.
Certainly the camera, audio recorder, or motion detector will capture whatever is
encountered independent of social factors, no matter the economic level, gender, or
ethnicity of those being recorded. This can introduce fairness and help smooth out
some of the rough edges of stratification. The populist arming of subordinates and
the public at large with personal computers and recording devices may serve as a
counterweight to the surveillance tools of the more powerful. Consider the video-
cam documentations of police abuse seen on the evening news or the public figure
being hoisted on his or her own petard, as in the case of President Nixon and the
Watergate tapes.
But this egalitarian potential of the new technology does not mean that all per-
sons and settings have an equivalent chance of being surveilled. Nor are the
resources (whether cultural or physical) to defend, resist, and challenge equally

Privacy and inequality
\
425
distributed in stratified settings and societies. When they are available, their use
may be prohibited, as with company policies banning the use of cellular telephone
cameras.
In the prison case noted above, in spite of the omnivorous potential of the lens,
there is unlikely to be a camera or audio recording of what goes on in the warden’s
office or in the guards’ recreational room, nor in the bathroom people in these posi-
tions use. The inmates’ cells have no monitors that permit them to watch the
guards, nor can they legally have cell phone cameras or even cell phones.
Yet there are some factors that qualify the familiar connection between privacy
and stratification. Conceptions of privacy vary depending on the historical context.
The Greeks, for example, placed the highest value on public life. One’s sense of
identity was found there. Privacy, being the realm of slaves, women, and children
who were restricted to the home, was not valued. To be private meant to be
deprived. Are there historical referents in the fact that privy is term for a toilet? 
But beyond questions of cultural relativism, power is rarely a zero-sum game,
and there are forces operating to weaken the link between privacy protection on the
one hand, and invasion and stratification on the other. The ability to invade privacy
as a reflection of power differences is often limited because it is rooted in conflict-
ing values and interdependency, and is expressed on a broad and decentralized
scale within a free market economy. 
A number of factors limit the unleashing of the full potential of privacy-invading
technology, even in contexts of inequality: legal and moral normative constraints
on power holders; the logistical and economic limits on total monitoring; the inter-
pretive, contextual, and indeterminate nature of many human situations; system
complexity and interconnectedness; human inventiveness; and the vulnerability of
those engaged in surveillance to be compromised or responded to in kind. 
In spite of doomsday scenarios with respect to the death of privacy and liberty,
in societies with liberal democratic economic and political systems, the advantages
of technological and other strategic surveillance developments are sometimes
short-lived and contain ironic vulnerabilities. In some ways technologies are neu-
tral, and can help or even favor the less privileged. The design of automated and
more-transparent systems that restrict or eliminate discretion may lessen the poten-
tial for official corruption and discrimination. The creation of documentary records
of transactions that can be reviewed later (as with audio and video recordings) can
offer evidence of what occurred in contested settings. Thus, the natural claims-
making advantage of the more privileged may be somewhat offset.
The democratization of privacy-invading and privacy-protecting technologies as
seen in their widespread availability and ease of application could increase equality.
Through countersurveillance, we see an ironic turning of the tables. Thus, facing
urine drug tests, employees can first experiment at home, testing themselves with a
variety of readily available products like those used in the official test, or they may
protect their private behavior through using products that mask drug residue.
Lower-status support persons such as maids, valets, butlers, chauffeurs, and per-
sonal assistants, often are required to know—or come to know—a great deal about
the private lives of those they work for, and this tends not be reciprocated. 
In modern societies where the mass media is so central, elite status comes
with some new costs, and political leaders and celebrities lack the anonymity of

426
Privacy and inequality
\
the average person. They both occupationally, and perhaps psychologically,
need to be in the public eye, while they simultaneously place a high value on
being left alone. The same mass media that is so central to their success also
invades their privacy, as evidenced by the market for the goods produced by the
paparazzi.
But other factors go far beyond public figures. Social life is dynamic. To be
modern and successful in contemporary society increasingly means to be wired and
plugged in to remotely mediated forms of communication and interaction. In one
sense—excluding direct observation by police in public places—it is not homeless
persons who are most subject to surveillance, but rather it is the more privileged.
Indeed the very state of being “off the system,”  which can partly define low or
lumpen proletariat status, also brings with it a perverse kind of freedom to be left
alone. Increasingly it is the more privileged within the system whose electronic
transactions are subject to surveillance. 
New styles of electronic living in some ways alter the traditional relationship
between surveillance and stratification. For George Orwell, it was not the
masses but the elites who were most closely watched. As life comes to imitate
art, contemporary electronic lifestyles reverse some aspects of the traditional
relationship between stratification and surveillance, at least with respect to docu-
mentary records of behavior. The deep immersion of the more privileged in new doc-
umentary record forms of communication and interaction comes with some
ironic vulnerabilities. 
Excluding their greater vulnerability to being observed in public places, in being
unplugged the poor and transitory homeless are in some ways less subject to sur-
veillance than the more privileged and located. Consider the latter’s telephone, fax,
computer, bank, credit, employment, medical, and travel electronic trail- and tale-
leaving behavior. Awareness of the above factors modifies, but does not overturn,
the stratification-privacy invasion link. Such awareness reveals that indeed technol-
ogy is a double-edged sword with respect to social stratification (and much else),
even if its multiple blades are not of equivalent sharpness.

Privacy notices
Privacy notices, which are also called “privacy statements,”  implement the
notice principle of fair information practices. It is important to note that a privacy
notice is not the same as a privacy policy, even though the terms are sometimes
used interchangeably. A privacy notice communicates an organization’s informa-
tion practices to the public while a privacy policy describes the organization’s stan-
dards for the collection of personally identifiable information and how the
information is subsequently managed by the organization. 
Privacy notices serve two purposes. First, they help people make informed
choices among companies based on their information practices. Second, privacy
notices help reduce the risks associated with disclosing personal information
because they provide people with information about the organization’s information
practices. This information can help people decide whether or not to disclose cer-
tain personal information, or whether or not to even engage with an organization at
any level. 
Privacy notices are particularly important for e-commerce because when busi-
ness is conducted online, there are fewer signaling opportunities for companies
than exist in the off-line world, thus the notice is a critical contact point with the
individual. If the online environment is perceived as overly risky, people will be
less motivated to conduct online transactions, particularly if the organization is not a
well-known brand, or they have not done business with the organization previously. 
At a minimum, privacy notices should include the basic elements of fair infor-
mation practices: notice, choice, access, and security. A complete privacy notice
typically describes what personal information is collected; how the information
will be used; whether personal information will be shared and, if so, with whom;
the options available to exercise control over how personal information is used,
including the ability to opt-in or opt-out of unrelated uses; how to review one’s
personal information and correct errors; and the general steps that the organization
has taken to protect the information. The notice should also describe its scope,
meaning which parts of an organization or a website are governed by the notice,
and include information about how to contact the organization regarding privacy
concerns. 
Privacy notices became a public policy issue in the mid-1990s when privacy
concerns threatened the growth of e-commerce. Privacy notices were viewed as
one way to address these concerns. Between 1998 and 2000, the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) used web-based surveys to report to the U.S. Congress regard-
ing online privacy. These surveys measured whether or not commercial websites
collected personal information, whether or not the sites posted online privacy
notices, and the extent to which these notices reflected fair information practices.
In 1998 the FTC found that while the vast majority of websites collected personal
information, only 14 percent provided any notice of their information practices,
and only 2 percent provided notice by means of a comprehensive privacy notice.
By 2000, the FTC reported that 88 percent of a random sample of websites had

428
Privacy notices
\
posted some form of privacy disclosure. However, only 20 percent of those poli-
cies included all four basic elements of fair information practices: notice, choice,
access, and security. 
Subsequently, laws were enacted requiring privacy notices for three sectors:
websites targeting children under 13 (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
of 1999 (COPPA), financial institutions (Financial Services Modernization Act
of 1999 or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)), and certain health organizations
(Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)).
These laws specified content, general format requirements, and delivery require-
ments for notices. While COPPA applied specifically to online privacy notices,
GLB and HIPAA applied to both off-line and online privacy notices. Further,
beginning in 1999, U.S. government agencies were required to post privacy poli-
cies on their websites. Industry self-regulatory programs for privacy, such as the
BBBOnline and TRUSTe privacy seal programs, were also launched during this
same time period. 
While laws and self-regulatory programs define standards for the content of
some privacy notices, there are no comprehensive rules that apply to all privacy
notices, nor are all organizations required to post privacy notices. Congress
declined to act on the FTC’s 2000 recommendation to enact legislation mandating
that commercial websites post baseline privacy notices. However, absent a require-
ment to post privacy notices, commercial websites or other organizations regulated
by the FTC that voluntarily post or distribute privacy notices could nonetheless be
subject to FTC enforcement action for engaging in an unfair or deceptive trade
practice if their practices are at odds with their privacy notices. For example, in
2002 the FTC announced it had reached a settlement with two high-profile organi-
zations, Eli Lilly and Microsoft, in response to complaints that these two organiza-
tions had violated their online privacy policies. 
Current issues related to privacy notices include readability of notices, format
standards for notice, and comprehension. For example, a 2004 Harris Interactive
Survey conducted for Privacy and American Business found that 69 percent of
those responding decided not to register at a website to get information or to shop
because the site’s privacy policy was perceived as too complicated or unclear. A
2001 Harris Interactive Survey found that a majority of those responding expressed
a strong preference for short privacy notices and for companies to adopt a consis-
tent summary or checklist format for their privacy policies.
In December 2001, the Gramm-Leach Bliley (GLB) regulatory agencies hosted
a public workshop focusing on improving the readability of GLB notices, because
the initial notices were widely perceived as unreadable. Approximately a year later,
the FTC created a pamphlet summarizing the key communication tools and tech-
niques presented at the workshop as a voluntary means for promoting the readabil-
ity of GLB privacy notices. 
Developing standards for notices is another way to promote readability. For
example, privacy notices on websites displaying a privacy seal, while longer over-
all than privacy notices posted on other websites, are more readable than privacy
notices posted on websites without a privacy seal. This may be the result of the fact
that privacy policies submitted by prospective licensees are subject to review by the
seal program and are revised to improve readability prior to being awarded a seal.

Nonetheless, readability remains an ongoing challenge as organizations attempt to
balance legal compliance issues with effectively communicating complex informa-
tion practices to consumers in a single document. 
Alternative notice formats such as short or layered notices have the potential
for improving the usefulness of notices to consumers. With the layered notice
approach, organizations post or distribute short notices, modeled after nutrition
or food labels, which are linked to the longer, complete privacy notices. The lay-
ered notice contains the highlights from the complete privacy notice. In January
2005 the FTC and the other GLB agencies issued requirements specifying lan-
guage and format standards for prescreened offers for credit or insurance, includ-
ing a requirement for a layered, short notice. In addition, alternative notice
formats for wider use are under consideration by the government and industry
groups in the U.S. and abroad. Major challenges in developing an effective lay-
ered notice include vocabulary and format issues as well as in determining what
content should be included. 
Finally, being able to read a notice does not mean that the reader comprehends
the content of the notice. Privacy notices cannot help people make informed
choices or reduce risk if an individual does not understand the meaning conveyed
by the content of the notice. There has been little or no comprehension testing of
privacy notices, so this is clearly an area for future work. 
Privacy notices also cannot help address the risks of disclosing personal informa-
tion if people are not motivated to read them. There is some evidence that people are
unaware of the risks posed by disclosing personal information online, and the role
privacy policies should play in helping them make informed decisions about dis-
closure. For example, a 2003 survey, Americans and Online Privacy, found that 57
percent of adults who access the Internet from home believe incorrectly that the
existence of a privacy policy means the website will not share their personal infor-
mation with third parties. A comprehensive program of consumer education is
needed if privacy notices are to realize their potential as a tool for improved con-
sumer decisionmaking and choice.

Privacy torts
The privacy torts are a group of legal causes of action under which an individual
can sue another for invasion of privacy. There are four torts that are known collec-
tively as the “privacy torts” : (1) intrusion upon seclusion; (2) public disclosure of

430
Privacy torts
\
private facts; (3) false light; and (4) appropriation of name or likeness. Today, most
states recognize some or all of the privacy torts.
The privacy torts originated with an article by Samuel Warren and Louis Bran-
deis, “The Right to Privacy,”  published in the Harvard Law Review in 1890. War-
ren and Brandeis were partners together in a law firm in Boston. Brandeis would
later go on to become a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The article began by discuss-
ing the increasing sensationalism of newspapers. Warren and Brandeis wrote dur-
ing a time when there was a rapid explosion in newspaper readership. This was the
era of “yellow”  journalism, where papers were inexpensive and where the focus
of the media was on provocative headlines, tawdry human-interest stories, and
other attention-grabbing matters. Warren and Brandeis were concerned by the
press’s ability to invade the “sacred precincts of private and domestic life.”  The
authors were also concerned about new technologies in photography, namely a
recently invented camera manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company. This new
camera, called the “snap camera,”  was a lightweight, portable camera that was not
very expensive. For the first time, Warren and Brandeis noted, people could take
candid photographs of each other; previously, photos of people were taken by pro-
fessional photographers, and people had to pose for their pictures to be taken. War-
ren and Brandeis feared that the new cameras in the hands of an increasingly
sensationalistic media could pose a great threat to privacy. 
The article argued that the law at the time did not adequately protect privacy.
Warren and Brandeis observed, however, that the common-law cases did support a
general “right to be let alone,”  and from this general right, courts could derive
specific protections for privacy. They suggested that courts create tort actions so
that people who suffered an invasion of privacy could sue for damages.
Shortly after the twentieth century began, courts and legislatures responded to
the Warren and Brandeis article by creating a number of torts to protect privacy.
In 1960 William Prosser, the foremost tort law expert in the country at the time,
examined over 300 privacy cases, in reference to the Warren and Brandeis article.
In an article titled “Privacy,” published in the California Law Review, Prosser
noted that there were four distinct torts that had arisen from the Warren and Bran-
deis article, and these became known as the privacy torts. 
Intrusion upon Seclusion
The tort of intrusion upon seclusion protects against the intentional intrusion
into one’s “solicitude or seclusion”  or “his private affairs or concerns”  that
“would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.”  The tort deems it a legal
wrong for people to snoop into others’ affairs by a variety of means. For exam-
ple, in Hamberger v. Eastman, 206 A.2d 239 (N.H. 1964), a landlord was held lia-
ble for intrusion by using a hidden recording device to record his tenants’
conversations in their apartments. In Nader v. General Motors Corp., 255 N.E.2d
765 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1970), the court concluded that General Motors could be liable
for wiretapping Ralph Nader’s telephones and for having him placed under exten-
sive surveillance in public. In K-Mart Corp. v. Trotti, 677 S.W.2d 632 (Tex. App.
1984), an employer’s unauthorized search of employee’s personal locker consti-
tuted intrusion upon seclusion.

Privacy torts
\
431
Other cases have found viable intrusion actions for peering into a person’s
home windows, such as Pinkerton Nat’l Detective Agency, Inc. v. Stevens, 132
S.E.2d 119 (Ga. App. 1963), or harassing a person by making repeated telephone
calls, as in Donnel v. Lara, 703 S.W.2d 257 (Tex App. 1985). In another famous
case, Dietemann v. Time, Inc., 449 F.2d 245 (9th Cir. 1971), two reporters deceived
a man in order to gain entry into his home, where they secretly recorded him per-
forming his quack healing powers. The court concluded that the deceptive entry
coupled with the hidden recording devices constituted a viable intrusion claim. 
Public Disclosure
The tort of public disclosure of private facts creates a cause of action when one
makes public “a matter concerning the private life of another”  in a way that is
“highly offensive to a reasonable person”  and “not of legitimate concern to the
public.”  In Daily Times Democrat v. Graham, 162 So. 2d 474 (Ala. 1964), a news-
paper was liable for public disclosure when it printed a photograph of a woman
whose dress was blown up by air jets. In Barber v. Time, Inc., 159 S.W.2d 291 (Mo.
1942), the use of a woman’s photograph in a story about the woman’s rare disease
was held to be a violation of the tort.
One of the most difficult elements of the tort to apply is the last element: that the
disclosure not be of “legitimate concern to the public.”  This element is referred to
as the “newsworthiness test.”  The purpose of the newsworthiness test is to protect
free speech. Even if a disclosure violates somebody’s privacy, it cannot give rise to
liability if it is newsworthy. For example, in Sipple v. Chronicle Publishing Co.,
201 Cal. Rptr. 665 (Cal. App. 1984), a newspaper wrote a detailed account of the
background of Oliver Sipple, the man who heroically saved President Ford from
being shot by an assassin. In the story, the newspaper disclosed that Sipple was gay,
a fact he had concealed from his family. One of the reasons why the court con-
cluded that the article was newsworthy was because it questioned whether Ford’s
reluctance to publicly thank Sipple for saving his life was because Sipple was gay.
Courts have found the newsworthiness element very difficult to apply. A number
of approaches have arisen. Sometimes courts defer to the media, concluding that
they should not be second guessing the judgments made by journalists. The prob-
lem with this approach, however, is that it lets the media win all of the time. Other
courts look to the “customs and conventions of the community”  and conclude that
information is not of legitimate concern to the public if it consists of “morbid and
sensational prying into private lives for its own sake.”  In one very controversial
case, Diaz v. Oakland Tribune, 188 Cal. Rptr. 762 (Ct. App. 1983), the Oakland
Tribune published an article indicating that the first woman student-body president
elected at a local community college was a transsexual. The court concluded that
there was “little if any connection between the information disclosed”  and the plain-
tiff’s “fitness for office.”  Another famous case, Shulman v. Group W. Productions,
Inc., 955 P.2d 469 (Cal. 1998), involved a television show chronicling real emer-
gency rescues that filmed the rescue of a woman who had been severely injured in
a car accident. The court concluded that the television show was newsworthy.
The public disclosure tort raises potential First Amendment concerns, as the tort
involves free speech. Law professor Eugene Volokh criticizes the tort for allowing

432
Privacy torts
\
people to stop others from speaking about them. The Supreme Court has never
squarely addressed whether the tort is constitutional under the First Amendment. In
a series of cases, the Supreme Court has concluded that when the government
makes information publicly available in a public record, the press cannot be held
liable for publishing it (see Cox Broadcasting v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975); Smith v.
Daily Mail, 443 U.S. 97 (1979)). In Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U.S. 524 (1989),
the Supreme Court held that this rule applies when a rape victim’s name, revealed
in a public police report, is published in a newspaper article. In each case, the
Supreme Court explicitly refrained from more broadly holding that the tort was
unconstitutional. 
False Light
A third privacy tort, false light, protects against the giving of “publicity to a mat-
ter concerning another that places the other before the public in a false light”  that
is “highly offensive to a reasonable person.”  The tort deals with falsehoods and
fostering misimpressions. False light bears many similarities to the defamation
torts of libel and slander. A primary difference, however, is that whereas libel and
slander require that the falsehood be damaging to a person’s reputation, false light
does not. Under false light, even a flattering yet false statement about a person can
give rise to liability so long as it causes emotional distress to the person. 
Many false light cases involve instances where people’s photographs are used
out of context. For example, in Thompson v. Close-up, Inc., 98 N.Y.S.2d 300
(1950), the court held that a plaintiff could bring a false light action when his photo
was used in an article about drug dealing. In another case, Holmes v. Curtis Publishing
Co., 303 F. Supp. 522 (D.S.C. 1969), the court found a false light action occurred
when a plaintiff’s photo was used with the caption indicating he was a high-stakes
gambler. 
Appropriation
The tort of appropriation occurs when “one who appropriates to his own use or
benefit the name or likeness of another.”  The tort protects the individual’s right to
“the exclusive use of his own identity, in so far as it is represented by his name or
likeness.”  
What constitutes a person’s name or likeness has been interpreted broadly. The
use of a famous football player’s nickname, for example, can constitute an appro-
priation of his name or likeness (see, for example, Hirsch v. S. C. Johnson & Son,
Inc., 280 N.W.2d 129 (Wis. 1979)). In Ali v. Playgirl, Inc., 447 F. Supp. 723
(S.D.N.Y. 1978), the famous boxer Muhammad Ali sued Playgirl magazine for
publishing a drawing of a man in a boxing ring with the identification “The Great-
est.”  This was an appropriation because “The Greatest”  was Ali’s nickname. In
Midler v. Ford Motor Co., 849 F.2d 460 (9th Cir. 1988), the court held that singer
Bette Midler could sue for appropriation when a commercial used a singer who
imitated her voice.
Appropriation protects against the commercial exploitation of one’s name or
likeness, not the use of one’s name or likeness for news, art, literature, parody, sat-
ire, history, or biography. Using a person’s photograph to illustrate a news article,

Privacy torts
\
433
for example, is not appropriation; nor is writing a biography about a person. A
sculpture of a person constitutes a work of art, and is therefore not an appropriation
of that person’s name or likeness. The key to the tort is whether the person’s iden-
tity is being used to endorse a product, or whether the value of the person’s identity
is being exploited for the benefit of another.
In a series of cases, courts have held that newspapers can use people’s photo-
graphs to illustrate stories even when the people in the photographs are not the
actual people involved in the story. For example, in Finger v. Omni Publications
International, Ltd., 566 N.E.2d 141 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1990), the court held that a
newspaper could print the photo of a large family in an article about in vitro fertili-
zation even though the children had not been conceived using in vitro fertilization.
In Arrington v. New York Times, 434 N.E.2d 1319 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1982), a photo-
graph of the plaintiff was used in connection with an article about the black middle
class. Since the photo illustrated the story, it was not an appropriation of the plain-
tiff’s name or likeness. In Messenger v. Gruner + Jahr Printing and Publishing,
208 F.3d 122 (2d Cir. 2000), a young woman’s photos were used to illustrate a
story in Young and Modern magazine about a 14-year-old girl who, while drunk,
had sex with three older men. The woman whose photos were used had nothing to
do with the story, but the court concluded that the images illustrated the themes of
the story.
Other Torts
The privacy torts are not the only torts that protect privacy. In some cases, a general
tort action for negligence has been used. For example, in Remsburg v. Docusearch,
Inc., 816 A.2d 1001 (N.H. 2003), a man bought data about a woman from a data-
base company. He used the information about her work address to confront her at
her place of employment and kill her. The court held that the company could be lia-
ble if it did not act with “reasonable care in disclosing a third person’s personal
information to a client.” 
The tort of breach of confidentiality is another tort that protects privacy (see
McCormick v. England, 494 S.E.2d 431 (S.C. Ct. App. 1997). The tort applies
when certain professionals (doctors, lawyers, bankers, and teachers, among others)
disclose information that their patients or clients disclose to them in confidence.
Unlike the tort of public disclosure, the breach of confidentiality tort does not
require that the disclosure be highly offensive to a reasonable person. There is no
newsworthiness test.

Private investigators
Private investigators (or “PIs”) are professional, nongovernmental individuals
who seek out information about groups or individuals for private clients. PIs are
employed by lawyers, legal firms, corporations, nonprofit organizations, private
citizens, and celebrities. Private investigating work typically operates at the limits
of the laws governing surveillance and privacy. Lawyers and legal firms hire PIs to
interview witnesses, investigate their backgrounds, or get information to make a
case for a client. Corporations often hire PIs in order to decrease and investigate
theft as well as industrial espionage. Most PI work done for average private citi-
zens concerns issues of infidelity, divorce, and/or premarital background checks.
The fees for PIs are usually expensive, and are billed and calculated in a similar
fashion to that of lawyers: the charges are per hour, plus expenses. This means that
the services of PIs are typically engaged by wealthy individuals or well-funded
organizations. 
PIs use various forms of surveillance and research in order to gather information
for their clients. Direct fieldwork for PIs includes physically watching a target’s
house, calling the target’s place of employment under false pretenses, and observ-
ing the target’s activities. This type of work often involves irregular hours. PIs use
inconspicuous locations or vehicles to observe the activities of the target, using
such tools as binoculars, video surveillance cameras, still photo cameras, cellular
telephones, one-way listening devices, and microphones. Other aspects of private
investigators’ work involve researching the public records that contain much
information on individuals’ personal lives. 
Some types of PI work may border on the illegal. PIs are often aware of legal
boundaries and may push their investigations to these limits. PIs are generally
required to hold PI licenses in the states in which they operate. Some states such as
Alaska and Alabama do not require licenses, yet some other states, such as Califor-
nia, require PIs not only to have licenses but to complete an official investigating
course. If a PI is found guilty of infractions relating to the legal boundaries, it could
lead to the loss of his or her license.
Contrary to popular fiction, PIs rarely engage in direct confrontations with those
they are investigating or do work involving guns. Many PIs do not have concealed
weapon licenses, since firing a weapon in a noncontrolled situation may require
suspension of a PI’s license during the legal investigation of the shooting. Unlike a
police officer, during the time a license is suspended, a PI cannot earn a living as a
private investigator. PIs, therefore, avoid confrontation whenever possible and are
likely to reject contracts that would threaten the status of their licenses. 
The exception to this is a different aspect of private investigators: the security spe-
cialist. Some private investigators specialize in maintaining security for individuals

Private parts
\
435
or organizations. The investigation aspect of this specialty involves researching and
adjusting the security protocols of clients as well as investigating potential threats. 
Allan Pinkerton (1819–1884) was an early and high-profile private investigator.
His firm started with a few investigators who were generally hired to investigate
bank thefts, unexplained corporate losses, and other types of fraud. Later, Pinker-
ton became infamous for employing mercenaries who engaged in violent confron-
tations with striking workers and for hiring people to infiltrate labor organizations
as spies. Pinkerton was hired by the government on many occasions until Congress
passed the Pinkerton Law, forbidding the federal government from hiring Pinker-
ton’s and similar agencies. 
The future of private investigating will be shaped by technological develop-
ments. More sophisticated, higher-quality, and less-expensive surveillance equip-
ment will mean more thorough–and potentially more invasive—investigations.
Moreover, as more and more “public”  information is put online, access to the
Internet will mean it will be easier to find, analyze, and compile information for
background checks and other investigations. Finally, some PI agencies are employ-
ing computer hackers for the purpose of breaking in to a target’s equipment and
accessing other information. It seems likely that computer PIs will come to occupy
their own niche as companies monitor and potentially punish copyright infringe-
ments on the Internet.

Private parts
The term “private parts”  is a euphemism for areas of the human body that are
associated with sexual excitement, reproduction, and elimination. Distinguishing
between private and public parts of the physical body has varied across time and
cultures, and some cultures adhere to a narrow interpretation of private parts (geni-
talia are private) and other societies abide by a broader interpretation (any exposed
skin is considered private or erotic). In the United States, private parts of the body
are associated with both pleasure and danger. The power associated with bodily
pleasure is intoxicating and thus considered potentially dangerous. The Judeo-
Christian culture maintains a considerable separation between private and public
parts of the body. When this private/public dichotomy or distinction is main-
tained, private parts are more often associated with immorality and degenerate
behavior. The association of private parts with morality and sexuality increases
anxieties regarding the human body. 
Private and public divisions are not only applied to the physical human body, but
the same distinctions are carried throughout our political and social body. A central
tenant of the theory of liberalism is an interest in freedom from governmental inter-
ference. This interest is expressed by the difference between public and private
realms of social life. In modern and classical political theory, the public arena is the
realm of life regarding politics, and the private arena refers to issues of family life,

436
Private parts
\
areas beyond governmental intervention. Second-wave feminists exposed the ambi-
guity of private and public boundaries of social and political life in their analysis of
work. One of the many issues behind the feminist slogan “the personal is political”
was the fact that the private life of the family bolsters public life. That is, the public
sphere is dependent on the private sphere, including the initial, unpaid, and unrec-
ognized work women perform in the private familial household. However, many
actors in the public sphere, primarily men, refused to recognize women’s unpaid
work in the household. Thus feminists questioned and criticized the demarcations
between private and public spheres. Female exploitation could be reduced, they
argued, by eradicating the distinction between public and private spheres.
Private and public manifestations of the physical as well as the social and politi-
cal body begin to merge when examining legislative agendas. Obscenity is the term
most often associated with representation of the private parts of the human body.
The legal definition of obscenity has historically been used to describe language,
images, and behavior that are offensive to the mainstream population. The defini-
tion of obscenity has variety across cultures and time. Representations deemed
offensive to the general population vary according to the standards of the dominant
ruling group. Behavior and images associated with obscenity became political tools
to be used or abused by those in power, often those in control of the definition
itself. As a result, issues regarding obscenity have to do with civil liberties. The
U.S. Supreme Court originally defined obscenity as material that was “sexually
explicit.”  This proved problematic as the very groups who attempted to apply
obscenity regulations, radical feminists and conservative policymakers in particu-
lar, were charged with obscenity when they simply described the offensive images
in question. The Supreme Court further clarified the definition of obscenity with
Miller vs. California, Miller vs. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) decision. Here the
Court established a three-part test for a judge or jury to determine whether the
material in question would be considered obscene. If the material was deemed
“patently offensive”  to “the prevailing community standards”  or was equated with
“prurient interests,”  then the representations were deemed offensive. Once public
officials applied the Miller standards, however, certain groups’ practices became
the gauge of obscenity. That is, European male behavior became defined as norma-
tive, and all other behaviors (particularly that associated with lesbian or gay sex as
well as with other sexual behaviors such as sadomasochism or bondage) were
deemed obscene. As a result, deviant and minority groups rather than images and
representations became targets of social control.
A number of laws currently regulate behavior associated with private parts of
the human body. The U.S. Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Earl Warren, ren-
dered the most far-reaching decisions with respect to privacy and the human body.
In Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), the Court established that every
individual was protected by a right to privacy based on interpretations of the First,
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Griswold case determined that the use of
contraception was a right for married couples. Privacy was further expanded with
subsequent decisions, among them Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which
granted privacy rights to women seeking abortions. However, the Court appeared to
restrict privacy protections in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), when jus-
tices refused to recognize sexual relations between two consenting adults of the

Private parts
\
437
same sex as a basic right. The Court determined that privacy rights did not extend
to previously criminalized behavior. In the Griswold case, the Court imposed limi-
tations on states’ abilities to regulate private behavior, but the Court also ruled that
states did have the right to override individual privacy if a persuasive rationale
could be established. In the Bowers case, that persuasive rationale was invoked
with the act of sodomy. Here the implications were devastating for gay, lesbian,
and bisexual groups as their behavior became the definitive criteria upon which states
rights governed private behavior. The Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492
U.S. 490 (1989), case further restricted women’s bodily privacy as it established
that the state could impose restrictions on a woman’s right to an abortion. These
later Supreme Court cases appeared to restrict, or even reverse, some privacy rights
initially established in earlier courts. But the Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558
(2003), decision that decriminalized all sodomy statues reversed the Bowers deci-
sion. The Court ruled that the right to engage in private consenting adult sexual
activity was a constitutional right of privacy. Initially the Court’s decision seemed
to eliminate the stigma that had applied to minority-group behaviors targeted in
former sodomy laws. However, post-Lawrence v. Texas decisions have not elimi-
nated the stigma entirely. For example, in Virginia, publicly engaging in sodomy is
a felony under the “Crimes Against Nature”  statute, while publicly engaging in
heterosexual intercourse is simply a misdemeanor. Consequently, minority group
behaviors continue to be targeted for additional social control. 
As cultural critics, feminist performance artists like Annie Sprinkle openly
question boundaries not only between public and private parts of the body, but
boundaries involving many other Western-defined notions of duality: sacred and
profane, art and pornography, Madonna and whore. Deconstructing and exposing
ambiguity is a focal point of some performance artists. Performance artists practice
art by using their bodies as the centerpieces of their presentations. Characterized as
deviant and pornographic (as opposed to artistic) for her sexually explicit dramas,
Sprinkle seeks to educate the public about the private arena of sex, sexuality, and
the human body. Sprinkle considers herself a sexual healer, encouraging people to
celebrate sexuality, sloughing off the shame associated with this privatized realm of
life. Sprinkle demystifies sex and exposes some of people’s deepest anxieties about
private parts of the human body with her stage shows, some of which have included
masturbating, urinating, sucking dildos, exhibiting her dirty underwear, resting her
breasts upon the heads of willing audience members, and most notoriously, insert-
ing a speculum in her vagina and inviting audience members to gaze at and photo-
graph her cervix. In a typical performance where she portrays a prostitute, Sprinkle
deconstructs the binary oppositions of client and whore. She illustrates and dis-
cusses the customer’s desire, then takes the audience through versions and images
of her own private desire. She does not characterize the client’s desire as misogy-
nist (the argument associated with radical feminists), nor does she elevate her own
desire above the client’s (the argument associated with pro-pornography feminists).
An advocate of postmodernism, Sprinkle embraces and expands on binary posi-
tioning, rendering all categories authentic and continual. She advances agency and
power to both representations. 
Sprinkle’s art poses the question of why it is important to draw distinctions
between binary categories, particularly between private and public categories of the

438
Privilege
\
human body. The separation between private and public parts of the human body,
as well as between the same parts of the social and political body, is not only artifi-
cial and tenuous; in addition, Sprinkle illustrates that binary distinctions create
identities by coercing individuals to navigate between them. She deconstructs and
exposes the ambiguity of boundaries with a keen eye on how the categories are
used in the service of the powerful, to the detriment of the less powerful. While
dichotomous private and public categories function well as analytic devices, they
are often more consequential in the lives of many individuals. Binary categories are
never equal; they always force hierarchy and inequality.

Sue E. Spivey
Privilege
Generally, when the needs or interests of society in protecting the privacy of
communications trump the need for evidence, the law protects the right to keep
communications between two persons confidential. The protection is called privi-
lege. It prevents the disclosure of certain types of private information, including
the substance of confidential conversations between two people. The privilege must
be properly asserted and can be waived. Generally, however, the privilege belongs
to the speaker and cannot be waived by the listener.
In order for communication to be privileged, it must truly be a confidential com-
munication. Thus, conversations among groups are generally not afforded protec-
tion. Further, if the conversation is made in a public place or otherwise overheard, it
will not be considered truly confidential, and thus will not be subject to protection.
Privilege can attach to any communication, whether spoken, written, or otherwise.
Use of privilege defeats the goals of the judicial process, that is, of determining
the truth about what was said in any particular context. Courts, therefore, recognize
privilege in limited circumstances and construe privileges very narrowly. Rarely
are new privileges created; instead, the courts rely on privileges that have long legal
histories. 
In some jurisdictions, there is a presumption that privilege exists in certain cir-
cumstances (i.e., conversations between attorney and client, wife and husband,
minister and penitent, therapist and patient, doctor and patient). In other words, the
intent that a communication be privileged is assumed by the court. In other juris-
dictions, those relying on privilege must prove that the conversations at issue were
intended to be confidential and were in fact not overheard by a third party.
There is frequently a two-step test applied to determine if a privilege will be
attached to a specific conversation or communication. The first question is whether
the speaker intended the message to be confidential. If a confessor tells a priest,

Privilege
\
439
“Please tell my brother I never intended to kill his wife,”  the communication will
not be afforded protection. The intent that the message be relayed to a third person
will defeat the first requirement of confidentiality. The second prong of the test is
whether the communication was indeed confidential. In other words, did (or some-
times could) another hear the conversation? If, in the confines of the confessional,
the penitent party told the priest, “I killed my brother’s wife,”  the confession
would be protected. If, however, the penitent and priest had been riding on a
crowded train and the penitent had made the same confession, no such privilege
could be claimed.
Exceptions to the second prong of the test do exist. For example, if a patient
makes statements to his or her doctor’s nurse, the doctor-patient privilege would
ordinarily still apply. This conclusion, however, depends on the assumption that the
patient intended the communication to be confidential and that it was made in
circumstances where it was reasonable to believe the communication was confi-
dential. There are also circumstances where communications that would ordinarily
qualify as privileged will not be afforded that protection. Those circumstances are
generally those where the speaker announces plans to commit a crime or harm a
person, or uses the communication to commit fraud or further a criminal endeavor.
In order to waive a privilege, the party waiving it must actually hold the privi-
lege. Thus, a doctor cannot waive a patient’s privilege and testify about what the
patient told him or her. The patient, however, is always free to waive confidentiality
and testify about the substance of the previously confidential communication. 
Since privileges block the goals of the judicial process, they can be easily waived
by explicit or implicit action. For example, if the victim of an auto accident sues
seeking payment for medical bills and pain and suffering, the victim implicitly
waives the doctor-patient privilege by making the very nature of doctor-patient com-
munications the subject matter of the lawsuit. If the person relying on the privilege
has, voluntarily or involuntarily, disclosed the content of the conversation to any third
party, privilege is waived. Privilege can also be waived by simply failing to assert it.
A distinction does need to be made between the content of a conversation and
the subject matter of the conversation. If a penitent tells a friend that he or she went
to confession and confessed committing a prior crime to the priest, the penitent has
disclosed the nature of the conversation but not the content. There has been no
waiver of the privilege. If the penitent, however, tells the friend, “I told Father
Smith I murdered my sister-in-law,”  the privilege has been waived.
I. Attorney-Client Privilege
Communications between clients and attorneys in the course of the professional
relationship are privileged if they are confidential. There need be no established
relationship between the attorney and the client before the communication. Nor is
there any requirement that the client hires or retains the attorney before the communi-
cation. Generally, all that is required is that the person talking with the attorney
intends that the communication be confidential. 
As discussed above, communications by a client with an attorney’s employees
or agents are generally privileged as well. Privilege generally lasts long as the attor-
ney’s employees or agents are assisting the attorney and the communication
involves a subject within the scope of that representation. 

440
Privilege
\
The communications of independent experts hired to assist an attorney in evalu-
ating a case or examining a client are also generally kept confidential. Exceptions
to this are numerous. For example, reports prepared by those experts will fre-
quently be subject to discovery. Likewise, if a client should discuss circumstances
involving child abuse with a mandated reporter of child abuse, the communications
regarding that issue will not be kept confidential.
A client may also expect that when he or she uses agents to communicate with a
lawyer, the communication carried by the agent to the lawyer will be kept confi-
dential. In that circumstance, neither the agent nor the attorney could reveal the
confidential information. The protection would depend on the client’s intent that
the communication be confidential, the instructions given to the agent about confi-
dentiality, and the agent’s actions in protecting the confidentiality as the message is
relayed to the attorney.
Attorney-client privilege is also a privilege for corporate clients. Corporations
are treated as persons under the law, so privilege in this case is not all that differ-
ent in concept. Questions arise, however, in terms of who can claim privilege. In
Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383 (1981), the Supreme Court held that
when an employee is speaking on behalf of the corporation, communications
between that employee and corporate counsel are privileged if the communica-
tion concerns corporate, not personal, matters. It is generally held that privilege
can be successfully asserted by corporate managers, management-level corporate
agents, in-house counsel, and outside attorneys. Specific corporate approval may
be required to qualify communications between lower-level employees and coun-
sel as confidential. In the corporate context, attorney-client privilege can be
waived by the board of directors, executives authorized to act for the corporation,
or in certain circumstances, by the corporation’s attorney. Communications must
be treated as confidential within the corporation to be considered as confidential
by the courts.
The attorney-client privilege will generally not apply to physical evidence.
Further, if an attorney represents two persons in one legal matter and a subse-
quent dispute between clients occurs, there is no privilege if the dispute is about
the matter in which the attorney assisted the clients. The attorney-client privilege
will also not survive if the client sues the attorney for actions taken by the attorney
during the attorney’s representation of the client.
There is an important distinction between attorney-client privilege and what
has become known as the attorney’s “work product doctrine.”  An attorney’s
work product, defined as the lawyer’s written documents prepared in anticipa-
tion of litigation, has a qualified immunity from discovery in judicial proceed-
ings even though there is no “communication”  necessarily involved. The
protection in this case is not a privilege in the historic sense. Protections for an
attorney’s work product are not absolute. Discovery of materials prepared in
anticipation of litigation is permitted if the opposing party can show there is a
substantial need of the materials in preparation of its case, and that the request-
ing party has been unable to obtain the information contained in the attorney’s
papers. 

Privilege
\
441
II. Marital Privilege
Generally, courts cannot force once spouse to testify about confidential commu-
nications received from the other spouse. The goal is to protect and promote hon-
esty between spouses. The privilege is held to extend to verbal communications,
communicative acts, and information obtained as a result of the marital relation-
ship. While it can be difficult to define, marital privilege will not protect ordinary
acts and conduct occurring in the spouse’s presence. 
For this kind of privilege to be claimed, the parties involved must be married to
each other. Thus, it is frequently said the privilege does not survive divorce or
death. Divorce or death, however, does not free either spouse to reveal the confi-
dential communications that occurred during the marriage. It only frees each party
to reveal communications made either before or after marriage. Conversations
between members of an engaged couple are not protected, nor are conversations
between persons living in a marriage-like relationship. If the parties are married,
the privilege will generally survive even if they no longer live together or have been
legally separated for years. Many states require that the act or communication have
a relationship to the marriage or not be directly deleterious to the marriage in order
to qualify for marital privilege. In a minority of states, a spouse cannot be forced to
testify about any communication, even as drastic a communication as a threat to
kill the other. Thus, victims of domestic battery can sometimes be prevented from
testifying about their abuse by the spouse who was responsible for the attack.
It is important to remember that the rules of confidentiality apply. If a spousal
communication has been reported to a third party, the protection afforded by privi-
lege is lost. Police can interview one spouse to gain evidence against another, and
the evidence obtained can be admitted at trial. And any third party can testify about
what one spouse may have said about another. 
III. Religious Privilege
Generally, a person has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent another
from disclosing confidential communication between the person and a member of
the clergy when the clergy member is acting as a spiritual advisor. The privilege
covers formal confessions as well as informal but confidential communications
seeking spiritual guidance. The privilege can be claimed by the speaker, or on a
speaker’s behalf, by a guardian, conservator, or executor. 
Most states have statutory definitions of clergy for the purposes of identifying
those to whom the term applies. For example, Kentucky requires that a member of
the clergy “is a minister, priest, rabbi, accredited Christian Science practitioner, or
other similar functionary of a religious organization, or an individual reasonably
believed to be so by the person”  seeking consultation (Kentucky Revised Statutes,
KRS Chapter 421). 
This privilege is not without limits. At least one court has required that the
communication involve a “confession”  to qualify for the privilege. In that case,
the court held that ministers must produce notes about conversations with victims
of sexual abuse to be used by the defense in a criminal trial. Some courts have
rejected claims of privilege for comments made in quasi-religious circumstances

442
Privilege
\
like Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, while others have endorsed the privilege
under those circumstances.
IV. Reporter’s Privilege
A reporter’s privilege, often established under “shield laws,”  twists the tradi-
tional notion of the privilege as belonging to the speaker and not to the listener. As
interpreted by the courts and set forth in various state statutes, a reporter’s privilege
is to refuse to reveal the unpublished contents of his or her notes or to reveal the
identities of confidential sources. This privilege is far from absolute.
Perhaps one of the most misunderstood privileges of all, the reporter’s privilege
would seem to find its basis in the First Amendment press protections. Neverthe-
less, a sharply divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S.
665 (1972), that the constitution affords no such protection. That ruling still stands.
Even under some of the more than 30 state statutes that set forth a privilege for
the press, the privilege is not absolute and may be overridden by applying a balanc-
ing test as encouraged by Justice Powell’s concurrence in Branzburg. The actual
tests suggested include considering whether the information sought is relevant or
material; whether there is a compelling and overriding interest in obtaining the
information; and whether the information is available from any other source.
Courts use a variety of sources to recognize what might constitute a reporter’s priv-
ilege including court decisions, common law, state statutes, and the court’s own
procedural rules. 
If the confusion about the existence of any protection for journalists is not
enough, the simple question of who is entitled to claim the privilege adds yet
another layer. Some states require that to qualify for the privilege, the reporter must
be a full-time newspaper or broadcast station employee. Arguably, that definition
excludes all website, blog, or e-zine authors, freelance reporters, writers of non-
fiction books, and documentary producers. In effect, the unsettled nature of this
privilege from state to state, and even from federal court to federal court, leaves
reporters and sources on uncertain ground. 
V. Doctor-Patient Privilege
Communications from a patient to a doctor while the patient is seeking the
doctor’s opinion or treatment are privileged. The protection includes statements
by the patient as well as details learned by the doctor as a result of medical exam-
ination or testing. Typically, the protection will cover the person’s entire medical
file. Generally, information obtained by or comments made to technicians and
nurses working under the supervision or at the direction of a physician are also
privileged. The privilege is not automatic. A staff person, nurse, or other person
must work under the doctor’s direct supervision for the doctor’s privilege to
apply. Hospital staff persons, or health care clinic employees who have no direct
connection to the patient’s doctor, may not be covered by the doctor-patient priv-
ilege (but may be covered by privileges of their own). Also, for the doctor-patient
privilege to apply when a patient has communicated to someone other than the
doctor, the communication must be made in the course of seeking a doctor’s
opinion or treatment.

Privilege
\
443
When a patient sues a physician for malpractice, or sues a third party claiming
an injury or medical condition was caused by that third party, the privilege is
waived. Indeed, in these circumstances, patients are frequently deemed to have
waived their rights to all their medical records, whether directly related to the con-
dition for which they were treated or not. Requests for payment of medical bills by
an insurance company are considered waivers of privilege. Applications for health
or life insurance usually include explicit waivers of the privilege as well.
Many states have by statute created a kind of healthcare professional privilege.
Similar to the doctor-patient privilege, in order for the privilege to apply, the two-
prong test of intent and circumstances must be met. Some of the privileges created
by various state laws include registered nurse-patient, nurse practitioner-patient,
chiropractor-patient, psychologist-patient, social worker-patient, marriage and family
therapist-patient, and professional counselor-patient privileges. 
VI. Accountant-Client Privilege
Historically, only lawyers could promise clients confidentiality regarding com-
munications about financial affairs. Thus, when business people or individuals dis-
cussed tax and other concerns with accountants, or released financial documents to
those accountants, all that information could be obtained through discovery by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or any other litigant. As a result, there was a
chilling effect on clients’ desires to confide in accountants, who were also the best
persons to provide the financial advice the clients needed.
Today, in most states, confidential communications made to an accountant in the
course of a professional relationship are privileged. The privilege usually covers
information provided to an accountant and anything learned by an accountant dur-
ing an audit. The privilege will also cover any documents created by the accountant
in the course of working for the client. In most instances, however, the privilege
will not cover papers and documents given to the accountant. 
VIII. Executive Privilege
When a president of the United States wants to avoid making confidential
records or communications public, the president claims executive privilege. The
privilege is also claimed by other executive branch employees. The privilege is
almost always claimed to keep other governmental agencies from gaining access to
the confidential materials. The privilege is based on the concept of separation of
powers contained in the Constitution. 
This privilege is actually not mentioned in the Constitution. There is also no
statute protecting it. The Supreme Court basically acknowledged the privilege in
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1971), also know as the Pentagon Papers
case, when it acknowledged the “valid need for protection of communications
between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the
performance of their manifold duties.”  Unfortunately for Richard Nixon, the Court
did not adopt his effort to claim the privilege, and it ordered that he release the docu-
ments because, under the circumstances, the need for truth trumped the president’s
need for secrecy.

Public health and safety
Public health and safety are often defined as those societal activities that seek
to ensure the conditions necessary for people to be healthy. Underlying many of
the activities to protect and promote the health of populations are vast acquisi-
tions of identifiable health data by governmental public health authorities—and
their private-sector partners—from health care providers, insurance companies,
and others. The extensive collection and use of identifiable health data to protect
the public’s health within increasingly national and international electronic health
information systems raise significant concerns among individuals about the privacy
of their health information. Balancing individual privacy concerns with the laud-
able goal of protecting communal health is a central component of historic and
modern privacy laws, ethics, and policies.
In many ways, protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health data and
promoting the public’s health seem contrary. Public health proponents want access
to large amounts of health data; privacy advocates want to limit access to similar
data. Individually identifiable health information has traditionally been used by or
disclosed to an array of public- and private-sector entities (e.g., health care workers,
pharmacies, researchers, insurance companies, and employers) for a variety of rea-
sons (both legitimate and dubious), and with or without an individual’s knowledge
or consent. Varied policies for sharing health data reflect the fragmented nature of
legal and ethical protections of health information privacy. Fearing potential mis-
uses or wrongful disclosures of sensitive health data that could lead to individual
discrimination and stigmatization, privacy advocates consistently seek to limit the
acquisition, use, and disclosure of identifiable health information in governmental
and private-sector settings. Their concerns, often highlighted in well-publicized
breaches of privacy norms or standards by governmental and private-sector data
holders, seemingly justify more restrictive privacy practices.

Conversely, public health practitioners need consistent, routine access to and use
of individually identifiable health information to accomplish important public
health objectives. The collection and use of identifiable health data by federal,
tribal, state, and local health authorities support nearly all public health functions
and goals. Aggregated health data are needed to monitor the incidence, patterns,
and trends of injuries and diseases in populations. Health data are acquired by pub-
lic health authorities through legally authorized testing, screening, and treatment
programs. Carefully planned surveillance programs and epidemiological investi-
gations at the state and local levels gather individual health information on multiple
conditions and factors, including (1) communicable (e.g., tuberculosis, SARS,
avian flu) or sexually transmitted (e.g., HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea) infections
or diseases; (2) clusters or outbreaks of bacterial or viral infection (e.g., hantavirus,
E. coli) from naturally occurring sources or bioterrorism; (3) risk behaviors in sub-
populations (e.g., smoking among adolescents or ethnic minorities); and (4) other
harmful conditions (e.g., diabetes, child or spousal abuse, lead poisoning, or iatro-
genic injuries). Collecting this information helps public health authorities develop
and implement meaningful programs and interventions to improve public health
outcomes. 
Privacy and public health proponents may disagree whether public health needs
for health data override the legitimate privacy interests of individuals. In order to
resolve conflicting demands, modern law- and policymakers try to balance individ-
ual privacy rights against the public’s interest in promoting public health outcomes.
When properly balanced, identifiable health data can be shared responsibly with
public health authorities while still respecting individual privacy. This balance, for
example, is seen in the HIPAA Privacy Rule, promulgated by the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) under the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Prior to the implementation of the Pri-
vacy Rule, an array of federal and state laws attempted to safeguard health infor-
mation privacy. The effect was to create a patchwork of privacy protections that
protected health data in differing ways, depending on the type, holder, and purpose
of the data. When the Privacy Rule took effect on April 14, 2003, it presented for
the first time a national U.S. standard of health information privacy and security
protections (similar to data protection acts that proliferate among member coun-
tries of the European Union).
The Privacy Rule applies to covered entities (i.e., health plans, health insurance
companies, specifically named government health programs, health care clearing-
houses, and most health care providers) and their business associates through con-
tractual mechanisms. It protects individually identifiable health information
(“protected health information,”  or PHI) created or received in any form by covered
entities. These entities responsible for establishing and adhering to a host of privacy
protections, including (1) providing notice to individuals regarding their privacy
rights and how their PHI is used or disclosed; (2) adopting and implementing inter-
nal privacy policies and procedures; (3) training employees to understand privacy
policies and procedures; (4) establishing appropriate administrative, technical, and
physical safeguards to protect the privacy of PHI; and (5) assisting health consumers
to exercise their rights to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their
PHI.

446
Public health and safety
\
The Privacy Rule specifically addresses how and under what circumstances cov-
ered entities may disclose PHI outside their organizations. In general, a covered
entity may not disclose PHI without individual written authorization, subject to
several exceptions. Among these exceptions are disclosures from covered entities
to public health authorities for legitimate public health purposes. In this way, the
Privacy Rule—and most other comprehensive privacy laws—reflects an appropri-
ate balance between individual privacy interests and public health. However, this
balance is still compromised through misinterpretations and misapplications of pri-
vacy principles that can present barriers to public health activities. Some covered
entities may mistakenly refuse to share PHI with public health authorities because
they perceive that the Privacy Rule prohibits these disclosures. The entities incor-
rectly use privacy laws like the Privacy Rule almost like a shield to reject reasonable
public health data requests. 
Alternatively, public health authorities may misperceive that the Privacy Rule
affects how they utilize PHI once it has been received from covered entities. This is
not the case. Public health authorities doing public health functions are not covered
by the Privacy Rule. Rather, public health authorities may have to adhere to a host
of federal, state, and local privacy laws and policies that, taken together, are incon-
sistent, fragmented, and inadequate. These laws differ as to the degree of privacy
protections afforded, assign varying rights to access identifiable data, and allow
multiple exceptions to disclosure prohibitions outside public health agencies. Some
states’ laws declare that public health records are private but do not spell out the
degree of privacy protections afforded. They may fail to narrowly define who may
have access to such data or require persons to demonstrate why they need access.
Public health information privacy laws may lack specificity about when disclosures
may be made, permissively allow disclosures to persons or for purposes that are
inconsistent with public health (e.g., disclosure in court settings), or fail to address
secondary disclosures of information beyond those used to justify the original col-
lection. Some states’ disclosure provisions are too strict, interfering with legitimate
public health exchanges of identifiable data among public health agencies. 
In response to the myriad of public health information privacy laws and polices,
Lawrence O. Gostin and James G. Hodge, Jr., scholars at Georgetown and Johns
Hopkins universities, convened a multidisciplinary team of privacy, public health,
and legislative experts under the auspices of the federal Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) to create a “gold standard”  for the legally responsible
use of identifiable data in public health settings. They developed the Model State
Public Health Privacy Act of 1999 (MSPHPA), which provided, for the first time, a
model set of provisions that addressed strong and consistent privacy safeguards for
public health data. The MSPHPA authorizes public health agencies to acquire, use,
and store identifiable health data for public health purposes while simultaneously
requiring them to respect individual privacy and imposing penalties for noncompli-
ance. Individuals are also empowered with various privacy rights and remedies. 
Notwithstanding the observation that some privacy laws present some barriers to
effective data use practices by public health authorities, in reality privacy and pub-
lic health are synergistic. This is a core theme of the MSPHPA. Protecting the pri-
vacy of identifiable health data is critical to accomplishing public health goals.
People will not stand for unwarranted privacy abuses by government or by the

private sector. Failing to respect the sensitivity and privacy of a person’s health
information predictably leads individuals to avoid or limit their participation in
public health programs. When measured across populations, these collective deci-
sions can skew the accuracy of public health information, ultimately affecting pub-
lic health programs and outcomes. Protecting privacy is thus essential to protecting
the public’s health. 
Conversely, everyone needs public health. No single person can ensure condi-
tions in which he or she, or others, can be healthy. Protecting the public’s health is
more than a community aspiration; it requires the active cooperation and participa-
tion by each individual as a member of society. For everyone to benefit from com-
munal health goals, people must be willing to confidentially share their health data
for public health purposes. Each person experiences some diminution in informa-
tional privacy expectations in the interests of public health. Protecting the privacy
of health information is thus not absolute. There are always legitimate uses of
health data for public health purposes that should not necessarily be viewed as
infringements of individual privacy interests. 
In summary, protecting individual privacy and the public’s health are indispens-
able objectives within a national health infrastructure that increasingly exchanges
health data through electronic means. Neither goal can be neglected for the sake of
the other because privacy and public health are synergistic. Individuals rely on public
health authorities to protect the health of communities. Public health officials rely on
individuals to provide timely and accurate health data through covered entities, which
requires privacy protections. The HIPAA Privacy Rule recognizes this synergy. It
reflects an essential feature of national privacy policy: disclosures of health data are
made for public health purposes without individual written authorization. Still the
Privacy Rule and other laws present some barriers to public health practice. These
barriers may reshape the practice of public health in years ahead absent better soci-
etal understanding of the critical objectives of protecting communal health.

Public/private dichotomy
The terms “public”  and “private,”  and their underlying concepts, have been
used for thousands of years, often as opposites to form the public/private dichot-
omy. For Aristotle, male citizens were expected to govern themselves. Separate

448
Public/private dichotomy
\
from the governing sphere, male citizens ruled their own households. Other male
citizens could not interfere with a male’s household unless a male citizen violated
the expectations for his roles as husband, father, or slave owner. Open to many
interpretations, Jesus said, “Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and
unto God the things that are God’s,”  a statement perhaps serving as a basis for the
separation of church and state. Today, the public/private dichotomy is widely used
as a tool to delineate the powers of government and market actors, devise bound-
aries around family homes, and define responsibilities of community members.
Public often concerns government, but sometimes includes areas where individuals
can communicate. Private frequently refers to markets, but just as often to people
and spaces where individuals, families, nonprofit organizations, and others live and
cooperate. Public is characterized by access and openness. Private is characterized
by efficiency, innovation, and promotion of self-interest. Although public and pri-
vate have different meanings, what is meant by the public/private dichotomy?
A dichotomy is typically conceptualized as having four components. The first
component is a division. A dichotomy divides phenomena. The second component
is having two parts. Di- means “two” ; a dichotomy has two parts. The third com-
ponent is exclusion. The division creates a boundary that excludes overlap of the
two parts. The fourth component is exhaustion. The dichotomy exhaustively
includes all potential phenomena, and all phenomena belong on one side or the
other of the dichotomy. Applying these four components to a consideration of the
public/private dichotomy will further understanding of whether the public/private
dichotomy truly is a dichotomy, and if it is not, whether the notion of a public/
private dichotomy is still useful.
The first component of a dichotomy is that phenomena can be divided. The
boundary is drawn on the basis of a difference, such as one phenomenon possesses a
characteristic the other phenomenon does not. In the public/private dichotomy, this
boundary divides public and private. An important boundary separating public and
private is eligibility. In the case of eligibility, public often implies accessibility: a
public good is available to everyone. Private means restriction: the good is available
to some, such as people who can pay for access. A similar boundary is a physical
boundary. A public space, such as a public park, is available to everyone. A private
space is restricted; for instance, a family can lock their home and take steps to prevent
individuals from entering their property. Another important boundary is obligations.
For obligations, public often denotes a legal requirement: individuals and families are
obligated to pay taxes to governments. Private implies absence of legal coercion:
individuals enjoy freedoms to act or not act as they see fit. Private examples range
from whether to try to adopt children to whether to consume alcoholic beverages.
The public/private dichotomy divides these phenomena into two spheres of activity.
The second component is that the dichotomy consists of two parts. Quite simply,
the public/private dichotomy is based on two parts, the public and the private. Yet
both public and private have multiple meanings, and each meaning of public is
related to each meaning of private. For instance, in discussing social policies, public
sector usually refers to government and private sector refers to the market. Public can
refer to the public sphere and private to the private sphere when discussing areas of
sociopolitical action. In each instance, public refers to one kind of phenomenon
and private refers to a second kind of phenomenon. 

Public/private dichotomy
\
449
A key component is the ability to use the dichotomy to exclude one phenome-
non from another, to designate a phenomenon as one kind or the other. This com-
ponent clarifies that all phenomena can be divided into two parts. For the public/
private dichotomy to exist, all phenomena must be able to be divided into either
public or private. An example is social policy. We designate health insurance plans
as either public or private. In the United States, the largest public health insurance
plan is Medicare. The private system of employment-based health insurance plans
insures most Americans. Further, the public/private dichotomy is used to distin-
guish private property on which a home is built from public property on the same
property, such as a sidewalk or a public utility mechanism. Finally, some activities
are designated public and others private. Participating as a citizen in meetings of
local government bodies, such as schools or city councils, is a public activity. The
decision to have sexual intercourse is considered one of the most private activities.
A closer look reveals, however, that the boundaries separating the public and the
private, essential to the existence of the public/private dichotomy, are regularly
crossed. One instance of violating this boundary is determining who pays. The fed-
eral government does not directly finance Medicare. Employers and employees pay
for Medicare, the U.S. public health insurance plan with the broadest coverage. In
contrast, employment-based health insurance plans enjoy preferential tax treat-
ment. Potential tax revenue is foregone, which must be paid for by all income tax-
payers, including taxpayers who do not enjoy health insurance coverage. In another
example, a government may rationalize that a decision is for the public good and
use eminent domain powers to force a family to sell its private property. The private
sphere is often subject to intervention by public-sphere actors. Decisions to marry
and become parents are considered private prerogatives in many countries, but in
some places, intense public debates are taking place as to whether gays and lesbi-
ans possess the same rights.
Do private efforts ever cross the public/private boundary to shape public efforts?
An important example can be found in the welfare state. Many governments rely
on pay-as-you-go approaches, by which currently employed workers support cur-
rent recipients. These pay-as-you-go public systems are disrupted by reductions in
tax revenues, which occur when the numbers of employers and employees and the
amount of wages are reduced. Market-based relationships and events affect public
policies. Health of the public sphere is significantly affected by individuals’ deci-
sions to engage intellectually and become involved in social and political debates.
For a public sphere to maintain its essential contributions to a sustainable society,
individuals must make efforts to stay informed, debate ideas, cooperate in decision-
making, and communicate with each other.
Exhaustion is the idea that all phenomena can fit into the two categories making
up the dichotomy. If a universe of phenomena exists, the dichotomy is based on this
universe consisting of two parts. As suggested above, however, many phenomena
cannot easily be characterized as public or private. These phenomena may represent a
third sector, which is neither purely public nor purely private, but rather a hybrid. The
idea of exhaustion depends on what kinds of public and private actors and institutions
are contrasted. Public and private qualities of welfare policies usually contrast gov-
ernment-employment and government-individual efforts. Important efforts are under-
taken, however, by social groups whose identifying characteristic is not employment

450
Public/private dichotomy
\
based but rather characterized by collective action that seeks to provide welfare to
its members, such as through the work of mutual aid societies. Often designated as
the social sector, in contrast to the public and private sectors, efforts of these groups
may be essential to a functioning public sphere. Here it is not possible to decide
whether the public/private dichotomy does or does not incorporate the social sec-
tor, but it is important to indicate that some experts approach the social sector as
neither public nor private. 
Is the public/private dichotomy a false dichotomy? A false dichotomy occurs
when a dichotomous construct’s boundary fails to produce exclusive or exhaustive
categories, or both. The public/private dichotomy for social policies often violates the
requirement of exclusion. Government and private entities frequently collaborate to
sponsor social policy initiatives, including providing pensions, health insurance, edu-
cation, and social services such as addiction treatment programs. In some instances,
collaboration is less voluntary when government coerces provision by private enti-
ties. The public/private dichotomy for privacy often violates the requirement of
exclusion. Governments try to shape individuals’ health behaviors, for example,
especially reproductive and parenting decisions. Governments also seek to monitor
individuals’ decisions to join organizations and form relationships with others. 
The public/private dichotomy for public and private spheres often violates the
requirement of exclusion. Necessary to the public sphere, libraries, television and
radio broadcasts, and religious organizations also require the interest of and sup-
port from private-sphere members. The public/private dichotomy may not exhaust
all possibilities. Voluntary organizations, which belong in the social sector, are
often considered necessary for a healthy society, but their membership does not
easily belong in either the public or private sphere. The frequency and importance
of public/private collaborations raises the question of exhaustion: do the frequency
and importance of public/private collaborations suggest a third type of phenomena
the concept of a public/private dichotomy does not encapsulate? 
What are potential harms of relying on the idea of a public/private dichotomy?
Potential harms include false assumptions, hidden involvement, and inequities.
Advantages are supposed to characterize the efforts of public- and private-sector
actors and institutions. After recognizing the numerous violations of the exclusion
component, however, these distinct advantages become fuzzy and perhaps disap-
pear. If tax benefits are removed, will individuals be less likely to act in their own
interests and save for retirement? Governments financially support and intervene in
many private activities. Some private actors may not provide goods and services
without government involvement, and government may provide goods and services
as a result of private behaviors. Public/private collaborations can hinder democratic
accountability. When we ignore public involvement and label an activity as private,
government officials and their constituents may be discouraged from gathering
information about how government resources are used to support such private
undertakings. Labeling an activity as public may overstate the degrees of access to
a good, program, or service that government provides. Inequities arise from how
public and private efforts are funded and regulated. All taxpayers may foot the bill
for private retirement pensions and health insurance plans, especially when these
plans go bankrupt. All governments regulate and some conduct surveillance, but
many governments regulate and observe private behaviors of some social groups more

Public records
\
451
than others. Inequalities in access to information and education can result in inequities
in public-sphere participation, thereby producing public-sphere weaknesses.
Despite these dangers, why should we continue to use the concept of the public/
private dichotomy? The public/private dichotomy can function as a tool and shield.
It can be used to place responsibilities on the shoulders of government or non-
governmental institutions. The public/private dichotomy can be employed to distin-
guish between public and private spheres, highlighting the importance of the public
sphere in keeping governments and markets under control. The public/private
dichotomy can be drawn on to describe change. It is a valuable tool for analyzing
privatization and new assumptions of responsibilities and powers by private and
public actors. The public/private dichotomy is useful for describing declines in
public spheres. The public/private dichotomy can be effective as a shield. It can be
wielded to prevent government intrusion into private decisions and other govern-
ment surveillance. Social groups can deploy the public/private dichotomy to draw
attention to hypocritical stances taken by governments. These social groups can
point out that the same sort of behavior is considered private for some, but that gov-
ernment actors seek to make the behavior an issue of government regulation for
other social groups.
Dichotomies are characterized as consisting of four components: division, two
parts, exclusion, and exhaustion. Using this conceptualization, it is difficult to char-
acterize the public/private dichotomy as exclusive or exhaustive. Consequently, this
difficulty raises questions of whether the public/private dichotomy is a false dichot-
omy. It remains an open question as to whether the benefits of relying on the concept
of a public/private dichotomy outweigh its costs.

Public records
Public records laws require the federal government, state governments, and
many local and county governments to disclose government documents and
records. Disclosures, however, can threaten personal privacy. For this reason, many
of these laws permit the withholding of documents when disclosure invades per-
sonal privacy. 
In the United States, such public records laws reflect the importance of the pub-
lic’s right to know about the operations of government. Several states enacted public
records law prior to the enactment of the federal Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) in 1966, a statute that has become the model for many subsequent laws.

452
Public records
\
The federal FOIA exemplifies the scope of these laws. The federal law assumes
that government documents and records are available to the public and that “any
person”  may obtain them without giving a reason for a request. The federal FOIA
and other public records laws, however, permit or require government officials to
withhold documents affecting interests that are protected by exemptions to these
statutes.
Among the most important of these exemptions are ones designed to protect per-
sonal privacy. The federal FOIA contains two such exemptions that illustrate the
character of privacy protections contained within other public records laws. One of
these exemptions, the privacy exemption, allows a government agency to withhold
requested documents, the disclosure of which would “constitute a clearly unwar-
ranted invasion of personal privacy.”  Another exemption applies to law enforce-
ment records the release of which could reasonably be expected to “constitute an
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 
The privacy exemption applies to “personnel, medical and similar files” but has
been broadly defined to include any documents that implicate personal privacy inter-
ests. The language of the exemption articulates a balancing test that weighs privacy
interest against the interests in disclosure. Because the exemption requires a balanc-
ing of interests, it directs that the reasons for disclosure sought by a requester be con-
sidered. The “clearly unwarranted” language indicates that balance must be strongly
in favor of the protection of personal privacy for the exemption to apply. 
The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has made the exemption more broadly appli-
cable than the language of FOIA might suggest. According to the Supreme Court,
only the “core purpose” of FOIA may be balanced against any possible invasion of
privacy. That core purpose is to understand the operations of government. Even if
the disclosure serves other laudable interests, such as improved labor-management
relations, consumer understanding of the risks of products, or the commercial inter-
ests of a requester, these interests may not be balanced against any invasion of the
right of privacy. Thus, even a minimal invasion of the right of privacy, such as the
release of names and addresses of individuals, would constitute a “clearly unwar-
ranted” invasion of personal privacy unless the interest served by the release falls
with the “core purpose” of FOIA. 
In addition, the Supreme Court has stated that a mere suspicion of government
wrongdoing is insufficient to invoke the core purpose of the Act. Rather, a
requester must produce evidence that would allow a reasonable person to believe
that some impropriety by government officials might have occurred.
Although generally the exemptions permit but do not require the withholding of
documents covered by them, the privacy exemption may limit the discretion of
government officials to release documents falling under the exemption. This limita-
tion results from the interaction of the exemption with the prohibitions against the
release of certain documents under the Privacy Act of 1974.
The law enforcement exemption applicable to law enforcement records adopts a
similar balancing test regarding the risk to personal privacy. The omission of the
word “clearly” from the balancing test for this exemption provides a somewhat
broader protection of personal privacy. As with the privacy exemption, only the
“core purpose” of FOIA is balanced against the reasonably likely invasion of per-
sonal privacy.

453
In 1996 Congress enacted the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amend-
ments (EFOIA). That act adjusted standards and procedures to address the elec-
tronic storage of government documents. EFOIA also stressed the obligations of
government to disseminate information to the public rather than to wait for
requests. Some scholars feared that this emphasis on dissemination combined with
the easier access to documents provided by electronic access could pose new
threats to privacy. However, by increasing the likelihood that citizens might dis-
cover invasions of privacy by government agencies, EFOIA and public records
laws may increase the protection of privacy by deterring such government conduct.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
Radio frequency identification (RFID) systems signal a shift toward nonvisual
(or post-optic) forms of surveillance. Essentially, RFID systems work as unique
electronic identifiers placed on items (in the form of stickers embedded with
RFID chips or “tags”) or on people or animals (in the form of bracelets, badges,
or implants embedded with RFID chips). Once “tagged,” humans and nonhuman
objects can be identified, tracked, and managed through electronic databases.
There are two main types of RFIDs: active and passive. Active RFIDs contain a
miniature battery and actively emit radio frequencies to any nearby system read-
ers. Passive RFIDs contain no battery source but instead draw the necessary
power to emit a frequency through secondary “reader” devices such as mounted
detectors or handheld wands, which are often called “interrogators” by industry
vendors. Both types of RFIDs are “transponders” with built-in antennas for com-
municating with tag readers or “transceivers.” To date, these systems have been
deployed by factory, shipping, retail, and entertainment industries; by hospitals,
schools, and other organizations monitoring people; by public transportation
departments and private transportation companies; and—of course—by the mili-
tary. While the stated goal of using RFIDs is to track and manage products and
resources more efficiently, the potential of RFIDs for surveillance and social con-
trol of people has caused vocal alarm among privacy advocates, technology crit-
ics, and religious groups.
Privacy advocates and others are concerned that RFIDs will enable ubiquitous
identification and tracking of individuals, primarily through their products
(clothes, books, ID cards, automobiles, food, etc.). For instance, a scheme by
Gillette and UK supermarket chain Tesco to tag boxes of razors and coordinate
those RFIDs with storewide surveillance systems illustrates the advanced regula-
tion of social relations made possible by these systems. In this case, covert pic-
tures are taken of individuals who remove boxes of razors from the “smart shelf,”
and these images are then beamed to the Personal Data Assistant (PDA) devices
of store security personnel. The RFIDs allow real-time tracking of those individ-
uals throughout the store and, potentially, beyond. This development sparked sig-
nificant public outcry, including online campaigns to “boycott Gillette.” What is

interesting from a surveillance studies perspective is that RFIDs integrate with
older forms of visual surveillance (via closed-circuit TV), which were focused on
monitoring, to provide enhanced databased surveillance predicated upon active
prediction, identification, and tracking. A significant critique of RFIDs has also
emerged from Christian fundamentalist groups in the United States, which inter-
pret these technologies as “the mark of the beast” and, therefore, harbingers of
the apocalypse. These groups, which are found mostly in online settings, base
their interpretation on the Book of Revelation, which states, “[The beast] causes
all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on
the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the
mark.” From this perspective, implanting RFIDs into humans (for which the
company Verichip received FDA approval in 2004) represents an advanced form
of “the mark,” and thus cause for personal intervention (to avoid taking the mark,
perhaps unwittingly) and collective mobilization (to warn others). Interestingly,
privacy advocates and Christian fundamentalists agree that societies must criti-
cally investigate the social ramifications of RFID technologies, but they come to
this shared conclusion from radically divergent political orientations—leftist-
progressive and ultra-conservative, respectively.

Reasonable expectation of privacy
The “reasonable expectation of privacy” test is applied to determine whether the
Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution will protect against certain searches
and seizures by government officials. The test was first formulated by the U.S.
Supreme Court in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). The test actually
appeared in a concurring opinion by Justice Harlan, who stated the Fourth Amend-
ment covers a search or seizure if (1) a person exhibits an “actual or subjective
expectation of privacy” and (2) “the expectation [is] one that society is prepared to
recognize as ‘reasonable.’”
What constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy? The answer is rather diffi-
cult because it involves understanding a litany of Supreme Court decisions in par-
ticular cases. There is no particular formula for determining when a reasonable
expectation of privacy exists. Therefore, one must look at the specific circum-
stances of each case in which the Supreme Court rendered a decision and make
generalizations and analogies. In Katz, the Supreme Court famously stated,

Reasonable expectation of privacy
\
457
For the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly
exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth
Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area
accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.
In practice, however, the Court has not always adhered to this approach. In sev-
eral cases, the Supreme Court has concluded that people lack a reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy when they are observed in public. In what is known as the plain
view doctrine, the Supreme Court has held that “it has long been settled that
objects falling in the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to
have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence” (Harris v.
United States, 390 U.S. 234, 236 (1968)). In Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445 (1989),
for example, the Supreme Court held that a person lacked a reasonable expectation
of privacy in his greenhouse where the roof was partially open to a view from
above and where the police flew over it in a helicopter to peer inside.
People also lack a reasonable expectation of privacy in being overheard when
speaking in a public place. In private places, however, if people cannot be seen or
heard by others, then generally they will be deemed to have a reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy.
Consistent with the view that people lack a reasonable expectation of privacy in
public, the Supreme Court has held that a person lacked a reasonable expectation of
privacy when law enforcement officials installed a physical-tracking device that
monitored where he drove in his car. According to the Court, a “person traveling in
an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in
his movements from one place to another” (United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276
(1983)). In contrast, a tracking device that monitored a person's movements in his
home did infringe upon his reasonable expectation of privacy (United States v.
Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984)). Whereas the movements in Knotts were in public, the
movements within the residence were not, and this amounted to an impermissible
search of the residence.
The police can apply sensory enhancement technology to what they see or hear
with the naked senses. In Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730 (1983), the Supreme Court
held that using a flashlight to “illuminate a darkened area” did not implicate a rea-
sonable expectation of privacy. In Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S.
227 (1986), government officials flew over the defendant's property and used a
high-tech aerial-mapping camera to take photographs, which could then be magni-
fied to reveal very small objects. The Supreme Court concluded that there was no
reasonable expectation of privacy because the “mere fact that human vision is
enhanced somewhat, at least to the degree here, does not give rise to constitutional
problems.”
There are instances, however, when using sensory enhancement technology can
implicate a person's reasonable expectation of privacy. In United States v. Kyllo,
533 U.S. 27 (2001), the police used a thermal sensor imaging device to detect heat
patterns coming from a person’s home. Although the police did not enter the resi-
dence, the device measured the heat emanating from the residence. The Supreme
Court nevertheless concluded that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of
privacy because the device could be used to detect activities within his home.

Reasonable expectation of privacy
\
The Supreme Court also has concluded that people lack a reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy in information exposed to third parties. This has become known as
the “third-party doctrine.” For example, in United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435
(1976), the Court held that people lack a reasonable expectation of privacy in their
bank records because “[a]ll of the documents obtained, including financial state-
ments and deposit slips, contain only information voluntarily conveyed to the
banks and exposed to their employees in the ordinary course of business.” Employ-
ing analogous reasoning in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), the Court held
that people lack a reasonable expectation of privacy in pen register information
(the phone numbers they dial) because they “know that they must convey numeri-
cal information to the phone company,” and therefore they cannot “harbor any gen-
eral expectation that the numbers they dial will remain secret.” Similarly, in
California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35 (1988), the Supreme Court concluded that
people cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy in trash left for collection
on the curb because they “exposed their garbage to the public” and “placed their
refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash
collector.”
The third-party doctrine is difficult to square with other Fourth Amendment doc-
trines. If a person is talking on the phone to another person, this does not negate
either person's reasonable expectation of privacy, even though the two are sharing
information with each other. One of the parties to the conversation can betray the
other, and people do not have a reasonable expectation that their confidants will not
communicate their secrets to the police. However, so long as both parties to the con-
versation have resolved to keep the conversation private, they have a reasonable
expectation of privacy if they did not speak in public or where audible to others.
Nevertheless, if a person provides information to a bank or a company, then the per-
son has been deemed to have relinquished his reasonable expectation of privacy—
even if the bank or company desires that the information be kept private. The Court
has not explained why exposing information to a bank or company is different from
exposing it to another conversant over the telephone.
The third-party doctrine also gives rise to some difficult issues because of life in
the information age. Countless companies maintain detailed records of people's
personal information: Internet service providers, merchants, bookstores, phone
companies, cable companies, and many more. According to the third-party doc-
trine, a person lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy in this information because
third parties possess it.
Taken together, the cases suggest that the Supreme Court believes that people
lack a reasonable expectation of privacy whenever something is exposed to the
public or to third parties. In other words, if a person keeps something a total secret,
then he can reasonably expect it to be private. However, once something is revealed
in public or to others, then he can no longer reasonably expect privacy.
Methodologically, how does the Supreme Court determine whether there is a
reasonable expectation of privacy? At first glance, the reasonable expectation test
appears to be empirical: a reasonable expectation of privacy is an expectation that a
majority of members in society deem reasonable. However, in applying the test,
the Supreme Court has rarely looked to empirical evidence or to polls. Instead, the
Court has typically applied its own notions of privacy. In at least one instance, the

Red & Black Publishing Co. v. Board of Regents, 262 GA. 848 (1993)
\
459
Court acknowledged that the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test has a norma-
tive dimension:
For example, if the Government were suddenly to announce on nationwide televi-
sion that all homes henceforth would be subject to warrantless entry, individuals
thereafter might not in fact entertain any actual expectation of privacy regarding
their homes, papers, and effects. Similarly, if a refugee from a totalitarian country,
unaware of this Nation's traditions, erroneously assumed that police were continu-
ously monitoring his telephone conversations, a subjective expectation of privacy
regarding the contents of his calls might be lacking as well. In such circumstances,
where an individual's subjective expectations had been “conditioned” by influences
alien to well-recognized Fourth Amendment freedoms, those subjective expecta-
tions obviously could play no meaningful role in ascertaining what the scope of
Fourth Amendment protection was. In determining whether a “legitimate expecta-
tion of privacy” existed in such cases, a normative inquiry would be proper (Smith
v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 741 n.5 (1979)).
A broader conclusion might be drawn from the preceding statement. Perhaps the
“reasonable expectation of privacy” test should measure whether privacy in a par-
ticular matter is normatively desirable, as expectations can erode over time as tech-
nology advances. On the other hand, under such an approach, who determines what
is normatively desirable? Some critics are skeptical as to whether it is appropriate
for judges to be making such normative judgments for society.
Other critics have charged that the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test has,
in practice, led to a curtailment of Fourth Amendment privacy protection. Many
cases applying the test have concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of
privacy, and hence no Fourth Amendment protection. Despite much criticism and
controversy, the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test remains the central crite-
rion courts use to determine the scope of Fourth Amendment protection.

Red & Black Publishing Co. v. Board of Regents, 262 GA. 848 (1993)
In the case of Red & Black Publishing Co. v. Board of Regents, the staff of the
student newspaper at the University of Georgia, The Red and Black, believed that it
should be granted access to the records and proceedings of the university’s student
organization court. Specifically, in this instance it desired access to the records and
proceedings dealing with hazing charges brought against two fraternities. The Red

460

\
and Black filed suit against the university’s Board of Regents, including university
president Charles Knapp and others, under Georgia's Open Records Act and Open
Meetings Act after its request for access to the records was denied.
The Supreme Court, in accordance with the trial court, ruled that the newspaper
was entitled to the organization court’s records; however, unlike the trial court, it
also deemed the proceedings to be accessible. The Supreme Court based its ruling,
in part, on the definition of the term “open records” under Georgia’s Open Records
Act, as any material processed in a public agency or office. It noted that the act's
purpose is to promote the openness of such material so that the public may monitor
its institutions as well as maintain trust in them. The organization court was formed
as part of a public institution, the University of Georgia, which is governed by a
public agency, the Board of Regents. Thus, the Court concluded that the organiza-
tion court's records were public and therefore accessible to the student newspaper.
Although the defendants argued that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA), otherwise known as the Buckley Amendment, did not require them
to disclose the records, the Supreme Court considered this impertinent since the
purpose of the Buckley Amendment was not to protect individuals’ privacy, but to
prevent institutions from carelessly releasing education records. Furthermore, it did
not consider the organization court’s records to be of the same nature as the educa-
tion records protected under this amendment.
The Supreme Court noted that the purpose of Georgia’s Open Meetings Act is
similar to that of the Open Records Act in that it protects the public by allowing it
to monitor the governmental proceedings of public agencies at which official busi-
ness and policies are discussed. While the organization court is not a governmental
agency or body in the same sense as the Board of Regents, the Court held that it
was equivalent under the Open Meetings Act. The organization court was created
by the university; holds its sessions on the campus; and, has the job of discussing,
enacting, and deciding on policies and regulations dealing with the university’s
social organizations.
To determine a verdict in this case, the Supreme Court based its decision on the
implications of certain prior acts and amendments as well as on the definitions of sig-
nificant terms that arose in the proceedings. In addition, it noted that the state required
such business to be open to the public under the two acts discussed. Although decisions
on the issue of privacy are difficult to make, perhaps future courts will find the reason-
ing in this specific incident useful for their own justifications.

Red-light and speeding cameras
Red-light and speeding camera systems automate some of the traffic enforcement
functions of police. The technologies can include radar or laser detection devices,
electromagnetic loops embedded in the road, pole-mounted or portable cameras,
microprocessors, and networking devices. Most of the older systems rely on 35 mm
film, which must be routinely extracted from the units; newer systems employ digital
and video cameras and send the information over data networks. In theory, when an
automobile trips an electronic sensor after a traffic light changes to red, or when a
vehicle’s speed exceeds the posted limit by a certain amount (usually 10 mph in the
United States), photographs are taken of the front and rear of the vehicle (i.e., of the
driver and the license plate, respectively). The owner of the vehicle may then be sent
a citation or a notice to “nominate” the actual driver of the vehicle at the time of the
alleged violation. Currently, 45 countries use such systems; in the United States, the
systems are active in 19 states and the District of Columbia.
Privacy advocates and others have vocally opposed such systems. The key con-
cerns involve the potential for surveillance creep, the attenuation of constitution-
ally guaranteed due process and equal protection, and the apparent conflicts of
interest and lack of transparency entailed by the outsourcing of police functions to
private industries. First, surveillance creep is a serious concern with technological
systems such as these, because they allow the indefinite retention of data, making it
possible—and likely attractive—for law enforcement agencies and others to access
the data for purposes beyond the intended functions of the systems. It is also possi-
ble that unintentional breaches of privacy can occur, such as in a well-documented
case in Hawthorne, California, where a picture of a woman and her lover was sent,
in the form of a citation, to the woman's husband. Second, the Due Process and
Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution may be conveniently ignored by
police departments and the courts that perceive the technological systems as some-
how “neutral” and therefore fairer than individual law enforcement agents in tar-
geting traffic crimes. However, compelling cases have been made that significant
threats to constitutional protections are occurring. Not everyone is being photo-
graphed. Punishments can vary depending on whether one is cited by an officer or
by the automated system. Data unrelated to the violation are being collected and
stored; and, those being accused of breaking the law have no recourse to challenge
their accusers in court—meaning, in effect, that they are guilty until proven inno-
cent. Finally, the privatization of police functions has introduced a host of second-
ary concerns about the profit interests and secrecy of the companies operating
these systems. Notably, a judge in San Diego, California, found that the evidence
generated by these systems was unreliable because the private company operating
them received a percentage of the fines and evidently “rigged” the system to
increase its profits. What this example demonstrates is that, far from being neutral,
the technologies are embedded with the values and interests of their designers, who
in most cases are private companies with no obligations of public accountability.

As might be expected, individuals have developed vibrant “countersurveillance”
techniques to neutralize the effectiveness of red-light and speeding camera sys-
tems. These include extreme measures such as destroying cameras; using various
sprays, shields, or automated camera flash guns to make license plates illegible; or
using Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, radar or laser detectors, or maps
of camera locations to facilitate avoidance of, or behavior modification around,
known cameras.

Reproductive rights
Reproductive rights refers to a compilation of issues related primarily to
women’s rights to bear and raise children as well as their rights not to do so. Mat-
ters such as birth control, emergency contraception, abortion, sterilization,
assisted reproductive technologies, and fetal rights are included in the moral and
legal debates surrounding reproductive rights. While questions surrounding the
control of reproductive capacities have a long history, the term “reproductive
rights” came into popular usage in the 1960s, during a time of technological
advancement, sexual revolution, and a general “rights explosion.” Currently,
women’s reproductive rights are guaranteed as individual rights to privacy rather
than rights of gender equality. Public and political debates over reproductive con-
trol are not woman-centered; rather, they are aimed at addressing large-scale social
or economic problems.
There is an intricate connection between reproductive rights and privacy.
Although the word “privacy” does not actually appear in the U.S. Constitution, an
underlying notion of individual autonomy and privacy are evident in the Fourth
Amendment’s guarantee against unlawful search and seizure and the Fifth Amend-
ment’s shield against self-incrimination. While these constitutional protections
have been extended to reproductive rights, a woman’s right to privacy in such mat-
ters is rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment’s assurance of individual liberty.
Before his appointment to the Supreme Court, then lawyer Louis Brandeis argued
that this embedded right to privacy would lead to a judicial “right to be let alone.”
This notion became salient in the case of Griswold v Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479
(1965), which overturned the illegality of birth control by married couples. In this
case, the marital bedroom was designated as “a zone of privacy.”
While Griswold laid the foundation for reproductive rights as a privacy issue,
the landmark abortion case of Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), further estab-
lished this right. Although the Court argued that abortion was foremost a medical

Reproductive rights
\
463
issue, Justice Henry Blackmun’s opinion that the Due Process Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment guarantees a woman’s right to privacy prevailed as a victory for
reproductive rights activism. However, this right to privacy, like First Amendment
rights, may be reduced if the state has a compelling interest in the issue. This is evi-
dent in Roe’s creation of a trimester system, with women granted some level of
autonomy and bodily integrity during the first three months of pregnancy. During
this time, the individual woman, in consultation with her doctor, remained free to
make decisions regarding the progression of her pregnancy. A woman’s right to pri-
vacy decreased in the second trimester, when her health is defined by the state as
more vulnerable. Finally, in the third trimester, the state’s right to protect a viable
fetus (one that could potentially live outside the womb) usurps a woman’s right to
privacy and justifies state intervention to prevent an abortion, unless it is necessary
for preserving the mother’s life or health. This trimester system has had contradic-
tory effects, expanding women’s reproductive control on one hand while legalizing
state intervention on the other. Ultimately, the ruling in Roe placed the control of
pregnant bodies in the hands of physicians.
Roe faced a potential overturn in the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood of Penn-
sylvania v Casey. This case addressed the limitations and regulations of abortion
even in the first trimester, including: provisions for a 24-hour waiting period; spou-
sal consent; parental consent; informed consent on the part of the pregnant woman;
and, reporting regulations. The Court fractured into three blocs, but Roe was not
overturned. Instead, the trimester system was replaced with a framework of “undue
burden,” and all of the abortion restrictions, with the exception of spousal consent,
were upheld. The Court indicated that the public had come to rely on the right to
abortion put forth in Roe, but now states could limit access as long as they did not
place “a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonvi-
able fetus.” Reproductive rights advocates argue that the legal restrictions to abor-
tion approved under the Casey ruling challenge women’s right to privacy and limit
control of their own bodies.
Social policies such as the Hyde Amendment, which allows federal money for
abortions only in instances where the woman’s life is threatened, limit the reproduc-
tive rights of many women. In 2000 federal policies were expanded to permit funds
for abortions in cases of rape or incest as well. Currently, 20 states allow the use of
their funds for abortions, while 30 have no public assistance for such acts. The right
to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy relates directly to a woman’s finan-
cial capability to be a properly legitimate mother. At the same time, those women
who do not meet middle-class standards of legitimate motherhood are not provided
with the social and financial support to end their pregnancies. Opponents to repro-
ductive rights place the interests of the unborn over an individual woman’s right to
privacy by prohibiting federal funding for abortion. By limiting funds for abortions,
social policies refute the idea that limiting family size has benefits for society as a
whole. Because poverty does not demand special consideration under the Constitu-
tion, the right to privacy in procreative matters is not universal.
In the decades since Roe, fetal personhood has stood at the center of anti-abortion
campaigns. Proponents of fetal personhood argue that the fetus has rights—like liv-
ing, breathing people—and those rights can be distinguished from those of the
pregnant woman. Advocates of fetal protection maintain that the state has an

464
Reproductive rights
\
obligation to secure the interests of the unborn. Several protectionist policies devel-
oped in the last decades of the twentieth century placed fetal rights above women’s
individual rights. These policies resulted in the prosecution of women for dispens-
ing drugs to minors via the umbilical cord, and the banning or restriction of fertile
(although not necessarily pregnant) women from hazardous workplaces. Some
pregnant women have been ordered to undergo medical treatment, including cesar-
ean sections, against their will, and others have lost custody of their children as a
result of behaviors during pregnancy that the state deemed threatening to the poten-
tial life of the unborn fetus. Reproductive rights activists challenge these policies as
an invasion of the pregnant woman’s privacy. Unlike other conflicts of individual
rights, the issue of fetal rights is complicated by the physicality of pregnancy. Fetal
protection demands that the pregnant woman’s individual rights be violated to pro-
tect those of the fetus. The social pressure to protect the fetus is likely to further
challenge women’s control of their own bodies, especially since the possibilities
for additional restrictions on pregnant women’s conduct are unlimited. The current
debate could lead to the prosecution of women who fail to follow physicians’
advice to exercise during pregnancy, to limit alcohol intake, or to take prenatal vita-
mins. As long as moral and legal motivations underlie support for fetal rights,
women’s rights are in jeopardy. The status of the fetus, desired or not, determines
whether fetal rights or women’s right to privacy prevail.
Race and social class play an important role in reproductive rights and result in
social policies that assign differing social importance to groups of babies based on
these characteristics. Because society values the reproduction capacity of some
women while disregarding that of others, white women and other women of privi-
lege have historically fought for reproductive autonomy to liberate themselves
from the notion of motherhood as biological destiny. Women of color, on the other
hand, have challenged governmental policies that have alternately compelled or
restricted their reproductive capacity depending on social demands and attitudes.
During slavery, black women, viewed as capital, were forced to procreate to further
their owners’ holdings. Eugenics in the 1920s resulted in forced sterilization for
those deemed socially unfit. During the early 1970s, federally funded experimental
trials of Depo-Provera resulted in the sterilization of more than 100,000 poor
women, nearly half of whom were black. Currently, poor and minority women are
more likely to be subjected to forced medical treatment during pregnancy. The fear
of forced treatment could deter women from seeking any prenatal care, further
endangering their health and the health of the fetus. Public authorities overwhelm-
ingly associate poor women and women of color with social problems, such as
drug-addicted newborns, “welfare queens,” and teenage pregnancy. Ultimately,
women of color and poor women are faced with different realities when reproduc-
tion is considered a privacy issue.
Reproductive rights straddle the public/private dichotomy of American soci-
ety. Women’s private decisions about whether to have children do not exist in a
vacuum. Laws and policies shape women’s rights to privacy and place women’s
reproductive control in the public context. Society’s desire to grant women rights
of bodily integrity has a relatively short history in the United States, gaining legal
recognition with Roe and Casey only late in the twentieth century. Thus, women’s

reproductive rights face a tenuous future as an individual woman’s rights compete
with those of the unborn and the best interest of the state.

Restrooms and dressing rooms
Restrooms are rooms or areas that are often equipped with a toilet, shower, and
sink in which an individual typically would wash, shower, urinate, or defecate.
Dressing rooms are rooms or areas that are designated for changing clothes, apply-
ing makeup, or other, similar conduct. These types of activities are traditionally
performed within an enclosed or secluded setting because they innately invoke a
sense of privacy.
Although there is no uniform definition of privacy, it is generally accepted that
privacy includes a desire to shield one’s body, including genitalia or “private
parts,” as well as certain activities, ranging from defecating to bathing and trying
on clothing in a retail dressing room, from the plain view of other individuals. In
fact, public display of some of these activities is often considered taboo.
Restrooms and dressing rooms furnish a measure of privacy protection to an
individual who is engaging in activities such as bathing by limiting the access
available to others, and thus limiting the opportunity of exposure to others. As a
general matter, the level of protection afforded depends upon whether society con-
siders the individual to have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Typically, by
going behind the closed doors of a bathroom or dressing room, an individual may
reasonably expect not to be observed by others.
"Peeping Toms,” however, often commit acts of voyeurism by targeting
restrooms and dressing rooms for the purpose of spying on an individual in vari-
ous states of undress. Because of the innate privacy concerns involved, this is
often illegal.
Public restrooms and retail dressing rooms, however, may be legitimately sub-
ject to limited surveillance under certain circumstances. For example, privacy
interests may be weighed against the interests in law enforcement and the preven-
tion of shoplifting. Therefore, where a property owner posts a conspicuous warning
of surveillance, or where the restroom or dressing room reasonably does not sug-
gest that it offers privacy protection, an individual engaging in private activities
therein may not be considered to have acted reasonably by expecting to remain pri-
vate. As a general matter, however, nonconsensual observation or image recording
of occupants of restrooms and dressing rooms is prohibited by law.

Right to be let alone
The origin of a legal remedy for invasion of privacy is most often traced to the
writings of former Harvard Law School roommates Samuel D. Warren and Louis
D. Brandeis (class of 1877). Later in his career, Brandeis served on the United
States Supreme Court from 1916 to 1939. Warren founded a prominent Boston law
firm that still exists today. In 1890, after Warren had wooed Brandeis to his firm,
the upstart lawyers convinced the Harvard Law Review to publish their article “The
Right to Privacy.” There they defined an expansive concept of privacy and the steps
private individuals could take to protect those privacy rights. However, the “right to
be let alone” was first described in the writings of a lesser-known Michigan jurist.
Thomas M. Cooley began his professional life as city clerk, then newspaper edi-
tor, and later circuit court commissioner. Once he turned his attention to the prac-
tice of law, he began to amass what has been called “the most distinguished legal
record of any man whose name has been associated with the jurisprudence of
Michigan.” He became a state court justice in 1864.
When the University of Michigan Law School began operations in 1859, Cooley
was one of the first professors hired. At the school he taught constitutional law, real
property, trust, estates, and domestic property. In addition to teaching, he wrote
numerous legal articles on varied subjects, including constitutional limitations,
Blackstone’s Commentaries, Story’s Commentaries, and torts. His 1888 treatise on
the law of torts included the “right to be let alone.” As Cooley described the right, it
was a right to be free from assault or threats of violence. As he characterized it, “The
right to one’s person may be said to be a right of complete immunity: to be let alone.”
Brandeis and Warren modified that “right” to accomplish their own purposes.
According to popular legend, Warren was appalled by newspaper reports about his
daughter’s wedding. Although this story is refuted by some scholars, it is clear that
Brandeis and Warren felt that individuals should be free from fear that newspapers
would scrutinize their private lives and publish details that constituted little more
than idle gossip. They explained, “Instantaneous photographs and newspaper
enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life; and
numerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that ‘what is
whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the house-tops.’” The authors
ranted against the press’s “overstepping . . . the obvious bounds of propriety” in an
effort to satisfy the “prurient taste” of readers.
To explain their proposed cause of action, the authors traced the development of
common law and actions to protect individuals from threats to their bodies as well
as to their reputations, concluding that the time was ripe for the application of those
principles as a remedy for the “evils” of the press. They suggested that the right to
privacy would not proscribe all publications, but rather would protect “those per-

Right to die
\
467
sons with whose affairs the community has not legitimate interest.” They also pro-
posed that all persons should have the right to prevent publication of “matters
which they may properly prefer to keep private.” Their goal was “to protect the pri-
vacy of private life.”
Brandeis and Warren acknowledged that publication of matters of public
record, court actions, and the like would not be covered under their right of pri-
vacy. Their right also would not allow an action for its violation unless there was “a
special damage,” nor would there be any right to claim an invasion of privacy if the
publication was made by or with the consent of the subject of the publication.
When there was an “invasion,” however, truth would provide no defense for the
publisher, nor would the absence of malice. They suggested that remedies for those
wronged should include damages for “injury to feelings,” as well as an injunction
in limited cases.
Today the federal courts, most states, and the District of Columbia recognize a
right of privacy, and the limits of the tort of public disclosure of private facts are
well established: (1) private facts must be publicly disclosed; (2) the “private” facts
must not be matters of which the public has a right to know, and cannot be “news-
worthy,” lest the legal protections come in direct conflict with the freedom of the
press; and (3) the matters made public must violate the public’s sense of decency or
be offensive and objectionable to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities.

Right to die
The right to die is a relatively recent development in society, brought about by
dramatic advances in medical technology beginning in the 1960s. The legal case
that launched the societal discussion involved a 21-year-old woman from New Jer-
sey who collapsed and ended up in a New Jersey hospital emergency room on April
15, 1975. The whole country soon knew her name: Karen Ann Quinlan. Doctors
did not know the cause of Quinlan’s collapse, but she apparently experienced a sig-
nificant period without oxygen before being resuscitated. The technique that the
“rescue squad” used to revive her in her house, called cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion or CPR, had originated a little more than 10 years earlier. In the hospital she
could not breathe on her own, and doctors cut a hole in her throat (a tracheotomy)
and inserted a tube that was connected to another fairly recent invention, a large
respirator that did the breathing for Quinlan.
After Quinlan spent a short period in a coma, her eyes opened. However, doctors
told her family that she had not regained consciousness. They called her condition
“the persistent vegetative state,” a diagnosis named only three years earlier, in
1972, by Drs. Fred Plum and Bryan Jennett in the prestigious medical journal The
Lancet. This condition was the by-product of increasingly sophisticated lifesaving

468

\
techniques at accident sites and better-equipped emergency rooms. Patients who
previously would have died were brought back from the brink of death, but not all
the way back. In the early 1970s doctors were seeing more and more patients in
this condition, necessitating a diagnosis and a name. Quinlan’s parents faced a
question that was new to society: If this medical technology could do no more than
keep Karen Ann Quinlan suspended in a state of permanent unconsciousness,
would it be best to turn off the respirator and allow her to die naturally? Ultimately,
the question came before the New Jersey Supreme Court, which concluded that
Quinlan, though unconscious, retained a right to privacy that allowed her to refuse
unwanted medical treatment. The court stated that her parents could exercise this
right on her behalf. Once the doctors turned off the respirator, however, Quinlan
was able to breathe on her own. She lived, unconscious in a persistent vegetative
state, for 10 more years, succumbing to pneumonia on June 11, 1985.
In the wake of the Quinlan case, the federal government convened the President’s
Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and
Behavioral Research, which issued several reports analyzing the difficult legal and
ethical issues raised by advancing technology, such as those in the circumstance of
Karen Ann Quinlan. The commission issued a separate report on another amazing
topic created by medical technology: the definition of death itself. For most of human
history, a person who was dead, was dead; one’s heart, lungs, and brain all stopped at
roughly the same time. Technology changed that equation, and the President’s Com-
mission wrestled with the question of defining a person as dead by law, even though
that person’s heart and lungs continued to function with the support of technology.
The term “brain death” was born. In addition to the President’s Commission, many
state legislatures, medical and legal groups, and others investigated ways to address
these new issues. Most states passed laws authorizing citizens to complete a docu-
ment called a “living will.” Through such documents, people could attempt to make
their wishes about medical treatment known ahead of time, in case they found them-
selves unable to communicate, like Karen Ann Quinlan.
In 1990 the American public tackled its second national right-to-die situation,
involving a young woman from southern Missouri named Nancy Cruzan. Cruzan
suffered significant oxygen deprivation to the brain because of a car accident on
January 11, 1983. Like Karen Ann Quinlan, she lapsed into the eyes-open uncon-
sciousness of the persistent vegetative state. Unlike Quinlan, however, Nancy Cru-
zan’s parents sought court approval to remove artificial nutrition and hydration, or
a feeding tube, rather than a respirator. Also with Cruzan, the public saw for the
first time still photos and videotape footage of exactly what the persistent vegeta-
tive state looked like (Quinlan’s parents only released her black-and-white high
school yearbook photo). Ultimately, the Cruzan case ended up before the U.S.
Supreme Court. The 1990 decision in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't of
Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), established the constitutional right of all Americans
to refuse unwanted medical treatment. The Court also reasoned that a feeding tube
was medical technology, like a respirator or dialysis, and a device that had taken
the place of a natural function lost due to accident or illness. In the wake of Cruzan,
Congress passed a law called the Patient Self Determination Act, which provides
that all patients entering a hospital in the United States must be counseled about
living wills and other types of health care planning.

In the spring of 2005, the third major right-to-die circumstance came into the
public spotlight, involving a young Florida woman named Terri Schiavo. Like Cru-
zan and Quinlan, Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state, and like Cruzan,
Schiavo’s case involved a feeding tube. Unlike the two earlier cases, however, the
Schiavo case pitted the husband, Michael Schiavo, against Terri Schiavo’s parents,
Bob and Mary Schindler, in a bitter public court battle over her fate. Her husband
sought the removal of her feeding tube, and her parents opposed that effort. Ulti-
mately, the dispute went through a series of trials and appeals over 10 years, with
different interest groups becoming involved on both sides. During this skirmish,
Terri Schiavo’s tube feeding was stopped and restarted twice. The second time, the
tube was reinserted when the Florida legislature passed a law, soon known as
Terri’s Law, which ordered that the tube be reinserted. The court battle continued,
and near the end even the federal government and the president attempted to weigh
in. The courts eventually ruled in favor of the husband, and Terri Schiavo died on
March 31, 2005, 13 days after the removal of her feeding tube.
At the start of the twenty-first century, American society is in many ways only
beginning to tackle the hard questions raised by relentlessly advancing medical
technology. In a little more than 40 years, that technology has moved from the
invention of the respirator to the capability of doctors in New York to perform
surgery on a woman in France using a robot and images transmitted over a cable
at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Changes are coming at a breathtaking pace
to a population that is aging rapidly. The huge demographic bulge consisting of
people popularly known as Baby Boomers is poised to enter “old age.” The U.S.
Census Bureau estimates that the population of those 85 years and older will
more than quadruple between the years 2000 and 2050, from 4 million to 18 mil-
lion. In the year 2000, only Florida had a population at least 17 percent of which
was age 65 or older. By the year 2030, the Census Bureau estimates that 44 states
will look like Florida does now. Hard questions about the goal of medicine and
what rights people have in demanding or refusing medical treatment are only
going to grow more difficult, and more frequent. American society will be debat-
ing and shaping the framework of those rights, including the right to die, for
years to come.

Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
This landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court remains at the center of
national debates over whether terminating pregnancies should be legal. The opin-
ion contains a lengthy survey of the history of abortion, which illustrates that
restrictive criminal abortion laws are relatively modern in origin. In Roe v. Wade,

470
Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
\
the Supreme Court held a woman’s right to an abortion to fall within the right to
privacy and therefore to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution. This right was found to be not absolute, however, and laws regulating
abortion practices could be upheld if they were narrowly tailored to satisfy a com-
pelling state interest. The decision in Roe is significant because it held that a
woman’s right to choose is a fundamental constitutional right of privacy and also
because the decision represents the first steps by the judiciary to determine just
how far this right should extend.
The Texas statutes at issue in the case made it a crime to procure an abortion, or
to attempt one, except for the purpose of saving the life of the mother. Texas first
enacted a criminal abortion statute in 1854. “Jane Roe,” a single woman residing in
Dallas County, brought this cause of action in March 1970 against the district attor-
ney of the county. The case requested a declaratory judgment that the Texas crimi-
nal abortion statutes were unconstitutional and that the state should be restrained
from enforcing statutes that criminalize abortion.
In her initial federal action, “Jane Roe” alleged that she was unmarried and
pregnant and that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion performed
by a licensed physician. Since her life was not threatened, she was unable to get a
legal abortion in Texas, and she could not afford to travel outside the state to have
the procedure. She claimed that the Texas statutes were unconstitutionally vague
and that they abridged her right of personal privacy as protected by various U.S.
constitutional amendments. After the initial case was filed, the suit was expanded
to include several other parties, such as James Hubert Hallford, a physician who
had been arrested for violations of the Texas abortion statutes, and “John and May
Doe,” a married couple whose doctor had advised them against pregnancy. Finding
that the other parties were not appropriate plaintiffs in the litigation, the Supreme
Court decided the case based solely on the complaint brought by “Jane Roe.”
The central issue decided in Roe v. Wade was whether the Texas statutes that
criminalized abortion, except in instances where the mother’s life was threatened,
improperly invaded a women’s right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. The
first question the Court addressed was whether there exists a private right to an
abortion guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. While the Constitution does not
explicitly mention any right of privacy, in decisions dating as far back as 1891
the Supreme Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee
of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist pursuant to the several constitu-
tional amendments.
The decision in Roe found that while the roots of the  privacy rights at issue in
the case were contained in several constitutional amendments, they lay chiefly in
the Fourteenth Amendment and the guarantee that no state shall deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Due Process Clause,
which was adopted in 1868, is said to guarantee both procedural rights, such as
basic due process of the law, and also more substantive rights, such as those hold-
ing that a person's life, liberty, and property cannot be subject to state regulation
without an appropriate compelling state interest to justify the limitation. In addi-
tion, the Court held that only personal rights that can be deemed fundamental, or
“implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” should be properly included in the con-
stitutional guarantee of personal privacy.

Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
\
471
In prior cases, the right to privacy had been extended to activities relating to
marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and
education. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court explained that the concept of pri-
vacy guaranteed in the Constitution was broad enough to encompass a woman’s
decision concerning whether to terminate her pregnancy. Specifically, the Court
found that state criminal abortion statutes like those promulgated in Texas, which
exempted from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother
without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests
involved, violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since
the right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy was part of the liberty guar-
anteed in the amendment, the right could not be limited or restricted without due
process of law.
Although the Roe Court did not explain the value of a right to privacy, the opin-
ion goes into some detail concerning the consequences of statutes that criminalize
abortion. The detriment that the state would impose upon the pregnant woman by
denying this choice altogether was apparent to the Court, and the decision cites the
specific and direct harm of denying this right. This discussion is important to the
decision in Roe because it holds that all factors—medical, psychological, eco-
nomic, and otherwise—were to be weighed by the woman privately or with her
physician during consultation, and not based on broad state interests.
An important element in the decision that a woman’s right to choose whether to
terminate her pregnancy is part of a fundamental right of privacy based on consti-
tutional protections was the Court’s holding that the unborn do not possess the
rights of a person guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, and particularly those rights
guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The Roe Court
surveyed a broad sweep of previous laws and decisions that had been reluctant to
endorse any theory that life begins before birth. Most legal rights, including those
relating to inheritance or other devolution of property, have generally been contin-
gent on being born. Similarly, in the case at issue, the fundamental guarantee to pri-
vacy takes supremacy over life not yet realized. This part of the opinion, and
precisely when life begins, remains central to debates today concerning a whole
range of privacy issues.
With the centrality of privacy guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment deter-
mined, the second question the Court answered was whether the woman’s right is
absolute such that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in
whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. On this point, the Court
diverged from “Jane Roe” and held that a right of privacy must also acknowledge
that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. While the
state may generally regulate activities through legislation and other enactments,
when a fundamental constitutional right is at issue, only regulation that is neces-
sary to a compelling state interest will be upheld. On this issue, the Court held that
the privacy right involved in whether to terminate a pregnancy cannot be said to be
absolute and must be subject to some limitations. For example, the state may prop-
erly assert an interest in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and
in protecting potential life; and in the case at issue, there will be some point in a
pregnancy where these respective interests will become sufficiently compelling to
sustain regulation of some factors that govern the abortion decision.

472
Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
\
With respect to state limitations governing the right to privacy in the termination
of a pregnancy, following Roe, any such regulations must be supported by a com-
pelling state interest and must also be narrowly drawn to express only the legiti-
mate state interests at stake in regulating the activity. The Court found two state
interests that could properly limit the woman’s right to choose whether to terminate
her pregnancy. Protecting life and potential health could not justify broad limita-
tions without more narrowly tailored state interests. According to the Roe Court, it
is reasonable and appropriate for a state to determine at some point that another
interest—for example, the health of the mother or that of the potential human
life—becomes significantly involved and thus appropriately limiting of the
woman's right to privacy.
Rejecting the state of Texas’ argument that life begins at conception, the Court
in deciding Roe blazed a difficult trail in its discussion of when exactly the state
should have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the
health of the pregnant woman and still another important and legitimate interest in
protecting the potentiality of human life. Following the opinion, these interests
were to be understood as separate and distinct, each growing in substantiality as the
woman approaches term, and each with the possibility of becoming “compelling.”
Drawing on modern medical advances and with the expressed need to limit the
circumstances under which the state could invade the woman’s constitutional right
to privacy, the Supreme Court drew several lines limiting the right to choose. The
issue of whether and when the state may regulate this right was laid out by the Roe
Court in three parts. The first holding was that during the first trimester, the abor-
tion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the preg-
nant woman’s attending physician. Second, following the first trimester, the state
may regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal
health. Finally, for the stage of pregnancy subsequent to viability, the state may
regulate or proscribe the procedure except where it is necessary for the preservation
of the life or health of the mother. Importantly, the Roe opinion holds that an excep-
tion should always exist in the law to protect the mother’s life, no matter what stage
the pregnancy is in upon termination.
The Supreme Court’s “trimester” analysis has never been overturned, but in
cases following Roe, the Court seemed to use a reasonableness test to determine the
validity of laws regulating abortion. The requirement that state regulation be both
compelling and narrowly tailored remains the law today. Whether laws regulating a
woman’s right to choose are a reasonable means to protect health or are simply
enacted to deter abortion procedures, and when the state’s interest is compelling
enough to regulate a fundamental constitutional right, are lines of inquiry that have
been central to the Court’s wrestling with one of the most controversial issues in
the United States.

Safe Harbor Principles
The Safe Harbor Principles are a voluntary, self-regulatory, privacy policy
framework for U.S. companies wishing to do business with European Union (EU)
member states. The principles were developed by the International Trade Adminis-
tration of the U.S. Department of Commerce in response to the European Data
Protection Directive, which prohibits the flow of personal data from European
Union member countries to non-EU countries whose data protection measures are
not considered adequate by European Union standards. After two years of negotia-
tions with EU data protection officials, the EU approved the Safe Harbor Princi-
ples, while retaining the right to review its decision at a later time. After receiving
this approval, the principles were implemented in November 2000.
The Safe Harbor Principles are important to the negotiation of privacy policy in
a global arena because they reflect different approaches to privacy protection
between the European Union and the United States. While the EU provides com-
prehensive data protection legislation for all sectors of society in all member states,
the United States has traditionally preferred a mixed approach of limited state and
federal legislation in isolated cases (e.g., the privacy of video rental records) and
industry self-regulation. Of the stakeholders in personal information, the United
States has thus emphasized the rights of businesses to use personal data for busi-
ness purposes and to treat such data as subject to market principles. 
Designed to bridge these differences in approach to privacy protection, the Safe
Harbor Principles protect U.S. companies from interruptions in their data flow
from European Union member countries and from prosecution under European
data protection laws. For this purpose, U.S. businesses wishing to join the Safe
Harbor program self-certify and publicly state their compliance with the Safe Har-
bor Principles annually on the U.S. Department of Commerce website. As a result,
these companies can be subject to prosecution under U.S. laws addressing fraud
and misrepresentation such as the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) if they
fail to follow the principles. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, par-
ticipation in the Safe Harbor Principles provides companies with a number of
benefits, including recognition by all 25 EU member countries as adhering to
adequate privacy practices and the increased likelihood that complaints about
\
\

476
Same-sex marriage
\
privacy violations against the companies by EU citizens will be heard in the United
States and will be subject to U.S. law.
For this purpose, the Safe Harbor Principles provide a compromise between EU
standards for data protection and the U.S. tradition of mixed approaches and busi-
ness self-regulation. Most notably, under the Safe Harbor framework, businesses
must obtain “opt-in” consent from individuals only if sensitive personal data are to
be passed on to a third party or to be used for purposes not specified during data
collection. The principles also allow for less stringent requirements for individuals
to access their personal data to make corrections or deletions, specifying that such
access does not need to be provided if the costs of providing access are “dispropor-
tionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy.” Finally, the Safe Harbor Principles
do not require data protection authorities as recourse mechanisms; rather, they
allow for a range of mechanisms, including voluntary, corporate-sponsored privacy
seal programs such as TRUSTe or BBCOnline.
Nevertheless, the Safe Harbor Principles have received a mix response. Busi-
nesses have sometimes found them onerous and confusing, and have also noted the
cost of maintaining two different sets of privacy practices—one for their European
and one for their North American operations. Accordingly, participation has been
limited. As of October 2005, only 811 businesses were listed on the Safe Harbor
compliance list, a number of whom had not renewed participation and were listed
as “not current.” In contrast, privacy advocacy organizations in the United States,
such as Privacy International, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC),
and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have argued that the principles
do not go far enough to protect the privacy of European citizens and that the princi-
ples, by design, fail to offer any privacy protection to U.S. citizens.

Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966)
On November 12, 1964, Mr. Schmerber and a friend were drinking in a tavern
and bowling alley until around midnight. After deciding to go home, they both got
into Schmerber's automobile. While driving under the influence of alcohol,
Schmerber lost control of his vehicle, skidded across the road, and collided with a

tree. When the ambulance arrived, the paramedics determined that both individuals
had sustained injuries and needed to be taken to the hospital for treatment. It was
apparent that Schmerber had been drinking and was intoxicated at the time of the
accident; consequently, he was arrested and later convicted of violating the Califor-
nia Vehicle Code. In order to secure the evidence needed to prove intoxication, a
police officer had told the overseeing physician to draw blood and conduct a
chemical analysis. Subsequently, the test revealed that Schmerber’s blood alco-
hol level was over the legal limit, and the results of this test were later admitted
into evidence. 
Schmerber objected to evidence revealed by the blood test analysis on the
grounds that it violated his right to silence under the Fifth Amendment. He also
argued that his right to security from an unreasonable search and seizure of his
blood was a violation of his enumerated Fourth Amendment privilege. The trial
court did not believe that drawing blood was a violation of Schmerber’s constitu-
tionally protected rights. When the Supreme Court of the United States heard the
constitutional arguments under a writ of certiorari, they affirmed the trial court's
decision that there was no constitutional violation.
The Fifth Amendment argument was dismissed because the nature of the evi-
dence under its protection must be testimonial or communicative. The privilege to
remain silent when asked to provide information pertaining to one’s guilt is enu-
merated in the Fifth Amendment and is extended only to information that can be
withheld or provided by the choice of that individual. According to the court, a
blood test is no different than a fingerprint or a photograph. The physical nature of
a blood test is not communicated and therefore does not have an ability to remain
silent when used to determine the guilt of an individual. There is no testimony that
is offered by a blood sample beyond the actual physical characteristics of the
blood. The Court reasoned its action to dismiss this argument through a long his-
tory of jurisprudence that had defined the specific limitations of the Fifth Amend-
ment.
The Fourth Amendment argument was likewise rejected by the Supreme Court
on the grounds that the amendment’s purpose is not to protect against all intrusions,
but rather to protect against ones that were unjustifiable or unreasonable under the
circumstances in which they were conducted. In a perfect world, the legality of a
search or seizure of a person or property often hinges upon a court-issued warrant.
However, it is necessary to permit officers of the law to arrest or seize an individual
when it is apparent that the individual is either guilty of or is planning to commit an
illegal act. This probable cause of action justifies society’s intrusion into the Fourth
Amendment protections, and, therefore, a court-issued warrant is not always
required. 
In this case, the officer had probable cause to conduct a lawful arrest without a
warrant because of the combination of the apparent smell of alcohol on Schmerber
as well as his visibly bloodshot and glassy eyes. Even though the arrest was made
lawfully, the search and seizure of the respondent’s blood still became an issue
under the Fourth Amendment. Typically, after the lawful arrest of a suspect, the
courts have held that it is lawful to search and seize any evidence reasonably corre-
sponding to the accused person at the time of arrest. The issue in this case is
whether the circumstances surrounding Schmerber’s arrest had created a reasonable

478
Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966)
\
environment within the legal realm of the Fourth Amendment that would justify
drawing his blood without his consent. Simply because the arrest was lawful did not
necessarily substantiate the intrusion of a needle into Schmerber’s body for the pur-
pose of drawing his blood.
In order to preserve the human dignity and privacy that the Fourth Amendment
seeks to protect, the Court imposed two caveats that must be met before a warrant-
less search and seizure can be justifiable following the arrest of a suspect. First, the
Court required that there must be clear indication that the intrusion will produce the
evidence it seeks to obtain. Second, there must be exigent circumstances to justify
the need to act in order to preserve any evidence that will obviously be lost if the
search or seizure is delayed because of the requirement to get a warrant. Since it is
a fact that blood contains any alcohol that has been consumed by a person and that
the alcohol will dissipate over time, the officer was justified in his action to obtain
the evidence that was certainly in the respondent’s blood. It was certain that the
blood analysis would produce the evidence, and that, if the officer had waited for a
warrant, the evidence would likely have been metabolized out of Schmerber’s sys-
tem. The Court decided that both caveats were satisfied, justifying the deviation
from the Fourth Amendment. 
The invasiveness of the intrusion into Schmerber’s body was weighed against
the specific circumstances surrounding the search and seizure of his blood. The
taking of his blood was done by a physician in a hospital setting and was performed
according to standard medical practices. Since the blood was obtained in a custom-
ary manner, the Court decided that it had been reasonable. Because there was an
exigent need to retrieve the respondent’s blood combined with the certainty of pro-
curing the evidence, the Court decided that the invasiveness of the blood test had
been acceptable, as long as the manner in which the blood had been taken was in
accordance with standard medical practice. Ultimately, the Court ruled that
Schmerber’s Fourth Amendment argument was not applicable to the circumstances
surrounding this case. 
The dissenting opinion of the Court disagreed with the majority’s decision
regarding the Fifth Amendment. The minority suggested that the blood test was of
a testimonial or communicative nature and therefore should be protected under the
Fifth Amendment. Previous cases had held that it was unlawful for the government
to compel individuals to produce papers or documents that could incriminate them.
The dissent illustrated the disparity between the protection of an individual’s
incriminating documents and the refusal to protect an individual from the punctur-
ing of his skin to retrieve his blood in order to secure the same incriminating evi-
dence. The dissent argued this was a strange hierarchy of importance, where the
protection of a person’s blood was less valued than were documents and papers.
The decision in Schmerber v. California was made under the specific circum-
stances that surrounded the search and seizure of Schmerber’s blood. The Court
was clear to point out that it continued to balance human integrity and dignity pro-
tected under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments against the need for society to
obtain evidence and preserve the lawfulness and protection of its citizens. The
decision in this specific case was reached only on the presented facts and did not
create a precedent that would be applicable to all intrusions into a person’s body.

Search warrant
A search warrant is a written order issued by a judge (or other officer of a court)
authorizing a law enforcement or other government official to search a person or
location, usually for illegal material (contraband) or for evidence of a crime. War-
rants may include special criteria, such as “no knock” provisions that allow police
to execute them without warning. Since searches are likely to be intrusive and dis-
ruptive of privacy, the requirement of a search warrant based on probable cause is
one of the most important constitutional safeguards of privacy. Indeed, the Fourth
Amendment’s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures was one of the
provisions of the Bill of Rights that Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas
cited in his majority opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), the
decision that made explicit a constitutional right to privacy. 
Over the years, the meaning of the warrant clause and other aspects of the
Fourth Amendment have been the subject of much interpretation by the courts.
These interpretations have dealt with questions such as what constitutes a search,
what defines an unreasonable search, when searches may be conducted without
warrants, and what satisfies the requirement of probable cause. Interpretation has
usually taken place in a context characterized by tension between impatience with
those portions of the law that constrain the police and a concern that the privacy of
the individual be respected
The constitutional protection of privacy against unreasonable searches and sei-
zures is grounded in the Fourth Amendment, which states that “the right of the peo-
ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated,” and further provides that “no Warrants
shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particu-
larly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.”
The requirement of specificity was especially important to the framers of the Bill
of Rights. The events leading up to the American Revolution had seen widespread
objections to British use of open-ended “general warrants,” both in America where
customs officials used them (in the form of writs of assistance) to search for
unnamed smuggled goods and in Britain where the government had used general

warrants as a means of suppressing opposition journalist John Wilkes. Opposition
to such searches had frequently cited the common law right to be left alone,
another of the legal bases of the right to privacy.
As with the rest of the Bill of Rights, the Fourth Amendment was originally held
to protect Americans from abuse by the federal government but not to apply to the
states. During the course of the twentieth century, most of the protections of the
Bill of Rights were gradually “incorporated” into the Fourteenth Amendment’s
Due Process Clause and held to apply also to the states. The Supreme Court held the
“core” of the Fourth Amendment to be applicable to the states in Wolf v. Colorado
(1948).
A search originally was taken to mean a physical intrusion by an agent of gov-
ernment, particularly into lodging. The definition expanded dramatically during the
last third of the twentieth century. In the case of Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347
(1967), the Supreme Court reversed earlier precedents to include wiretapping of
conversations within the meaning of search, opening up a field in which the courts
would struggle to stay abreast of proliferating eavesdropping technology. Also con-
sidered searches are physical intrusions into the person, such as those necessary to
obtain blood, breath, and DNA samples. However, the action of a police office who
performs a “stop and frisk” or a “pat down” of a person deemed to act in a suspi-
cious manner is not considered an unreasonable search within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment.
One of the difficulties of interpreting the Fourth Amendment is that it has some-
thing of split personality. The first part emphasizes the need to protect the individ-
ual from “unreasonable” searches and seizures, while the second stresses that
warrants should be issued only for probable cause. Some might argue that any
search without a warrant issued for probable cause is unreasonable, but the amend-
ment does not actually say this, and the courts have not interpreted it in this fash-
ion. The courts have long recognized that some types of searches do not require
warrants. The crucial question thus becomes whether those searches are reason-
able. Typically, twentieth-century courts relied on the standard of probable cause
(see below) to define reasonableness. Since the 1980s, though, the standard has
increasingly become whether an action violates the standard of a “reasonable
expectation of privacy.” The phrase first occurred in the aforementioned Katz case
in 1967, where it was used to extend the definition of search to include electronic
eavesdropping. It has since been used more often to narrow the definition of what
might be judged an unreasonable search. In effect, the Court evaluates the balance
between the weight of the government’s interest in the search and the extent to
which the individual’s privacy interest is affected. In general, the courts tend to
look most critically at actions that intrude on the interior of people’s homes, while
showing greater tolerance for government activities elsewhere. A farmer’s fields or
even a fenced backyard, for example, have been held not to be entitled to an expec-
tation of privacy.
There is a long list of exceptions to the rule that searches should be based on
warrants. In daily practice, many more searches are conducted without warrants
than with them. These warrantless searches include (but are not necessarily limited
to) a search incident to an arrest, a search of a motor vehicle, an inventory of the
personal effects of persons who are arrested, a search of abandoned property

(including garbage), evidence in plain view, consensual searches, searches at bor-
ders and airports, and searches in “exigent circumstances” (i.e., those where the
delay in obtaining a warrant would make it impossible to conduct the search). All
of these exceptions have been defined and elaborated by judicial interpretation.
Probable cause is important both to the issuing of search warrants and to the jus-
tifications for warrantless searches. Since many warrants are based on information
supplied by police informants, establishing the credibility of the source of that
information became a major concern. During the 1960s, there was a decided ten-
dency toward tightening requirements for warrants and invoking rules of evidence
similar to those used in trials. Police requesting warrants were expected to make
clear both the circumstances in which the informant was likely to have gained use-
ful information and the officer’s reasons for believing it was true. In 1983, how-
ever, the Supreme Court decided in Illinois v. Gates that a more holistic judgment
of the totality of circumstances was more practical. The Court has also held that
“administrative searches” in workplaces and schools do not have to have warrants
or meet the probable cause standard.
The tension between the needs of government and privacy concerns continues to
provoke controversies. One of the most controversial aspects of the prohibition of
unreasonable searches and seizures has been the exclusionary rule. This excludes
from consideration evidence gathered in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The
exclusionary rule was first adopted by the federal courts in Weeks v. United States,
232 U.S. 383 (1914), and subsequently applied to the states in Mapp v. Ohio
(1961). The Court, however, has allowed some use of unconstitutionally obtained
evidence, for example in challenging the testimony of witnesses.
While most controversies in this area of privacy have grown out of the criminal
justice system, an additional site of controversy has been the area of national secu-
rity, particularly in the area of electronic surveillance. For example, in the after-
math of the September 11, 2001, attacks, President George W. Bush ordered
intercepts of telephone conversations of American citizens with foreigners sus-
pected of terrorist connections on his authority as commander in chief. Not only
did this involve the National Security Agency in spying on American citizens, but
it also bypassed the procedure set up by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
of 1978 (FISA) for seeking warrants for national security wiretaps. In such cases,
the government argued that national security requirements outweighed the privacy
interests of individuals.
Search warrants are only intended to protect individual privacy from abuse by
public authorities. Employers, for example, have broad powers to search in the
workplace or to make drug testing a condition of employment.

Secrecy
Secrecy is the concealment of that which, if known, would bring negative conse-
quences; privacy is the concealment of that which is positive or intimate. Secrecy
has negative connotations, irrespective of the content of the secret, while privacy,
irrespective of what goes on in private, has positive ones. In American society,
secrecy is the provenance of at least six social groups: the government, the work-
place, the stigmatized, the institutionalized, the young and old, and those engaged
in secret societies or rituals.
Governmental secrecy has been studied extensively by social scientists.
Although openness has supposedly been one of the hallmarks of American democ-
racy in its judicial, executive, and legislative branches, there have always been
areas where that light has been darkened: secret “security risk” lists kept by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), secret surveillance of right- or left-wing
threats to national security or safety, secret meetings of local government agencies,
and the like. Although nations may be wary of internal secrecy, governments jus-
tify it to varying degrees and under various circumstances. Governmental secrecy
is also commonplace in international relations, including wars, where nations
attempt to keep secret from other nations everything from the details of satellite
surveillance to the number of spies on foreign territory. International secrecy, espe-
cially in wartime, is generally more palatable to populations than is internal
secrecy.
Both public- and private-sector workplaces may have secrets, either from out-
siders or from their own employees. Industrial secrets protect new pharmaceutical
discoveries or automobile designs from industrial espionage or “poaching” by
other companies. The protection of workplace secrets is one reason given by
employers for overt or secret surveillance of their employees; other reasons include
social control related to inventory protection or how time is spent on the job. Work-
place surveillance is controversial in itself, but even more so when the surveillance
is secret; indeed, the workplace, like government, epitomizes the ethical and legal
conflicts over the right to individual privacy vs. collective or corporate protection.
Secrecy has historically been the provenance of the stigmatized or misbehaving:
gays and lesbians, former mental patients, ex-convicts, philandering spouses. The
stigmatized conceal identities, past histories, or present activities for many reasons:
the homosexual or philanderer may fear losing his or her spouse and children, the
ex-convict may fear being denied employment, the drug user may fear losing his or
her job. Private investigators may be hired to penetrate these individual secrecies. 
Both individual and more collective types of secrecy are found among institution-
alized populations such as mental patients and prisoners, who are not entitled to
many resources or to much, if any, privacy. Inmates or patients are forbidden to
engage in certain activities—for example, sexual acts with others—and are deprived
of certain goods-generally alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. They are also limited in the
amount of legitimate goods and services they may acquire, from food to haircuts.

Secrecy
\
483
Therefore, forbidden and limited activities, goods, and services are engaged in and
acquired in secret, often resulting in entire secret institutional economies.
In American society, the old and the young are protected by law from behaviors
and relationships that are permitted to adults but forbidden to the young or old.
These behaviors are culturally defined either as valuable or as tolerable for
adults—marital sexuality, responsible drinking, access to pornography—but as
negative and damaging when engaged in by minors or the elderly. Sexual activity is
forbidden by law to unmarried minors, and sometimes to the institutionalized eld-
erly. Preadolescents and adolescents are not permitted to partake of certain adult
privileges and substances, from having sex to driving automobiles to cigarette
smoking, and when they do these things, they do them in secret. Age-related and
institution-related secrecy are similar in that concealment is resorted to when the
privacies and privileges permitted to adults are denied or taken away.
As noted above, what is common to these several arenas of secrecy is the con-
cealment of what the audience—not necessarily the secret-bearer—might define as
negative: a secret government decision, the stigma of homosexuality, staff finding
cigarettes in a mental patient's room, or a parent finding out that a teenager has
been drinking. Those who keep secrets, however, may or may not share the audi-
ence's negative view of what they are concealing: the secretly gay person who
scorns heterosexuals, the teenager who likes to drink, the mental patient who wants
a cigarette. It is only in the arena of governmental secrecy that both the audience
and the secret-keepers are likely to view what is concealed as negative: for exam-
ple, the threat of a potential terrorist attack on Los Angeles.
Another arena of secrecy in America includes the secret society, code, and/or rit-
ual. Both children and adults may engage in temporary or more enduring secret
activities or societies, from secret handshakes or phrases to rituals and spaces, to
which only the secret-sharers have access. The existence of secret societies may be
known about, but not their membership or location; indeed, efforts may be made by
governments or religious bodies threatened by secret societies to acquire lists of
members in order to stamp them out. Since secrecy itself is negative (although,
again, the content of the secret will likely seem positive to its keepers), secret
codes, rituals, or societies are generally suspect. The secrecy inherent in secret
societies intersects with privacy at the point where the individual’s privacy is vio-
lated in order to determine whether she or he is a member of such a society. Such
investigative tactics have been used by governments and religious bodies in cases
of illicit or illegal secret societies. 
As the above examples illustrate, secrecy and privacy have a number of similari-
ties and differences. Like secrecy, privacy is a concealment strategy, but what is
being concealed may be positive (to the self and to audience) rather than negative.
Marital sexual relations, a handwritten diary, or the hard drive of a computer, are
among the positive cultural values protected by privacy. Conversely, illegal sexual
activities, a handwritten diary detailing armed robberies, or pedophiliac pornogra-
phy must be concealed as secrets. 
Privacy also conceals necessary intimacies; paramount among these are the
washing and toileting functions of private parts. The necessary intimacy of private
parts and their handling is common to all members of society, thus there is no

484
Secrecy
\
secrecy equivalent as such. In the arena of necessary intimacies, privacy is enforced
by laws forbidding public defecation, urination, or sexual intercourse.
The relationship between privacy and secrecy is structured by economic and
power relations: the more privacy entitlement or acquisition that a social group,
family, or individual has, the less secrecy seeking is necessary. The more upper-
class and wealthy the family or (non-stigmatized) individual is, the more that family
or person can acquire spaces and times for privacy; conversely, there is little privacy
for lower-class individuals crowded into tenements. The staff and administrators of
an institution can escape from its walls into their private homes, whereas the
inmates cannot. 
This is not to say that social status, wealth, and power always confer privacy and
obviate the need for secrecy. Although the right to privacy is clustered at the top of a
hierarchy and the resort to privacy resides at the bottom, this relationship may be
inverted in some contexts. A politician who smokes may keep this fact secret from
his constituency, while the politician’s office janitor would not bother. The janitor is
likely to be able to protect his or her privacy from the media more effectively than can
the politician-although the politician’s household may afford more privacy.
Secrecy and privacy are also social definitions subject to negotiation and conflict,
in political/religious, family, and institutional contexts. For example, the Church of
Scientology, variously regarded as a religion, cult, sect, or illegal organization, has
been accused by various governments of posing a danger to citizens. Attempts to sub-
poena “secret” documents have been met with attempts to redefine such documents
as private “religious, sacred knowledge” protected by the First Amendment. Power
relations in a given society determine the success or failure of these tactics.
Power relations are also relevant to the conflict of definitions in families and in
institutions. In a family vignette, a teenage girl is talking on the phone and her
mother comes into the room. The teen turns her head down and starts mumbling
into the phone. Her mother says, “Oh, don't be so secretive,” and the teen responds,
“I just want some privacy!” This scene could be repeated in other places where
authorities and subordinates coexist, such as between the staff and patients in a
mental hospital or between the teachers and pupils in a boarding school. What the
miscreant defines as privacy and its entitlements the authority defines as secrecy
and its illicit concealments.
While privacy is vulnerable to invasion, secrecy is vulnerable to revelation: pri-
vacy’s invasion is by the public or the unwanted; secrecy’s revelation may be by
anyone. The best-kept secret is an unshared one: a person with secret homosexual
desires who does not share them with anybody (and thus, of course, cannot fulfill
them). The truth is, the more people who share a secret, the more the possibility of
its violation.
There is secrecy and there is privacy; there is a secret but no equivalent such as “a
private”—the closest our language comes to that is private parts. The term “private
parts” conjures up the origins of privacy in the body, extending over the centuries to a
plethora of extra-bodily rights. Privacy is essentially individual, at most dyadic.
Secrecy may be individual—the unshared secret—but it is also collective. The socio-
logical essence of the relationship between privacy and secrecy lies in this: the bal-
ance of power, rights, and responsibilities between the individual and the collective.

Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a handshake protocol that enables secure commu-
nication between two programs or machines. It is used primarily to secure Internet
transmissions. SSL protects data that are in transit from eavesdroppers and other
active attackers on the network. The first version of SSL was designed in 1994 by a
group of engineers at Netscape Communications, and since then, the protocol has
undergone several revisions and modifications, culminating in its adoption as the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) standard by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) in 1999. 
SSL provides generic security features for the communication channel on top of
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Therefore, any protocol that can be carried
over TCP, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Pro-
tocol) can be secured using the SSL protocol. In order to enable secure communi-
cation, SSL provides data confidentiality by encrypting the data that are being
transferred between two communicating machines. Encrypting the data being sent
on the wire renders that data unintelligible to third-party attackers. Thus, SSL has
made it safe for users to send their credit card numbers, passwords, and other con-
fidential information to authorized remote servers. Another important security fea-
ture provided by SSL is server authentication. Server authentication makes it
possible for a client machine to corroborate the identity of a remote server before it
reveals or sends sensitive information such as password or credit card information
to the remote server. Thus the client machine or, more specifically, the web browser
acting on behalf of the client machine can be sure that the sensitive information is
revealed only to intended servers. Although it is not strictly required for the server
to carry out client authentication, since the password or the credit card information
provides inherent proof of the client’s identity to the server, the SSL protocol does
support client authentication as well. Authentication in SSL is carried out using a
certificate-based mechanism. The client machine verifies the X.509 public-key cer-
tificate of the server in order to corroborate its identity. Further, SSL also provides
data integrity by making use of message authentication codes. Thus, it is possible
to detect any unauthorized attempts to tamper with the data.
The SSL handshake protocol consists of two phases. The first phase involves
server authentication. During this phase, the server sends its certificate in response
to a client’s connection request. The client generates a random master key, encrypts
the master key with the server’s public key, and then transmits the encrypted master
key to the server. The server recovers the master key and authenticates itself to the

486
Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)
\
client using this master key. Subsequent communication is encrypted and authenti-
cated with keys derived from this master key. In the optional second phase, the
server sends a challenge to the client. Upon receiving the challenge, the client
authenticates itself to the server by generating a digital signature on the challenge
and returning the signed challenge along with its public-key certificate. Upon suc-
cessful authentication, the server and client can communicate securely using the
shared keys.

Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)
Charles Sell, once a practicing dentist, had a long history of mental illness. In
September 1982, after telling doctors that the gold he used for fillings had been
contaminated by Communists, Sell was hospitalized, treated with antipsychotic
medication, and subsequently discharged. In June 1984, Sell called the police to
say that a leopard was outside his office boarding a bus, and he then asked the
police to shoot the leopard. Sell was again hospitalized and subsequently released.
On various occasions he complained that public officials were trying to kill him. In
April 1997 he told law enforcement personnel that he “spoke to God last night,”
and that “God told me every [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)] person I
kill, a soul will be saved.”
In 1997 the federal government charged Charles Sell with submitting fictitious
insurance claims for payment. A federal magistrate, after ordering a psychiatric
examination, found Sell “currently competent” but noted that Sell might experi-
ence “a psychotic episode” in the future. The magistrate released Sell on bail. A
grand jury later produced a superseding indictment charging Sell and his wife
with 56 counts of mail fraud, 6 counts of Medicaid fraud, and 1 count of money
laundering.
In early 1998 the government claimed that Sell had sought to intimidate a wit-
ness. The magistrate held a bail revocation hearing. Sell’s behavior at his initial
appearance was, in the judge's words, “totally out of control,” involving “screaming
and shouting,” the use of “personal insults” and “racial epithets,” and spitting “in
the judge’s face.” A psychiatrist reported that Sell could not sleep because he
expected the FBI to come busting through the door. The judge then revoked Sell’s
bail.
In April 1998 a grand jury issued a new indictment charging Sell with
attempting to murder the FBI agent who had arrested him and a former
employee who planned to testify against him in the fraud case. The attempted
murder and fraud cases were joined for trial. In early 1999 Sell asked the magis-
trate to reconsider his competence to stand trial. The magistrate sent Sell to the
United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri, for

Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)
\
487
examination. Subsequently the magistrate found that Sell was “mentally incom-
petent to stand trial.” He ordered Sell to be hospitalized for treatment at the
medical center for up to four months, to determine whether there was a substan-
tial probability the Sell would attain the capacity to allow his trial to proceed.
Two months later, medical center staff recommended that Sell take antipsychotic
medication. Sell refused to do so, and the staff sought permission to administer the
medication against Sell’s will. One new incident that was introduced at the next
trial was that Sell had approached one of the medical center’s nurses, suggested
that he was in love with her, criticized her for having nothing to do with him, and,
when told that his behavior was inappropriate, added that he couldn’t help it. The
medical center doctors testified that, given Sell’s prior behavior, diagnosis, and cur-
rent beliefs, boundary-breaching incidents of this sort were not harmless and, when
coupled with Sell’s inability or unwillingness to desist, indicated that he was a
safety risk even within the institution. They even had him moved to a locked cell.
The magistrate authorized forced administration of antipsychotic drugs. In
affirming that decision, the district court concluded that medication was the only
viable way of rendering Sell competent to stand trial and was necessary to serve the
federal government's interest in determining his guilt or innocence on the fraud
charges. The court of appeals also affirmed the earlier decisions. On the fraud
charges, the appellate court found that the federal government had an essential
interest in bringing Sell to trial, that the treatment was medically appropriate, and
that the medical evidence indicated that Sell would be able to participate fairly in
his trial.
The privacy question involved was as follows: may the federal government
administer antipsychotic drugs involuntarily to a mentally ill criminal defendant in
order to render that defendant competent to stand trial for a serious, but nonviolent,
crimes? Justice Stephen G. Breyer delivered the opinion for the Supreme Court.
The Court held that the Constitution allows the federal government to administer
antipsychotic drugs, even against the defendant’s will, in limited circumstances.
The Court reasoned that such conditions include if the treatment is medically
appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the
trial’s fairness, and taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary signif-
icantly to further important governmental trial-related interests. After determining
that the district court and appeals court findings did not satisfy these conditions, the
Court vacated the appellate court’s judgment. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by
Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, arguing that the Court did not have jurisdic-
tion to decide the case.

Senate Select Committee
\
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to 
Intelligence Activities
In the mid-1970s, this committee, chaired by Frank Church (D-ID), was orga-
nized to investigate illegal governmental spying and surveillance activity in the
wake of the Watergate break-in by members of Richard Nixon’s reelection cam-
paign. “The Church Committee,” as it became known, took public and private testi-
mony from hundreds of people and collected huge volumes of files from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
the National Security Agency, and the Interval Revenue Service (IRS), as well
as many other federal agencies during testimony in 1974–1975. This information
gathering culminated in 14 reports completed in 1975 and 1976, which remain the
most extensive review of governmental intelligence activities to date. Recommen-
dations from the committee for reform of intelligence activities were debated in
Congress and in some cases were carried out. 
The interim report documents the Church Committee’s findings on United
States involvement in attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, particularly Fidel
Castro of Cuba, Patrice Lumumba of the Congo, and Ngo Din Diem of South Viet-
nam. Although the CIA did not succeed in assassinating these foreign leaders, the
agency provided arms to insurgents and spent millions of dollars in public propa-
ganda, attempted to influence democratic elections (as in the case of Allende in
Chile), and funded opposition political campaigns. Based on the recommendations
in this report, President Gerald Ford issued an executive order (11905) to ban U.S.-
sanctioned assassinations of foreign leaders, which was subsequently replaced in
1981 by President Reagan’s Executive Order 12333.
The remaining reports include seven volumes of public hearing records and
exhibits, and six books that document the committee’s writings on the various top-
ics investigated. In regard to privacy, Book II, titled Intelligence Activities and the
Rights of Americans, details the abuses of domestic intelligence agencies. The con-
clusion states, “Domestic intelligence activity has threatened and undermined the
constitutional rights of Americans to free speech, association and privacy. It has
done so primarily because the constitutional system for checking abuse of power
has not been applied.”
The committee found that the government had collected huge amounts of infor-
mation about the lives of private citizens, including political beliefs and personal
associations, through the use of illegal or uncontrolled intrusive techniques, includ-
ing theft and electronic surveillance. Included in these activities were a CIA pro-
gram to open mail to or from selected American citizens that led to 1.5 million
names being stored in the Agency’s computer database; efforts by intelligence
units within the FBI that created files on over one million Americans; burglaries
carried out by intelligence agencies in the homes and offices of suspected “subver-
sives;” and, actions by intelligence agency agents to infiltrate religious, media, and
academic organizations. 
The report charged that the checks and balances that protected privacy had been
compromised by three main departures from the constitutional plan for controlling
the abuse of power: excessive executive power, excessive secrecy, and avoidance of
the rule of law. The document produced three recommendations to protect privacy
in the wake of these abuses of power. First, all governmental action that directly

Sense-enhancing technologies
\

infringes on First Amendment rights must be prohibited. Second, any governmen-
tal action that has an indirect impact upon the rights of speech and assembly is per-
missible only if it is undertaken to fulfill a compelling governmental need, and the
government must use the least restrictive means to meet that need. Third, proce-
dural safeguards should be adopted along with substantive restraints, such as that
of obtaining a judicial warrant from a neutral magistrate once probable cause has
been determined.

Sense-enhancing technologies
The term “sense-enhancing technologies” refers to all types of equipment or
machines that increase the perceptual ability of the user. In practical terms, this
means a device that allows the user to see or hear things that could not be detected
by the use of the normal human eyes or ears: for example, infrared goggles, para-
bolic microphones, or thermal sensors. This entry will survey the different types
of sense-enhancing technologies and provide an overview of the law governing
their use.
Sense-enhancing technologies have been around for centuries. The first and
most basic example of a sense-enhancing technology is artificial illumination, such
as a torch or, in more modern usage, a flashlight. Another example is a visual mag-
nifier, such as a telescope or binoculars, which have been used for centuries by sci-
entists, law enforcement officers, and lay people in order to see things that would
otherwise be undetectable by the naked eye. Hearing-enhancing devices can be
traced back almost 200 years to devices like the stethoscope, used originally by
doctors but also adapted for use by individuals conducting surveillance through
walls.
As the twentieth century progressed, however, sense-enhancing devices became
more powerful and more potentially intrusive in two ways. First, the potential mag-
nitude of amplification increased dramatically: modern-day binoculars can mag-
nify an image between 30 and 80 times its actual size, while an individual can use a
parabolic microphone to listen in on a conversations over 400 feet away. Second,
and more significantly, new devices have been created that can detect inputs that
are beyond our five senses, such as x-ray devices, infrared light, and radiation.
Sometimes termed “sense-replacing devices” rather than sense-enhancing devices,
these surveillance tools have become ubiquitous in our society: metal detectors
(which detect disturbances in a magnetic field) are a standard fixture in airports or
any other “secure” location, while night-vision goggles and thermal imagers
(which detect infrared light waves) are readily available on the open market and
frequently used by law enforcement and military personnel. Other forms of sense-
replacing devices, such as x-ray machines, are less widespread but commonplace in
specific fields such as medicine. And still others have been used almost exclusively
by law enforcement to great effect. Radar guns have been used by police for over

490
Sense-enhancing technologies
\
50 years to detect the speed of passing cars; today there are over 125,000 radar
guns in this country, and an average motorist can expect to be monitored by a radar
gun over 1000 times in his or her lifetime. Similarly, law enforcement officers use
thousands of trained dogs throughout the country to detect the smell of narcotics or
explosives; although technically these animals are not a type of “technology,” they
are tools used to detect otherwise imperceptible sensory inputs during a search of
an individual or an automobile. Finally, law enforcement officials are developing
newer sense-enhancing (or sense-replacing) technology: handheld gun detectors
are able to provide police officers with the shape and location of metal objects con-
cealed on a person, while ion scans can be used on tables or the interior of automo-
biles to determine whether narcotics or explosives have recently been in contact
with the surface.
The proliferation and increased effectiveness of sense-enhancing technologies
have given rise to significant legal questions about whether and how to regulate
them. As noted above, sense-enhancing technologies come in many different forms
and can be used in many different ways, from everyday uses of commonplace items
(such as pointing a flashlight down a dark alley) to specialized uses of more sophis-
ticated devices (such as calculating the speed of cars with radar guns) to surveil-
lance that intrudes quite dramatically into an individual’s privacy (such as detecting
what a person is carrying under his or her clothes, or monitoring activities might be
occurring inside the house). Legal regulation of these devices falls under two cate-
gories: first, the restrictions placed on law enforcement officials using these
devices to investigate crime; and second, the restrictions placed on citizens using
the devices for their own private purposes.
In the context of law enforcement, the primary question is a constitutional
one: under what conditions (if any) is a government agent required to procure a
search warrant before using sense-enhancing technology to conduct surveil-
lance? Under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, a law enforcement
officer is generally required to obtain a search warrant before conducting an
intrusive search; in order to obtain such a warrant, the officer must prove to a
magistrate that there is probable cause to believe that a suspect is engaged in ille-
gal activity. If the magistrate agrees and issues the warrant, the officer can search
the suspect, or the suspect’s home, automobile, or office, in almost any manner
the officer wishes. 
In the early stages of an investigation, a law enforcement officer might not yet
have probable cause and therefore would not be able to obtain a warrant. Thus,
many types of surveillance (with or without sense-enhancing technology) must
be conducted without warrants, and courts strictly regulate what types of war-
rantless surveillance are permitted. For example, police officers can stake out a
house and observe who enters and leaves, but they cannot enter the house without
consent and search for contraband. Emerging technologies create a new spin on
the old legal question: is a law enforcement officer allowed to conduct warrant-
less surveillance using sense-enhancing technology, and if so, what types of tech-
nology are permissible?
The Supreme Court addressed this question in the  landmark case of Katz v.
United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). In Katz law enforcement officers placed an
electronic listening device on the outside of a public phone booth and eavesdropped

\
491
on the defendant’s conversation. The defendant claimed that this surveillance method
violated his Fourth Amendment rights, and the Supreme Court agreed. In the words
of Justice Harlan, the electronic listening device violated the defendant’s “reason-
able expectation of privacy,” and therefore law enforcement officers were not
allowed to use such devices unless they first obtained a search warrant from a court. 
The reasonable expectation of privacy test became the standard for evaluating the
legality of sense-enhancing devices for the next 30 years. In evaluating whether or
not a certain new technology violated this standard, courts would consider not only
the type of technology at issue, but also the way in which it was used. For example,
the Supreme Court held that using a homing device to track the movements of sus-
pected criminals was legal if it merely reported the suspects’ travels over public high-
ways, but using the same device to track their movements inside a private home
violated the Fourth Amendment. Similarly, using a flashlight to examine a public
area, a private open field, or even the interior of a car is permissible because such
actions do not violate an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy.
In 2001 the Supreme Court clarified the reasonable expectation of privacy test in
the case of United States v. Kyllo, 533 U.S. 27 (2001). In Kyllo, government agents
suspected the defendant was using high-intensity heat lamps to grow marijuana in
his home. To confirm their suspicion, they conducted a scan of the house using a
thermal imager, a device that detects infrared radiation. The heat patterns detected
by the imager provided further evidence that the defendant was using heat lamps,
and the agents used that information to acquire a search warrant. As in Katz, the
Supreme Court held that the warrantless use of this sense-enhancing technology
violated the Fourth Amendment, since the suspect had a reasonable expectation of
privacy regarding the contents of his home. In so doing, however, the Court defined
two different contexts in which the government’s use of a sense-enhancing technol-
ogy would not violate an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy and there-
fore could be permitted.
First, if the specific use of the technology only detected information that could
otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a private area, the sur-
veillance was permissible, regardless of the type of technology used. In other
words, if a law enforcement officer used a high-powered parabolic microphone to
eavesdrop on a conversation that occurred in a public restaurant, the surveillance
would be permissible. The information that the officer received from listening in on
the conversation could have been acquired by other means without intruding into a
private area (for example, law enforcement officers could place an undercover
officer at the table next to the suspects to eavesdrop the old-fashioned way). Like-
wise, law enforcement officers would be permitted to use extremely high-powered
binoculars to observe a suspected drug transaction in a park or on a street corner,
since the suspects would be conducting their business in a public place and the
activity could have been observed by any individual who was walking nearby. In
other words, if the use of the technology merely allows law enforcement officers to
more easily or more safely observe or detect things that they could have detected
through more conventional means, the surveillance does not violate the Fourth
Amendment. To put it another way, if the suspects are in a public place, they do not
have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding anything they say or do, even if
law enforcement officers use the newest technology to spy on them.

492
Sense-enhancing technologies
\
Even if the surveillance does result in information that could not possibly have
been obtained without physical intrusion into a private area, the government
agents’ actions might still be legal. This is because of the second scenario set out
by the Court: if the law enforcement officers are using a technology which is in
“general public use,” they need not seek a warrant before conducting the surveil-
lance. The term “general public use” was not defined in the opinion, and it will
surely be the source of future litigation, but the general outlines were clear enough:
devices such as flashlights and binoculars that are routinely used by the general
public are in general public use, while newer, rarer technologies (such as gun
detectors, which can see through a person’s clothing) are not. For example, assume
law enforcement officers used a flashlight to look down a private driveway at night
and saw two individuals conducting a drug transaction. Without the sense-enhanc-
ing technology of the flashlight, the officers could never have perceived the illegal
activity unless they had entered the private property. But because flashlights are in
general public use, the individuals in the driveway did not have a reasonable expec-
tation of privacy regarding their actions. On the other hand, if the officers used a
sophisticated, portable x-ray machine to see through the walls of a house, or a par-
abolic microphone to eavesdrop on the conversations inside a house, they would be
using technology that is not in general public use to detect information that they
could not possibly have acquired without a physical intrusion into the private
house—and therefore that surveillance would be barred by the Fourth Amendment.
This is exactly what happened in the Kyllo case itself: the Court decided that the
thermal imager was not in general public use, and so it could not be used to gather
information about what was going on inside the defendant’s private residence.
Although some justices pointed out that the thermal imager used in Kyllo was
widely available on the open market, with over 10,000 units already sold, a major-
ity of the court held that such devices were not in fact in general public use—and
probably because they were not yet in such widespread use that their ubiquity
would change people’s reasonable expectation of privacy. If in the future, if every-
one owned a thermal imager and they were routinely used by individuals (as flash-
lights and binoculars are today), then law enforcement officers could begin to use
them with impunity, since in such a world the suspects they would be watching
would have no objective reason to believe that the heat emanating from their homes
or bodies is private information.
Compared to the well-developed (and well-litigated) standards governing the use
of sense-enhancing devices by law enforcement officials, the laws regulating civilian
use of those devices are relatively scarce and undefined. Every state has a common
law right (that is, a right developed in the courts, not by statute) that protects individ-
uals’ privacy, but most of the torts that are connected with that right involve the
defendant giving publicity to the private facts in some way. The only applicable
restriction in most jurisdictions is the common law tort of intrusion, which generally
bars “invasive conduct which is highly offensive to a reasonable person.” Thus, a
civilian who uses sense-enhancing technology in a way that is invasive and highly
offensive would be liable for monetary damages in a civil suit to the person upon
whom he or she was spying. At least one state has enacted a statute to deal with the
specific problem of sense-enhancing technology: California bars any attempt to
observe or detect “personal or familial” activities using a “visual or auditory enhanc-

493
ing device” (Cal. Civ. Code §1708.8(b) (2001)). As with the common law restriction,
violation of this law merely subjects the defendant to civil, not criminal liability. The
standard used by the California legislature for civilian misuse of these technologies
closely mirrors the standard used by the Supreme Court for law enforcement offi-
cials: the use of the technology has to violate a reasonable expectation of privacy, and
the information gathered must be of the type that could not otherwise have been gath-
ered without physical intrusion onto private property.

Sex offender registries
Sex offender registries (SORs) are databases of information about persons con-
victed of sex offenses who have completed their sentences or received probations
and now reside in the community. SORs are primarily intended to help law
enforcement agencies monitor the whereabouts of known sex offenders, thereby
preventing crime as well as providing a pool of suspects for police when a sex
crime is reported. Depending on the jurisdiction, access to SORs may be restricted
to criminal justice officials or made available, via formal community notification
systems (CNSs), to community organizations and the general public to assist in the
managing of risk to children and other vulnerable persons. SORS and CNSs are
predicated on the notion that sex offenders, more than other kinds of offenders,
have an enduring disposition to offend and should, therefore, have stringent restric-
tions placed on their rights to privacy and freedom of movement. SORs and CNSs
reflect intense public concern about the risk of serious harm posed by sex offend-
ers, particularly to the most vulnerable persons in society, such as women and
children. These concerns also create strong pressure on politicians of all stripes to
respond accordingly to public demands for action.
In 1990, the state of Washington passed its Community Protection Act in
response to strong media and public reaction to a repeat child sex offender's brutal
rape and mutilation of a seven-year-old boy. The SOR component of this legisla-
tion requires all convicted sex offenders to register with the police upon release
from prison; the CNS component requires dissemination of information about reg-
istered sex offenders to community organizations and the general public. Who spe-
cifically receives information depends on a three-tier system of assessing the
degree of risk (high, moderate, and low) posed by individual offenders. 

494
Sex offender registries
\
Other states soon followed Washington’s lead. Some states adopted Washing-
ton’s systems of tiers of risk; other states treated all sex offenders as a single, high-
risk class. Of note is that legislation creating SORs and CNSs took on the names of
those child victims that advocates used to mobilize public reaction and governmen-
tal response. New Jersey’s Megan’s Law was triggered by the rape and murder of a
7-year-old girl named Megan Kanka. Indiana’s Zachary’s Law, named after a 10-
year-old boy murdered by a child molester, established the first SOR that could be
accessed by the public via the Internet. Currently over 30 states permit similar
online access to SORs.
In 1994, President Bill Clinton sponsored the Jacob Wetterling Act, which
required all states to set up SORs or have their criminal justice funding cut by 10
percent. In 1996, this was followed by the federal Megan’s Law, which required all
states to create CNSs, and the Pam Lychner Act, which created a national SOR,
linking state databases to enable tracking of sex offenders across state lines.
Other countries followed the United States’ lead in establishing SORs but
declined to link them to CNSs. In 1997, the United Kingdom passed a civil statute
creating a SOR to help police solve sex crimes. In 2000, the Canadian province of
Ontario enacted Christopher’s Law. This was followed by federal legislation setting
up a national registry (NSOR) in 2004. In Canada’s NSOR, strict rules with regard
to access and disclosure currently require law enforcement personnel to meet the
thresholds established under Section 16 of the Sex Offender Information Registra-
tion Act in order to access the registry and disclose information in it.
British and Canadian police and politicians resisted community notification leg-
islation, arguing that community notification would impede the usefulness of regis-
tration as a law enforcement tool because the loss of liberty and privacy and the
stigma resulting from community notification would reduce offender compliance
with registration requirements. Indeed, unlike some American states, which have
compliance rates of less than 50 percent, compliance with registration requirements
has recently been estimated to be over 95 percent in the United Kingdom. Officials
representing Ontario’s registry and Canada’s NSOR, while not providing published
evidence, make similar claims. 
While the specific characteristics of SORs and CNSs vary by jurisdiction,
most share common features. Offenders convicted of identified sexual offenses,
once outside of prison, must initially provide and regularly update information
about themselves with local police. When formally authorized, this information
can legitimately be disseminated to community organizations and the general
public. The information provided can include the following: home and employ-
ment contact information; identifying characteristics such as tattoos and scars;
the types of offenses that triggered the need to register; personal information
such as age, weight, and place of birth; vehicle make and license number; and
recent photographs.
The length of time a released sex offender is required to register varies by juris-
diction, offense type, and offender type. Offenders convicted of multiple counts of
child molestation may be required to register for life; those convicted of other
offenses, depending on their seriousness, may be required to register for shorter,
fixed periods of time. An example of how duration of registration relates to the
offense can be found in the Canadian NSOR. It requires offenders to register for 10

Sex offender registries
\
495
years, 20 years, or for life, depending on whether the type of offense the offender
was convicted for has been classified as less serious, serious, or very serious.
The decision as to whether a sex offender will be subject to registration also
depends on the jurisdiction. In the United States, after receiving written notifica-
tion, offenders who have completed their sentences or are on parole or probation
are required to register with local police. In Canada, the decision is made not at the
time of release, but rather by the trial judge immediately after the imposition of
sentence. In most circumstances, the prosecutor makes a formal request to the court
for inclusion in the sex offender registry, and the trial judge then ultimately deter-
mines whether the offender will be subject to the registry and for how long the
offender will have to register upon release.
Opponents of SORs and CNSs point to the myriad pragmatic and civil libertar-
ian difficulties they pose. Opponents argue that sex offenders who have paid their
debt to society should not have additional measures imposed upon them after sen-
tence completion, should not have to share personal information, and should not be
subject to any increased police scrutiny that an otherwise “normal” offender would
avoid.
Opponents further argue that, even if one accepts that police should have access
to sex offender information, the public should not have such access. When any
interested person in a jurisdiction with Internet access to its SOR can access a sex
offender’s personal information by home computer, constitutionally protected pri-
vacy rights have been seriously eroded. A tertiary concern stems from a slippery-
slope critique. If society chooses to invade the privacy rights of a particular
offender group, what will stop society from invading the privacy of other offender
groups? This critique contends that when the rights of one minority group are
infringed upon, the rights of all members of society are threatened.
There have been few legal challenges specific to offender privacy and sex
offender registries. Most courts have either deferred making a decision in anticipa-
tion of future legislation or had their decisions rendered moot by the introduction
of newer legislation. The following cases are notable exceptions.
In New Jersey, in Doe v. Poritz, despite a strong dissent, the court held that sex
offender registry and community notification does not violate offenders’ privacy
rights. In A. A. v. New Jersey, the court limited the scope of the Poritz decision. It
held that complete public access to offender information is unconstitutional, and
that the offender’s home address must be removed from the community notification
website.
In Ontario, in R. v. Burke, the court held that the sex offender registry was a
grossly disproportionate violation of privacy for this specific offender. Conversely,
in R. v. Ayoob, the court did not find that there was a grossly disproportionate viola-
tion of that specific offender’s privacy rights. In both cases, the decision ultimately
turned on the criminal record of the offender and the seriousness of the sex offense
violation. In December 2005, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that
Ontario’s SOR was constitutional.
The balance between individual privacy and public protection is most difficult
to achieve in the case of offenders considered to be dangerous and morally
unclean. On the one hand, those who support SORs and CNSs argue that knowing
one is being watched deters one from re-offending. On the other hand, critics of

496

\
SORs and CNSs are concerned that members of a specifically targeted offender
group who have served their time are being denied basic privacy rights that other
released offenders would have been granted. Such critics ask how a democratic
society can maintain its higher moral authority when one segment of the popula-
tion has its privacy rights violated, and how the invasion of constitutionally pro-
tected civil liberties can be justified when evidence to support its deterrent effect
is lacking.

Sex offenders
How sex offenses are defined has varied over time and across cultures. Even
today definitions vary across jurisdictions in the United States. The public response
to these offenses and to the people who commit them, however, has been more con-
sistent and driven largely by fear, outrage, and a demand for protection. The con-
temporary political and legal treatment of sex offenders mirrors public opinion, and
the result has been to make sex offenders subject to additional limitations on their
privacy even after they have served their sentences. This entry will discuss current
developments in the criminal justice system in the treatment of sex offenders that
expand control over sex offenders in terms of legal processing, treatment options,
and integration back into society.
Some states have passed laws that allow for the civil commitment of sex offend-
ers after they have served their criminal sentences. To some legal scholars, these
laws are viewed as a resurrection of the sexually violent predator (SVP) legislation
enacted during the mid 1900s. The supporting logic in favor of this trend is that
some sex offenders tend to have high recidivism rates and are therefore likely to re-
offend. In these cases the statutory standards favor public safety over individual
rights. Although the need for continued treatment is ostensibly the goal of this leg-
islation, it tends to emphasize an incapacitative objective over rehabilitation. The
result is that many sex offenders may be kept under some form of state control
indefinitely for the purpose of preventing crimes they “might” commit. 
One treatment option that has been adopted by states for use with sex offenders
is chemical castration. This treatment involves injection of a synthetic hormone
(Depo-Provera), which lowers the blood serum testosterone levels in males. Taken
on a regular basis, this hormone reduces sexual impulses, the frequency of erotic
fantasy, erections, and ejaculations. Chemical castration has been in use in the
treatment of sex offenders since 1944, but at that time it was administered with the
informed consent of the individual. Today, chemical castration statutes are differ-
ent. In 1997 California became the first state to enact a law mandating chemical

Sex offenders
\
497
castration for twice-convicted sex offenders whose victims were under the age of
13. Chemical injections begin prior to release on parole and are continued while
the offender is under community supervision. If the offender refuses, parole is
denied. 
Fundamental rights of privacy and procreation are at issue when mandatory
Depo-Provera injections are imposed. Privacy concerns arise because the individ-
ual's right to control his own person and the right to refuse treatment are compro-
mised. The right to privacy and bodily autonomy also extends to the right of an
individual to make procreative decisions. The effects of Depo-Provera that result in
a reduction of sperm production are believed to be temporary and reversible when
injections stop. The sex offender in temporary treatment of this kind still has the
ability to engage in sex and procreate. For sex offenders who are sentenced to life-
time injections, however, the right to procreate may be denied permanently. Bol-
stering this argument is the lack of understanding about the long-term side effects
of Depo-Provera on sexual performance and potency. There are cases in the Cali-
fornia court system that oppose the use of mandatory organic treatment for offend-
ers. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are challenging
chemical castration by comparing it to mandatory sterilization, which was
declared unconstitutional in Skinner vs. Oklahoma (1942).
In 1994 the abduction of an 11-year-old boy in Minnesota prompted Congress to
pass a law mandating that all 50 states create sex offender registries with local law
enforcement agencies so that an offender’s current residence can be identified
(Jacob Wetterling Crime Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registra-
tion Act, 1994). After another tragic episode involving the murder of Megan Kanka
in New Jersey by a previously convicted child molester, Megan's Law was added to
the Wetterling Law in 1996. According to this law, states are mandated to have pro-
cedures in place to inform the public about sex offenders who live in their commu-
nities. The rationale for community notification is that public safety, especially the
protection of children, will be enhanced if the community has knowledge about the
presence of convicted sex offenders residing in the neighborhood. Even juvenile
sex offenders, whose privacy is usually well guarded by the criminal justice com-
munity, can be subject to sex offender registration.
In a review of notification laws in all 50 states, research has found that notifica-
tion methods commonly include press releases, flyers, door-to-door contact, neigh-
borhood meetings, and the use of Internet websites. About half of the states assign
offenders to one of three risk levels and notify the public differentially according to
the risk an offender poses to the community. Other states employ broad community
notification, publicizing the locations of all sex offenders without regard for risk
assessment. Legal scholars have argued that using the Internet to provide public
notification of sex offenders when a dangerousness hearing has not occurred is a
privacy violation, but the courts thus far have largely rejected this claim.
In cases involving sex offenders, much of the current legislation tends to favor
the need for public safety over the privacy standard the supports the right to be left
alone. Another privacy standard affecting this group involves the right to control
information about oneself. The challenge here has focused on the release of infor-
mation about offenders and how that information might be used.

Sex offenders
\
The type of information collected on sex offenders varies, but at a minimum
includes the offender’s name, address, and law enforcement identification number.
In some states this information can also include a photograph, fingerprints, hand-
writing samples, employment information, residence history, vehicle registration
numbers, HIV status, and DNA samples. Considering the potential for its misuse,
the ease with which some of this personal information can be accessed by the pub-
lic is a major concern relating to sex offenders’ privacy. 
Several states’ sex offender registries are made available to the public through
toll-free and pay phone lines, CD-ROMS, or the Internet so as to the meet commu-
nity notification mandates set forth in Megan’s Law, but private citizens who take it
upon themselves to notify communities have been known to obtain lists of regis-
tered sex offenders and post them on the Internet without the endorsement of law
enforcement. Understanding the potential for the misuse of sex offenders’ personal
information, some states have taken added measures to ensure its proper use. For
example, the Sex Offender Registry Board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
requires users of its Internet registry to acknowledge and accept an agreement
regarding the appropriate use of information before accessing details of level 3
(high-risk) sex offenders. Specifically, the registry viewer must agree not to use the
information to commit a crime, discriminate against, or harass an offender. The
penalty for breaching the agreement involves a fine, incarceration, or a combina-
tion of both. Once the registry is accessed, users can obtain a sex offender’s full
name, age, race, sex, height, weight, hair color, eye color, exact address, the num-
ber and types of sex offenses that he or she has been convicted of, the date of con-
viction(s), a color photograph of the offender, and information pertinent to whether
the offender lives or works in the area. 
Technology has played a dual role in contemporary issues surrounding sex
offending. While the Internet has opened up a whole new hunting ground for sex-
ual predators and created new potential for non-forcible sex offenses against chil-
dren, it has also played an instrumental role in disseminating offender information
to law enforcement agents and communities under the guiding principle of public
safety. As of February 2001, 29 states had publicly accessible Internet sites that
contained searchable information on individual sex offenders. 
In addition to the creation of sex offender registries, federal legislation also per-
mits DNA testing and the collection of samples from sex offenders for identifica-
tion purposes. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 grants
authority to the attorney general to require sex offenders convicted in federal courts
to provide DNA samples for inclusion in the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI)’s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). Twenty-two states report that
they collect and maintain DNA samples as a required part of sex offender registra-
tion, while 19 additional states report limited or no collection of DNA samples.
This information is often collected along with other identifying information such as
fingerprints and handwriting samples, which can then be used either to link a sex
offender to future crimes or to crimes that have taken place in the past.
Other laws such as buffer-zone laws restrict where a sex offender can live and
are used in some form by as many as 14 states. Most of these laws prohibit sex
offenders from living within a specified radius around schools and day-care cen-
ters, but some buffer-zone laws are so strict that they also prohibit sex offenders

Sexual harassment
\
499
from taking up residence near parks, playgrounds, trails, swimming pools, librar-
ies, churches, bus stops, and any other place where children usually gather. The
radii within which sex offenders are prohibited from living vary but can range any-
where from 1000 to 2500 feet. In some cases this means that entire cities and towns
are off limits to sex offenders, and that sex offenders who already live within
restricted areas can be evicted and forced out of their homes.
The long-term effects of these trends on the treatment of sex offenders and the
protection of the public have are not yet fully understood, and many issues remain
to be examined. The limited research that does exist suggests that some offenders
have experienced loss of jobs, homes, property damage, and harassment. One of
positive aspects of notification laws according to offenders is an increased commit-
ment to prevent re-offending. 
The logistic demands of implementing these laws are also at issue, which should
factor into the continued balance between public safety and individual freedom. An
overreliance on these laws may not afford the protection hoped for by the public.
For example, findings from several studies demonstrate that buffer-zone laws fail
to cause reductions in sex offense recidivism. Moreover, the underlying premise for
buffer-zone laws appears to be unfounded because sex offenders who live near
places where children usually gather, such as schools or parks, are no more likely
to re-offend than are sex offenders who do not live near children.

Sexual harassment
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in employment
on the basis of sex, as well as on the basis of the other protected grounds of race,
religion, and national origin. Although sexual harassment is not expressly prohib-
ited by the statute, the courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have
concluded that harassing conduct that is motivated by sex constitutes discrimina-
tion with respect to a term or condition of employment. Similarly, harassment on

500
Sexual harassment
\
the basis of race, religion, or national origin may also constitute discrimination in
connection with a term or condition of employment.
Traditionally, the courts have recognized two forms of sexual harassment. The
first form, generally referred to as “quid pro quo” sexual harassment, involves a sit-
uation in which an employment opportunity or an employment detriment is condi-
tioned on an individual’s receptiveness to, toleration of, or rejection of sexual
conduct. Under language more recently adopted by the United States Supreme
Court, this form of sexual harassment is defined as harassment that results in a
“tangible employment action,” such as a hiring, firing, promotion, demotion, or
other similar action. The second type of sexual harassment is referred to as “hostile
environment” sexual harassment; it involves sexual conduct that does not result in a
tangible employment action but that creates an offensive, abusive, or hostile work-
ing environment.
Under the rules adopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
the administrative agency charged with enforcement of Title VII, and applied by
the courts, in order for harassment to be actionable, it must meet certain require-
ments. For both “quid pro quo” and “hostile environment” sexual harassment, the
harassing conduct must be unwelcome and must have been undertaken because of
or motivated by sex. In addition, in order for “hostile environment” sexual harass-
ment to be actionable, it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter one’s
working conditions or create a hostile or abusive working environment.
Employers face potential liability for sexually harassing conduct that occurs
among their employees and in the context of the workplace. With respect to harass-
ing conduct engaged in by a supervisory employee toward his or her subordinate
employees, employers are automatically liable when that harassing conduct results
in a tangible employment action, such as a hiring, firing, demotion, or other similar
action. When no such tangible employment action results from the harassing con-
duct, employers still face liability for the sexually harassing conduct engaged in by
supervisors unless the employer can show both that the employer acted reasonably
to prevent sexual harassment and to remedy sexually harassing conduct when it
occurred, and that the employee who was subject to the sexually harassing conduct
did not act reasonably in either reporting the conduct or in otherwise acting to
avoid harm caused by that conduct. With respect to sexually harassing conduct that
occurs between co-workers or by third parties, the employer can face liability for
that conduct if the employer knew or had reason to know of the conduct and did not
act to prevent or remedy that conduct. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, individuals who actually engage in the harassment do not face individual lia-
bility, although it is possible that they might face liability for the sexually harassing
conduct under state law claims against the individual harassers.
The privacy implications of sexual harassment are extensive, both for the indi-
vidual accused of harassment and for the target of harassing conduct. Perhaps the
element of sexual harassment law that threatens the most extensive potential inva-
sion of privacy for targets of harassment is the requirement that harassment has to
be shown to be “unwelcome” in order to be actionable. In order for a target of
harassment to demonstrate that the harassment was unwelcome, he or she has to
show that the conduct was not invited or otherwise incited, as well as being
required to show that the conduct was offensive to him or her. Accordingly, courts

Sexual harassment
\
501
have admitted evidence of past sexual conduct on the part of the target, as well as
evidence about the target's dress, speech, or other conduct in the workplace to
determine whether the conduct might have been invited or encouraged. Courts have
also entertained evidence about whether the target of harassment has had sexual
relationships with other individuals in the workplace, presumably on the basis that
the existence of such relationships might be relevant to the question of whether
sexual conduct by the harasser was welcomed. In some cases, courts have even
admitted evidence as to the target's conduct outside of the workplace context to
determine whether the conduct in question might have been welcomed or—more
extremely—whether the target of harassment was the “type” of person who, because
of his or her conduct, could be deemed to have welcomed sexual conduct generally.
There have been efforts to limit the invasion of privacy that can be caused by
inquiries into the “welcomeness” of sexually harassing conduct. Formerly, “rape
shield” statutes sought to prevent inquiries into the past sexual conduct of rape vic-
tims in an effort to show “sexual predisposition.” The Federal Rules of Evidence, in
Rule 412, have been amended to also apply with respect to civil actions involving
sexual conduct, including actions claiming sexual harassment. That rule seeks to
reverse the presumption that evidence of a target’s past sexual conduct is admissi-
ble in such actions. Instead, the rule is that evidence of the target’s past sexual con-
duct or “sexual predisposition” is inadmissible unless its evidentiary value
“substantially outweighs” the danger of harm that that evidence poses to the victim
or other parties. Accordingly, under this rule, employers seeking to introduce evi-
dence of an employee’s past sexual conduct will have to show not only the rele-
vance of the conduct to the existence of actionable discrimination but also a special
need on the part of the employer with respect to that evidence.
Privacy may also be affected by inquiries into the past sexual conduct of individ-
uals accused of harassment. Those inquiries might be made for a number of rea-
sons or purposes. For example, because sexual harassment may be less likely to
occur in front of witnesses than other forms of discriminatory conduct, and there-
fore whether the conduct in fact occurred may be at issue, employees bringing sex-
ual harassment claims may well feel compelled to produce other victims of the
individual accused of harassment, thereby arguing for the relevance of certain
forms of past sexual conduct by the alleged harasser.
In addition, to the extent that a victim of harassment may be claiming that he or she
was disadvantaged because of a failure to engage in sexual conduct with the harasser,
while other individuals who were willing to engage in such conduct received employ-
ment benefits, it may be necessary to inquire into the voluntariness of those other sex-
ual relationships. In particular, because the law may recognize a cause of action for
sexual harassment by individuals disadvantaged by the existence of other coerced sex-
ual relationships in the workplace—because it suggests that the employment opportu-
nity really was conditioned on willingness to submit to unwanted sexual conduct—but
does not recognize a cause of action for individuals disadvantaged by the preferential
treatment based on existence of other voluntary sexual relationships among their
supervisors and co-workers, the voluntariness of sexual relationships to which the
employee herself or himself is not a party may become relevant to the validity of the
employee’s sexual harassment claim. This possibility affects the privacy interests of
the alleged harasser and other employees in the workplace.

502
Sexual harassment
\
The requirement that sexually harassing conduct be undertaken “because of sex”
also has implications for the privacy interests of both the victims of harassment and
the individuals accused of harassment, particularly with respect to sexual harass-
ment that occurs between members of the same sex, but also with respect to
instances of opposite-sex harassment. Although the United States Supreme Court
has recognized that harassment between members of the same sex can constitute
discrimination because of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Court made clear that such harassment is actionable only if it can be
proven to have occurred because of sex; the sexual nature of the conduct has not
been considered sufficient to establish the “because of sex” requirement. The Court
suggested that one way to create an inference that sexually harassing conduct
between members of the same sex is based on sex is to show “credible evidence
that the harasser was homosexual.” Accordingly, to the extent that the employee
claiming to have been harassed seeks to establish that the same-sex harassment to
which he or she was exposed was based on sexual desire and therefore because of
sex, the sexual orientation of the alleged harasser may become legally relevant.
While it is not entirely clear what might constitute “credible evidence” of sexual
orientation, one might imagine that past same-sex sexual conduct on the part of the
alleged harasser might be sought to be introduced in order to establish that require-
ment of actionable sexual harassment.
Information about the sexual orientation of the victim of harassment may also
become legally relevant in connection with the need to establish that the sexually
harassing conduct has occurred because of sex. While harassment that is deemed to
be motivated by sex can be actionable under Title VII, harassment that is based on
the victim’s sexual orientation generally is not, because the courts have consis-
tently interpreted Title VII’s protections against sex discrimination not to extend to
discrimination based on sexual orientation. Accordingly, if employers or individu-
als accused of harassment are able to establish that the targets of harassment were
selected for harassment because they were gay men or lesbians, not because they
were men or women, the harassment of those individuals would not violate the
law’s prohibition of sex discrimination, as that law is traditionally interpreted and
applied. In this way, the sexual orientation of the victims of harassment—or at least
the perceived sexual orientation of those victims—becomes legally relevant to a
claim of sexual harassment.
The requirement for actionable “hostile environmental” sexual harassment
that the conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an offensive or abu-
sive working environment can also affect the privacy interests of employees tar-
geted for harassment. The courts have made clear that there is both a subjective
and an objective component of this requirement. That is, not only must the
employee show that he or she subjectively perceived the environment to be abu-
sive, but the employee must also show that the challenged conduct caused the
environment to be objectively hostile or abusive. This requirement raises the pos-
sibility that the employer, defending against a hostile environment claim, will
attempt to show that the individual targeted for harassment was not actually
offended by the conduct. This showing would likely take the form of attempting
to demonstrate other behavior on the part of the victim of harassment that would
show a lack of offense or toleration of sexually offensive conduct, such as evi-

Sexual harassment
\
503
dence suggesting that the employee herself or himself engaged in sexually offen-
sive conduct or otherwise was the “type of person” who would not be offended
by sexual conduct in the workplace. Even the requirement that the harassing con-
duct be objectively offensive poses privacy implications, in that an employer may
well attempt to show that, even though the employee was subjectively offended
by the conduct, his or her reaction was not reasonable; for example, perhaps
because some experience in his or her past—childhood or adult sexual violence,
assault, or some mental condition—caused the victim to be unusually and atypi-
cally sensitive to sexual conduct in the workplace.
Even the standards applied by the courts for imposing liability on employers for
the sexually harassing conduct of supervisory and nonsupervisory employees may
have implications for the privacy interests of individuals accused of harassment and
the individuals targeted for harassment. Although employers face automatic liabil-
ity for sexual harassment engaged in by supervisory employees when that conduct
results in a tangible employment action, employers do have the opportunity to
avoid liability for supervisory sexual harassment when no such tangible employ-
ment action occurred. Accordingly, employers seeking to avoid liability on the
grounds that the target of harassment unreasonably failed to report the conduct or
otherwise unreasonably failed to avoid harm caused by the conduct may well be
tempted to seek to explore aspects of the employee’s past conduct or past experi-
ences with the harasser in order to establish the unreasonableness of the target’s
response to that conduct. For example, while the relative youth or sexual inexperi-
ence of a victim of harassment might be viewed as justification for a delay in
reporting harassing conduct, the employer might well attempt to prove the opposite
in order to argue that such an employee targeted by sexual harassment should have
immediately recognized the nature and gravity of the harassing conduct and there-
fore reported the conduct without delay.
Of course, even the requirement that individuals who have been sexually harassed
report the sexual conduct to which they have been subjected to the appropriate
authorities affects the privacy interests of the individuals victimized by sexual harass-
ment. The sexually harassing conduct that forms the basis of complaints of sexual
harassment is likely to consist of sexual advances and demands for sexual conduct,
sexual touching, sexually degrading comments and inquiries into the person’s sexual
practices, and even sexual assaults and rape. Even individuals who have resisted such
conduct or who have been subjected to forcible sexual conduct are likely to be
embarrassed about the fact that the conduct has occurred and may think—perhaps
with some justification—that they will not be believed or will be blamed for the con-
duct. Individuals who have felt compelled to submit or to tolerate sexually harassing
conduct may well believe they bear some responsibility for the conduct to which they
have been subjected, or at least may believe that others will think that they are at fault
in some way. Accordingly, many victims of sexual harassment may well be reluctant
to disclose the conduct to which they have been subjected, even to persons close to
them, such as family members and close friends. Requiring that they report such
conduct to the proper authorities, such as supervisors and human resource personnel,
can be particularly difficult to do and intrusive of privacy interests, particularly if the
employer has not set up a mechanism by which those reports can be made in a secure
and safe manner.

504
Sexual violence
\
Some tension between the laws covering sexual harassment and the privacy
interests of employees is inevitable. An exclusive focus on the need to prevent sex-
ually harassing conduct may give too little weight to the privacy interests of
employees, while too much focus on privacy may prove insufficient to protect the
victims of sexual harassment for the damaging aspects of that activity.

Sexual violence
Sexual violence describes a variety of nonconsensual, offensive conduct involv-
ing the use of genitals or other private parts such as breasts and buttocks. Rape is
a form of sexual violence and is generally defined as the nonconsensual sexual pen-
etration by force or threat of force. Penetration includes vaginal, oral, and anal, and
does not require proof of full intrusion into the body. For example, mere contact
with the labia is sufficient in most states to prove vaginal penetration. Penetration
can involve the perpetrator as the one receiving or causing the penetration. In some
states, the element of force has been eliminated, and rape can be proved simply by
establishing penetration and the absence of consent.
Laws against sexual violence typically provide for the harshest sanctions when
the conduct involves penetration into or by the victim's body. Early laws against
sexual violence evolved from the common law idea that a sexual offense was a
crime against a man’s property. This is because women and children were defined
in law as men’s property rather than as individuals with their own rights. As
women gained political status, the law evolved to recognize sexual violence as a
crime against the autonomous self and bodily integrity of the victim. Despite these
gains and although in theory sexual violence law is designed to promote personal
autonomy, virtually every state defines rape as the forcible sexual penetration of
another without consent. Critics argue that by requiring proof of force in addition
to nonconsensual actions, autonomy is not adequately preserved, and that if the
goal is to protect the integrity of free will, sexual harm without consent, irrespec-
tive of force, should define the crime.
Although sexual violence is a crime even when it occurs between spouses, until
the 1990s, at least some states had a so-called marital exception, such that sexual
violence perpetrated by a man against his wife could not be prosecuted. No state
retains an explicit marital rape exception today. However, in some states, rape of a
wife by her husband is harder to prove and/or carries less punishment than if the

Sexual violence
\
505
same crime happened to a stranger. Proof of nonconsent is required in all states in
order for a healthy adult victim to establish that an unlawful act occurred, but con-
sent is irrelevant for certain victims, such as those under a certain age. In most
states, a child cannot lawfully consent to sexual penetration until age 16, although
they may lawfully consent to nonpenetrating sexual contact at a slightly younger
age. In some states, the age of consent changes based on the age of the person with
whom the minor has sexual contact. For example, a 15-year-old may be prohibited
from consenting to sexual contact with an adult, but may lawfully consent to the
same sexual contact with another 15-year-old individual.
In many states, irrespective of age, victims cannot lawfully consent if they are
disabled, heavily intoxicated, or otherwise incapable of making a knowing, intelli-
gent, and voluntary decision about sexual conduct. Likewise, in many states, peo-
ple cannot lawfully consent to sexual contact in certain trust relationships, such as
teacher/student and doctor/patient. Most sexual violence occurs in private, and the
majority of such violence occurs between people known to each other. Thus, pri-
vacy theory and privacy laws often inhibit the ability of law enforcement and other
public officials to monitor, intervene, and redress sexual violence. 
Sexual violence can be redressed under civil or criminal law. If it involves an
individual in a vulnerable class, it might be redressed by a state agency, such as a
department of mental health. When a child is victimized, social service agencies
might become involved and could remove the child from a home, either tempo-
rarily or permanently, irrespective of whether a criminal prosecution ensues. Cer-
tain persons with reasonable cause to believe a child has been or is being sexually
abused are obligated to report abuse to government officials responsible for provid-
ing protective services to children. Failure to report is a crime in most states when
the person with such knowledge is in a “caretaking” position, such as that of a
teacher, day-care provider, or doctor.
When a civil claim is filed to redress sexual violence, the remedy for the vic-
tim is the recovery of money damages. Sexual violence may also fall under the
definition of sexual harassment and/or civil rights laws. Title VII and Title IX
are the popular titles of federal laws that prohibit sex discrimination, including
sexual harassment and sexual assault, in the workplace and in school respec-
tively. Legal actions filed under Title IX and Title VII allow for equitable reme-
dies in addition to money damages, such as court orders requiring a school to
change its policies and procedures. When sexual violence is redressed in civil
law, the victim is a formal party to the case and is represented by his or her own
personal attorney. The victim can choose whether to file or withdraw a civil
claim, and the actions of the victim may bear on liability during a determination
of fault. For example, a victim might be found 20 percent responsible for an
assault if she sues her landlord for negligently allowing a rapist to break in and
assault her, and the evidence also shows that the victim, by her own negligence,
contributed to her own risk of harm.
When sexual violence is redressed through criminal law, the victim is not a
formal party to the case, and the prosecution does not represent the victim. The
victim is a witness for the government, and there is no assessment of comparative
fault between the victim and the accused. Criminal law theory is only concerned
with holding the offender accountable. When a crime of sexual violence is

506
Sexual violence
\
prosecuted in criminal court, the state and/or defense may issue subpoenas to
compel the testimony of the victim and/or to compel the production of materials
and things related to the crime. Likewise, a judge may issue a court order for the
same purposes.
Although a subpoena in a civil case can seek broad discovery of “relevant
evidence” and information that “may lead to the discovery of relevant evidence,”
in a criminal case, subpoena power is strictly limited. The prosecution has
authority to send subpoenas to private persons for trial, for grand jury investiga-
tions to uncover relevant evidence, and for other legitimate needs during eviden-
tiary hearings. The accused has constitutional authority to send subpoenas to
private persons only for specifically identified evidence needed for use in the
trial. The accused in a criminal case has no constitutional authority to send sub-
poenas to the victim or to any private person for the purpose of conducting “dis-
covery.” The accused has “discovery rights” only against the opponent, which is
the state.
In civil and criminal cases, if a procedurally invalid subpoena is issued, such as
when a defense attorney sends a subpoena seeking “discovery” during the pretrial
period, the recipient is authorized, if not obligated, to refuse to comply. It may even
be appropriate to seek sanctions against the attorney who sent the unlawful sub-
poena. If a procedurally valid subpoena is issued and asks for privileged, confiden-
tial, or private information, the recipient is authorized and usually legally obligated
to refuse to comply and to notify the sender and the court of the nature of his or her
objection. Most sensitive material, such as a victim’s therapeutic counseling
records or records of conversations between a victim and her private attorney, is
protected by statute, common law, and a constitutional right of privacy. All these
bases of legal protection should be asserted by the holder of the information.
Except in extremely rare circumstances, a judge will summarily deny a defense
request for sensitive material.
In the very unusual case where further inquiry is essential, a judge may conduct
a hearing to balance the competing interests and thereafter order disclosure of cer-
tain information that, on balance, must be disclosed in response to a compelling
and legitimate litigation need. In most cases, a judge will conduct an “in camera”
review to determine whether information believed to be in a protected file in fact
exists. An in camera review involves the judge, alone, reading the file to determine
whether any portion of the contents must be disclosed to help clarify an issue legit-
imately in dispute in a particular litigation.
During a criminal trial, and in some states even during a civil trial, the accused
often tries to uncover information pertaining to the victim’s past sexual conduct
and use that evidence in the trial. This type of evidence is protected from disclosure
in every state under rape-shield laws. One or more exceptions in the law may apply
so that absolute protection against disclosure is not guaranteed; however, the victim
can also rely on the Supreme Court decision of Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558
(2003), to insist on protection against disclosure of past sexual conduct, because
the Court held in Lawrence that lawful sexual activity between adults is protected
by a fundamental constitutional right of privacy. With the Lawrence decision, vic-
tims have a stronger argument that their sexual privacy is shielded not only by a
statute but by the Constitution.

Silver platter doctrine
\
507
Victims in sexual violence trials are often concerned about being identified in
the media, and while most states have laws that prohibit public disclosure of a vic-
tim’s identity, the Supreme Court has held that an absolute bar on disclosure is
probably unconstitutional. Nevertheless, most media exercise voluntary restraint
and opt not to identify a victim without the victim’s permission.

Silver platter doctrine
One of the most important constitutional safeguards of privacy is the Fourth
Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. A key to
enforcing this provision is the exclusionary rule, which restricts the use of evidence
seized in an illegal search. For many years the silver platter doctrine served as a
loophole to the exclusionary rule, allowing evidence obtained in an unconstitu-
tional search by state or local law enforcement officials to be used in a federal pros-
ecution. This loophole was closed in 1960 and the doctrine is now generally held to
be unconstitutional.
The silver platter doctrine developed along with the exclusionary rule, which
was established in Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914). The rule originally
applied only to federal criminal prosecutions. Evidence uncovered by state or local
law enforcement officers in what would have been an illegal search if performed by
federal personnel was held to be admissible as long as federal officials did not par-
ticipate in the search or connive at it. In the words of Supreme Court Justice Felix
Frankfurter (in Lustig v. United States, 1949), if such evidence was handed to fed-
eral agents “on a silver platter,” it was admissible in a federal court. This created a
sense of apparent inconsistency, especially after the Supreme Court held that the
“core” of the Fourth Amendment should apply to the states. In 1960 the Supreme
Court ruled in Elkins v. United States that such evidence was inadmissible. The fol-
lowing year, the Court applied the exclusionary rule to the states.
Recognition of the doctrine also raised the question of whether it applied in
reverse, that is, whether evidence illegally seized by federal agents could be used in
a state prosecution. In 1956 the Court ruled that it could, as long as it had not been
specifically suppressed in federal court proceedings. The application of the exclu-
sionary rule to the states in 1961, however, made the point largely irrelevant.

\
The unconstitutionality of the silver platter doctrine applies only in criminal
prosecutions. In 1976 the Supreme Court ruled in Janis v. United States that evi-
dence seized illegally by one level of government could be used by the other as evi-
dence in civil cases, a provision mostly relevant in tax cases.
A related question has been whether evidence uncovered by a private citizen in
what would have been an illegal search if conducted by an agent of law enforce-
ment could still be used. This circumstance, outside the scope of the key silver plat-
ter decisions, has been addressed largely at the state level. In an influential decision
in 1976, the California Supreme Court held in People v. Mackinnon that police
could not “stand idly by” and allow a search that would be illegal if they undertook
it themselves. However, in order for this restraint to apply, the police must have
both the knowledge of the illegal search and the means to prevent it.

Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (1989)
In 1987 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) passed the Federal Railroad
Safety Act in an attempt to address the issue of employees who were intoxicated
from alcohol and drugs while operating locomotives within the United States. The
act cited a study conducted in 1979 illustrating the extent and seriousness of the
problem. In consideration of the potential destruction and financial loss resulting
from the actions of intoxicated railroad employees, the Supreme Court decided that
the act justified potentially intrusive methods of reducing the employees’ use of
drugs or alcohol while on the job. 
Subpart C of the act required immediate and mandatory blood testing and urine
analysis from any employee involved in a major train accident. It defined a major
train accident as an incident where death occurs, where a hazardous spill resulting
in evacuation or injury occurs, or where damage caused to railroad property totals
$500,000 or more. The act also gave railroads the discretionary power, under sub-
part D, to demand breathalyzer or urine tests from employees suspected of being
intoxicated. The Railway Labor Executives’ Association filed suit, attempting to
prohibit the new regulations. The association argued that a violation of the Fourth
Amendment could occur if an employee was required to submit to any form of test-
ing without probable cause. By requiring an employee to submit to drug testing
based simply on the random discretion of the FRA, such a search would lack the
certainty requirement consistent with probable cause; thus, the search would be
violation of the Fourth Amendment. After the federal district court had heard the
association’s argument, it held that, although the Fourth Amendment does protect

Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n (1989)
\
509
an individual’s right to the integrity of his or her own body, the need of society to
remedy the serious problem of intoxication, which may cause damage to life and
property, is more important than the traditional requirement of probable cause to
make a search constitutional under the Fourth Amendment. 
When the case reached the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, this court reversed the
district court’s decision. The court of appeals agreed with the district court that
the rules stipulated in subpart D could violate the employees’ right to privacy under the
Fourth Amendment. The court of appeals also affirmed that, because of the signifi-
cant safety concern for the public, the traditional requirement of probable cause
was not realistic in requiring blood, urine, or breath tests. However, the court of
appeals reversed the district court’s decision on the grounds that such blanket
authority to require testing was too sacrificial of constitutional protections. The
court of appeals decided that, at a minimum, there should be a prerequisite of rea-
sonable suspicion of intoxication before the FRA could require an employee to
submit to testing. The court held that, because the FRA regulations did not require
that the suspicion be related to an individual, the suspicion could not be reasonable.
Based on this reasoning, the court of appeals reversed the decision of the district
court and concluded that the FRA should find specific reasonable suspicion of
intoxication before it could order an employee to submit to a drug test. 
The Supreme Court decided to hear the case under a writ of certiorari and
reversed the decision of the court of appeals to invalidate the regulations stipulated
in the act. The Court, however, recognized the long history of precedence that pro-
tected individuals from a compelled intrusion into their privacy. Even though the
collection and analysis of biological samples by government agencies are searches
subject to constitutional discretion, not every search could be considered unlawful
or in violation of the Constitution. The Court then attempted to weigh the balance
between the individual’s rights to a reasonable expectation of privacy against the
needs of society for safe railroading practices. Consequently, it recognized that, under
certain circumstances similar to the operations of prisons, schools, and governmental
offices, there are exceptions to the normal requirements that government officials
conduct searches within the scope of the Fourth Amendment. Along those same
lines, the Court deemed the tasks of railroad officials as safety sensitive and as
beyond the normal Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause. 
The Court addressed the concern of the court of appeals using the same line of
protective reasoning it had provided to justify the surrendering of the traditional
requirement of probable cause. It held that the blanket authority given in the Fed-
eral Railroad Safety Act, for the purposes of random testing without reasonable
suspicion or probable cause, was required to ensure the results the act had been cre-
ated to achieve. The FRA had provided the records of years of investigative study
that demonstrated there was no way to perfectly and accurately determine the
intoxication of specific employees while they were working on safety-sensitive
tasks. Instead, the FRA claimed blanket testing to be the most effective way to
deter employees from using drugs or alcohol while working. In other words, the
possible discovery of intoxication and threat of dismissal was the most effective
way to keep employees from using drugs and alcohol while on the job. If employ-
ees could not predict when a test would occur, then the effect of deterrence would
be greatly increased. The Court agreed that the benefit to society through deterring

employees from using drugs and alcohol while working was important enough to
sacrifice the traditional rules required for a Fourth Amendment search.

Smart cards
A smart card is a plastic card, typically the size of a standard credit card, which
is embedded with a micromodule containing a single silicon integrated circuit chip
with a memory and microprocessor. A familiar example is a magnetic strip card.
Other examples include optical cards, memory cards, and microprocessor cards.
Memory and microprocessor cards are truly smart cards in that they each contain
an integrated circuit chip that can store information, perform local processing, and
complete complex calculations. These integrated circuit cards use radio frequency
chips to operate, whereas an optical card requires a laser to read the card. The ben-
efits of smart cards are their size, their cost, and their protection against fraud. The
concerns are that smart cards enable intrusive profiling of individuals by integrat-
ing different databases and biometric identifiers within the card.

Sobriety checkpoint
A sobriety checkpoint is a police roadblock set up ostensibly to screen motorists
to determine if they have been operating automobiles under the influence of alco-
hol. Sobriety checkpoints have become part of the well-publicized efforts to stop
drunk driving on American highways. Powerful citizen advocacy groups such as
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) have influenced politicians and govern-
ment officials to take steps such as lowering the blood alcohol threshold to deter-
mine legal intoxication and to support tactics such as sobriety checkpoints to stop

511
drunk drivers. Yet, because of the potentially invasive nature of the sobriety check-
point, the practice appears to threaten constitutional protections and challenge
assumptions on the limitations of governmental powers.
The sobriety checkpoint is usually a short interruption of a driver’s journey that
allows police to assess whether the driver is intoxicated. The delay is less invasive
than an automobile search, where police officers physically examine the automo-
bile, sometimes without a search warrant, when there is probable cause. Because
police at a checkpoint stop all drivers, one has to assess whether the loss of some
rights for a greater society good, such as removing drunk drivers from the road-
ways, is sufficient ground to allow government intrusion on all individual drivers.
An expectation of privacy and having the right to travel without arbitrary actions by
the government are reasonable and well within the context of constitutional protec-
tions provided for by Article IV of the Constitution as well as by the Fourth
Amendment. 
Two cases, Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz (1990) and Illinois v.
Lidster (2004), provide legal standing for sobriety checkpoints. In Illinois v. Lidster,
the Supreme Court determined that such checkpoints do not violate one’s Fourth
Amendment rights. The Court further determined in the same case that the lack-
ing of any individualized suspicion by the police cannot by itself determine the
outcome of a case because, in the opinion of the Court, one’s car may not be
treated as one’s home (see New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106). Also, in Michigan
Department of State Police v. Sitz, the Supreme Court ruled that special law
enforcement concerns can justify checkpoint stops even if there is no individual-
ized suspicion. In short, the police can arrest a driver for drunk driving without
knowing anything about that driver’s drinking until intoxication is discovered at
the checkpoint. 
What about individuals who neither drink nor wish to be subjected to sobriety
checkpoints? The Court’s concern for overall societal benefits may outweigh individual
interest. Again, the Michigan State Police case is especially significant because
of the rather extensive rationale for sobriety checkpoints in the majority opinion
by the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The following statements are part of
that opinion: “No one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving
problem or the State’s interest in eradicating it. . . . In sum, the balance of the
State’s interest in preventing drunken driving, the extent to which this system can
reasonably be said to advance that interest, and the degree of intrusion upon indi-
vidual motorists who are briefly stopped, weighs in favor of the state program”
(496 U.S. 444).
The chief justice’s words make clear that the Court was weighing the merits of
the rights of the individual against the interest of government. The majority opinion
by Rehnquist remains the official position of the Court on sobriety checkpoints.
However, Justice John Paul Stevens declared in his dissenting opinion, “Unfortu-
nately the Court is transfixed by the wrong symbol, the illusory prospect of punish-
ing countless intoxicated motorists, when it should keep its eyes on the road plainly
marked by the Constitution.” So while the Supreme Court has upheld the constitu-
tionality of sobriety checkpoints, it also established specific guidelines for their
use. Police are required to give notification of a checkpoint, and they cannot detain
motorists for an unreasonable amount of time. The Court has also indicated that an

512
Sobriety checkpoint
\
arrest rate of less than 5 percent would raise questions of whether there is a legiti-
mate government interest in the activity. 
Subsequently, the decision has had an impact on sobriety checkpoints in other
states. The United States Congress also conducted public hearings on drunk driv-
ing and its adverse impact. A federal statute was passed that allowed the secre-
tary of transportation to withhold part of a state’s federal highway funds if the
state did not pass laws requiring the drinking age to be at least twenty-one. The
federal action was supported in the 1987 case of South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S.
203. Citizens have also been part of the widespread efforts that have resulted in
public policies and judicial decisions that allow law enforcement officials to
carry out sobriety checkpoints. As previously noted, MADD has been the cata-
lyst for numerous public hearings on drunk driving and its impact at both the
local and national levels. Public awareness programs and advertisements on the
number of automobile accidents and deaths attributed to drunk driving have
helped bring the issue to the public’s mind and to the attention of politicians.
Other citizen groups, businesses, entertainment organizations, and government
agencies have become advocates against drunk driving through supporting
numerous public service announcements and advertisements. Thanks to modern
technology, a causal surfing of the web resulted in this writer identifying more
than 30 advocacy and community groups involved in this issue. Besides MADD,
the array of advocacy groups against drugs and alcohol include Citizens Against
Drug Impaired Drivers and Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways. Business
groups such as the National Association of Convenience Stores and entertain-
ment organizations represented by the Entertainment Council, Inc., are listed as
advocates against drunk driving. Professional groups such as the National Asso-
ciation of Broadcasters and government agencies such as the National Safety
Transportation Board, United States Department of Transportation, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Department of Justice, and the
United States Department of Education are also numbered as advocates against
drunk driving. The support of government agencies is significant because their
advocacy is often followed by official policies on a particular subject. This is
especially true of the Department of Transportation division of National High-
way Traffic Safety Administration, which has issued guidelines for carrying out
sobriety checkpoints. The Department of Transportation, under former secretary
Elizabeth Dole, successfully defended the national government’s power to with-
hold a state’s federal highway funds when the state did not comply with a federal
mandate to stop underage drinking. 
The sobriety checkpoint is a policy that illustrates judicial balancing of individ-
ual privacy rights against the interests of the whole of society, and citizen influ-
ence. Because the court has provided legitimacy and rationale for stopping
motorists to determine if they are intoxicated, the sobriety checkpoint has become
a fixture for all who drive on American highways. The activities of powerful advo-
cacy groups, particularly Mothers Against Drunk Driving, represent how citizens
can impact decisionmakers. Such citizen influence guarantees that those inclined to
drink and drive will likely face less than sympathetic law enforcement officials and
judges. Motorists who are law abiding as well as nondrinkers will continue to expe-
rience the invasiveness of the sobriety checkpoint given the widespread public sup-

port to stop drunken driving and the belief that sobriety checkpoints will both deter
and catch drunk drivers.

Social Security number
The Social Security Act of 1935 established Social Security numbers (SSNs) for
the sole use of the Social Security program. Less than a decade later, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9397, permitting federal agencies to
use the identifying numbers as part of a new record-keeping system. SSNs became
taxpayer identification codes in 1961 when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
starting using them. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 enabled driver’s license and
motor vehicle registration entities, welfare agencies, and state and local tax organi-
zations to use SSNs.
A SSN is a unique nine-digit numerical sequence issued to every U.S. citizen
by the Social Security Agency (SSA). The first three numbers identify the per-
son’s residence as provided on the application form. The SSA discloses the num-
bers being used in each area on a routine basis. While it is widely rumored that
the middle two digits represent a person’s ethnicity, there is no evidence to sub-
stantiate this claim. 
An individual’s Social Security number is confidential information; it should
never be offered on a routine basis. One’s Social Security card, containing the
number, should be safeguarded. It should never be carried with the individual
unless there is a unique circumstance requiring the card. When people give out
their SSNs, they are allowing others to gain access to their personally identifi-
able information. An average person cannot correct these important data if an
error is discovered. Nor does the person have the legal right to correct any
errors. 
An individual needs to maintain vigilance in order to protect and prevent
abuse of the Social Security number. Even if someone directly inquires about
an individual’s number, offering that number is not mandatory. There are sev-
eral important questions to ask regarding why the number is needed, how it will
be used, and what the consequences are for noncompliance. Once this information

514
Social Security number
\
is known, the person’s choice to provide the Social Security number is an
informed-albeit voluntary-decision.
There is significant legal constraint concerning government personnel asking for
a person’s Social Security number. However, there is no legal governance over pri-
vate companies regarding their policies on acquiring, maintaining, or disclosing
this private information. If a government agency employee asks for an individual’s
Social Security number, the government worker is required to supply information
on a Privacy Act disclosure notice as outlined in the Privacy Act of 1974, which
addresses all three important questions mentioned earlier. Nongovernmental firms
are not required to comply with this legal condition. If a private company’s policies
on private information are improper, a customer’s only alternative is to locate a dif-
ferent company with which to do business. 
The concerns with SSN security are twofold. SSNs are used to link together data
about a person using a variety of sources. The person’s SSN is the identifying com-
mon denominator. Secondly, many individuals regard presentation of one’s SSN as
representation and authorization of the individual’s identity. Medical records as
well as brokerage files treat a person’s SSN as the true indicator of the client’s
identity. Banks treat the client’s SSN as a secret passcode known only to the
account owner; in reality, one only needs to present the account holder’s name,
along with his or her SSN, and state that the account number has been forgotten.
Usually the bank will permit a transaction such as the transfer or withdrawal of
funds. These two concerns stand in direct conflict with each other. Commonly used
on drivers’ licenses, mailing labels, and grade transcripts from colleges, these
readily available codes—depicting people’s identities—should never be used for
identity authentication purposes.
The Privacy Act of 1974 is the main law that addresses the use of SSNs. It man-
dates that a federal agency, when asking for a person’s SSN, must inform the person
of four things: the statute or order permitting the solicitation, the voluntary or manda-
tory nature of compliance with the request, the intended purpose and how the infor-
mation (if disclosed) will be used, and any consequences for noncompliance. The act
establishes that it is illegal to repudiate a person’s rights because of refusal to provide
his or her SSN. One exception to this is if federal law necessitates SSN disclosure. A
second exception is the disclosure to a government agency whose record-keeping
system predates 1975. 
At their inception, and for several decades past that point, it was clearly noted on
the card itself that SSNs were not to be used for identification purposes. However,
no law was passed to confirm this guiding principle. Many private citizens are
enraged by the U.S. government’s violation of this founding SSN precept. The IRS
states that any U.S. citizen earning income is required to have a Social Security
number. The IRS also requires employers to report income earned by an employee
by the employee’s SSN. Some legal scholars consider the legal foundation on
which the IRS bases its authority to be very shaky. However, it is important to real-
ize that the IRS incarcerates violators of their policies. Given this, the majority of
citizens and employers comply with the IRS.
The Social Security Agency (SSA) rarely issues a new SSN to a person experi-
encing extreme duress from a stalker or as a result of identity theft. This task
requires, however, convincing all parties involved that all other possible options

Sodomy
\
515
have been explored and used. The SSA does not promise to issue a new number
and leaves the decision of how to proceed to the judgment of the local office. While
there are companies willing to provide an individual with a new SSN, the only legal
route to obtaining a new SSN is through the Social Security Agency. Any company
claiming to provide this service is fraudulent.

Sodomy
In the early twentieth century, the Ariston Turkish and Russian Baths were
among the places in New York City where men met for anonymous sexual encoun-
ters. In 1903, working with a local anti-vice organization, police placed the bath-
house under surveillance and arrested 16 men on sodomy charges in a late-night
sting operation. One man was eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison. The Aris-
ton raid was the first of many raids on gay bathhouses in major urban centers. A
century later, the U.S. Supreme Court declared sodomy laws unconstitutional, not-
ing in its majority decision that the meanings of both sodomy and sexuality have
changed greatly over time. Understanding the history of sodomy and sodomy laws
is important for a broad understanding of sexual privacy for at least two reasons. At
the most obvious level, the policing of sodomy has entailed serious encroachments
on sexual privacy, uniquely affecting gays and lesbians. Also, the term “sodomy”
acts simultaneously as a stigma-drenched criminal category and as a criterion and
cultural shorthand for what it means to be gay or lesbian. 
In modern usage, sodomy refers to nonprocreative sexual practices, typically
oral or anal sex. From the colonial period through most of the nineteenth century,
however, sodomy laws criminalized a wide range of sexual conduct that often fell
under proscriptions against “crimes against nature” or against “unspeakable acts”:
bestiality, public masturbation, and pedophilia. A wealth of historical evidence
suggests that sodomy laws did not target sexual intimacy among same-sex couples
in particular. Colonial authorities considered sodomy a capital offense, but they did
not view sodomy as linked to an offender’s sexual orientation. A concern with non-
reproductive sexual acts and sex between parties of vastly different social statuses
(adult/child or master/servant) characterized the law’s statutory scope and enforce-
ment. In general, police and prosecutors pursued sodomy charges in instances
where men sexually preyed upon children. In New York City, for example, almost
all sodomy prosecutions involved men accused of harming children under the age
of 18.
The dominant understandings of sexuality and same-sex desire changed radically
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the policing and surveillance
of sodomy changed in response. During these years of sexual upheaval—revealed in
the growth of scientific understandings of human sexuality, a selective erosion of
Victorian sexual mores, and shifting norms of courtship—prosecutors made more
frequent use of sodomy laws, and they used them to target gay men. In the early

516
Sodomy
\
twentieth century, sodomy prosecutions soared in cities like Boston, Philadelphia,
St. Louis, and Los Angeles. Whereas the older use of the sodomy law primarily
addressed men’s coercive sex with weaker or nonconsenting parties, the twentieth-
century use of the law increasingly tied nonnormative sex with a homosexual status
group. 
With a new understanding of sodomy and homosexual identity in place, police and
courts mounted a large intervention into the private lives of gays and lesbians. The
net of sexual surveillance expanded during the first half of the twentieth century, as
some anti-vice and anti-crime organizations were given quasi-police powers to inves-
tigate and secure evidence of sexual immorality. Following the repeal of Prohibition,
vibrant urban gay subcultures were effectively crushed by the state liquor authority
and other state agencies that made saloon licensing contingent on the owners’
cooperation in excluding supposed sexual degenerates. During the Cold War, the
state surveillance of gays and lesbians intensified, and the U.S. government launched
an extensive attack on suspected gays and lesbians in the civil service. Moreover,
sodomy laws disproportionately affected the less fortunate. The greatest number of
sodomy arrests occurred in impoverished sections of U.S. cities. Historian George
Chauncey notes that the primary targets of sodomy arrests in New York City during
the 1940s and 1950s were Puerto Rican and African American. 
In the words of legal scholar William Eskridge, “The modern regulatory state
cut its teeth on gay people.” These efforts were buoyed by the modern conflation of
gay identity and sodomy. The seemingly inseparable link between sodomy and
same-sex desire broadly affected sexual privacy by cementing a connection
between deviant sexual practices and gays and lesbians. Writing about the creation
of modern sexuality in the late nineteenth century, social theorist Michel Foucault
argued that “homosexuality appeared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was
transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior androgyny, a her-
maphrodism of the soul.” In other words, the modern act of sodomy was seen not
just as a sexual act like other sexual acts, but it functioned as a proxy for something
deeper in the individual. Earlier medical, legal, and cultural understandings of sod-
omy variously positioned it as a vice, addiction, or human failing. Likewise, men in
the nineteenth century could have sex with other men without impugning their mas-
culinity or respectable status. In the modern age, however, sodomy came to be
viewed as an index of a particular sexual self. Not captured in sodomy arrest records
or rates of prosecution, this effect of the understanding of sodomy is more subtle,
although no less consequential, in eroding sexual privacy. The practice of sodomy
marks individuals as deviant or criminal, while gays and lesbians are simultaneously
marked as deviant for presumably engaging in the practice of sodomy. 
In their  ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), the U.S. Supreme
Court gave hard legal backing to the taken-for-granted link between sexual devi-
ance and gays and lesbians. In the majority ruling, Justice White claimed that pro-
scriptions on “homosexual conduct” had “ancient roots.” In a concurring opinion,
Justice Burger referenced Judeo-Christian ethics and Western civilization to con-
demn “homosexual sodomy.” Leading up to the Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558
(2003), decision, a group of historians filed an amicus brief with the Court in which
they explained that the phrase “homosexual sodomy” would have been “literally
incomprehensible to the Framers of the Constitution” because sodomy was viewed

Sodomy
\
517
as a discreet act and not as an indication of a person’s sexual orientation. Nonethe-
less, the link between sodomy and sexual identity has been generally accepted as a
taken-for-granted fact in legal and popular culture, and was succinctly voiced in
1993 when former senator Strom Thurmond shouted on the Senate floor during a
debate about gays in the military that “heterosexuals do not practice sodomy!”
In the years leading up to the Court’s 2003 disposal of Bowers in Lawrence v.
Texas, legal scholarship has brought to light evidence that sodomy laws bestowed
legal legitimacy on gross intrusions in the private family lives of gays and lesbians,
and they allowed employers and state officials to commit egregious forms of dis-
crimination. For instance, in Bottoms v. Bottoms, Pamela Bottoms successfully
fought for custody of her three-year-old grandson upon learning that her daughter,
Sharon Bottoms, was a lesbian living with another woman. The trial judge invoked
Virginia’s sodomy law to invalidate the mother’s custody rights, reasoning that the
mother routinely engaged in illegal acts and was therefore an unfit parent. When
the case reached the Virginia Supreme Court in 1993, the Court upheld the original
ruling and noted that “conduct inherent in lesbianism” is punishable as a felony in
Virginia and “that conduct is another important consideration in determining cus-
tody.” In another case, Robin Shahar’s offer of employment at the Georgia attorney
general’s office was rescinded when her employer, Michael Bowers, learned of her
upcoming commitment ceremony to another woman. When Shahar sued, Bowers
cited Georgia’s sodomy law as a defense, arguing that employing a lesbian is akin
to employing someone committing ongoing criminal behavior. The Eleventh Cir-
cuit sided with Bowers and denied the basis for Shahar’s anti-discrimination suit.
Bottoms v. Bottoms, Shahar v. Bowers, and the history of sexual regulation show
how sodomy laws not only governed private sexual conduct, but also shaped the
categories in which people were placed and the enduring associations attached to
those categories. Sodomy laws effectively created a criminal class, giving legal jus-
tification to intrusions into the private lives of gays and lesbians. Over the course of
the twentieth century, sodomy statutes defined homosexuals as a class on the mar-
gins of the law and gave legal ammunition to the opponents of sexual liberty.

South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364 (1976)
\
South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364 (1976)
In this case, Mr. Opperman’s automobile had been impounded by police for
being illegally parked. While in possession of the vehicle, officers conducted a rou-
tine search and inventory of all the items found inside. The search included the
main section of the car as well as the glove compartment. While logging the items
within the glove compartment, the officers found a small amount of marijuana.
When Opperman arrived at the station to retrieve his property and to reclaim his
vehicle, he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. 
At the trial, a police officer testified that the purpose of the search was to protect
the valuable items that were seen in the vehicle. He stated that the impound lot was
not well protected, and since cars had been broken into, the department thought it
prudent to search and inventory all the items inside the vehicles within their cus-
tody. Opperman’s motion to suppress the discovery of the marijuana was denied by
the trial court, and he was convicted and sentenced to a $100 fine and 14 days in
county jail.
On appeal, the Supreme Court of South Dakota reversed the conviction on the
grounds that the search made by the officers had not been reasonable, and that it
had been a violation of Opperman’s Fourth Amendment rights of privacy. After
granting a writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the
state court. The Court reasoned that the nature of an automobile is not the same
as the nature of a home. As such, the reasonable expectation of privacy in an
automobile is less than the expectation of privacy in a home. In other words, the
restrictions that bind law enforcement will be less strict when conducting
searches of automobiles than when conducting searches within homes. In this
case, Opperman’s automobile had been subject to a legal seizure because the
vehicle had been parked in a no-parking zone for an extended period of time. The
Court justified the local police department’s standard search and inventory prac-
tices based on three reasons. First, the court recognized a legitimate need to pro-
tect the items found inside an impounded vehicle from unexpected loss or theft.
Second, there was a legitimate need to protect police from claims of lost or sto-
len items while vehicles were legally within their custody. Finally, the Court
found the department’s practices reasonable because of the need to protect the
officers and department from potentially dangerous items inside impounded
vehicles. 
Furthermore, the Court looked to the Fourth Amendment standard for reason-
ableness to determine the scope of constitutionally protected inventory searches. It
concluded that inventory searches conducted under the circumstances in this case
were not the same as searches that required probable cause in order to be reason-
able. The probable cause standard for a reasonable search was not applicable to this
case. Since a search requiring probable cause typically occurred in criminal investi-
gations, it was not necessary for searches conducted under routine inventory cir-
cumstances, where there was no reasonable belief of criminal activity, to meet the
same probable cause standard. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not
require that every search be conducted only after probable cause has been estab-
lished. Rather, it held that every search be conducted within the realm of reason-
ableness, a concept established through the totality of circumstances surrounding
the specific situation. 

South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364 (1976)
\
519
The Court ultimately ruled that Opperman was not entitled to an order to sup-
press the evidence because the search had been conduced within the realm of rea-
sonableness. The decision was supported by Justices Burger, Blackmun, Powell,
Rehnquist, and Stevens. Their opinion asserted that the fact that the search was
conducted in an automobile gave the police department more leeway under the pro-
tections of the Fourth Amendment. The Court held that since the automobile had
been legally impounded and the search had been done as a routine safety precau-
tion, it was reasonable for the officers to conduct the search. Moreover, the type of
search conducted had not been related to a criminal investigation and therefore was
not required to meet the probable cause standard typically required for most
searches to be legitimate under the Fourth Amendment. 
The dissenting argument in this case was that case law was clear as to under
what circumstances the right to privacy in an automobile was just as merited as the
right in a home. The dissenting judges—White, Marshall, Brennan, and Stewart—
rationalized that people were likely to store their papers and effects in their auto-
mobiles from time to time and were entitled to the same expectation of privacy that
they would have in their homes.
Further, the dissent disagreed with the opinion that the routine search into an
automobile for the protection of valuable items should be without the same consti-
tutional requirements as other searches. The testimony in the case stated that the
search had been conducted as a standard procedure and not because there was any-
thing valuable in plain view. There was no reason to believe that anything valuable
existed inside the vehicle. To enter into the vehicle for no reason was absolutely a vio-
lation of an individual's right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, if
an item of some value could be seen in plain view, the entry into a locked vehicle to
obtain that item for the protection of the owner does not permit the continued
search into the enclosed glove compartment. The right to search the vehicle for
items surpassed the point of reasonableness once the search was extended to areas
that were not in plain view, such as a suitcase, a bag, or a glove compartment. 
The dissent argued that the majority opinion incorrectly drew a distinction
between the right to be secure in a home and the right to be secure in an automo-
bile. The dissent argued there was no difference, and that the right was equal in
both circumstances. Also, the dissent disagreed with the belief that there was not a
need for the same constitutional requirements that all other searches must have.
The reasonableness and extent of this search needed to be based on the same stan-
dards that apply to other intrusions. The fact that this search had been undertaken
without criminal suspicion did not excuse it from the same limitations specified
within the Constitution.

Spam
Spam refers to unsolicited or unwanted electronic mail, usually sent in large
quantities and consisting of commercial advertisements. Spam has been described
as “the scourge of the Information Age.” The vast majority of e-mail sent today is
spam, although much of it is diverted before delivery. Spam is generally viewed as
objectionable because of its often offensive content, the resources it consumes, its
effects on computer and network security, and the secondary effects of responses
to spam. A variety of technological and legal mechanisms have been deployed
against spam, although it has proven to be an extremely persistent problem.
Most efforts to define spam limit it to unsolicited messages—those sent to recip-
ients who have no relationship to the sender, and who have not consented to receive
the messages. Because some unsolicited messages are unobjectionable, however,
the definition of spam is usually further limited to include only commercial mes-
sages or those sent to a large number of recipients within a short period of time.
Spam therefore is commonly described as unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE) or
unsolicited bulk email (UBE).
There are many other definitions of spam. In some e-mail systems, for example,
spam-filtering criteria are determined based upon the messages that individual
users choose to identify as spam, rather than by application of objective criteria.
Spam may also be defined based upon the sender’s failure to comply with various
rules, such as disclosure requirements or processes for collecting or removing
addresses from a mailing list.
The most common technological response to spam is the deployment of auto-
mated techniques that attempt to identify which incoming messages are spam, then
block or divert those messages while permitting legitimate messages to pass
through. Filtering and blocking can be performed by end users or by service pro-
viders who receive e-mail on the end users’ behalf. All filtering technologies carry
a risk of false positives, false negatives, or both. Because the danger that legitimate
communications will be lost if the rate of false positives is too high, users tend to
prefer more conservative filters, despite the fact that they permit more spam to pass
through undetected. A mechanism that merely flags or temporarily diverts putative
spam rather than blocking it completely is another viable option.
Filtering technologies often employ whitelists and blacklists—lists of addresses
from which a particular recipient does or does not wish to receive e-mail messages,
regardless of other message characteristics. A related approach, a challenge-and-
response system, requires unrecognized senders to respond to an automated challenge
message before their e-mail will be delivered to the recipient. Challenge-and-response
systems have been widely criticized for the overhead they impose, especially on send-
ers, and many legitimate senders routinely ignore challenges, so such systems tend to
produce a high false positive rate in practice.
Many end users attempt to control circulation of their e-mail addresses in order
to limit the amount of spam they receive. For some this is a fairly effective method,
although it is impractical for those who want to publicize their addresses for legiti-

Spam
\
521
mate purposes, and it is common for senders of spam to gain unauthorized access
to lists of e-mail addresses by a variety of means.
Other technical responses to spam include limits on third-party relaying of e-
mail, limits imposed by service providers on their own users’ outbound e-mail, and
various methods of sender authentication. These approaches to date have had only
a limited impact on the volume of spam, but they may well fare better in the future.
Since the mid-1990s, spam has been the focus of hundreds or thousands of
court cases. Perhaps the two most important of these are CompuServe Inc. v.
Cyber Promotions, Inc., (1997) and Intel v. Hamidi. In CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber
Promotions, Inc., an e-mail marketing firm had unrelentingly sent unsolicited
e-mail advertisements to hundreds of thousands of CompuServe subscribers,
ignoring CompuServe’s objections and circumventing its efforts to block the mes-
sages. CompuServe sued, alleging that the messages amounted to a “trespass to
chattels” a somewhat obscure legal theory based upon unauthorized interference
with personal property. The court recognized the claim and enjoined the marketing
firm from sending unsolicited advertisements to CompuServe’s subscribers.
The same theory was used in many other spam-related cases following
CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc., but it was dealt a blow by the California
Supreme Court in the case of Intel Corp. v. Hamidi (2003). In this case, a disgruntled
former employee of Intel Corporation had waged a campaign against the company
and its practices, and as part of that campaign, the employee had sent mass e-mail
messages to thousands of Intel employees using their Intel e-mail addresses. Intel
demanded that he stop sending e-mail into its system and attempted to block the
messages on its own; the company then resorted to litigation after these efforts
were unsuccessful. The court rejected Intel’s trespass to chattels claim on the
ground that Intel could not demonstrate any direct injury to its e-mail system from
the messages; its objection was to the content and indirect effects of the messages,
which was deemed beyond the scope of the trespass tort.
Legislatures have also attempted to control spam, arguably with even less success
than the courts. More than half of the states in the United States enacted anti-spam leg-
islation between 1997 and 2003, although only two of these laws (in California and
Delaware) contained broad prohibitions on spam, neither of which was ever enforced.
In late 2003 the federal CAN-SPAM Act was enacted. CAN-SPAM primarily targets
fraudulent activities in commercial e-mail rather than the sending of spam itself. The
law did authorize the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish a registry of
addresses to which spam could not be sent; although the FTC elected not to implement
this provision of the law, in part because of concerns that the confidentiality of
addresses in the registry could not be assured. Some jurisdictions outside the United
States have enacted much stronger restrictions on spam, although to date the impact of
such laws on international spam, at least, seems to be fairly minimal.

Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969)
In Stanley v. Georgia, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the First and
Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution prohibit the government
from criminalizing the mere possession of obscene material if the material is held
privately. The Supreme Court drew a clear distinction between this case and its pre-
vious line taken in earlier cases that allowed states to criminalize pornography that
was either sold or distributed to the public. In this case, the Supreme Court focused
on the much more limited reach of the obscene material, in that it was merely pos-
sessed in the privacy of the defendant’s home. The sanctity of privacy in one’s own
home convinced the court to declare unconstitutional the Georgia criminal statute
against obscenity at issue in the case.
The defendant in the case, Mr. Stanley, faced an investigation for alleged
involvement in illegal bookmaking (betting) activities. A judge had issued a search
warrant, and federal and state agents searched Mr. Stanley’s home. Although they
found virtually no evidence of bookmaking, in the process of the search they
looked through a desk drawer in an upstairs bedroom. In this drawer they found
three reels of eight-millimeter film. The agents also discovered a projector and a
screen in an upstairs living room. Using these, they watched the films and seized
them after concluding that the films were obscene. 
The defendant was arrested and charged with knowing possession of obscene
material under Georgia law. The Georgia statute at issue criminalized the know-
ing possession of obscene material, and under the statute, “a matter is obscene if,
considered as a whole, applying contemporary community standards, its pre-
dominant appeal is to prurient interest, i.e., a shameful or morbid interest in
nudity, sex or excretion.” After a jury trial, he was convicted. The State Supreme
Court of Georgia affirmed his conviction, and he appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
Importantly, Mr. Stanley did not deny that the films were obscene; rather, he
focused his argument elsewhere. Although he raised numerous challenges in his
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court needed to focus on only one to over-
turn his conviction. The Court accepted his contention that by criminalizing the
mere private possession, the Georgia obscenity statute violated the First Amend-
ment, which applies with equal force to the states by virtue of its incorporation
under the Fourteenth Amendment. 

Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969)
\
523
The Court began by analyzing the Georgia Supreme Court’s earlier decision in
upholding the conviction against Mr. Stanley. That court had found the Georgia
statute constitutional because of earlier cases from the U.S. Supreme Court that
allowed the states to criminalize obscene material that was distributed or sold. It
found no meaningful distinction between the mere possession and the commercial
sale of obscene material. 
Nevertheless, both Mr. Stanley and the state of Georgia agreed that this case pre-
sented a case of first impression, in that no other case had presented the exact issue
under the facts of this case: “whether a statute imposing criminal sanctions upon
the mere knowing possession of obscene matter is constitutional.” 
The state of Georgia argued that the decision in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S.
476 (1957), made the case against Mr. Stanley an easy one. It pointed out that in
Roth, the U.S. Supreme Court had declared that “obscenity is not within the area
of constitutionally protected speech or press.” Thus, because the Supreme Court
had declared that obscenity is not speech protected by the First Amendment,
Georgia contended that the states may regulate obscene material without virtu-
ally any limits.
Despite the earlier line of cases such as Roth, however, the Supreme Court found
an enormous distinction based on the facts of Mr. Stanley’s case. In rejecting Geor-
gia’s argument, the Court noted that “neither Roth nor any subsequent decisions of
this Court dealt with the precise problem involved in the present case.” Those ear-
lier cases dealt with mailing and advertising obscene material, which involved pub-
lic distribution in some manner. Therefore, none of the earlier statements by the
Court “were made in the context of a statute punishing mere private possession of
obscene material.”
The Court then reemphasized that this case was different from all the rest before
it. And, although those earlier cases might have deemed obscene speech to be not
fully protected by the First Amendment, the Court refused to find obscene speech
to be completely outside the scope of the First Amendment. The Court insisted that
the earlier precedent merely established that the government has an “important
interest in the regulation of commercial distribution of obscene material. That hold-
ing cannot foreclose an examination of the constitutional implications of a statute
forbidding mere private possession of such material.” 
With this backdrop, the Court formulated its general defense for the First
Amendment right of the freedom to receive information and ideas. The Court con-
cluded, “This right to receive information and ideas, regardless of their social
worth is fundamental to our free society. Moreover, in the context of this case—a
prosecution for mere possession of printed or filmed matter in the privacy of a per-
son's own home—that right takes on an added dimension. For also fundamental is
the right to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from unwanted govern-
mental intrusions into one’s privacy.” This dual privacy concern gave the Court
enormous pause in upholding a statute that criminalized the mere possession of
pornography in one’s own home. The Court concluded, “If the First Amendment
means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in
his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch. Our whole
constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to con-
trol men’s minds.” While recognizing the remaining right of states to regulate

524
Stephanie’s law
\
obscene material in the public realm, the Court refused to extend that power to con-
trol against an individual’s mere private possession.

Stephanie’s law
Stephanie’s law was signed into law by New York Governor George E. Pataki on
June 23, 2003, and has been in effect since August 4, 2003. This New York law
joined several other states’ laws that criminally prohibit the secret surveillance of
individuals in their homes, private residencies, and other places that individuals
would expect privacy. Named after Long Island resident Stephanie Fuller, whose
landlord, William Shultz, had secretly videotaped her bedroom in her rented apart-
ment, Stephanie’s law updated state and local “Peeping Tom” and privacy statutes
in New York. Stephanie’s law provided stricter punishment for video voyeurism or
any form of secret surveillance; however, the law also set limited boundaries on
where and when individuals’ rights to privacy will be protected. Thus, while indi-
viduals’ right to privacy is protected from secret surveillance in their private homes
and in some public settings, Stephanie’s law does not protect violations of privacy
in public space. 
In response to many national incidents of video voyeurism, New York enacted
Stephanie’s law in order to expand protections of privacy to include incidents
where voyeurs used new types of technology. Fuller discovered she was being
secretly videotaped by landlord Schultz when her boyfriend noticed strange wires
coming out of the smoke alarm in her bedroom. Police later found videotapes in
Shultz’s apartment, and Fuller was worried that he was selling on the Internet.
Because Schultz used a video camera that was not filming Fuller through a win-
dow, he could not be charged with as violating New York’s “Peeping Tom” laws.
Instead, Mr. Schultz was charged with trespassing; he thus received a fine of
$1500 and was sentenced to three years probation and 280 hours of community ser-
vice. A previous anti-voyeuristic statute in New York, Article 26 of the General
Business law, included a $300 fine and 15 days of imprisonment for video voyeur-
ism. However it could not be used to prosecute Shultz as the law did not prohibit
secret surveillance in private residences. Fuller also discovered similar cases where
perpetrators faced other charges for video voyeurism. Other landlords had been
found taping their residents, and a kindergarten teacher was charged with endan-
germent of a minor after filming five girls putting on their swimsuits. Arguing that

Stephanie’s law
\
525
these crimes were similar to sexual assault, Fuller began a state-wide campaign.
Fuller, joined by other previous victims, lobbied the state legislature for two years
to redefine the laws to take into account new types of surveillance technology and
classify these types of privacy invasions as sexual assaults. 
Stephanie’s law amends New York penal code to redefine unlawful surveillance
as a Class E felony, punishable by up to four years imprisonment for first offenders,
and up to seven years for repeat offences (§70.00[2][e] New York Penal Code,
§250.5 New York Penal Code). Under the law, a video voyeur can face two sepa-
rate charges of criminal unlawful surveillance and dissemination of an unlawful
surveillance image regardless of the type of camera or device used in the crime.
The law defines unlawful surveillance as the use or instillation of a recording or
imaging device to view, broadcast, or record a person dressing and undressing, or
his or her sexual or private parts for the purpose of entertainment of profit without
the individual’s permission and where the person has a reasonable expectation of
privacy (§250 New York Penal Law). Thus, under this new law, Shultz could have
been prosecuted for installing the video camera in Fuller’s bedroom as well as for
selling any of his tapes over the Internet. In addition, the law requires offenders to
register with the state sex offender registry. Therefore under Stephanie’s law,
offenders who violate victims’ privacy in turn lose their right to privacy. 
Stephanie’s law joins several other state laws that restrict video voyeurism includ-
ing laws in the state of Washington, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Virginia, California, and
Illinois. Like these states’ anti-voyeurism laws, Stephanie’s law focuses its protection
of privacy on the physical location where the incident occurred rather than on the
individual privacy invasion committed. Although Stephanie’s law provides tougher
sentences on voyeurism than past state laws, many legal critics argue that the law will
do little to protect individuals in public spaces. The law prevents individuals from
using electronic devices under an individual’s clothing, known as “upskirting”; how-
ever, the law only prohibits such acts in places where an individual has a reasonable
expectation of privacy. Thus under Stephanie’s law, individual privacy is protected in
a private place such as a “bedroom, changing room, fitting room, restroom, toilets,
bathroom, washroom, shower, and any room assigned to guests or patrons in a motel,
hotel, or inn” (§250.50 New York Penal Code). The law, however, does not protect
individual privacy in public spaces such as malls, restaurants, bus stops, or other
crowded areas where upskirting is likely to take place. For example, in the state of
Washington, with a similar anti-voyeurism law, two men, Mr. Glas and Mr. Wells,
who were convicted of videotaping and upskirting women in a local mall, were later
acquitted by the state court because “public places could not logically constitute loca-
tions where a person could reasonably expect to be safe from casual or hostile intru-
sion of surveillance” (State vs. Glas, Wash. 2d 410, 2002). 
California approved additional amendments when previous anti-voyeurism laws
did not protect individuals from several incidents of video voyeurism, including
upskirtings in public stores and malls. Following an incident where a man used a
gym bag to upskirt several dozen women in crowded stores, the California legisla-
ture amended existing laws to focus on the individual violation acts rather than the
location. Thus under §647[k][1] of California Penal Code, it is illegal to use hidden
cameras to photograph or record another identifiable person under or through that
person’s clothing for sexual gratification without consent or knowledge of the person.

526
Stephanie’s law
\
Although the California code also stipulates that the act should occur under cir-
cumstances where the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy, the Califor-
nia law also protects people in public spaces because it includes acts that invade
under and through clothing. The expectation is that people are using clothing to
protect their privacy, and that using cameras over or through the clothing is in itself
an invasion regardless of whether it occurs in public or private spaces. 
Unfortunately, video voyeurs have a loophole within the California law as well.
In order to be found guilty, the state must prove that the video voyeur took the
images for sexual gratification or arousal, and the victim must be identifiable.
These two loopholes are problematic as they exclude a majority of invasion of pri-
vacy acts. Since most upskirting does not include the victim’s face, California law
exempts most types of these invasions. In addition, including a sexual gratification
clause excludes secret taping used for entertainment or commercial website use.
Thus, Stephanie’s law provides more protection than its Californian counterpart
since the New York law does not require the victim to be identifiable and recog-
nizes that video voyeurism may be for profit. 
Victims of upskirting and secret surveillance find the most protection in Illinois.
The Illinois anti-voyeurism law prohibits using concealed video and photographic
equipment through or under the clothes worn by another person for the purpose of
viewing the body or undergarments without the person’s consent (section 5/26-4
Illinois Criminal Code).
Although limited, Stephanie’s law provides stricter protections against invasions
of privacy with video cameras and other recording devices. Supporters of
Stephanie’s law, including Fuller herself, argue that the law updates the protection
of privacy to include new types of surveillance and treats offenders appropriately.
Moreover, Stephanie’s law expands privacy protection into areas where privacy
was always assumed to be protected, including private residences and changing
rooms. Several state legislators who supported the law argued that it not only
updated laws that had provided loopholes to high-tech video voyeurs but also pro-
vided a necessary deterrent through the implementation of prison time. Critics of
the statue, however, claimed that the law is too strict on offenders rather than too
lax in its definitions of privacy. If convicted under Stephanie’s law, individuals may
face between two to seven years imprisonment and must register with the state’s
sex offender registry when released. Some argue that this punishment is too severe
for a nonphysical assault, especially when victims cannot be identified as in many
incidents of upskirting. Instead, critics argue that stricter trespassing laws and or
counseling is a more appropriate way of dealing with video voyeurs than prison
time.

Sterilization

Sterilization
Sterilization is a surgical procedure designed to prevent reproduction. Legally
and politically in the United States, sterilization is couched in terms of the right of
the state to control humans through health and safety regulations versus the indi-
vidual’s right to control her or his own body. Socially, however, sterilization prac-
tices resonate with social control measures disproportionately targeted at certain
minority groups.
The right to control one’s body is not explicitly a constitutional protection;
rather, it is an assumption grounded in private property rights. Historically chil-
dren, slaves, servants, and women were denied bodily autonomy. For example,
slaves were owned by masters, and wives were subject to the whims of their hus-
bands. While the issue has been modified for other adults, many feminist scholars
continue to argue that bodily autonomy of women is not equal to that of men. Dur-
ing the twentieth century, the U.S. Supreme Court emphasized bodily privacy
rights in contrast to private property considerations. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U.S. 479 (1965) established that individuals have some guarantees of bodily pri-
vacy based on interpretations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments.
But this has limitations as well. For example, the Court has appeared to use pri-
vate property definitions at times and privacy issues at other times. The Skinner v.
Oklahoma (1942) case establishing that reproduction is a right also determined that
the state has a right to prevent procreation for those on public assistance. The
boundaries between public and private control of the human body are not fixed, and
judgments continue to be less systematically applied, particularly when minority
groups (women, people of color, gays, lesbians, and transsexuals) are concerned.
Coerced or compulsory sterilization is a birth control practice most frequently
associated with the eugenics movement, a social and medical movement designed
to improve the quality of the overall population through reproductive controls. The
movement’s early twentieth-century objective was to eliminate social and biologi-
cal problems such as poverty and birth defects through both positive and negative
eugenic measures. Positive strategies included character and behavior training pro-
grams designed for Anglo Saxons (population augmentation). Negative strategies
involved sterilization and immigration restrictions (population control). The move-
ment occurred during a time of rapid industrialization, urbanization, and immigra-
tion, all of which contributed to the idea that the lower classes of society would
outnumber the upper strata, presumably causing genetic deterioration. 
Courts devised compulsory sterilization primarily for developmentally disabled
persons but also targeted homosexual, indigent, deaf, blind, epileptic, criminal, and
physically deformed populations. In addition, many leaders of the eugenics move-
ment attempted to enlist government approval for sterilization on a much broader
scale. By 1920, 10 states had legislated authority to sterilize certain individuals
convicted of criminal offenses as well as those confined to asylums for the insane.
In contrast to the larger scientific community, courts generally supported eugenics
laws to protect public health and safety. Judicial advocates argued that genetic
deterioration was an impending risk that warranted violation of civil liberties. 
The U.S. Supreme Court decision Buck v. Bell (1927) was one of the most
sweeping compulsory sterilization cases. Carrie Buck, a 17-year-old developmen-
tally disabled girl, had been involuntarily committed to the Virginia Colony for the

528
Sterilization
\
Epileptic and Feeble-Minded. Judges permitted Ms. Buck’s sterilization (without
consent) by means of salpingectomy (tubal ligation). The logic behind the decision
rested on the notion that she would endanger the general population by procreating
if she was released. Attorneys for the state argued that her family presented a
genetic predisposition for mental incapacitation, and sterilization was a reliable
method of preventing further reproduction of the feebleminded. The strong support
for sterilization given by Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., pro-
vided the justification for continued practices. As a result of this ruling, many
states engaged in widespread compulsory sterilization practices, terminating these
only when legislative incentives prohibited the practice. The original case, how-
ever, has never been reversed. The Buck case occurred in a cultural context of fear
and intimidation of various minority groups as well as the expansion of state
authority over private matters. More importantly, the case illustrates the tensions
between the goal of individual bodily liberty and the state’s right to impose restric-
tions through public health, social reform, or other political measures.
Although the eugenics movement was struck a serious blow when prominent
Nazi officials revealed that their genocide policies were based on the logic and
practice of sterilization techniques used in the United States, coercive sterilization
was still performed in the United States until the 1970s, just in more subtle forms.
For example, as part of their ongoing medical training, surgical residents per-
formed tubal ligations on Hispanic women and radical hysterectomies on Native
American women. Members of these groups were not informed about the nature of
the procedures. In other situations, medical authorities denied African American
welfare recipients obstetric care until they agreed to undergo sterilization proce-
dures. Once the media exposed these practices, sterilization measures largely
ended, and governors of the states involved issued public apologies.
Sterilization measures did not end completely, however; they were simply trans-
formed into more surreptitiously manipulative techniques. Such was the case with
the use and abuse of Norplant, the contemporary link to the eugenics movement.
Introduced in 1991, Norplant is a progesterone-based contraceptive including six
small cylindrical one-inch tubes that are implanted in a woman’s upper arm by a
medical practitioner. Each tube releases a dose of progesterone for five years.
Boasting a 99 percent effectiveness rate, some policymakers refer to Norplant as a
form of temporary sterilization since it can be reversed. Only traditional forms of
sterilization are more effective. Since use of Norplant requires virtually nothing
from the recipient as compared to other contraceptive measures, it appeared to be a
liberating form of birth control. But within a year of its introduction, use of Nor-
plant became the means by which the state attempted to reduce the reproductive
choice of certain groups of women. Historically, sterilization rates have been con-
sistently highest with African American, Native American, Puerto Rican, and poor
women. It is these very populations that have been the primary targets for Norplant.
Once Norplant was introduced to the general population, various constituen-
cies attempted to issue directives for its use. While studies revealed that medical
professionals gave erroneous information to African American, Native Ameri-
can, Puerto Rican, and poor female clients, judicial advocates instituted more
sweeping measures. Judges offered women convicted of child or drug abuse the
choice of extended jail time or reduced jail time accompanied with the use of

Stop and frisk
\
529
Norplant. Policymakers in 13 states created bills designed to coerce women to
use Norplant. Some bills provided that upon the birth of a child to a welfare
recipient, the state would pose the choice of Norplant to prevent any further preg-
nancies or threaten loss of benefits. Others offered money, food, and clothing in
return for using Norplant. Although none of the bills introduced was officially
passed, that the measures were considered precariously links the contemporary
political and social climate and practices to the larger historic arena of the eugen-
ics movement.
The logic of the proposed legislation was genuinely flawed, since blatant stereo-
types regarding welfare abuse-women on public assistance have more children, for
example-were used as causes of societal problems. Further, mandating Norplant
would not have been a solution to the problems of drug or child abuse. The link to
sexism is striking since no such measures have ever been proposed for men con-
victed of drug abuse. The assumption that women were still the group solely
responsible for birth control clearly bolstered the initiatives. Further, the high rates
of sterilization of women of color, coupled with insufficient health care for that
group, suggested not only population control, but institutional racism and sexism. 
Most importantly however, sterilization use and abuse should not be limited to
an analysis of civil liberties exclusively. The state defines the issue as an issue of
rights: the right of the individual’s personal liberty versus the right of the state to
protect the larger well-being of society through health and safety regulations. How-
ever, this presents a significant contradiction. States also have attempted to prose-
cute individual women on the basis of fetal rights. A fetal right is a right for an
unborn being whose existence is legally disputed. Yet if the state coerces adminis-
tration of Norplant, then the fetus, the being whose existence is in legal limbo, will
be prevented from coming into existence. So by preventing the existence of the
unborn fetus, its nonexistence is ensured. Such practices underscore the fact that
individual rights are not the primary concern; rather, social control issues are most
relevant. As privacy interests are structured through race, class, gender, and sexu-
ality, a policy designed exclusively around issues of privacy will most likely fail to
address the full extent of coerced sterilization and other reproductive abuses
against minority groups.

Stop and frisk
Despite Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and sei-
zures, police officers may stop pedestrians and subject them to a “pat-down search”
without a search warrant under certain circumstances. The process has come to be
called a “stop and frisk.”

530
Stop and frisk
\
The landmark case approving a stop and frisk search was Terry v. Ohio, 392
U.S. 1 (1968). In that case, the Court acknowledged that “we deal here with an
entire rubric of police conduct—necessarily swift action predicated upon the on-
the-spot observations of the officer on the beat—which historically has not been,
and as a practical matter could not be, subjected to the warrant procedure. Instead,
the conduct involved in this case must be tested by the Fourth Amendment’s gen-
eral proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.” 
The Court went on to rule that for a warrantless stop to be constitutionally
acceptable, “the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts
which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant
that intrusion.” The Court went on to suggest an objective test for review of an
officer’s actions: “would the facts available to the officer at the moment of the sei-
zure or the search ‘warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief’ that the action
taken was appropriate?”
Notice, there is nothing in the Court’s instructions about protecting a pedes-
trian's expectations of privacy. Instead, the Court said there must be a balancing
between “the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or sei-
zure] entails.” The Court specifically held that “inarticulate hunches,” or good faith
alone, would not be sufficient to justify a stop or a search. “If subjective good faith
alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and
the people would be ‘secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,’ only in
the discretion of the police.”
There are two elements to a stop and frisk: the stop and the search. Initially, the
courts were quite strict in limiting the justifications for stopping citizens. Slowly, the
courts adopted a more liberal “reasonable suspicion of criminal activity” test to jus-
tify the stops. Law enforcement agencies instructed police that justifiable reasons for
a Terry stop included but were not limited to: (1) a person does not seem to fit in the
neighborhood; (2) a person matches a description of a person known to be sought by
law enforcement agencies; (3) a person is loitering, hanging around a set location
with no clear purpose, or is acting strangely; and, (4) a person is running away from
or is present in a crime-scene area.
There were still problems for police officers because many of the actions they
believed were suspicious were activities engaged in by law-abiding citizens. Since
Fourth Amendment rights apply only when there has been a seizure of a person, the
courts began to focus on when a “seizure” had occurred in an effort to reduce the
difficulties in analyzing the justification for a stop in the first place. The result was
that the test became not why did the officer stop someone for questioning, but
rather did the person who was stopped believe that leaving was possible. 
The Court addressed the freedom to leave issue in United States v. Mendenhall,
446 U.S. 544 (1980). In that case, Sylvia Mendenhall was going from one plane to
another in a Detroit airport when she was observed by Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration (DEA) agents, who believed she was acting suspiciously. The agents
stopped her to request identification. When she produced a driver’s license in one
name and an airplane ticket in another name, the officers asked her to accompany
them to an office on another floor in the airport. She agreed. Once in the office,
Mendenhall was asked if she would consent to a strip search. Again, she agreed. A
female officer escorted Mendenhall to a restroom and conducted the search. Heroin

was found. Mendenhall later argued her stop in the airport and the later search vio-
lated her Fourth Amendment rights.
The Supreme Court found the stop did not amount to a “seizure” and stated, 
We adhere to the view that a person is “seized” only when, by means of physical force
or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained. Only when such
restraint is imposed is there any foundation whatever for invoking constitutional safe-
guards. The purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to eliminate all contact between
the police and the citizenry, but “to prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by
enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals” (United
States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976)). As long as the person to whom ques-
tions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away, there has been no
intrusion upon that person's liberty or privacy as would under the Constitution require
some particularized and objective justification.
When the initial contact between police and suspect is not on a street but in a bus
or on a train, the freedom to leave question makes less sense. Thus, in Florida v.
Bostick, 501 U.S. 429 (1991), the Supreme Court defined the appropriate question
as “whether a reasonable person would feel free to decline the officers’ requests or
otherwise terminate the encounter.”
Once a suspect has been stopped, there is no automatic right to frisk. Officers
must have an articulable reason to justify the invasion of a person’s privacy. Con-
cern about an officer’s safety or the safety of others must be established, but it is
fairly easy for officers to legitimately make that claim. For example, when persons
refuse to answer questions or attempt to leave and avoid the officer, those acts in
themselves can justify a Terry search.
The Terry decision was limited to a search for weapons with the intent of pro-
tecting the safety of investigating officers. In 1993, however, the Supreme Court
expanded the permissible scope of an officer’s seizure “if in the course of a weap-
ons frisk, ‘plain touch’ reveals presence of an object that the officer has probable
cause to believe is contraband, the officer may seize that object” Minnesota v.
Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993). Ironically, in Dickerson, the Court rejected an
officer’s seizure of a small plastic container, ruling the officer should not have con-
tinued his search by manipulating the container with his fingers while it was still in
the defendant’s pocket since the officer had determined the suspect did not have a
weapon.
The concept of a Terry search has also been extended by the courts to include
items a person may be carrying if there is a “reasonable, articulable suspicion, pre-
mised on objective facts” that the items being carried contain contraband or evi-
dence of a crime.

Strip search
A strip search is a search of an individual by a law enforcement officer or other
agent of government that requires the rearrangement or—more commonly—
removal of some or all of the person’s clothing to permit the visual inspection of
the body, especially the private parts—the genitals, anus, and breasts—for weap-
ons, illegal goods (contraband), or evidence of a crime. A body cavity search, a
variant of the strip search, involves the internal physical examination of body cavi-
ties, including (in unusual circumstances) internal organs. Strip searches constitute
the most intrusive and dehumanizing type of search, and thus are among the most
serious encroachments on personal privacy. Since most strip searches are con-
ducted on people in police custody, it is in such situations that the practice most
often comes into conflict with privacy rights.
Although strip searches of arrested individuals have a long history in Anglo-
American law and were well established in the American colonies before their
independence, the topic gained visibility and widespread public awareness only in
the second half of the twentieth century. A number of reasons account for this. One
was the enhanced consciousness of privacy rights in an era that first saw the
Supreme Court recognize, in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), a con-
stitutional right to privacy. Another was the greater importance given rights of
those accused or convicted of crimes as part of the “due process revolution” of the
1960s. This was partly fueled by accusations that strip searches were often used to
harass, intimidate, and humiliate prisoners. Also a factor was the greater promi-
nence of the War on Drugs and the awareness that dealers and users could find
ingenious ways of secreting controlled substances, money, or weapons within their
bodies. A final factor was the sensationalistic media attention given to anything
related to nudity. 
Constitutional protections and regulation of strip searches are grounded in the
Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches. While much of
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has focused on questions surrounding the
searching of areas such as homes and residences, offices, and automobiles, rela-
tively less attention has been given to searches of the body, and many questions
await full definition. Generally, the courts have upheld strip searches as searches
“incident to arrest,” a major category of exceptions to the requirement of a search
warrant.
The key Supreme Court decision involving strip searches was Bell v. Wolfish
(1979). This case arose out of the overcrowded conditions and administrative prac-
tices, including strip searches, in New York City’s Metropolitan Correctional Cen-
ter (MCC), particularly those practices affecting pretrial detainees. While

Strip search
\

acknowledging the offensive character of strip searches, the Court also noted that
those in custody, even if not convicted of a crime, have a “diminished” rather than
reasonable expectation of privacy. In overturning a lower court decision that
found the detainees’ rights had been violated, the Court refrained from laying down
detailed rules for prison management and instead stated that a wide-ranging defer-
ence should be accorded to the judgment of correctional officials. Ultimately, it put
forth a balancing test that pitted the individual prisoner’s reduced privacy interest
against the state’s security interest in maintaining order and safety in the facility. In
this context, it found the MCC’s use of strip searches was not unreasonable. 
After Bell, the Supreme Court offered little guidance as to what might characterize
an unreasonable strip search, although the Court left open the possibility that such a
circumstance might exist. It fell to the state and lower federal courts to wrestle with
the issue. Although not always consistent, a pattern did emerge. While continuing
Bell’s deference toward penal authorities and upholding, for example, random strip
searches of prison inmates, the courts have generally held that there must be some
basis for strip searches of pretrial detainees, and that blanket provisions that all per-
sons detained by police be strip searched regardless of the alleged offense or circum-
stance of arrest go too far. While some judges have argued in favor of a standard of
probable cause that a strip search will uncover contraband or weapons, the most
widely accepted standard is that of “reasonable suspicion”: an officer’s ability to
articulate grounds for suspecting that a person might be secreting such material
would be sufficient to justify a strip search. General circumstances in which strip
searches might be justified include the following: when the person has been arrested
for a crime that involves weapons, violence, force, or contraband; when the person
has a record of a past arrest—even for a minor offense; when the person would be
likely to remain in custody for some time; when the person would be likely to mingle
freely with other prisoners; or, when the person has been deemed to be a danger to
himself or others. A search warrant, of course, can also justify a strip search.
The courts also made it clear that otherwise constitutional searches could be
conducted in a manner that would make them illegal. For example, the Chicago
Police Department’s practice of strip searching all female suspects taken into
custody while only frisking males was ruled unconstitutional in 1983. In other
cases, persons arrested for minor offenses and lacking past arrest records of the
sort that would arouse reasonable suspicion have been held to have been strip
searched illegally.
The courts have established a variety of general rules that should apply to the
manner of strip searches. Such searches should be done by officers of the same sex
as the person being searched, officers of the opposite sex should not be present in
the same space, and the space should itself offer protection from outside observa-
tion. Strip searches may be done in the field only in emergency circumstances.
Moreover, records of strip searches should be kept, including the reasons for the
search.
While the courts have labeled manual body cavity searches to be the most intru-
sive and invasive type of search, they have not consistently set a higher standard for
them than the reasonable suspicion that would allow visual strip searches. How-
ever, they are more likely to require a search warrant, and most jurisdictions require
that they be done by medical professionals.

534
Surveillance
\
As in other searches, one of the major sanctions against the abuse of strip
searches is the exclusionary rule barring from court any evidence gained in an
illegal search. Another recourse that has become increasingly common in chal-
lenging strip searches is to bring suit, sometimes as a class action. A number of
well-publicized decisions have found in favor of those who had been subjected to
strip searches. In 2004, for example, Sacramento County, California, agreed to pay
$15 million to some 16,000 people who had been illegally strip searched by the
county sheriff’s department from 2000 through 2003. Such suits have been espe-
cially common in challenging blanket strip search policies, and their success has
had a significant impact in prompting law enforcement agencies to change their
policies in the direction of more individualized criteria based on reasonable suspi-
cion. The courts have generally been less likely, however, to find police or correc-
tions personnel personally liable for illegal strip searches.
Law enforcement personnel continue to make widespread use of strip searches,
adjusting their policies and practices to judicial interpretation. In addition to stress-
ing that such searches are necessary to gathering evidence and keeping contraband
and weapons out of jails and prisons, law enforcement personnel also hold that
strip searches have a deterrent effect.
Although most strip searches and controversies involving them have originated
in the criminal justice system, they sometimes occur in other spheres as well. One
of these is in schools. School officials generally enjoy greater latitude in conduct-
ing searches than do police, and strip searches have sometimes been resorted to,
especially in efforts to locate drugs or stolen property. Here, too, the increasing
number of lawsuits has had a curbing effect. Some states, such as Iowa, have
banned school strip searches entirely. Many districts have either banned them or
greatly tightened the circumstances in which they can occur.
Some have predicted that new developments in imaging technology will make
strip searches obsolete in the twenty-first century. While less intrusive x-ray
devices may reduce the indignity and humiliation inherent in the process, it will
not necessarily mean an increase in privacy.

Surveillance
Perhaps it is fitting that the topic of surveillance, so shrouded in intrigue, is often
ambiguous and misunderstood. One error involves the common tendency to see
surveillance as the opposite of privacy. Another is to associate it only with govern-
ment and with law and order activities in particular. Privacy and surveillance can be
interwoven. Viewed in social process terms, they are different sides of the same

Surveillance
\
535
coin. Surveillance may be the means of crossing borders that protect privacy. This
is illustrated by strong public concern with the nefarious and multifarious elec-
tronic, chemical, and database means of collecting personally identifiable infor-
mation without the individual’s knowledge and consent. Yet surveillance can also
be the means of protecting privacy. Consider the passwords and audit trails
required to use some databases, or the various defensive measures such as a perim-
eter video camera used to protect the home. Whether surveillance or privacy inva-
sion is seen depends partly on the point of view taken.
When this duality is considered in the abstract, it is difficult to reach broad con-
clusions about the appropriateness of either surveillance or privacy. They can be
socially desirable, as well as destructive. Surveillance can serve goals of protection,
administration, rule compliance, documentation, and strategy, as well as goals
involving inappropriate manipulation, restricted life opportunities, social control,
and spying. Privacy can be central to an individual’s dignity and liberty as well as
to intimacy, honest communication, group borders, and democracy, but it can also
hide socially destructive behaviors such as abuse within families and white collar
crime.
With the development of new communication and computer technologies and
new ways of living that increasingly rely on non-face-to-face forms of interac-
tion, questions of personal information have taken on new social significance.
The microchip and computer are central to surveillance developments and, in
turn, reflect broader social forces set in motion with industrialization that involve
empirical documentation, rationality, bureaucracy, and capitalism. The increased
availability of personal information is one strand in the constant expansion of
knowledge witnessed in recent centuries, and of the centrality of information to
the workings of contemporary society.
The dictionary defines surveillance as “close observation, especially of a sus-
pected person” or persons. Examples include an individual suspected of bank rob-
bery who is discretely followed by police and is apprehended after robbing another
bank, or the discovery that a leader of an anti-globalization protest movement is a
police informer. 
The above examples are instances of “traditional surveillance,” and the dictio-
nary definition fits. Yet it is too narrow. The focus of surveillance goes beyond sus-
pects, crime, and national security. To varying degrees, surveillance is a property of
any social system—from two friends to a workplace to a government. Examples of
this understanding of surveillance include a supervisor monitoring an employee’s
productivity, a doctor assessing the health of a patient, a parent observing a child at
play in the park, the driver of a speeding car asked to show a driver’s license, or a
voyeur. Each of these also involves surveillance. 
Information boundaries and contests are found in all societies and in all living
systems. Humans are curious and yet also seek to protect their informational bor-
ders, even as they must also reveal their information. To survive, individuals and
groups engage in, and guard against, surveillance. Seeking information about oth-
ers, whether within or beyond one’s group, is characteristic of all societies, as are
efforts to protect information. However, the form, content, and rules about infor-
mation vary considerably. In the case of surveillance, for example, there are vari-
ations between relying on informers, intercepting smoke signals, taking satellite

photographs, gathering information from “cookies” placed on the computers of
Internet users, or mapping the spread of a contagious disease. With respect to
communicating information, there are differences between the expectation that
close friends will share secrets, the varied disclosure notice and Freedom of
Information Act requirements, and the expectations surrounding the confidential-
ity of sealed or classified records.
The traditional forms of surveillance contrast in important ways with what can
be called the “new surveillance,” a form that became increasingly prominent
toward the end of the twentieth century. The new social surveillance can be defined
as “scrutiny through the use of technical means to extract or create personal or
group data, whether from individuals or contexts.” Examples include the use of
video cameras; computer matching, profiling and data mining; work, computer,
and electronic location monitoring; DNA analysis; drug testing; brain scans for lie
detection; various self-administered tests; and thermal and other forms of imaging
to reveal what is behind walls and enclosures. The use of “technical means” to
extract and create the information implies the ability to go beyond what is offered
to the unaided senses or voluntarily reported. Much new surveillance involves an
automated process that extends the senses and cognitive abilities through using
material artifacts or software. 
Using the broader verb “scrutinize” rather than “observe” in the definition calls
attention to the fact that contemporary forms of surveillance often go beyond the
visual image to involve sound, smell, motion, numbers, and words. The eyes do
contain the vast majority of the body’s sense receptors, and the visual is a master
metaphor for the other senses (e.g., saying “I see” for “I understand”). Yet the eye
as the major means of direct surveillance is increasingly joined or replaced by other
means. The use of multiple senses and sources of data is an important characteristic
of much of the new surveillance. 
Traditionally, surveillance involved close observation by a person, not a
machine. But with contemporary practices, surveillance may be carried out from
afar, as with satellite imaging or the remote monitoring of communications and
work. Nor need it be done through close, detailed monitoring—much initial sur-
veillance involves superficial scans looking for patterns of interest to be pursued
later in greater detail. Surveillance has become both farther away and closer than
previously. It occurs with sponge-like absorbency and laser-like specificity. 
In a striking innovation, surveillance has also been applied to contexts (geo-
graphical places and spaces, particular time periods, networks, systems, and cate-
gories of person), not just to a particular person whose identity is known
beforehand. Moreover, the new surveillance technologies are often applied categor-
ically (e.g., all employees are drug tested or all travelers are searched, rather than
those whom there is some reason to suspect). 
Traditional surveillance often implied a noncooperative relationship and a clear
distinction between the object of surveillance and the person carrying it out. In an
age of servants listening behind closed doors, binoculars, and telegraph intercep-
tions that separation made sense. It was easy to distinguish the watcher from the
person being watched. In the new surveillance, with its expanded forms of self-
surveillance and cooperative surveillance, the easy distinction between the agent
and the subject of surveillance can be blurred.

In related forms, subjects may willingly cooperate by submitting to personal
surveillance in order to have consumer benefits (e.g., frequent flyer and shopper
discounts) or for convenience (e.g., access to fast-track lanes on toll roads for
which fees are paid in advance). Implanted chips transmitting identity and location
that were initially offered for pets are now available for their owners (and others) as
well. In some work settings, smart badges worn by individuals do the same thing,
although not with the same degree of voluntarism. 
Beyond the individual forms, surveillance at an aggregate level is central to
social management. The careful tracking of behavior through computer records
(referred to by Roger Clarke as “dataveillance”) is believed to offer a more rational
and efficient approach to social organization and control. The new surveillance rel-
ative to traditional surveillance has low visibility, or is often invisible. Manipula-
tion as against direct coercion has become more prominent. Monitoring may be
purposefully disguised as with a video camera hidden in a teddy bear or a clock. Or
it may simply come to be routinized and taken for granted as data collection is inte-
grated into everyday activities. For example, use of a credit card for purchases
automatically conveys information about consumption, time, and location of the
purchase. 
With the trend toward ubiquitous computing, surveillance and sensors in one
sense disappear into ordinary activities and objects, automobiles, cellular tele-
phones, toilets, buildings, clothes, and even bodies. The relatively labor-intensive
bar code on consumer goods that requires manual scanning may soon be replaced
with inexpensive embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) computer
chips that can be read automatically from short distances. The remote sensing of
preferences and behavior offers many advantages, such as controlling temperature
and lighting in a room or reducing shipping and merchandising costs, while also
generating records that can be used for surveillance. 
There may be only a short interval between the discovery of the information and
the automatic taking of action. The individual as a subject of data collection and
analysis may also become almost simultaneously the object of an intervention,
whether this involves the triggering of an alarm or the granting (or denial) of some
form of access, for example, the ability to enter through a locked door, use a com-
puter, or make a purchase. 
The new forms are relatively inexpensive per unit of data collected. Relative to tra-
ditional forms, it is easy to combine visual, auditory, text, and numerical data. It is
relatively easier to organize, store, retrieve, analyze, send, and receive data. Data are
available in real time, and data collection can be continuous and offer information on
the past, present, and future, as through statistical predictions. Simulated models of
behavior can then be created. The new surveillance is more comprehensive, intensive,
and extensive. The ratio of what the individual knows about himself or herself rela-
tive to what the surveilling organization knows is changing dramatically.
I. Surveillance Structures and Processes
Surveillance can be analyzed by breaking it into components. These indicate
where to look and what to measure. This can help in identifying the variation that is
central to explanation, understanding, and evaluation. Structures that are fixed at
one point in time (like a photograph) can be differentiated from processes that

538
Surveillance
\
involve interaction and developments over time (like a video). The next section
considers some surveillance structures.
Organizational surveillance is distinct from the non-organizational surveillance
carried on by individuals. As James Rules has noted, modern organizations are the
driving forces in the instrumental collection of personal data. As organizations
increasingly use personal data for what David Lyon calls social sorting, the impli-
cations for many aspects of life are profound, whether they involve work, con-
sumption, health, travel, or liberty. At the organizational level, formal surveillance
involves a constituency. This term is used broadly to refer to those with some rule-
defined relationship or potential connection to the organization. This may involve
formal membership or merely contact with the organization, as through renting a
video or showing a passport at a border. 
Organizations have varying degrees of internal and external surveillance. Erving
Goffman has identified many kinds of employee or inmate monitoring, such as
within “total institutions.” These offer examples of the internal constituency sur-
veillance found in organizations. Here individuals “belong” to the organization in a
double sense. First they belong as members. But they also in a sense are “belong-
ings” of the organization. They are directly subject to its control in ways that non-
members are not. Thus, there is a loose analogy to the ownership of property. 
External constituency surveillance is present when those who are watched have
some patterned contact with the organization, for example, as customers, patients,
malefactors, or citizens subject to the laws of the state. Those observed do not
“belong” to the organization the way that an employee or inmate does. Credit card
companies and banks, for example, monitor client transactions and also seek poten-
tial clients by mining and combining databases. The control activities of a govern-
ment agency charged with enforcing health and safety regulations is another
example. In this case, the organization is responsible for seeing that categories of
person subject to its rules are in compliance, even though they are not members of
the organization. The same compliance function can be seen with nongovernmental
organizations that audit or grant ratings, licenses, and certifications. 
In the case of external non-constituency surveillance, organizations monitor
their broader environment in watching other organizations and social trends. The
rapidly growing field of business intelligence seeks information about competitors,
social conditions, and trends that may affect an organization. One variant of this is
industrial espionage. Organizational planning (whether by government or the pri-
vate sector) also requires such external data, although this is usually treated in the
aggregate instead of in personally identifiable form. 
Personal surveillance, in which an individual watches another individual
(whether for protection, strategic, or prurient reasons) apart from an organizational
role, is another major form. It may involve role relationship surveillance as with
family members (parents and children, a suspicious spouse) or friends looking out
for and looking at each other (e.g., monitoring locations through use of a cell
phone). Or it can involve non-role relationship surveillance such as in the free-
floating activities of the voyeur whose watching is unconnected to a legitimate role.
With respect to the roles that are played, the surveillance agent (watcher/
observer/seeker) can be identified. The person about whom information is sought is
a surveillance subject. All persons can play both roles, although hardly in the same

Surveillance
\
539
form or degree. These roles may change depending on the context and over a per-
son’s life cycle; the roles are also sometimes blurred and may overlap.
Within the surveillance agent category, the surveillance function may be central
to the role, as with police, private investigators, spies, work supervisors, and
investigative reporters. Or it may simply be a peripheral part of a broader role
whose main goals are elsewhere. Illustrative of this are check-out clerks who are
trained to look for shoplifters, or dentists who are encouraged or required to report
suspected child abuse when seeing bruises on a child’s face. 
A distinction rich with empirical and ethical implications is whether a situation
involves those who are a party to the generation and collection of data (direct par-
ticipants) or instead involves third parties. Third parties may legitimately obtain
personal information through contracting with the surveillance agent (e.g., to carry
out drug tests or to purchase consumer preference lists). Or information may be
obtained because confidentiality has been violated by the agent, or because an out-
sider has obtained it illegitimately (e.g., wiretapping, hacking, corrupting those
with the information). 
The presence of third parties raises an important secondary-use issue: can data
collected for one purpose be used without an individual’s permission for unrelated
purposes? In Europe the answer generally is no. In the United States, where a much
freer market in personal information exists, there are fewer restrictions. Large orga-
nizations warehouse and sell vast amounts of very personal information, without
the consent and with no direct benefit to the subject. 
Surveillance can also be analyzed with respect to whether it is nonreciprocal
or reciprocal. Surveillance that is reciprocal may be asymmetrical or symmetrical
with respect to means and goals. In a democratic society, citizens and govern-
ment engage in reciprocal, but distinct forms of mutual surveillance. Citizens
can watch government through Freedom of Information Act requests, open hear-
ings and meetings, and conflict of interest and other disclosures required as a
condition for running for office. However, citizens can not legally wiretap, carry
out Fourth Amendment searches, or see others’ tax returns. In bounded settings
such as a protest demonstration, there may be greater equivalence with respect
to particular means; for example, police and demonstrators may videotape each
other. 
Agent-initiated surveillance, which is particularly characteristic of compliance
checks such as an inspection of a truck or a boat, can be differentiated from subject-
initiated surveillance such as submitting one’s transcript, undergoing osteoporosis
screening, or applying for a job requiring an extensive background investigation. In
these cases, the individual makes a claim or seeks help and essentially invites, or at
least agrees to, scrutiny. 
With agent-initiated surveillance, the goals of the organization are always
intended to be served. Yet this need not necessarily conflict with the interests of the
subject-the protection offered by school crossing guards and the efficient library
service that depends on good circulation records benefit the organization and the
subject. Public health and medical surveillance have multiple goals, protecting the
community as well as the individual. Efficiently run companies provide jobs and
services. Providing a limited amount of personal information on a warranty form
and having a chip record usage of an appliance, such as a lawn mower or a car, may

540
Surveillance
\
serve the interest of both consumers and businesses (e.g., being notified if the man-
ufacturer finds a problem or offering proof of correct usage if the device fails). 
Subject-initiated surveillance may reflect goals that serve the interests of the initi-
ator, but they often overlap the goals of the surveilling organization. Examples include
some protection services that have the capability to remotely monitor home and busi-
ness interiors (video, audio, heat, gas, motion detection) or health systems for the pro-
tection of the elderly and ill (e.g., an alarm is sent if the refrigerator of a person living
alone is not opened after 24 hours). Since these are forms of surveillance more likely
to involve informed consent, these are less controversial than secretly generated agent
surveillance. What is good for the organization may also be good for the individual,
although that is not always the case and depends on the context.
II. Surveillance Processes
Rather than being static and fixed at one point in time, surveillance can be
viewed as a fluid, ongoing process that involves interaction and strategic calcula-
tions over time. Part of the fascination with the study of surveillance lies in its
dynamic nature, as groups in conflict relationships reciprocally and continuously
adjust their tactics to each other. Here the moral ambivalence that infuses the topic
as a result of conflicting values and social interests can also be seen. 
The myth of surveillance involves creating and sustaining the belief through the
mass media that a technique is omnipresent and omnipotent. When such literal
watching (whether real or metaphorical) is not possible, there is an effort to create
uncertainty about whether or not surveillance is present. This is presumed to be a
deterrent. However, in a complex world of conflicting interests, unexpected devel-
opments, and technology that breaks, perfect knowledge and control are rarely pos-
sible. New conditions may appear and efforts to resist surveillance are common.
A number of behavioral techniques of neutralization—strategic moves by which
subjects of surveillance seek to subvert the collection of personal information.
Among these are direct refusal, discovery, avoidance, switching, distorting, coun-
tersurveillance, cooperation, blocking and masking. Responses to drug testing
illustrate most of these.
One type of response is refusal—just saying no or feigning an inability to offer
the sample in spite of trying. Social systems often leak, and the date of a supposed
random or surprise test or search can sometimes be inferred involving a discovery
move. Employees may receive notice of a test. Such foreknowledge permits avoid-
ance moves involving abstinence, the hiding or destroying of incriminating mate-
rial, not going to work on that day, or leaving early because of illness. With
switching, drug-free urine (whether purchased commercially in liquid or powdered
form, or obtained from a friend) replaces the person’s own urine. Distorting
responses (e.g., diuretics and commercially available detox products) manipulate
the surveillance-collection process such that while offering technically valid
results, invalid inferences are drawn. Given empathy and the multiplicity of actors
and interests in complex organizations, various cooperative moves in which con-
trollers aid those purportedly controlled may also be seen. 
Countersurveillance involves an ironic turning of the tables in which the very
technologies used to control others come to be used to advance the interests of
those controlled. Thus, when facing a urine drug test, employees can first experi-

Surveillance
\
541
ment at home, testing themselves with a variety of readily available products like
those used in the official test. The wide availability of new tools such as covert
audio and video recording offers the surveilled the chance to turn the usual stratifi-
cation tables. The resulting data can be used defensively or to coerce those in posi-
tions of authority since there is the potential, for example, for the documentation of
unwanted sexual advances and police abuse.
Another set of processes involves decisions about whether or not to surveil, and
if so which technique to use, how to apply it, and to whom (e.g., to everyone, ran-
domly, or selectively based on criteria). In addition, decisions need to be made
about: whether or not the surveilled are to be informed of and have any say in the
process or in how the data are used; who will have access to the data; what the
degree of security will be; and, how long the data will be kept. The social scientist
seeks to identify and explain these patterns and their prior correlates.
Such decisions have consequences. Subsequent developments can be contingent
on the choices made. For example, some techniques that can be narrowly applied,
such as the use of DNA for identification purposes, will require the creation of
large databases against which a sample can be compared. A decision to watch
everyone (categorical suspicion) avoids claims of discrimination in targeting, but it
is more expensive and can lead to widespread feelings of privacy invasion.
Another aspect of process involves the path or “career” of surveillance events. In
many, perhaps a majority, of cases, no action follows from surveillance because
nothing of interest is discovered. The surveillance is intended to serve a scarecrow
function or simply to generate a documentary record. Information may be saved
until it is needed or a critical amount has been obtained. Or occasionally, too much
is discovered to act on, or the surveilled can exert counterpressure to prevent action
from being taken. 
Yet techniques, too, have careers. The surveillance appetite can be insatiable and
often shows a tendency to expand to include new goals, agents, subjects, and
forms. Awareness of this requires asking of any new tactic, regardless of how
benignly its means and ends are presented, where might it lead? The expansion of a
technology introduced in a limited fashion can often be seen. Extensions beyond
the initial use, whether reflecting surveillance creep or, in many cases, surveillance
gallop, are common. There may be new uses for the data. For example, the Social
Security number that Congress intended only to be used for tax purposes has
become a de facto national ID number, and video cameras once restricted to pris-
ons and high-security areas, are now found in offices, shopping malls, and homes. 
New surveillance agents and subjects may appear. A common process is a pro-
gression from use on animals to prisoners, criminal suspects, noncitizens, the ill,
children, and then throughout the society. Tactics developed by government for
defense and law enforcement often spread to manufacturing and commercial uses,
and then to uses in interpersonal relations by friends, family, and others. One exam-
ple of this trend is the expansion of drug testing from the military to sensitive cate-
gories such as transportation workers to the workforce at large, and then even to
parents who test their children. The patterning of the use of global positioning sat-
ellite data is equivalent. Yet expansion is only one path. A technique may be devel-
oped but not widely used; for example, this has been the case with handwriting
analysis (graphology) in the United States, although not in France. Or if adopted, a

542
Surveillance
\
tactic may diffuse slowly rather than rapidly throughout the social order. Televi-
sion, for example, had been available since the late 1920s, decades before it came
into widespread use. 
Sometimes a rarely studied phenomenon of surveillance contraction occurs.
Widely used tactics may come to be less used as a result of political controversy,
the development of regulations, and unintended consequences, or as a result of the
development of better tactics. For example, congressional legislation in 1988
severely restricted the use of the polygraph for employment purposes.
III. What Is to Be Done?
Social understanding and moral evaluation require attending to the varied
contexts and goals of surveillance. The many settings, forms, and processes of
surveillance preclude any easy explanations or conclusions. Two broad, con-
trasting views of the new surveillance can be identified. A pessimistic Franken-
steinian/Luddite view holds that surveillance technology is inhuman, destructive
of liberty, and untrustworthy. In addition, since surveillance technology devel-
ops out of an inequitable social context, it is seen as likely to reinforce the status
quo.
A more optimistic view places great faith in the power of technology, which is
seen to be neutral. More powerful surveillance tools are seen as necessary in
today’s world, where efficiency is so valued and where there is a multiplicity of
dangers and risks. Surveillance is a sword with multiple edges. The area is fascinat-
ing precisely because there are no easy scientific or moral answers. 
There are value conflicts and ironically conflicting needs and consequences, all
of which make it difficult to take a broad and consistent position in favor of, or
against, expanding or restricting surveillance. For example, society values both the
individual and the community. Members of society want both liberty and order.
Individuals seek privacy and often anonymity but also know that secrecy can hide
dastardly deeds, and visibility can bring accountability. Although individuals value
freedom of expression, too much visibility may inhibit experimentation, creativity,
and risk taking. 
As with any value-conflicted and varied-consequence behavior, particularly
those behaviors that involve conflicting rights and needs, it is essential to keep the
tensions ever in mind and to avoid complacency. Occasionally, when wending
through competing values, the absolutist, no compromise, don’t cross this personal
line or always cross it standard is appropriate. But more often compromise—if
rarely a simplistic perfect balance—is required. When privacy and civil liberties
are negatively affected, it is vital to acknowledge, rather than to deny this impact,
as is so often the case. Such honesty can make for more informed decisions and
also serve an educational function.
Surveillance practices are shaped by manners, organizational policies, laws,
and by available technologies and countertechnologies. These draw on a number of
background value principles and tacit assumptions about the empirical world that
need to be analyzed. Whatever action is taken, there are likely costs, gains, and
trade-offs. At best we can hope to find a compass rather than a map, and a moving
equilibrium rather than a fixed point for decisionmaking. The following questions
(Marx, 2005) can help.

Surveillance
\
543
Questions for Judgment and Policy Regarding Surveillance 
1. Goals: Have the goals been clearly stated, justified, and prioritized? 
2. Accountable, public, and participatory policy development: Has the decision to apply 
the surveillance technique been developed through an open process and, if appropriate, 
with the participation of those to be surveilled? This involves a transparency principle. 
3. Law and ethics: Are the means and ends not only legal but also ethical? 
4. Opening doors: Has adequate thought been given to precedent creation and long-term 
consequences? 
5. Golden rule: Would the watcher be comfortable with being the subject rather than the 
agent of surveillance if the situation were reversed? 
6. Informed consent: Are participants fully apprised of the system’s presence and the condi-
tions under which it operates? Is consent genuine—beyond deception or unreasonable 
seduction—and can participation be refused without dire consequences for the person? 
7. Truth in use: Where personal and private information are involved, does a principle of 
unitary usage apply, in which information collected for one purpose is not used for 
another? Are the announced goals the real goals? 
8. Means-ends relationships: Are the means clearly related to the end sought and propor-
tional in costs and benefits to the goals? 
9. Can science succeed? Can a strong empirical and logical case be made that a means 
will in fact have the broad positive consequences its advocates claim? Does the system 
or technique really work?
10. Competent application: Even if it works in theory, does the system (or operative) using 
it apply it as intended? 
11. Human review: Are automated results with significant implications for life chances 
subject to human review before action is taken? 
12. Minimization: If risks and harm are associated with the tactic, is the tactic applied to 
minimize these, displaying only the degree of intrusiveness and invasiveness that is 
absolutely necessary? 
13. Alternatives: Using a variety of measures, not just financial ones, are alternative solu-
tions available that would meet the same ends with lesser costs and greater benefits? 
14. Inaction as action: Has consideration been given to the “sometimes it is better to do 
nothing” principle? 
15. Periodic review: Are regular efforts made to test the system's vulnerability, effective-
ness, and fairness and to review policies? 
16. Discovery and rectification of mistakes, errors, and abuses: Are there clear means for 
identifying and fixing these and, in the case of abuse, applying sanctions? 
17. Right of inspection: Can individuals access and challenge their own records? 
18. Reversibility: If evidence suggests that the costs outweigh the benefits, how easily can 
the surveillance be stopped? What is the extent of capital expenditures and available 
alternatives? 
19. Unintended consequences: Has adequate consideration been given to undesirable con-
sequences, including possible harm to watchers, the watched, and third parties? Can 
harm be easily discovered and compensated for? 
20. Data protection and security: Can surveillants protect the information they collect? Do 
they follow standard data protection and information rights as expressed in the Code of 
Fair Information Protection Practices and the expanded European Data Protection 
Directive?

A central point of much social and legal analysis is to call attention to the con-
textual nature of behavior. Certainly these questions and the principles implied in
them are not of equal weight, and their applicability will vary across time peri-
ods, depending on need and perceptions of crisis, across contexts (e.g., public
order, health and welfare, criminal and national security, commercial, private
individuals, families, and the defenseless and dependent), and particular situa-
tions within these. Yet common sense and common decency argue for consider-
ing them.

Surveillance cameras
Surveillance cameras are ubiquitous. The use of closed-circuit television
(CCTV) to monitor locations around the world has exploded during the last decade.
The United Kingdom (UK) leads the world in the deployment of CCTV technology
in public spaces. According to researchers, the number of surveillance cameras in
private premises in London alone is estimated to be around 500,000. This tally
brings the total number of private and public cameras in the UK to approximately
4,285,000. The network of cameras is so dense—1 camera for every 14 people—
that in many urban areas people may be monitored and filmed as often as 300 times
per day. 

Surveillance cameras
\
545
Although the use of CCTV technology in the United States is less prevalent than
in the United Kingdom, it is steadily increasing. For example, in 2002 the U.S.
National Park Service installed surveillance cameras around national monuments
in Washington, D.C. Other cities including Baltimore, Chicago, and New Orleans
have installed camera surveillance networks with financing from the federal gov-
ernment, including from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Chicago
added 2,250 cameras to its Homeland Security Grid financed by a $5.1 million
grant from DHS. These cameras are linked to a $43 million operations center con-
stantly monitored by police officers. Baltimore used federal grants to finance cam-
era purchases and its $1.3 million Watch Center. A 1,000-camera surveillance
system is expected to be fully deployed by the end of the year as a result of federal
dollars being spent in New Orleans. 
As of October 1999, there were an estimated one million video cameras in oper-
ation in the United States for the purpose of promoting public safety and security.
In 1998, New York Civil Liberties Union volunteers conducted a project to produce
a comprehensive map of public and private surveillance cameras in Manhattan. The
group reported 2,397 CCTVs with only 55 cameras in use by the Department of
Transportation as part of their vehicular traffic control system. Minneapolis and
Washington, D.C., have conducted similar projects. Although no one tracks actual
numbers of surveillance cameras in the United States, the Carnegie Mellon Data
Privacy Lab estimates there are 10,000 publicly available online webcams display-
ing public places in the United States. 
Silent videotape surveillance is largely ungoverned by statute. Courts have held
that silent video surveillance even without the knowledge of those videotaped is
not covered under the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA).
Silent video surveillance is not an aural transfer because it does not involve a
human voice and therefore is not regulated under the legislation. There are almost
no federal regulations, state statutes, or express statutory provisions regarding the
interception of nonverbal video surveillance. 
In addition to the federal government, some states such as Missouri and Wash-
ington provide a limited restraint to video surveillance. Specifically, they have
adopted statutes prohibiting the use of video surveillance for the purposes of peep-
ing or voyeurism. The federal Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2003 makes it a
crime to capture an improper image of an individual if the perpetrator knowingly
does so under circumstances violating the privacy of that individual. Currently
under consideration is legislation attempting to include mobile cellular telephone
camera videos within the federal bill because of the enormous growth in the mobile
personal communication industry. Cell phones with camera capabilities soared in
popularity from under 9 million shipped to the United States during 2003, to 27
million in 2004. The number is expected to reach 100 million in 2008 (PC World,
2004).
Cameras are used routinely in public places to deter shoplifting, to prevent
crime and terrorism, and to record illegal acts. Persons in public venues are not the
only objects for the camera. Items, activities, and events are all subject to the scru-
tinizing eye of video surveillance, no matter how seemingly remote the public loca-
tion appears. In California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207 (1986), the Supreme Court
held that a police aerial observation made from an altitude of 1000 feet of a home

546
Surveillance cameras
\
where marijuana cultivation was suspected did not violate the Fourth Amendment
because private and commercial flights in the public airways are routine; therefore,
it was unreasonable to expect constitutional protection. In domestic settings,
CCTV use is usually legally acceptable; courts have found no invasion of privacy
by cameras in most areas of a home. For instance, in State v. Diaz (1998), the use of
so-called nanny cameras was found not to violate privacy rights. However, in cases
such as Miller v. Brooks (1996), the use of cameras in places where a person has a
reasonable expectation of privacy, such as a restroom or bedroom, were found to
violate privacy statutes or to be a tortious invasion of privacy. 
In United States v. Knotts, the Supreme Court found no expectation of privacy
when the government attached a radio-tracking device to a canister of chemicals sub-
sequently traced to the defendant’s house. Specifically, the Court held that a person
traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of
privacy in his or her movements from one place to another. Surveillance is acceptable
in virtually all places where a potential for visual observation exists. 
With video recording by the government virtually unregulated, except under
basic Fourth Amendment protocol, people are concerned that privacy outside the
home is becoming extinct. To that end, the federal government, through the
National Institute of Justice (NIJ), has funded research into the use of CCTV cam-
eras to monitor public spaces. Furthermore, the trade organization for security pro-
fessionals, ASIS International, commissioned the Carnegie Mellon Data Privacy
Lab to assess the number and nature of webcams that observe people in public
spaces. Ultimately, the goal is to analyze and propose related policies and best
practices for the security industry that measure the relationship between technol-
ogy and privacy. 
The bounds of CCTV are constantly being widened to include additional pur-
poses. Originally installed to deter theft and monitor traffic (for example as red-light
and speeding cameras), their use has expanded to include detecting undesirable
behavior such as public order transgressions to deter violence and vandalism in pub-
lic parks. CCTV is becoming an integral part of a government’s crime-control policy
and social-control theory. It is promoted as a primary solution for urban dysfunc-
tion. The technology has had a dramatic impact on the evolution of law enforce-
ment policy. In Britain, for example, CCTV is the single most heavily funded crime
prevention measure, accounting for three-fourths of the total spending on crime
prevention by the Home Office. 
Despite the explosive growth in video surveillance, concerns exist within the
public arena regarding the implications of CCTV use on privacy rights as well as
on civil rights. It is also a matter of debate whether CCTV use reduces or deters
crime. Some governmental uses of the technology spark little controversy, such as
CCTV use in correctional facilities. Other uses, however, raise serious constitu-
tional privacy concerns. Even though the effectiveness of these cameras in identify-
ing crime and terrorist activities and their efficiency as a deterrent and deployment
tool are still debatable, CCTV proponents seem to be gaining support. The dis-
placement of crime to a different location is one factor that clouds the findings of
the study. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a watch group for
privacy concerns, reports that although millions are spent on CCTV systems, stud-
ies show that they have little effect on criminal activity.

EPIC also reports that studies show that there is a serious risk of racial profiling
and discrimination with the use of camera surveillance networks. EPIC members
are concerned that the homeland security camera systems will be misused or
abused. Numerous examples of abuse are already on record, such as the situation of
the manager of a Florida newspaper, who extended a legitimate system to include a
hidden video camera in the employee bathroom. A second example of abuse
occurred when employees of Dunkin’ Donuts used the company’s video and audio
surveillance technology to listen in on customers. In addition, a JC Penney
employee discovered that a guard was showing a videotape in which he had
zoomed in on her breasts using the store’s ceiling cameras. In England, B-grade
filmmakers raided footage from public video cameras to make risqué movies fea-
turing unsuspecting persons. With the increase in CCTV use, coupled with new
technology making these cameras active as opposed to passive viewing vessels,
instances of abuse could grow exponentially. 
The technological changes related to CCTVs in the first five years of this cen-
tury are remarkable. Remote-controlled CCTV cameras can be made to pan, tilt,
and zoom in on specific activities or items. Newer cameras also have night-
vision capabilities and wireless technologies. A full range of viewing, record-
ing, and storage connections can be integrated with the cameras. Digital video
recorders developed for use with CCTV surveillance systems have hard drive
capacities to store up to10 weeks of recording with retrieval and video content
analysis.
Other technological developments include the conversion from analog to digital
and the development of smart cameras with event detection and notification for net-
worked video systems. Object tracking, another new innovation, enables a viewer
to follow a subject from camera to camera in order to monitor the target of interest
even when the target moves through the field of view. There are also advances in
imaging with reduction of field pattern noises, remote streaming video recording,
and viewing capability from handheld devices. Cyber Bug, a three-pound, pilotless
aircraft drone designed for airborne surveillance and intelligence and operated
by remote control, sends streaming video to military officers on the ground. The
Coast Guard is developing similar drones that can be launched vertically and that
will provide 16 continuous hours of surveillance. Other improvements include
wireless connectivity and access through the Internet, cost reductions, outdoor
automatic day/night adjusting cameras, and tapeless systems that allow storage
capacities in excess of one million gigabytes.
The change from analog to digital devices and the ease of video enhancement
for clarification purposes create a new set of issues relating to abuse and privacy
implications. Historically, when a convenience store surveillance camera caught a
crime on video, the analog tape was seized as evidence, and the item was admitted
if properly authenticated. Now, the first question raised is what must be seized as
evidence: the digital recording produced off the hard drive of a computer or the
hard drive itself. Each time a digital image is created in a new format, it has the
potential to be altered. Thus, a new field of science known as forensic video analy-
sis has emerged. Forensic video analysis is the scientific examination, comparison,
and evaluation of video in legal matters. A lack of legal precedent and scientific
authority exists within this novel field, so the extent to which a recognized expert

548
Surveillance cameras
\
can clarify, enhance, reproduce, and accurately retrieve information is all relatively
new and uncharted territory.
Although forensic video comparison evidence analysis is a relatively new field,
the use of comparison evidence in many other scientific disciplines is widely
accepted. Comparison evidence has been used in the area of fingerprint analysis,
DNA examination, footwear and hand print comparison, facial mapping, and ear
prints. Comparison evidence is also used in tool-mark identification, firearm and
bullet matching, paint chemistry matching, duct tape matching, and drug sampling.
It is also used in questioned document, fiber, and hair examinations. The technical
basis for all comparison evidence requires the identification and analysis of (1) a
class characteristic (an identifiable feature that assists in narrowing down the statis-
tical probability that a person or object belongs to the same group as a known per-
son or object that shares the same features) and (2) a unique characteristic
(identifiable features found on a specific person or object that are found on no other
person or object of a similar class). For example, a forensic video analysis of car
headlight spread can be performed since all cars display unique headlight patterns.
Questions as to potential tampering, best evidence (hard drive versus a digital
reproduction), and the use of comparison analysis by a reverse projection image
method are current concerns. Furthermore, questions related to time-lapse photo-
graphy, compression and scan conversion processes, aspect ratio to calibration, and
issues concerning retrieval of digital information in remote storage (particularly
storage outside of the United States) highlight additional evolving issues. 
The government does not provide the only threat to privacy in this regard. Pri-
vate citizens and business are using CCTV technology to protect themselves, to
monitor specific activities, or to send images via their mobile camera phones. Con-
cerns regarding the enactment and application of new regulations merit serious
attention in the future. In addition, the government’s acquisition of privately
recorded CCTV data for law enforcement purposes needs further scrutiny.

T
Telecommunication Act of 1996
The U.S. Congress passed the Telecommunication Act of 1996 on February 1,
1996. The act rewrote the Communications Act of 1934 and aimed to foster fair
competition by deregulating the telecommunication industry. Section 222 of the
act, entitled “Privacy of Customer Information,” states that telephone carriers have
an obligation to protect the confidentiality of information relating to their custom-
ers and requires carriers to obtain customer consent for the use, disclosure, and
access to Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI).
CPNI is data on individual calling behaviors, such as frequency, location, dura-
tion of calls, and types of services subscribed to by the individual customer. Tele-
phone companies collect this information to establish customer profiles for billing
and marketing purposes. CPNI is potentially detrimental to privacy because it
infringes on one’s right not to be monitored and on one’s control of personal infor-
mation. Since CPNI is a powerful source for the telecommunication industry for
identifying potential customers and designing marketing strategies, it may also vio-
late the individual rights of solitude and anonymity.
Section 222 lists three tiers of customer information and corresponding protec-
tions. Customer approval is not required for customer list information (name,
address, and telephone number) used to publish directories. Carriers can also dis-
close anything that does not constitute personally identifiable information with-
out consent so long as the disclosure is made on reasonable and nondiscriminatory
terms. Nevertheless, any access or disclosure of individual CPNI requires prior
approval from the identified individual. Congress was vague in stipulating how
companies should obtain such approval.
On February 19, 1998, the Federal Communications Commission issued an
order requiring carriers to notify their customers about their right to control the use
of their CPNI and to obtain their opt-in consent before accessing customer infor-
mation outside the range allowed under Section 222. The FCC’s interpretation of
Section 222 is to protect consumer privacy and to engineer a regulatory framework
that promotes competition by limiting the ability of large carriers to monopolize
the use of CPNI. The incumbent carrier, therefore, could not market products for
different services to which a customer did not apply, but could market its products

within existing service relations. The telecommunication industry soon contested
that the order was impermissible regulation of commercial speech and in violation
of the First Amendment.
In August 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled in U.S.
West v. FCC that the FCC’s interpretation of Section 222 was in violation of the
First Amendment. Circuit Judge Tacha stated that the First Amendment protects
the right both to disseminate and to receive information, and a ban on either com-
ponent of communication is a restriction on free speech. The court further used the
precedent of the 1979 Supreme Court case of Smith v. Maryland to reason that
CPNI privacy rights are not self-evident, recognized rights under the protection of
the Fourth Amendment. The FCC, therefore, could not favor individual privacy
over protected commercial speech.
The FCC responded in 2002 by stating that either “opt-in” or “opt-out” cus-
tomer consent could be used for the collection of CPNI. The Cellular Telecommu-
nications and Internet Associations issued a “consumer code” in September 2003
for self-regulatory measures to protect consumer privacy.

Telemarketing
Although telemarketing is often narrowly defined as marketing by telephone, it
is used here in a broader context to include any form of unsolicited selling message
targeted at individual consumers from a distance. Telemarketing includes direct
mail, telephone marketing, commercial electronic mail (i.e., “spam”), and mes-
sages sent to cellular telephones, facsimile machines, and computer screens. It
does not include mass media advertising or passive marketing messages, such as
billboards and Internet sites, nor does it include personal selling.
Telemarketing raises two major privacy concerns. The first involves the collec-
tion and sale of personally identifiable information to make targeting individual
consumers possible. The second concerns the intrusive nature of telemarketing.
Unlike passive marketing messages, which are relatively easy for consumers to
ignore, telemarketing requires consumers to deal, in some manner, with each mes-
sage. Telephone marketing causes the telephone to ring, and today often requires
that the consumer delete any message from voicemail or an answering machine.
Unwanted e-mail and messages to cell phones must be deleted, and direct mail and

Telemarketing

553
fax messages must be thrown away. Thus, telemarketing imposes higher costs in
terms of consumer time and, sometimes, financial disposal costs than passive mar-
keting. Only personal selling, with the salesperson’s proverbial foot in the door, is
more intrusive for consumers. However, some consumers find telemarketing to be a
convenient form of purchasing, and marketers use it because they hope it is more
engaging than passive marketing.
Telemarketing began with direct-mail advertising in the nineteenth century. At
first, the mailed circulars were of poor print quality, but improved printing technol-
ogy made catalogs and other more attractive solicitations possible. Consumers also
complained of receiving duplicate mailings. This led to the refinement of mailing
lists of potential consumers. By 1900, mailing lists were being compiled from
directories, newspaper clipping services, and other public sources and sold by cate-
gories, such as address or occupation. “Addressing companies” were available to
perform direct-mail campaigns, including printing and addressing the advertising
material. The U.S. Postal Service encouraged the growth of direct mail by offering
lower postal rates. Even the mandate to use ZIP codes in 1967, initially opposed by
marketers, proved to be an important market segmentation tool. Today about 40
percent of all mail is direct-mail advertising. It is estimated that half of direct mail
is never even opened by recipients.
There is virtually no regulation of direct mail in the United States despite the
cost of disposal and the fact that consumers spend about eight months of their life-
times disposing of direct mail. Customers may refuse delivery of materials they
declare to be obscene and require such mailers to stop mailing such materials to
them (39 U.S.C. §3008-12). It also is illegal to send unsolicited merchandise
through the mail and then request payment (39 U.S.C. §3009). Consumers may
treat such merchandise as a gift. Consumers do not have to pay to return the item
but may bear the costs of disposing of it.
Direct mail is relatively easy to ignore, but for many consumers a ringing tele-
phone is not. In 1991, when enacting the federal Telephone Consumer Protection
Act (TCPA), Congress heard evidence that more than 300,000 telephone solicitors
contacted more than 18 million Americans every day. In 1998, the Direct Market-
ing Association estimated that U.S. marketers spent $62 billion in telephone mar-
keting. Others estimate that telephone marketers must make 50 or more calls to
make a sale, but sales from such calls amount to roughly 30 percent of all telephone
purchases, or about $100 billion in 2002. A 2004 survey by the Ponemon Institute
found that 60 percent of consumers find telemarketing annoying.
Under federal law, telephone solicitations may occur only between the hours of
8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. for the recipient of the call. Telephone marketers may not
harass consumers by repeatedly calling or using obscene or intimidating language.
They also must identify themselves as sellers and explain that they are making a
sales call before beginning their sales pitch (16 C.F.R. §310). This rule was
amended in 2003 to establish the federal Do-Not-Call Registry. By March 2005,
some 84 million phone numbers had been registered to prevent unsolicited calls
from for-profit marketers, including those that solicit charitable contributions.
While this list does not preempt the do-not-call lists that 27 states had previously
established, several states are consolidating their lists with the federal registry. New
amendments also require the transmission of caller identification by the telemarketer

554

\
and regulate call abandonment, which occurs when a consumer answers the
telephone but there is no marketer on the line.
Because consumers pay for fax paper and often pay for incoming cell phone
calls, the TCPA also prohibits solicitations to telephone fax machines without prior
consent of the receiver and solicitations made to cell phones by automatic dialing
devices without prior consent (47 C.F.R. 64). The Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005
(47 U.S.C. §227) requires commercial faxes to properly identify the sending com-
pany and its phone number as well as provide a notice on how to opt-out of future
faxes from that firm. It does allow companies to fax customers with whom they
have an existing business relationship.
The latest effort to impose marketing costs on consumers without procuring
their consent is through e-mail and the Internet. The federal Can Spam Act of 2003
(15 U.S.C. §7701) explicitly preempted tougher state laws to authorize the sending
of commercial e-mail as long as the header and subject lines are not misleading and
the message discloses the identity of the seller and the fact that it is an advertise-
ment and gives recipients a method of opting out of receiving future e-mails from
that marketer. A list of one million e-mail addresses costs as little as $7, making
this a very low-cost marketing medium. Studies show that roughly half of all e-
mail traffic is spam, and it costs U.S. business about $10 billion each year to deal
with spam. The Federal Trade Commission has opposed establishing a Do-Not-Spam
registry because it believes it would be ineffective, but case law does allow Internet
Service Providers to offer spam filters.
As noted previously, marketing calls to cell phones made by an automatic dialing
device are illegal without prior permission of the recipient. The question arises
whether this also includes text messages, which also cause cell phones to ring. In
September 2005, the Arizona Court of Appeals held that computer programs that
send text messages by generating a list of text addresses are automatic dialing
devices under the TCPA, making the practice illegal. The court further noted that the
Can Spam Act prohibits unsolicited commercial messages to mobile service devices.
Finally, Internet users can receive targeted pop-up advertising messages when
“surfing” the web. This usually occurs when the consumer’s computer contains
“adware” that may simply send advertisements periodically. Some “adware,” how-
ever, follows the consumer’s search patterns and attempts to send advertising of
interest to the consumer. Furthermore, some search engines sell search terms to
advertisers and then display the advertisers’ ads either as a pop-up ad during the
search or as a “sponsored result.” The legality of these practices is being considered
on two fronts. First, the FTC has pursued firms that do not clearly disclose they are
loading “adware” onto consumers’ computers or mislead consumers about the
characteristics of the software they are receiving. Second, trademark owners are
suing firms that offer their trademarks for sale to other advertisers. Only a few con-
flicting judicial decisions have been issued thus far on these practices.
Marketers typically have challenged these regulations as violating their free
speech rights under the First Amendment. However, courts have found consumer
intrusion to be a significant regulatory interest and held that the regulations enacted
to date are constitutional. The courts typically examine whether the regulations are
narrowly tailored to achieve the regulatory interest and whether alternative chan-
nels for the speech are still available.

The first privacy concern listed previously, the collection of personal informa-
tion in order to target messages, has received relatively little legal attention in the
United States. Specific federal laws have been enacted to regulate privacy for web-
sites that seek personal information from children and to protect financial and
health care personal information. In addition, the FTC and other agencies pursue
cases where firms release or sell personal data in violation of their stated privacy
policy. However, no overall privacy protection for personal information exists at
the federal level. The U.S. approach is in contrast with that of the European Union.
The European Data Protection Directive on the Legal Protection of Databases
(96/9/EC), adopted in 1996, instructed member states to enact legislation requiring
that consumers be informed and consent before companies may collect personal
information about them for a database. They must be informed of the database,
have the right to correct or delete inaccurate data, and have the right to object to its
use for marketing purposes. Europe also has rejected the U.S. piecemeal approach
to dealing with intrusion. The 2005 Directive Concerning Unfair Business-to-Con-
sumer Commercial Practices (2005/29/EC) requires member states to enact laws by
early 2008 that will prohibit persistent and unwanted solicitations by any remote
media without prior consent or the ability to object easily and without cost to stop
future solicitations.

Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)
Terry v. Ohio was a landmark Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled there
was no violation of Fourth Amendment privacy rights in allowing police officers to
stop and “pat down” persons on the street when the officers have reason to believe
they may be dealing with “armed and dangerous” persons. The officer “need not be
absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably
prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety
or that of others was in danger. And in determining whether the officer acted rea-
sonably in such circumstances, due weight must be given not to his inchoate and
unparticularized suspicion or ‘hunch,’ but to the specific reasonable inferences
which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.”
John Terry and Richard Chilton were standing on a street corner in Cleveland, Ohio,
in October 1963, when an off-duty police detective observed them. Although he could
not say precisely why, he thought the two men looked suspicious. Therefore, he hid by
a store some 300 to 400 feet away and watched them. Terry and Chilton appeared

556
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)
\
agitated. Terry walked down the street, looked in a store window, and then returned
to where Chilton was standing. Then Chilton went to look in the same window and
returned to where Terry was standing. This routine was repeated multiple times. At
one point they were met by a third man, who spoke with them for a while and left.
The separate trips to the store window resumed.
Eventually, Terry and Chilton left their position on the street corner and walked
in the same direction the third man had gone. The detective followed. The officer
testified later that he believed the men had been “casing a job, a stickup” and
thought they might have guns. Terry and Chilton eventually met the third man
again, and the detective decided to confront the three men.
The detective approached the men, identified himself as an officer, and asked
their names. The three men mumbled a response. When he failed to get a clear
response, the detective grabbed Terry and turned him around so he was facing his
friends and was between his friends and the detective. At that point, the officer pat-
ted down Terry and felt a handgun, but could not get the gun free.
The detective then ordered the three men to enter the store they were in front of
and to face the wall with their hands in the air. He removed Terry’s coat, took out
the handgun, and then patted down the men, searching for weapons. Chilton had a
revolver in his pocket. The third man had no weapons. The officer never put his
hands inside the men’s pockets or coats except to remove the handguns. Terry and
Chilton were arrested and charged with carrying concealed weapons.
Terry and Chilton asked the trial court to suppress the evidence (the weapons)
seized during the police search. The motion was denied, and they were convicted. The
Ohio appellate courts confirmed the convictions and the trial court’s refusal to suppress
the evidence. The case was argued in the Supreme Court on December 12, 1967.
In an 8-to-1 decision, Justice Douglas dissenting, the Court addressed several piv-
otal legal issues that have led to a substantial body of law allowing stops and searches
in a variety of contexts. Ironically, the Court affirmed the stop and search of Terry
and Chilton after reaffirming that they both could rely on the protections of the
Fourth Amendment as they “walked down the street in Cleveland.” The men had a
“reasonable expectation of privacy” since the amendment protects people and not
places. The question for the Court became whether the stop and search of the two
men was reasonable under the circumstances because “what the Constitution forbids
is not all searches and seizures, but unreasonable searches and seizures.”
To reach its decision, the Court had to determine whether the brief stop of the
two men constituted a “seizure” that would call for Fourth Amendment protections.
The answer was easy. The Court noted, “It must be recognized that whenever a
police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, he has
‘seized’ that person.”
The next question was whether the “pat down” was a search. The Court was
nearly contemptuous of the state of Ohio’s argument that the search was a mere
“petty indignity” that citizens should be required to endure: “[I]t is nothing less
than sheer torture of the English language to suggest that a careful exploration of
the outer surfaces of a person’s clothing all over his or her body in an attempt to
find weapons is not a ‘search.’ Moreover, it is simply fantastic to urge that such a
procedure performed in public by a policeman while the citizen stands helpless,
perhaps facing a wall with his hands raised, is a ‘petty indignity.’ It is a serious

Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)
\
557
intrusion upon the sanctity of the person, which may inflict great indignity and
arouse strong resentment, and it is not to be undertaken lightly.”
The next question became the reasonableness of the officer’s actions under the
circumstances. The Court adamantly restated its holdings that, whenever possible,
officers must obtain warrants before conducting searches. In those instances, the
requirement for probable cause set forth in the Fourth Amendment must be met.
However, the Court found this situation was different: “We deal here with an entire
rubric of police conduct—necessarily swift action predicated upon the on-the-spot
observations of the officer on the beat—which historically has not been, and as a
practical matter could not be, subjected to the warrant procedure.” Thus, the Court
held, the actions did not require “probable cause”; rather, they must be considered
in light of what is reasonable and what is not.
The Court required a balancing test to be applied. The officer’s “need to search”
had to be balanced “against the invasion which the search (or seizure) entails.” Thus,
to justify an officer’s search or seizure, the Court ruled the officer “must be able to
point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences
from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.” More simply, the Court sug-
gested one test for reasonableness would be whether “the facts available to the officer
at the moment of the seizure or the search ‘warrant a man of reasonable caution in the
belief’ that the action taken was appropriate.” In establishing this threshold, the Court
rejected the notion that an officer’s own subjective justification for a search or seizure
should be sufficient: “Good faith on the part of the arresting officer is not enough. If
subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment
would evaporate, and the people would be ‘secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects,’ only in the discretion of the police.”
For Terry and Chilton, the Court found the government has a legitimate interest
in preventing, detecting, and investigating crime and in “the appropriate circum-
stances and the appropriate manner” in which an investigating officer may stop a
pedestrian for questioning, even when there is no probable cause for an arrest. The
men’s actions were sufficiently suspicious to warrant the detective’s stop.
The question then became whether there was any justification for the search. At
that point, the governmental interest was in protecting the officer’s safety. The
Court noted the history of violence against police officers and stated: 
In view of these facts, we cannot blind ourselves to the need for law enforcement offic-
ers to protect themselves and other prospective victims of violence in situations where
they may lack probable cause for an arrest. When an officer is justified in believing that
the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and
presently dangerous to the officer or to others, it would appear to be clearly unreason-
able to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the
person is in fact carrying a weapon to neutralize the threat of physical harm.
After setting out these parameters, the Court ruled there needed to be a “nar-
rowly drawn authority” for an officer to search for weapons in order to protect that
officer’s safety, or other officers’ safety, when the officer believes the suspect may
be armed. “The officer need not be absolutely certain the individual is armed; the
issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be war-
ranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.”

558
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)
\
The Court then determined the detective’s suspicions were reasonable. The
scope of the search was appropriate. Thus, the weapons seized could be admitted as
evidence against the men without violating their Fourth Amendment protections.
Subsequent cases focused on what could be seized during the Terry stop-and-frisk
situation. Early on, the Court developed rules to allow the removal of any item of the
size and shape of a weapon, but not allow the seizure of items, such as plastic bags con-
taining pills, that clearly were not weapons. The courts then expanded rulings to allow
admission of items officers had probable cause to believe were contraband.
Also at issue after Terry was the question of when a person had been “seized” as
a result of an officer’s conduct. This was a critical point, because the protections of
the Fourth Amendment do not come into play until there is a “seizure.” The stan-
dard has evolved to the point where the courts now ask if “in view of all the cir-
cumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that
he was not free to leave.” The “free to leave” standard was then subsequently
reduced further to “free not to answer questions” when the Court allowed officers
to stop a bus and question all the passengers on the bus without a warrant.
In the term following Terry, the Supreme Court decided Chimel v. California,
395 U.S. 752 (1969), and ruled that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the
arresting officer to search “the arrestee’s person and the area ‘within his immediate
control’—construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain
possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.” The Court reasoned, “A gun on a
table or in a drawer in front of one who is arrested can be as dangerous to the
arresting officer as one concealed in the clothing of the person arrested.”
In New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), the Terry concept was extended
again. The Court explained that the concept of “within a person’s immediate con-
trol” had not been successfully defined. Thus, to provide a “workable rule,” it held
that “articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of
an automobile are in fact generally, even if not inevitably, within ‘the area into
which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon.’” Applying the rules gov-
erning search incident to arrest, the Court also ruled that police could examine the
contents of any open or closed container found within the passenger compartment,
“for if the passenger compartment is within the reach of the arrestee, so will con-
tainers in it be within his reach.”
The concept of a Terry protective search was extended in 1983 from on-the-street
confrontations between police and suspects, or searches of occupied automobiles, to
searches of unoccupied stopped cars. In Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983),
the Supreme Court ruled that a warrantless protective search of a car’s unoccupied
interior was acceptable. In that case, although the driver was outside the car, an
officer had searched the interior of the car after seeing a hunting knife on the floor.
During the search, marijuana was found, and the driver was charged with posses-
sion. The Court ruled: 
Our past cases indicate then that protection of police and others can justify protective
searches when police have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses a danger, that
roadside encounters between police and suspects are especially hazardous, and that
danger may arise from the possible presence of weapons in the area surrounding a
suspect. These principles compel our conclusion that the search of the passenger

compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in which a weapon may be
placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief
based on “specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational infer-
ences from those facts, reasonably warrant” the officer in believing that the suspect is
dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.
The concept was further extended to the home in Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S.
325 (1990). There, the Court approved a police “protective sweep” of a residence
and held,
We conclude that the Fourth Amendment would permit the protective sweep under-
taken here if the searching officer “possesse[d] a reasonable belief based on ‘specific
and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those
facts, reasonably warrant[ed]’ the officer in believing,” Michigan v. Long (1983)
(quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968)), that the area swept harbored an indi-
vidual posing a danger to the officer or others.
Today the courts seem reluctant to limit the warrantless search of persons or
places provided police have articulable reasons to suspect that they, or others,
might be in danger if the search does not occur. There have been limitations, how-
ever. A police search of a suspect’s backpack was ruled improper because police
had seized the backpack and the suspect could not gain access to it. The courts also
have ruled that finding facts sufficient to justify a stop after making the stop is not
sufficient to justify making the stop in the first place. An anonymous tip based on a
suspicion that a person possibly possesses drugs is insufficient basis for a reason-
able suspicion on the part of a police officer. Also, signs of nervousness beyond the
norm cannot be the foundation for an officer’s reasonable suspicion. Finally, prior
criminal history alone is not a sufficient justification for a warrantless stop.

Thermal sensors
A thermal-imaging device, often called a FLIR (forward-looking infrared radar),
is used to detect activity and movement via heat patterns on the surface of a
selected target by identifying temperature differentials. The device provides a
visual image of objects that are warmer or cooler than the baseline. A thermal
imager is capable of locating a human in the dark from a distance in excess of

560
Thermal sensors
\
seven kilometers. Although thermal-imaging devices are incapable of seeing
through an object, activity or hot spots may be detected if heat from the activity
passes through an intermediate object, such as a window or a porous wall.
Thermal imagers are prized commodities that have been applied in a variety of
circumstances. The U.S. Border Patrol uses the device for military surveillance
and detection of illegal immigrants. FLIRs have been used to save persons trapped
in smoke-ridden buildings as well as many other search-and-rescue operations. The
imager has assisted in locating countless individuals, including missing children,
lost Alzheimer’s patients, fleeing suspects, and escaped convicts. The devices are
often used in drug cases to locate hydroponic laboratories. As a result of the refined
sensibility of the equipment, the devices have been used recently to detect and
identify emissions and air pollutants that are harmful to the environment.
The usefulness of the technology cannot be denied. These devices allow law
enforcement to collect otherwise unavailable information passively without a phys-
ical intrusion. Thus, for the most part, the suspect has no knowledge that the equip-
ment has been used. Because thermal imagers operate by observing and recording
waste heat radiated through the surface of a structure, concerns were raised that
Fourth Amendment privacy protection would be analogized to a garbage search
inquiry approved by the Supreme Court in 1988 in California v. Greenwood. The
concern centered on the collection of private information without notice, as well as
the acquisition of confidential data in areas where privacy is highly protected like
within a residence. Although the FLIR technology supposedly cannot penetrate
walls, it actually does to a certain extent. Without adequate control, this infrared
technology could allow the government to search and survey, violating the right to
privacy.
The issue is temporarily resolved by the 2001 Supreme Court decision in
United States v. Kyllo. In Kyllo, the litigants debated whether the information
retrieved by a thermal imager scan was collected through the wall of a home or
abandoned property or from heat emanating from the exterior of the home’s
walls. The Court, however, sidestepped that debate and focused its decision
instead on how the thermal imager was used under the Katz v.United States two-
pronged test. First, did the person have an actual subjective reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy? Second, was that expectation one that society was prepared to
recognize as reasonable? The Court concluded that Kyllo did have a subjective
expectation of privacy in the heat emissions within his home since the technology
had the potential of revealing more than the contraband hydroponic marijuana-
growing operation. Protected information, such as when the lady of the house
was bathing, could also be revealed. Furthermore, the subjective privacy expecta-
tion was one that society would be willing to recognize. This latter conclusion
was reached on the basis that thermal imagers are not devices commonly avail-
able to the public. Hence, the interiors of houses are off limits to any technology,
no matter how unobtrusive the technology may be, if the technology is not in
general use. This decision offers minimal or temporary protection to privacy
advocates since new technology is a continuing phenomenon and more technol-
ogy is being made available to the public.

Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374 (1967)
On September 11 and 12, 1952, three escaped convicts held James Hill, his wife,
and their five children hostage for 19 hours in their home in Whitemarsh, Pennsyl-
vania. The convicts were subsequently involved in a highly publicized encounter
with the police, and two of the three convicts were killed. The Hill family quickly
became front-page news. James Hill stressed that none of them had been hurt,
molested, or exposed to violence and discouraged any further coverage of their
story. The family moved to Connecticut soon after.
In the spring of 1953, Joseph Hayes published a novel entitled The Desperate
Hours, in which a family of four is held hostage by three escaped convicts in their
suburban home. Unlike the Hill family’s experience, the story’s family is exposed
to violence by the convicts. The father and son are beaten, and the daughter experi-
ences verbal sexual insult. The book was later made into a play, also entitled The
Desperate Hours.
Time, Inc.’s Life magazine printed an article about the play, calling it a reenact-
ment of the Hill incident. The article appeared in Life in February 1955. It was
titled “True Crime Inspires Tense Play,” with the subtitle “The ordeal of a family
trapped by convicts gives Broadway a new thriller, ‘The Desperate Hours.’” The
text of the article reads, “Three years ago Americans all over the country read
about the desperate ordeal of the James Hill family, who were held prisoners in
their home outside Philadelphia by three escaped convicts. Later they read about it
in Joseph Hayes’s novel, The Desperate Hours, inspired by the family’s experi-
ence. Now they can see the story reenacted in Hayes’s Broadway play based on the
book.”
The article also used photographs of scenes that had been staged in the Hill’s
former home. The pictures included a reenactment of the son being roughed up by
one of the convicts, labeled “brutish convict”; a picture of the daughter biting the
hand of a convict to make him drop a gun, captioned “daring daughter”; and one of
the father throwing his gun through the door after a “brave try” to save his family is
foiled. The appellee, James Hill, alleged that the Life article gave a knowingly false
impression that the play was an accurate depiction of the Hill incident. Hill sued
Life magazine for damages under a New York statute that provides a cause of
action to a person whose name or picture is used by another without consent for
purposes of trade or advertising. Life magazine, the appellant, claimed that the arti-
cle was about a subject of general interest and was published in good faith.
The jury awarded James Hill $50,000 compensatory and $25,000 punitive dam-
ages. On appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court ordered a new trial

as to damages but sustained the jury verdict of liability. At the new trial on dam-
ages, a jury was waived, and the court awarded $30,000 compensatory damages
without any punitive damages. The court did not feel that James Hill’s private life
had been intruded on and did not feel that Time, Inc. published the article for finan-
cial gain. Time, Inc. was still found liable, but the court felt the damages awarded
to Hill were excessive. The court declined to hold the New York “Right of Privacy”
statute unconstitutional. The court concluded that the instructions to the jury were
fatally defective because they failed to advise that a verdict for the plaintiffs could
be predicated only on a finding of knowing or reckless falsity in the publication of
the Life article. The court explained that absent a finding of such malicious intent
on the part of a publisher, press statements are protected under the First Amend-
ment, even if they are otherwise false or inaccurate.

Transaction-generated data
In the contemporary world of commerce, from grocery store to the Internet, all
legal transactions between buyers and sellers are recorded. A transaction may be
conceptualized as the exchange of one value for another (e.g., money in exchange
for a good). In the marketplace, payment increasingly occurs through credit cards
or digital cash, and record-keeping practices assume the form of electronic/digital
data. Therefore, the consumer represents not only a potential buyer, but also a
source of data. Practices of documentation constitute a form of consumer surveil-
lance carried out by private, for-profit organizations—whether the organization is a
third party or the actual seller. Data collection in seemingly simple exchanges
“captures” personally identifiable information (e.g., telephone number, ZIP
code) unnecessary for the purposes of the immediate transaction. Through the col-
lection and collation of extensive personal information, private corporations can
create consumer profiles to inform business strategy. In response to the burgeoning
use of surveillance techniques in economic transactions, particularly with respect
to e-commerce, Americans report in a number of surveys (e.g., 1997 Privacy and
American Business Survey and a 2001 Harris Interactive Survey) that they feel as if
they have lost control over the use of their personal information. They also interpret
these practices as an encroachment on individual privacy.
The contemporary collection and collation of personal information through eco-
nomic transactions is more extensive and intensive than in the past. The extensiveness

of this surveillance results from bureaucratic organizations formally tracking an
increasing number and range of individual behaviors. In principle, the systematic
record keeping of economic transactions represents one of the oldest practices of
human civilization, preceding even literacy. For example, the Inca Empire used a
system of knotted cords. The Roman Empire mastered systematic written record
keeping, which the Church perpetuated in a less organized fashion through medi-
eval Europe. With the rise of the nation-state and the expansion of capitalist mar-
kets, record keeping rationalizes economic transactions with more methodical
accounting practices, and bureaucratic organizations control a greater proportion of
daily life. The intensity of consumer surveillance is apparent in the expanding
quantity and precision of data generated and integrated per transaction. In the
United States, the sociohistorical roots of this mushrooming can be identified after
World War II. Three conditions essential for the proliferation of personal data col-
lection systems include new technologies, government policy, and market forces.
The role of computer and telecommunication technologies in introducing more
intense surveillance technologies is widely recognized. The effect of computers on
economic record keeping has been widely discussed in academic literature, public
policy, and business circles since the early 1970s. Computers transform record
keeping into data processing. The translation of personal information “captured”
through exchange into an electronic format facilitates the collection, storage, anal-
ysis, retrieval, and mobility of consumer data: computer software automates record
keeping for bureaucratic organizations. By the 1960s, automatic data processing
had dramatically reduced the cost and revolutionized the possibilities of the record-
keeping practices that had been used for thousands of years. Telecommunication
technologies also facilitated the adoption of electronic exchange (e.g., credit cards
and debit cards), which also supports consumer surveillance. A contemporary
example illustrates the effect of new technologies on economic transactions. When
a consumer calls a toll-free business number, software systems can automatically
access a customer profile before the operator answers the phone. That profile can
include data that are internal to the company (e.g., billing records) or external, such
as “lifestyle data,” which might indicate the place of residence, estimations of
home value, and annual income. Not only do such data open or close possibilities
in the relationship between a particular customer and enterprise, but the outcome of
the interaction feeds back into that profile to affect subsequent interactions. 
U.S. government policy has helped facilitate the heightened surveillance of con-
sumer behavior. In the postwar era, the federal govement has consistently financed
technological innovation from the earliest and crudest computers to the Internet.
For example, the United States Census offers geographic and social data to myr-
iad private companies for commercial exploitation. The ZIP Code Improvement
Plan and the 911 emergency system standardized addresses, making residential
information more user-friendly and marketing techniques, such as direct mailing
(i.e., “junk mail”), more affordable. In the 1970s, the Claritas corporation capital-
ized on these federal subsidies by pioneering a data-processing method known as
geodemographics, a body of analytic techniques that identify neighborhoods and
households by lifestyle categories to predict consumer behavior and reach niche
markets. Geodemographics merges spatial and demographic information with data
from more than 500 million consumer purchases per year. This research classifies

564
Transaction-generated data
\
the American public into 62 distinct lifestyle “clusters”—each associated with dis-
tinct tastes, values, and living arrangements.
Aside from subsidizing the cost of data collection, the rollback of the social
safety net—witnessed in the United States and most industrialized nations since
the 1960s—helps assign a greater value to personal information. Private providers,
free from any burden of offering universal access (e.g., insurance companies),
assume the responsibilities of public bureaucracies. These economic actors compile
personal information to sort the profitable clients from the risky clients. This “risk
society” further entrenches the drive to classify and categorize the population
based on its revenue-generating capacity. In this sense, cuts to social entitlements
aid in the creation of consumer data markets. In a more direct fashion, the govern-
ment helps create these markets by purchasing the services of data brokers like
Claritas. State agencies use “cluster” data to design and administer programs, such
as antismoking campaigns. In total, more than 15,000 nonprofit organizations,
government agencies, political parties, and private firms rely on the services of
Claritas. The accumulation and organization of personal data foster the develop-
ment of new campaigns, the introduction of new product lines and services, and
the location and design of new facilities.
The collection and collation of personal information from economic transactions
represents a growing sector in the economy. At the close of the twentieth cen-
tury, the production and analysis of transaction-generated data had become a
$10 billion/year industry. The emergence of the data-brokering industry under-
scores the importance of market mechanisms in the intensification of consumer
surveillance. In the marketplace, the demand for personal information stems
from the need of businesses to acquire accurate information regarding the envi-
ronments in which they act. Information that is more precise gives a firm a
competitive advantage over others. In other words, knowledge of individual
customers and potential customers serves the organizational goal of profitabil-
ity. Thus, as the cost of data collection, storage, and analysis falls because of
new technologies and federal subsidization, private firms seek greater quanti-
ties and better quality of personal information. Precise, reliable, and valid per-
sonal information enables companies to identify the most profitable clients and
devise appropriate goods, services, and marketing strategies. Conversely, the
collation of transactions into databases, such as “Consumer Return Databases,”
allows retailers to isolate less attractive customers, such as those who chroni-
cally complain or return items, and develop methods of exclusion (e.g., “digital
redlining”).
The strategic interests of private enterprises have spawned a market where data
abstracted from the lives of individuals become a commodity. A handful of corpo-
rations dominate this industry and own unimaginable sums of personal informa-
tion. A company called Acxiom has acquired personal data on virtually every
consumer in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, more
traditional merchants participate in personal-data markets by selling their custom-
ers’ information for supplemental revenues. Publishing companies, who have sold
magazine subscriber lists for decades, were among the first to realize this opportu-
nity. More recently, financial institutions have learned of these income-generating
possibilities. In search of these auxiliary revenues, traditional companies stress data

collection in what business observers call the “second exchange.” The “first
exchange” consists of the transaction of a good or service for payment, and in the
“second exchange” the consumer offers personal information for discounts or spe-
cial offers. Mail-in warranties represent a typical second transaction, and one-third
of U.S. households have filed such warranties. Supermarket loyalty cards constitute
another form. With loyalty cards, consumers must disclose significant amounts of
personal information to be eligible for store discounts, and retailers use such cards
to track all purchases back to the person. While this arrangement may initially
appear to be a fair deal since the consumer gains a reward for the loss of privacy, a
2003 study by the Wall Street Journal on loyalty cards demonstrates that they do
not actually lower prices. They create the appearance of lower prices, but in reality,
the discounts simply offset price hikes. In effect, consumers must foreclose more
personal information to maintain pre-loyalty card prices.
The combination of more extensive economic transactions and more intensive
record keeping engenders what legal scholar Arthur R. Miller calls a “data-
mania.” Apologists of consumer surveillance celebrate the democratizing effect
of systems like geodemographics, in which the cluster purportedly overcomes
distinctions of race, gender, and class in the marketplace. These enthusiasts tout
“data-mania” as a new era of efficiency and represent data collection and colla-
tion as a matchmaking process. Critics of “data-mania” point to the erosion of
personal privacy. Accounts in the mainstream media discuss a limited set of
implications that include identity theft and telemarketing annoyances, but schol-
arly critics call attention to social power. The asymmetrical flows of information
immanent in these new record-keeping practices empower private corporations at
the expense of the individual. When transaction-generated data permit companies
to sort consumers into groups of assigned worth or risk, new forms of discrimina-
tion, such as “digital redlining,” become possible. Thus, the clusters and individ-
ual profiles compiled from abstract electronic data have very real effects on the
life chances of flesh-and-blood persons.

Trespass
\
Trespass
Trespass is the unauthorized entry onto or use of property, either real or per-
sonal. The legal concept of trespass was developed in English common law during
the thirteenth century as a means of protecting the king’s interest in land and was
not considered a protection of privacy per se. Today trespass is most often used to
describe an intrusion into or an infringement of one’s rights to real property. While
a trespass action is frequently filed to protect a property owner’s privacy rights, the
action is still grounded in the land-based property concerns of early England. For
example, when a former U.S. congressman felt that reporters from the Baltimore
Sun invaded his privacy by interviewing him in his nursing home room, his tres-
pass action needed to be supplemented by an action for “intrusion upon seclusion”
under Maryland law to address his privacy concerns (see Mitchell v. Baltimore Sun
Co., Md. Ct. Spec. App., No. 266, 9/29/05). It is more helpful to think of a trespass
action as a tool to keep others from one’s property so that one’s privacy is protected
rather than as a tool to protect one’s privacy. In most jurisdictions, to succeed in a
civil trespass action, one must prove actual damages, although the damages may be
slight.
Criminal trespass is more difficult to explain because the laws vary from juris-
diction to jurisdiction. Under English common law, criminal sanctions were not
appropriate unless the trespass was accomplished by violence or a breach of the
peace. Today, some states make any entry onto another’s land without authority a
crime. If the trespass involves violence or injury to a person or property, it is usu-
ally considered criminal, although the resulting charges may not actually be for
trespass itself. Many jurisdictions, but not all, require proof of criminal intent to
prove criminal trespass. There are also jurisdictions that require proof that the tres-
passer had an unlawful purpose for entering into or remaining on the land to sup-
port a charge of criminal trespass. Still other jurisdictions will not find there has
been a criminal trespass unless the trespasser was first warned, by either a sign or
some other method, that trespassing is prohibited.
Generally, courts will hold trespassers responsible for the consequences of their
actions, including unintended or unanticipated consequences. Thus, if a trespasser
lights a fire to cook a meal but sets a forest on fire, the trespasser will be held liable
to the landowner for damages to the timber, the costs of fighting the fire, and any
other consequential damages. Absent specific statutes protecting privacy, courts
will usually not award damages in trespass for violation of privacy.
One of the more interesting and challenging questions of trespass is how far
above or below ground level the right to possession of land extends. In United
States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), the Supreme Court held that airspace above
land is like a public highway and ordinary airplane flights cannot commit trespass.
Nevertheless, a construction boom moving building materials over land may con-
stitute a trespass, as may a roof that hangs over another’s property. A trespass may
be committed by tunneling or mining under another’s land, or by forcing water to
flow under another’s property. A trespass action in these circumstances, however,
will generally be permitted only when there is damage to the surface land or inter-
ference with a landowner’s use of the property.
The old English concept of trespass on chattels has found a new life in computer
privacy litigation. Federal courts in several jurisdictions have held that the ancient

Two-way mirrors
\
567
doctrine applies to the “trespass” by spyware on computers via the Internet. Com-
panies like America Online, Compuserve, Intel, and eBay have successfully used
the doctrine to battle spammers and hackers. The cause of action provides hope for
private users as well in the battle to protect privacy when they can allege that unau-
thorized spyware tracks their Internet use, invades their privacy, and causes damage
to their computers. In addition, states are adopting criminal laws to prevent “com-
puter trespass.”
To understand the concept of trespass, it is helpful to understand the defenses to
the charge whether in the civil or criminal arena. Generally, for example, public offi-
cials have no special rights allowing trespass. Nevertheless, building inspectors,
health inspectors, and the like may have the authority to enter onto private property
without an owner’s consent. The distinction is that the entry is with lawful authority.
Those who enter land to protect another’s property or to save a life will not be
found guilty of trespass. Those with permission to enter property will not be guilty
of trespass unless they violate the terms of the original grant of authority allowing
them to enter. For example, generally a shopper in a store is not guilty of trespass,
as the owner has authorized the shopper’s entry. If, however, the shopper entered
the store to steal merchandise, the shopper may be guilty of trespass.
Property owners are limited in the actions they may take in response to trespass-
ers. They may put up fences and post signs limiting access, but they may not set
traps for unwary trespassers or shoot at them. Furthermore, landowners or tenants
on the land have no duty to protect or warn trespassers from existing hazards, but
they also cannot create situations to intentionally cause harm to those trespassers.
Nevertheless, if a property owner knows that people regularly trespass at one or
more locations on that owner’s land, the owner must take steps to keep trespassers
out or take steps to prevent their injury.

Two-way mirrors
Two-way mirrors, also referred to as one-way mirrors, are primarily used by
police to observe criminal suspects or by retail employees to monitor customers for
theft. Although two-way mirrors are famous for their placement in police interro-
gation rooms and shopping malls, they have become more readily available to the
public and are increasingly used in businesses and even private homes. With the
public’s increasing access to technology, two-way mirrors have become available
to anyone who is interested. Websites advertise the advantages of two-way mirrors

on personal property as ways to keep an eye on babysitters and others doing work
inside one’s home. On the other hand, some voice concern at the availability of
two-way mirrors since owners can place them inside dressing rooms, rental prop-
erty, or hotel rooms to facilitate voyeurism. The harmful possibilities of two-way
mirrors have increased the public outcry for privacy laws that would protect those
who are unknowingly watched.
Two-way mirrors are an effective means of surveillance since those being
watched are usually unaware of it. This is because of the way two-way mirrors are
designed. Two-way mirrors are commonly misunderstood to be a mirror from one
side and a window (letting light through) from the other side. Actually, the two-
way mirror is only semitransparent because it is letting about half of the light
through, and reflecting the other half of the light, from both sides. This effect
occurs when one side is in the dark. When no light goes through from the dark side
to the bright side, and almost no light is reflected back from the bright side to the
dark side, it acts as a sort of window. Therefore, those on the dimly lit side can see
through the mirror, while those on the brightly lit side see their own reflection.
Because of the properties of two-way mirrors, they are commonly used in police
interrogation rooms. This allows law enforcement officials to observe the interro-
gation and questioning process and to monitor for misconduct by both the criminal
suspect and those doing the interrogating. In addition to being used in interrogation
rooms, two-way mirrors have been used to monitor activity within shopping malls,
banks, post offices, and private businesses. Since two-way mirrors are semitrans-
parent, surveillance cameras can be placed behind them to capture any activity
within its viewing range. This is probably the second most popular use of two-way
mirrors. With a camera placed behind the two-way mirror, employers can monitor
not only customers, but their own employees as well. The placement of cameras
behind two-way mirrors is an effective means of identifying and apprehending
those breaking the law.

U
United States Census
The U.S. Census has evolved a great deal since the first enumeration in 1790. As
the population has grown, the task of collecting demographic information from
every household in the country has become more complex and costly. Over time
the survey itself has also changed, now including questions designed to elicit more
sensitive information than originally intended. As technological advances have
shaped census methodological and data dissemination practices, new privacy con-
cerns have developed. Although privacy and confidentiality may be conceptually
distinct, in the context of the U.S. Census, and in the minds of respondents, the two
issues are intricately related. The Census Bureau’s privacy and confidentiality prac-
tices are important factors in determining the agency’s procedures for collecting
and releasing household data. One of the primary concerns of the bureau is data
protection, which requires minimizing intrusion and developing comprehensive
measures to ensure that the data collected remain confidential. Reducing both real
and perceived risk is essential for a successful enumeration. Because census results
determine congressional redistricting and influence the distribution of billions of
dollars in federal funds, government officials, policymakers, and the general public
have an interest in the agency’s ability to collect accurate information.
The Census Bureau’s largest task is the decennial census. Although most of the
agency’s other projects rely on nationally representative sampling techniques, the
goal of the decennial census is to account for every household in the country. This
undertaking required a census employee to visit each household until 1970, when
the agency implemented the “mail out–mail back” survey allowing the United
States Postal Service to distribute the questionnaires and respondents to mail them
back to local processing offices. Each household now receives either the short form
(intended to collect only basic demographic and housing information such as gen-
der, age, race, and home ownership/rental status) or the long form (which is sent to
a sample of households and contains the short form plus additional questions). The
content and length of the long form have varied historically; in the 2000 census it
contained more than 50 questions eliciting information on such topics as English

language fluency, previous residences, the value of one’s home and cost of utilities,
whether a unit is covered by a second mortgage or homeowner’s insurance, and the
number of automobiles per household.
Participation in the decennial census is technically mandatory, but noncompli-
ance is rarely penalized. Collecting household information inherently involves a
level of intrusion. Because a successful enumeration requires the voluntary cooper-
ation of respondents, addressing the public’s privacy concerns is paramount to the
bureau’s success. Respondents have been particularly troubled by the perceived
invasiveness of the long form. Growing intolerance for private market researchers,
generally low levels of trust in the government, and greater fear of fraud and the
unauthorized use of personal information create additional barriers to census par-
ticipation. Political leaders have also expressed concerns. Prior to both the 1970
and 2000 censuses, Congress considered legislation to formally limit the questions
that could be asked in the decennial census in order to reduce what was viewed as
an undue burden and invasion of privacy imposed on the public.
In reaction to steadily declining response rates since the 1970 census, the bureau
launched a research initiative in the 1990s to assess attitudes about census-related
privacy concerns and their effects on individuals’ willingness to provide informa-
tion. They found that the public was not well informed about the bureau’s privacy
principles and that fears of data misuse were especially pronounced among histori-
cally underrepresented minority groups. To reverse participation trends in 2000, the
bureau instituted a multi–million-dollar, professionally designed public relations
campaign that included television, radio, and print ads. Hard-to-count populations
were targeted, and the advertisements emphasized that individually identifiable
census data are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act
and that even the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Supreme Court do not have
access to personally identifiable information collected in the decennial census.
The agency saw the success of the 2000 census campaign as evidence of the impor-
tance of addressing the public’s privacy concerns. In March 2005, the bureau appointed
the agency’s first formal Chief Privacy Officer, Gerald W. Gates, whose responsibilities
included strengthening data protections and educating census employees and the public
about privacy issues. After the 2000 census, the agency also updated its data steward-
ship website, increasing emphasis on the bureau’s legal and ethical obligations to
respect privacy and protect confidentiality. The new content stressed that personally
identifiable information is never published and cannot be used against a person by any
government agency or court, and that employees are sworn to uphold the privacy of
respondents for life, pointing out that violating the census confidentiality oath carries
severe fines of up to $250,000 and/or maximum prison sentences of five years.
The website also highlighted the protection that specific federal laws provided
respondents, as well as the agency’s own privacy principles: the census collects
only information that is necessary for federal programs; respondents have the right
to know the purpose and uses of the survey or census they agree to participate in;
the census is in full compliance with federal protections for research participants,
and respondents have a right to respectful treatment, including reasonable limits
and restrictions on the number of follow-up surveys; access to private information
is restricted to sworn staff; and, statistical methodologies, computer technologies,
and security procedures are in place to prevent identity disclosure.

When the first census enumeration was taken, there was very little concern for
individual privacy. Until the 1850 census, local returns were openly posted and
subject to public review. Citizens were allowed unrestricted access to original
records until 1880. An important turning point in the privacy history of the U.S.
Census occurred in 1952, when the statutory regulations of U.S. Code Title 13
were formalized. The provision establishes that census data may be used only for
statistical purposes and cannot be published with individual identifiers such as
name or Social Security number. The statute also restricts the use of information
that contains personal identifiers to sworn census employees. Legal contests by the
attorney general, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, and municipal governments to release personally identify-
ing census data or master address lists have consistently upheld the strict confiden-
tiality standards set forth in Title 13.
One of the enduring tasks of the Census Bureau is to provide greater accessibil-
ity to data while protecting respondent confidentiality. Increasing use of the Inter-
net and PCs, combined with technological advances, has led to an increased
capacity for the dissemination of census data to nongovernment users while also
generating new sources of privacy risk. In the late 1990s, the Census Bureau intro-
duced the American FactFinder website, which gives users remote access to census
microdata (disaggregated data at the respondent level without personal identifiers).
To make data more easily available while limiting confidentiality risks, the bureau
has developed a number of disclosure limitation procedures.
Prior to 1990, data suppression techniques were primarily used, leaving mar-
ginal totals in tables of aggregate data intact but suppressing small individual cell
values in addition to other random cells, so that the missing values could not be cal-
culated. Data-swapping techniques were introduced in the 1990 census and entail
exchanging records for a sample of cases with a sample of households in neighbor-
ing areas that are matched on the basis of key variables within households. Public
Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) may also be protected by introducing random
noise (adding or multiplying the data by a random number), top- and bottom-cod-
ing (collapsing data that fall above or below a certain percentage of the distribu-
tion), and using population thresholds (prohibiting disclosure of geographic
identifiers for areas with populations below 100,000). A disclosure review board
reviews all requests for microdata files to assess disclosure risk before being
released.
As the census and technology continue to evolve, new privacy concerns and
solutions will also arise. For instance, in the 2000 census, respondents were
allowed to indicate multiple race categories. Although intended to collect better
race data, the change inadvertently increased disclosure risks because of the added
race detail. In 2000, respondents were allowed to file their census short form over
the Internet, requiring multiple firewalls, encryption, and authentication codes to
protect the submitted data. The Census Bureau also is considering within-house-
hold privacy issues. In 1998, the Census Bureau implemented a respondent identi-
fication policy that requests permission to share limited information with other
household members in future waves of panel studies. The bureau also has been
testing the use of the American Communities Survey, based on a monthly random
sample of U.S. households, which elicits information similar to that requested on

the long form. If successful, this could result in the elimination of the long form,
which is perceived as especially invasive.

United States Postal Service (USPS)
The Postal Service was created in 1775 by decree of the Second Continental
Congress. The passage of the Postal Reorganization Act in 1970 restructured the
Post Office Department into the independent division of the executive branch we
have today. Presently owned and regulated by the executive branch, the USPS is the
third largest employer in the United States. The duties of the USPS are to receive,
sort, and make every reasonable attempt to deliver mail to citizens, organizations,
and corporations in the United States. Because the USPS has access to confidential
information, concerns about privacy infringement have been raised. Specifically,
rental procedures for private mailboxes (PMBs), National Change of Address
(NCOA) distribution, and mail surveillance have been cited as potential areas of
privacy violation.
The ability of the USPS to regulate commercial mail receivers is a concern to
privacy advocates. One reason to rent a PMB is to protect one’s home address from
public knowledge. Originally, PMB renters had the most anonymity. In the past,
renting a PMB required only one form of identification and a completed Form
1583 (Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent). However, on March 25,
1999, the USPS imposed new regulations on commercial mail-receiving agencies.
Now the USPS requires two forms of identification from all PMB renters. Accept-
able forms of identification must include proof of signature with picture and a
serial number that is traceable to the applicant. The USPS requires copies of all
PMB forms from commercial mail-receiving agencies, and it keeps those records
on file in case of criminal investigation. The national database that stores this infor-
mation, however, is publicly accessible. These new regulations have resulted in the
collection of individuals’ names, addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security

or otherwise traceable numbers. Public access to this private information may have
serious consequences for lawful U.S. citizens.
Privacy advocates argue that this procedure violates the Fifth Amendment, which
allows for protection of private information. Nondisclosure of private information is
important because it impedes discrimination and fraud. The USPS justifies these new
regulations as an attempt to reduce mail fraud. However, the USPS has yet to demon-
strate that fraud is more prevalent among PMB renters compared with post office box
holders. More alarming is that the personal information required on Form 1583 vio-
lates the privacy regulations of the USPS. Accessibility of this information may, in
fact, enable criminal activity, not impede it. Access to home addresses and otherwise
private information may be a personal liability, especially in instances involving iden-
tity theft, stalkers, and domestic-abuse victims.
The USPS privacy regulations state that all personal information disclosed should
be in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974. Examples of permissible grounds for
disclosure include the individual’s request or the request of the government, legal
proceedings or process, licensure, or mailers if they have the old address on file. Nev-
ertheless, loopholes in the Privacy Act allow for the unintended distribution of confi-
dential information. For example, NCOA lists provide the USPS with new addresses
that aid with mail forwarding when a person changes residences or businesses. How-
ever, the USPS does not actually execute the address corrections. The information
collected on the NCOA forms is sold to licensed service providers of the USPS.
These service providers make address corrections to existing mailing lists of individ-
uals. In addition to address updates, however, these licensed service providers, which
include junk mailers, direct marketers, and credit bureaus, often have other interests
in an individual’s private information. The consequences to private citizens are an
increased risk of fraud or discrimination and receipt of unwanted mail.
The USPS argues that the distribution of NCOA lists decreases the volume of
undeliverable mail, therefore cutting costs. Yet this procedure allows for private
information to be passed on to authorized third parties for unauthorized uses. Pri-
vacy advocates argue that federal protection is needed—similar to protection from
telemarketers—to incorporate safeguards from unwanted mail. The House Gov-
ernment Reform Committee, in conjunction with the House Government Affairs
Committee, has recommended the establishment of national Do-Not-Mail lists,
“No Junk Mail” stickers, and company-specific do-not-mail programs. In addition,
these committees urged the 109th Congress to consider the unintended conse-
quences of the NCOA program.
Besides the PMB and NCOA lists, the USPS affects Americans’ civil liberties in
another way. In response to the 2001 anthrax scares, the USPS proposed implement-
ing a sender identification program. Sometimes referred to as “smart stamps,” intelli-
gent mail would allow the U.S. government to track private mail. This would be
accomplished by requiring and recording identification from individuals sending
mail. The risks to civil liberties include the violation of anonymity and the unwar-
ranted surveillance of private mail. In 2003 the USPS withdrew its proposal to imple-
ment sender identification; nevertheless, mail surveillance is still a concern.
Mail covers, or the enclosing materials of private mail, are considered public
domain. Therefore, the U.S. government can inspect mail covers to protect national
security or apprehend criminals. Moreover, the opening of private mail is an inherent

574
United States v. Caldwell, 408 U.S. 665 (1972)
\
prerogative of executive authority in protecting national security. Mail covers indi-
cating an international origination or destination are subject to inspection by
Homeland Security or customs. In addition, a search warrant is not required for
opening mail in instances of possible bomb mechanisms, illicit drugs, or a threat to
national security. Information collected from mail covers includes sender identifi-
cation, recipient identification, and the class under which the mail was sent. This
information may lead to privacy violations of lawful U.S. citizens corresponding
with addresses outside the United States.
Grounded in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, nondisclosure of personal infor-
mation and protection from search and seizure are considered constitutional rights.
However, the USPS may infringe on Americans’ rights to privacy. Areas of con-
cern include PMB rental requirements, NCOA distribution, and mail surveillance.
Although surveillance and disclosure are in accordance with the Privacy Act, these
disclosures simultaneously permit government and nongovernment offices to col-
lect and distribute private information of lawful U.S. citizens.

United States v. Caldwell, 408 U.S. 665 (1972) (companion case to Branzburg v. 
Hayes)
In early 1970, a grand jury was investigating violations of federal law, including
threats against the president, civil disorder, and mail fraud, by the Black Panther
Party and other black militant groups. Earl Caldwell was a reporter for the New
York Times and assigned to cover the activities of the Black Panther Party and sim-
ilar groups. In February 1970, a subpoena was served on Caldwell ordering him to
testify and produce documents and recordings concerning the activities of the
Black Panthers. Caldwell objected to the scope of the order, and in March a second
subpoena was issued ordering him to appear before the grand jury to testify; how-
ever, the order omitted the document requirement. Again, Caldwell opposed the
scope of the subpoena, citing that his testimony would destroy his relationship with
the Panthers and infringe on the First Amendment rights of speech and press.
In April, the district court denied Caldwell’s motion to quash the subpoena but
did issue a protective order, which allowed Caldwell to refrain from revealing con-
fidential information, which is protect by the First Amendment. The court did stip-
ulate, however, that such information must be revealed if the government could
show a compelling national interest in obtaining his testimony that could not be
served by any other means.
Caldwell refused to appear and was held in contempt until he complied with the
court’s order to testify. The court of appeals reversed the contempt order and held that
requiring Caldwell to testify breached a qualified testimonial privilege for a reporter.
Such a requirement would have an adverse impact on the flow of news to the public.

United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973)
›
575
The Supreme Court granted certiorari and determined the issue to be whether
reporters are immune to grand jury subpoenas and from answering questions rele-
vant to the investigation of a crime. The Court reasoned that the First Amendment
does not give the press the right to publish anything and everything it wills without
consequence, as it is subject to liability for damages and subject to prosecution.
Furthermore, grand juries serve a fundamental interest in securing the safety of the
public, and thus, actions that infringe on personal rights are generally justifiable.
Therefore, the Court overturned the decision of the court of appeals and ordered
Caldwell to testify. The Court found that requiring reporters to disclose to grand
juries information that would be otherwise protected served a legitimate and com-
pelling state interest and was not in violation of the First Amendment.
In the dissent, Justice William O. Douglas stated two principles that stemmed
from his understanding of the First Amendment. The first is that the government
should afford citizens the freedom and privacy of their own opinions and beliefs
regardless of public sentiment. A corollary conclusion reached in the dissent is
that an individual must also have absolute privacy of the information gathered
and used in developing his or her own opinions and beliefs. The second principle
is that self-government cannot succeed unless people are free of general suspi-
cion as to their beliefs and able to participate in an undeterred flow of opinion
and reporting. Thus, by requiring Caldwell to testify, the government not only
infringed on inherent freedoms, but also impeded journalists’ ability to gather
and disseminate news.
Moreover, Justice Douglas points out that in his view no compelling need can be
shown that refutes the reporter’s immunity or forces him to testify, unless he is
involved in a crime. The First Amendment, absent his involvement in a crime, pro-
tects him against appearance before a grand jury, and if he is involved in a crime,
the Fifth Amendment protects him from self-incrimination. Therefore, in the view
of Douglas, the reporter need not appear simply to invoke a right to every question
posed by the grand jury. Thus, the reliance upon which the Court rested its opin-
ion—that there was a compelling state interest in Caldwell’s testimony and infor-
mation—failed to withstand the constitutional rights of the First and Fifth
Amendments guaranteed to Caldwell.

United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973)
The right to feel secure from unreasonable governmental searches and seizures is a
fundamental constitutional protection founded on the Fourth Amendment. The
question in United States v. Dionisio was whether Fourth Amendment protection
extends to security of an individual’s voice. The Supreme Court deliberated on the
need to protect private citizens against governmental mandates to produce voice

576
United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973)
\
samples in an investigation. The Court held that the voice is not included under the
Fourth Amendment and that the order to produce a voice sample is not a significant sei-
zure of an individual’s voice or a violation of the reasonable expectation of privacy.
A grand jury convened in an attempt to investigate federal gambling crimes that
had become an issue of governmental concern. The investigation produced multi-
ple recordings of conversations containing evidence pertinent to the grand jury. In
an attempt at voice identifiation with respect to the recordings, the grand jury sub-
poenaed roughly 20 people to submit voice samples. The respondent, Mr. Dionisio,
was among the 20 individuals required to take part in the investigation.
Each participant was instructed to look over transcripts of the recordings and
then report to the state’s attorney’s office for submission of a voice sample. They
were all advised of their legal rights as well as their classification as possible
defendants in the grand jury investigation. Mr. Dionisio refused to comply on the
grounds that it violated his Fourth Amendment right of protection from unreason-
able governmental seizures as well as his Fifth Amendment right to silence. When
his arguments went before the district court, both constitutional assertions were
rejected. He was ordered to comply with the grand jury’s subpoena and to submit
to the voice testing. Dionisio refused the court’s mandate, and he was found in civil
contempt. He was confined to police custody until either he submitted his voice
sample to the state’s attorney or the grand jury was dissolved.
After a reversal by the appellate court on the grounds that the subpoena did in
fact violate the respondent’s Fourth Amendment rights because of a lack of proba-
ble cause, the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari and reviewed the case. It
reasoned that there was no Fifth Amendment violation because a voice sample is
evidence that is physical in nature, much like other biometric identifiers such as
fingerprints or handwriting. In this case, the voice samples were meant only to
identify the voices on the recording as physical evidence. For the Fifth Amendment
to apply to this case, the intentions for ordering the voice samples would have to
involve testimonial or communicative purposes. In other words, what the investiga-
tion sought to do was no different from comparing the respondent’s face to a photo-
graph in order to determine his identity. The Court decided that the respondent’s
Fifth Amendment right to silence was not violated by the grand jury’s order.
Concerning the Fourth Amendment assertion, the Supreme Court separated the
respondent’s argument into two parts. The first issue was whether it was a violation
of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable seizures to require the
respondent to physically appear before the grand jury. The Court quickly rejected
this issue. Long ago, the courts deemed it to be in society’s best interest to require
an individual’s contribution of evidence when it was requested by any legal fact-
finding body. Second, Dionisio contended that the recording of his voice would be
a Fourth Amendment violation of his expectation of privacy. The Court ruled that a
seizure of Dionisio’s voice is, likewise, not protected under the Fourth Amend-
ment’s privacy clause. A person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy
regarding his voice. A person’s voice is produced in public on a daily basis for the
benefit of everyone who can hear it. It is not reasonable for an individual who
speaks in public to expect others not to recognize or familiarize themselves with
his voice. Simply because a person wishes to keep his voice private does not mean
that his expectation is reasonable if he exposes it in public. Likewise, it is not rea-

›
577
sonable for the respondent to expect his voice to remain private from the grand jury
if, in the past, he has publicly produced it, without restraint, for the benefit of all to
hear.
The Supreme Court concluded that there was no constitutional violation of the
respondent’s rights. The assertion that the Fifth Amendment right to silence would
be violated was flawed. Since the request of the respondent’s voice was made for
evidentiary rather than testimonial purposes, the Fifth Amendment did not apply.
The Court also decided that the Fourth Amendment claim was erroneous. Since the
respondent could not reasonably expect his voice to remain private if it had been
publicly used in the past, he could not expect it to remain private from the court.

United States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294 (1987)
Ronald Dunn owned nearly 200 acres of ranch property. Situated one-half mile
off the public road, the ranch consisted of a home with a nearby greenhouse, two
barns approximately 50 yards from the house, and a fence surrounding the prop-
erty. The ranch had a series of interior fences as well. One encircled the home and
greenhouse. A wooden fence surrounded the larger of the two barns, and another
fence barred entry into the barn proper; both of these fences were surrounded by
barbed wire. In 1980 the Drug Enforcement Administration learned that Robert
Carpenter had purchased certain equipment and chemicals used in the manufacture
of amphetamines, namely an electric hot stirrer plate and two drums of chemicals.
DEA agents placed tracking devices on the stirrer and the drums and tracked two of
them to the ranch house.
On November 5, 1980, law enforcement officials made a warrantless entry onto
the ranch, drawn by their data, the smell of chemicals, and the sound of a motor run-
ning. Crossing several fences, the officers observed—without entering the barn—
what they believed to be a drug laboratory. The following morning the officers
obtained a search warrant, and it was executed two days later. The officers seized
the equipment, chemicals, and drugs in the house and arrested Dunn.
The question before the Supreme Court was whether the barn fell within the
curtilage of the house, and thus whether Dunn had a reasonable expectation of
privacy in the barn and its contents. The Supreme Court held that the barn was not
within the curtilage of the home, as it did not meet a four-factor test. The first of
these factors to be considered was the proximity of the area to the home. In this
case, the barn was nearly 50 yards away from the residence. In the eyes of the
Court, this distance was sufficient to find that the barn was too far away from the

578
United States v. Kyllo, 533 U.S. 27 (2001)
\
residence. The second factor was whether the area was within an enclosure sur-
rounding the home. On Dunn’s ranch, he had constructed several fences. However,
the same fence did not encompass the home and the barns. The third factor consid-
ered was the nature and use of the area. The Court pointed out that the officers pos-
sessed independent and objective data indicating that the barn was not being used
as part of the home. Therefore, the barn could not be placed under the same blanket
of protection as the home, as it was being used for an independent purpose. The
fourth factor considered was the steps taken by Dunn to protect the area from
observation by others. The Court reasoned that although there were several fences,
they were much like those used to corral livestock and not intended to block obser-
vation. Therefore, because the barn did not satisfy any of the four factors, it was not
found to be within the curtilage of the home.
In the alternative, Dunn attempted to argue that the barn was essential to his busi-
ness, and therefore he possessed a privacy interest in it. The Court was quick to point
out that the officers never entered the barn. Rather, they conducted their observations
over the ranch-style fences. As the Court has previously held, law enforcement may
conduct observations from the surrounding open fields, and fences of this type do not
create a constitutionally protected privacy interest. The plain view observation of an
area is not unconstitutional, and even shining a flashlight into a darkened area does
not violate any Fourth Amendment protected interest.
Therefore, the Court reversed its prior decisions and held that the barn was not
within the protected curtilage of the home. All evidence that had been seized was
admissible, and Dunn’s conviction was upheld.

United States v. Kyllo, 533 U.S. 27 (2001)
Federal agents suspected defendant Kyllo of growing marijuana in his home,
part of a triplex. Indoor marijuana production requires high-intensity heat lamps. In
order to determine if such lamps were in use at Kyllo’s home, agents used a ther-
mal imager to determine the relative amount of heat emanating from Kyllo’s tri-
plex. The scan was done from the agent’s car across the street and took only a
couple of minutes. The scan revealed that the roof and one wall of Kyllo’s garage
were relatively hot compared with the rest of the home and the rest of the triplex.
Based on tips from informants, utility bills, and the thermal scan, a search war-

rant was issued. More than 100 marijuana plants were discovered in Kyllo’s home.
He moved unsuccessfully to have the evidence from the thermal scan suppressed
and was convicted, and he appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
remanded the case to the district court to decide on the intrusiveness of the thermal
scanning. The district court held that it was not intrusive because, inter alia, it did
not reveal intimate details of the home. The district court upheld the warrant, and
the defendant again appealed. The Ninth Circuit eventually affirmed the decision
under the Katz v. United States test, holding that Kyllo had shown no subjective
expectation of privacy in the amount of heat escaping from his home, and even if
he had, there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in “amorphous ‘hot spots’
on the roof and exterior wall.”
The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Court held that where the government uses a
device that is not in general public use to explore the details of a private home that
would have been unknowable but for physical intrusion, the surveillance consti-
tutes a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In an opinion deliv-
ered by Justice Scalia, the Court arrived at this conclusion by applying the Katz
“reasonable expectation” test: an object is not protected from search by the Fourth
Amendment unless the individual has a subjective expectation of privacy in the
searched object, and society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.
The Fourth Amendment is most applicable to the protection of privacy interests in
the home, but is extended to protect against searches of many things in which an
individual has an expectation of privacy. Indeed, in Katz the Court found an imper-
missible search in the government’s use of a “listening device” planted in a public
phone booth. While the setting is not a home, and is not always particularly private
because passersby may hear what is transpiring, an individual who shuts the door
to a public phone booth has a subjective expectation of privacy in the conversation,
and society is prepared to recognize that as reasonable.
While visual observation is not a search, this case involved more than naked-eye
surveillance; it involved the use of technology. And whereas the Court had previ-
ously held that enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex was not a
search—primarily because it was not a home, where privacy expectations are
heightened (Dow Chemical Co. v. United States)—here the Court drew the line. It
held that any information obtained by sense-enhancing technology regarding the
interior of the home, that could not have otherwise been obtained without physical
intrusion, constitutes a search. The Court declined to adopt the argument that the
type of information, intimate versus non-intimate, required a different conclusion.
The Court ruled that all details of the home are intimate details. The Court affirmed
that the Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house, and that
line must be not only firm but bright, requiring clear specification of what methods
of surveillance are impermissibly intrusive without a warrant.
Justice Stevens, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy and
O’Connor, dissented. The dissent in this case argued that there was an overlooked
distinction between “through-the-wall surveillance” and “off-the-wall surveil-
lance.” It argued that the thermal scanning, which collected data exposed on the
outside of the home, did not invade any constitutionally protected interest in pri-
vacy. Moreover, the dissent argued that the majority’s holding was contrary to

580
United States. v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303 (1998)
\
established law: that what a person knowingly exposes to the public is not subject
to Fourth Amendment protection. The dissent compared heat waves to aromas
from a kitchen, a lab, or an opium den: they enter the public domain when they
leave a building, and the expectation that they would remain private is not one that
society would recognize as reasonable. The dissent likened this case to California
v. Greenwood (1979), in which the court held that there is no reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy warranting Fourth Amendment protection in garbage discarded on
the curb outside the home. Further, the dissent argued that the majority’s limitation
of Fourth Amendment protection to surveillance by technology not in the public
use makes the holding meaningless because the protection dissipates as soon as the
technology becomes publicly available. The dissent also faulted the majority for
making their holding “home-specific,” citing the proposition that the Fourth Amend-
ment protects people, not places. The dissent concluded with an argument that while
the Court was properly concerned about threats to privacy flowing from advances in
technology, the duty to grapple with these issues belongs to the legislature.

United States. v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303 (1998)
In April 1997, Edward Scheffer, an airman in the United States Air Force, failed
to appear to work, could not be located on base, and was declared absent without
leave from the service. During a routine traffic stop, an Iowa state police officer
identified Scheffer and placed him under arrest, holding him until he could be
returned to the base. A urine analysis revealed the presence of methamphet-
amines. Scheffer sought to introduce polygraph results during his general court-
martial, which indicated he had not lied when denying drug charges and use while
in the service. However, Military Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 707, prohibit
the use of polygraph results in court-martial proceedings. The Supreme Court
granted certiorari to determine whether the exclusion of polygraph results violated
the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to present a fair defense.
The Court determined that state and federal authorities have a legitimate interest
in the admission of only reliable evidence at trial. The impression given by the
Court was that polygraph evidence has poor reliability and that even advocates of
such tests admit the existence of erroneous results. While the defendant has the
right to present relevant evidence, that evidence is subject to reasonable restric-
tions. Courts can make rules restricting admission of evidence as long as they are
not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes served. In the Court’s eyes, Rule

707 creates a balance, excluding both favorable and unfavorable results. Exclusion
of unreliable evidence is a principal objective of evidentiary rules. Finally, the
Court determined that the ultimate determination of truth and credibility lies, and
should remain, in the hands of juries and not machines. A fundamental premise of
the American criminal trial system is that the jury determines credibility. In
essence, the jury serves as its own lie detector. Polygraphs diminish the jury’s role,
and unlike fingerprints, which are solid evidence and fact, a polygraph is another
opinion as to whether a witness or defendant is telling the truth.

Matthew M. Dwyer
United States v. Steagald, 451 U.S. 204 (1981)
In early 1978, an anonymous informant contacted an agent of the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) and indicated he might help the agency
locate Ricky Lyons, a fugitive wanted on drug charges. The informant provided a
telephone number in Atlanta, Georgia, where Lyons could be reached during the
next day. The DEA contacted agent Kelly Goodowens and relayed the informa-
tion. Goodowens contacted the phone company and obtained an address for the
telephone number. Goodowens also learned that Lyons had a six-month-old
arrest warrant.
Within a short amount of time, Goodowens and 11 other officers drove to the
address. When they arrived, the agents noticed two men standing outside the home.
The officers drew their guns, frisked the two men, and determined that neither was
Lyons. The men were identified as Hoyt Gaultney and the petitioner, Gary
Steagald. When the agents approached the home, Gaultney’s wife answered the
door. The agents placed her in a guarded position and searched the house. During
the search, an agent discovered what he allegedly believed to be cocaine. Goodo-
wens sent an officer to obtain a search warrant and proceeded with a second
search of the house. Pursuant to the search warrant, a third search occurred, and the
officers discovered 43 pounds of cocaine. Steagald was arrested and indicted on
federal drug charges. At the suppression hearing, Goodowens testified he believed
the arrest warrant for Lyons justified the entry and search, and that nothing pre-
vented him from obtaining a search warrant.
The Supreme Court has consistently held that entry to a home to search or make
an arrest is unconstitutional unless done pursuant to a warrant, or in the existence
of consent or exigent circumstances. Thus, the question before the Court in this
case was whether an arrest warrant is adequate to protect the Fourth Amendment

582
United States v. Steagald, 451 U.S. 204 (1981)
\
rights of those not named in the warrant when their homes are searched without
consent and there are no exigent circumstances.
In this case, the warrant issued authorized the agents to seize Lyons. However,
the Court viewed the agents’ actions as overstepping the legal parameters estab-
lished in the warrant. The Court determined that the arrest warrant protected only
Lyon’s interest in being free from an unreasonable seizure, but not Steagald’s inter-
est in being free from an unreasonable search of his home. Therefore, the Court
viewed the search of Steagald’s home as no more reasonable than if it had been
conducted in the absence of a warrant.
The Court felt that a contrary conclusion would give police with an arrest war-
rant the freedom to search an individual’s home, and the homes of that individual’s
friends and acquaintances. Therefore, since the agents did not possess a search
warrant upon first entry and only an arrest warrant for Lyons, and because no exi-
gent circumstances existed to justify the infringement of Steagald’s Fourth Amend-
ment rights to be secure in his home, the Court ruled that the search of the home
was unconstitutional.
The dissent by Justice Rehnquist and Justice White stated that incidental
infringements of Fourth Amendment rights might be reasonable in the course of
executing a valid warrant. To support this reasoning, the dissent pointed out that
requiring a search warrant for each house, given the inherent mobility of a fugitive,
would impede the interest of the government and the public in the apprehension of
fugitives. The dissenters noted that in Dalia v. United States (1979), the Court
rejected the argument that a separate search warrant was required before police
could enter a business office to install an eavesdropping device when a warrant
authorizing the eavesdropping itself had already been obtained. The Court stated in
Dalia that when executing a warrant, police often find it necessary to infringe on
other privacy issues or rights not explicitly covered or considered by the judge issu-
ing the warrant. The same situation was applicable in Steagald, according to the
dissent. Although the arrest warrant was issued for Lyons, Steagald’s privacy inter-
est was incidental to the execution of a valid arrest warrant, and therefore under a
reasonableness standard, the government’s interest in the warrantless entry of a
third-party dwelling to execute an arrest warrant was compelling. Moreover, an
arrest warrant is limited in its scope of applicability to a third person’s home. It
ensures that person that the police are there on official business, and that they may
search for the limited purpose of arresting the subject of the warrant. The contra-
band discovered by the search for Lyons was incidental to the arrest warrant, and
not the product of a search warrant.

Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required 
to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act)
On October 26, 2001, President George W. Bush signed into law the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), P. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat.
272 (2001). The massive, 342-page act amended at least 15 existing laws, and it
expanded the investigative and surveillance authorities of federal agencies in pur-
suit of law enforcement and counterterrorism ends. The Patriot Act quickly became
a lightning rod for supporters and critics of the Bush administration’s “global war
on terrorism,” and much hyperbole has surrounded public discourse about the act
and its provisions. Although the Patriot Act was, by any measure, a reaction to the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, nearly all of the authorities created by Con-
gress in 2001 were later re-authorized as permanent legislation in February 2006.
Background
The Department of Justice introduced antiterrorism bills in the House and Sen-
ate less than one week after the September 11 attacks. The department had already
prepared draft legislation expanding law enforcement and counterterrorism investi-
gative authorities, so the bills were readily and quickly assembled. In the rush to do
something in response to September 11, and prodded by the anthrax letter attacks
and the fear that other such attacks could be in the planning stages, the bills were
passed with little debate in either house, and no Senate, House, or conference
report was produced that could aid interpretation of its provisions after enactment.
Although the original administration proposal contained several provisions that
significantly expanded existing investigative and surveillance authorities, the only
important concession made during the consideration of the act was the addition of
so-called sunset provisions (providing that sections of the act expire automatically
after a fixed period of time, unless explicitly renewed by Congress) attached to sev-
eral of the most controversial new provisions.
The act is complex, and many of its provisions are controversial. The act has gen-
erated spirited debate throughout its history, centering on whether the broad powers
granted the government in ways that could interfere with the rights of ordinary Amer-
icans have sufficient safeguards to protect basic liberties. Is the loss of personal lib-
erty worth the gain in security? More than five years later, there is no clear answer to
the policy debate or constitutional questions presented by some portions of the Patriot
Act; nor is it clear whether the act has met the announced goal of making it more dif-
ficult for criminals and would-be terrorists to operate inside the United States.
Summary of the Act
The Patriot Act expands the authority of federal officials to track and intercept
communications for law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering purposes.

584
USA PATRIOT Act
\
The act creates new crimes and penalties, and it streamlines in some ways the pro-
cedures for prosecution. The act also provides the Secretary of the Treasury with
new powers to regulate corruption of U.S. financial institutions with respect to for-
eign money laundering, while it adds restrictions tightening immigration and bor-
der crossing laws and facilitates the detention and removal of suspected terrorists
already inside the United States. Some of the most controversial expansions of
governmental authority were made subject to a four-year sunset provision. After
considerable debate and short-term extensions of the act in late 2005 and early
2006, all but two of those provisions were made permanent in 2006. Two others,
discussed next, were renewed subject to a new, multi-year sunset provision. This
discussion focuses on the portions of the Patriot Act most likely to impact privacy.
Provisions Affecting Privacy Interests
The most controversial provisions of the Patriot Act are those that most directly
affect privacy interests. These parts of the act provide law enforcement and intelli-
gence agencies a range of new surveillance and other investigative powers
intended to thwart terrorism and other crimes. While some new authorities have
been widely accepted, several others continue to generate controversy. The most
significant new powers include
• “Sneak and peek” searches, which make it easier for law enforcement and
intelligence agents to conduct secret searches of private homes and busi-
nesses without prior notice.
• Enhanced power for intelligence investigators to demand access to personal
records held by libraries, health insurance companies, bookstores, schools,
businesses, and civil or nonprofit organizations.
• Expanded wiretapping authorities, which permit law enforcement agents
to monitor personal Internet usage, including inbound and outbound elec-
tronic mail traffic and sites visited on the Internet. Court orders may be
implemented nationwide (“roving wiretaps”).
• Eased restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering in the United States and
greater access for intelligence investigators to information obtained during
criminal investigations.
• Greater authority to bypass court approval and obtain personal records from
financial institutions, telephone companies, and Internet service providers.
• Creation of a new crime of “domestic terrorism” that may be capable of tar-
geting nonviolent domestic groups, such as abortion protesters and envi-
ronmental activists.
“Sneak and Peek” Searches 
The Fourth Amendment normally requires that police obtain a warrant from a
magistrate or judge before searching someone’s home or business. The police also
must notify the person before conducting the search (known as “knock and
announce”). In theory, notice serves as a check against government excesses; gov-
ernment must operate in the open, and targets of a warrant could challenge it if the
search exceeded the scope of the warrant or if, for example, the police came to the
wrong home or business. Lacking prior notice, the target does not know of the war-

585
rant or the search until after the search has been completed. Exceptions to prior
notice have been limited to situations where evidence of a crime was likely to be
destroyed or where notice presented grave danger of physical harm to the investiga-
tors.
Under the Patriot Act, government agents may “sneak and peek” without notice
if notification of a search “may have an adverse result” on law enforcement. The
act allows notice to be delayed for a “reasonable period.” The Justice Department
claims that delayed notice gives them time to gather evidence of terrorist activity
and then arrest terrorists before they can attack. Critics point out that investigators
already had authority for secret surveillance to gather intelligence about suspected
terrorists, and the new law enforcement authority was not needed. In addition, the
“sneak and peek” authority extends to all federal law enforcement activity, not just
terrorism. This authority was not subject to the sunset in 2005.
Personal Records
Since at least the 1970s, federal courts have held that the government may col-
lect personal information that has been voluntarily provided to various categories
of third parties, such as banks, telephone companies, and schools. However,
according to legislation concerning domestic criminal investigations, a subpoena
for banking records, for example, required the bank to give notice to the target of
the subpoena, who then could challenge the subpoena in court before the bank
turned over information to the government. In gathering foreign intelligence, there
would be no notice to the target, but the government had to demonstrate to a court
probable cause to believe that the target was an agent of a foreign power.
Under these two schemes, the government could access a limited range of per-
sonal information—financial records and records from airlines, car rental agencies,
and other travel businesses. As modified by the Patriot Act, any kind of business or
nonprofit is required to produce “any tangible thing” that the government demon-
strates is relevant to “an authorized investigation to protect the United States from
international terrorism.” The requests, like prior ones related to foreign intelligence,
are made by a special court created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
of 1978 (FISA), where no notice or opportunity for the target to contest the request
is available and the court has no discretion to reject the government’s request so
long as the application is technically complete. The showing of a connection to a
foreign power is no longer required, and the information may be sought from an
unlimited range of businesses or nonprofits, including credit card companies,
health management organizations, video rental stores, libraries and bookstores,
and advocacy organizations. In addition, once a firm is presented with a demand
for “any tangible thing,” the act forbids the firm from disclosing the request to
the target or to any other person.
The act does forbid the government from basing a request for records solely on
the First Amendment activities of a U.S. citizen or resident alien. Moreover, the
Justice Department has claimed no interest in the reading or shopping habits of
ordinary Americans. Instead, the department has maintained that the expanded
authority might help uncover terrorist plots, such as learning about the purchase of
bomb-making materials from a feed or hardware store or a chemical or pharmaceu-
tical plant. Still, libraries and other groups lobbied hard to allow the records provi-

586
USA PATRIOT Act
\
sion to lapse by its sunset at the end of 2005. In the 2006 re-authorization, the
records sunset will be extended for a period of years, and a proposal to require the
government to show that the target of the request is connected to terrorism or espi-
onage before obtaining his records faces an uncertain outcome in Congress.
Monitoring Internet Use
Before the Patriot Act, government investigators had authority to use pen regis-
ters and trap-and-trace devices to record the numbers of outgoing and incoming
telephone calls at a particular phone. Law enforcement investigators could obtain a
court order so long as they simply certified that the pen register or trap-and-trace
device was “relevant” to an ordinary criminal investigation. Because these devices
do not capture actual conversations, and are thus viewed as less of a privacy threat
than traditional wiretaps, the law did not require that the target be a suspect in the
investigation.
Under the Patriot Act, the pen register and trap-and-trace order may be extended
to cover “dialing, routing, and signaling” information, enabling the government to
monitor Internet use. Although the act forbids the monitoring of the “content of
any communication,” critics of the provision note that a log of any person’s e-mail
or Internet transmissions can reveal the websites visited and the kinds of docu-
ments viewed or downloaded at those sites. In addition, the Patriot Act expanded
the reach of a pen register or trap-and-trace order to follow the target anywhere in
the United States, not just within the jurisdiction where the court issued the order.
These nationwide or “roving” orders save time, according to the government, and
the expanded authority to monitor Internet use is a necessary part of countering ter-
rorist threats. Critics tend to concede the need for Internet surveillance, but they
argue that because the authority in the act is not limited to terrorism investigations,
the “relevant” standard should be tightened to limit its application to those actually
suspected of aiding terrorism. In the end, Congress voted to extend the sunset pro-
vision on “roving wiretaps.”
Expanded Foreign Intelligence Gathering within the United States
Since 1978, when Congress created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
(FISC) in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the government has been per-
mitted to come to the secret court and obtain permission to install wiretaps and
conduct searches without notice to the target and without showing probable cause
of a crime. The purpose of the surveillance or search had to be to gather foreign
intelligence, and not to solve domestic crimes. Because the targets were agents of
foreign powers and there was no domestic law enforcement purpose to the surveil-
lance or search, the traditional requirements of notice to the target and demonstra-
tion to a magistrate that there was probable cause of criminal conduct were not
viewed as essential for these intelligence-gathering activities.
In the Patriot Act, an apparently simple and inconsequential change in word-
ing—from “the purpose” to “a significant purpose”—has been construed by the
Justice Department and a FISA review court to permit the government to use the
secretive and less protective FISC and FISA to get warrants, even where the over-
riding purpose for the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information. As
the Justice Department and other supporters of the change point out, national secu-

USA PATRIOT Act
›
587
rity crimes—particularly terrorism crimes—have mushroomed in recent years.
Thus, the search for intelligence related to security and terrorism and investigations
of criminal conduct are intertwined to such an extent that requiring separate proce-
dures and separate investigative teams was hindering effectiveness.
The effect of this Patriot Act amendment on FISA was widely perceived as tear-
ing down “the wall” separating law enforcement and intelligence gathering. Intelli-
gence information can be shared with criminal investigators, and law enforcement
information can be given to intelligence investigators. This sharing of information
was reinforced by a related Patriot Act provision that makes information sharing an
express power.
National Security Letters
When citizens provide private information to third parties—banks, and tele-
phone and Internet companies, for example—courts have held that there is no pri-
vacy interest that stands in the way of the third party transferring that information
to the government. Before the Patriot Act, the government had authority to issue
“national security letters” (NSLs) to force financial institutions and telephone com-
panies to release information concerning their customers. However, the govern-
ment had to have “specific and articulable facts” to show that the customer whose
records were sought was an agent of a foreign power. Under the Patriot Act, the
factual predicate was loosened considerably, so now to obtain an NSL the govern-
ment merely has to show that the credit reports, banking records, or telephone and
e-mail logs are “relevant” to an authorized intelligence investigation. The NSL is
issued by the FBI, and no court approves in advance or certifies afterward that the
legal requirements have been met.
Although the NSL provision was not subject to the 2005 sunset, Congress
amended the NSL provision in 2006 to rescind a requirement that the recipient of a
NSL not communicate with anyone, even a lawyer, about its receipt. In addition,
Congress may provide the NSL recipient with an opportunity to seek judicial
review of the NSL before complying with its terms to determine that the request
meets the “relevance” standard and does not otherwise violate the rights of the
recipient.
The Crime of “Domestic Terrorism” 
For the first time in our nation’s history, Congress provided through the Patriot
Act a law enforcement means for charging citizens thought to be engaged in ter-
rorist activity. The crime of “domestic terrorism” includes “acts dangerous to
human life” that otherwise violate federal law and that “appear to be intended . . .
to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion” and occur
primarily inside the United States. Critics of the new crime assert that govern-
ment could use the law to justify investigations and prosecutions of political
activists and nonprofit organizations that are opposed to government policies.
They worry that civil disobedience and nonviolent protest could be construed as
acts that “appear to be intended . . . to influence . . . government by intimidation
or coercion” and that are “dangerous to human life.” Government supporters
answer that these fears are misplaced, and that peaceful groups who do not other-
wise break laws will not be perceived as committing the new crime. Although the

Urine analysis
Drug testing programs operate in two general contexts: to deter drug use, or
punish it; and, to assist in treatment and rehabilitation. Programs may administer
urine tests periodically, randomly, or only in response to accidents or incidents in
which drug use is suspected. Privacy interests differ between settings, but their
combined effect is a generalized form of social control that is based on everyday
surveillance of bodily fluids once thought to be private. Positive tests in workplace
drug testing programs may lead either to job loss or disciplinary action, or to
enrollment in employee assistance programs. Consequences are especially negative
in social services or criminal justice settings, where the results of a positive toxicol-
ogy screen may lead to loss of child custody or even of liberty itself.
Urine testing is currently the most widely accepted and practiced form of testing
used to determine whether individuals have recently ingested illegal drugs. More
than 90 percent of drug testing is accomplished via urine testing as opposed to one
of the “alternative” testing modes (saliva, sweat, or hair analysis). Civil libertarians
resist urine testing on privacy grounds, citing both the act of urine testing itself and
the use of findings as incursions into the protected zone of privacy. Despite their
concerns, urine testing has been institutionalized throughout several major social
institutions in the United States, bringing the habits of millions of people under
surveillance. Two conditions enabled urine testing to become widespread in the
United States: judicial acceptance of the results and administrative changes. Test-
ing is most common in a few economic sectors, most notably transportation, which
exhibits the highest rates of random urine testing.
Since its humble beginnings in the 1970s, urine testing has become a $5.9 bil-
lion industry. Individual tests currently cost $25 to $32. The industry has spawned
a professional association, the Drug and Alcohol Testing Industry Association,

with more than 1,200 members and an allied industry to analyze the results. Labo-
ratories that analyze the results of urine tests are subject to regulation by the
National Institutes of Drug Abuse (NIDA), which operates a national certification
program to ensure that laboratories comply with mandatory guidelines. The indus-
try’s largest customer is the federal government, seeking to comply with its own
drug-free workplace regulations.
Urine tests establish the presence of metabolites, not the presence of drugs
themselves. Its scientific basis was established in the late 1960s, but not until the
early 1980s was EMIT, an enzyme-based assay still in use today, accurate enough
for organizations to risk court challenges in response to its use. Accurate urine test-
ing requires two steps. First, preliminary screening through radioimmunoassays,
enzyme immunoassays, fluorescence polarization immunoassays, and/or thin-layer
chromatography is used to identify samples that may be positive. The second step
uses a more specific methodology: gas chromatography with mass spectrometry
(GC/MS), which confirms or disconfirms the results of the first step. Thus, there is
room for error and interpretation. Enzyme-based urine testing often yields false
positives, and there is always the possibility of environmental contamination, tam-
pering, or human error. Urine tests are generally used to test for marijuana, cocaine,
methamphetamine, PCP, and opiates. They are generally not used to screen for
legal drugs such as alcohol or tobacco. Drug tests cannot document habitual drug
use or impairment on the job. The window during which episodic drug use remains
detectable varies by drug and by the testing technology used. The validity of the
results also varies. However, the technology itself has become less cumbersome
and expensive over time. Today, urine testing kits are relatively easy to use and
accurate compared with their antecedents. Their ease of use has enabled the exten-
sion of surveillance even further into the population.
Although urine testing began in drug treatment settings in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, the U.S. Armed Forces first scaled it up. The military turned to mass
testing due to problems with heroin addiction in combat units during the Vietnam
conflict. Veterans’ organizations and unions challenged the Army Drug and Alco-
hol Abuse Prevention Program in a series of cases in the mid-1970s. The first court
challenges led to recognition that urine tests were a form of “search and seizure”
that implicated the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Fourth Amend-
ment cases concern “warrantless” searches. Urine testing programs are considered
constitutional, despite the routine testing of individuals who are under no suspicion
of drug use (and where there is no “probable cause”). The Supreme Court enabled
broader testing of workers after accidents in Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’
Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989). The courts implemented “balancing tests” to ensure
that testing is conducted for purposes other than criminal prosecution (which
would contradict the presumption of innocence). These tests seek to “balance the
individual’s privacy expectations against the government’s interests” (National
Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, (1989)). Government interests were found
to outweigh individual privacy interests in Von Raab, which involved U.S. Customs
Agents.
The principal at issue in cases of this kind is whether a greater social good out-
weighs an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy. Urine tests are consid-
ered legally “reasonable” infringements on the privacy of some groups, such as

590
Urine analysis
\
U.S. Customs employees, who have a “diminished expectation of privacy in
respect to the intrusions occasioned by a urine test” (National Treasury Employees
Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 669 (1989)). Opinions in these cases generally inter-
pret urine testing as a way of detecting fitness for duty and soundness of judgment.
Military urine testing programs survived their earliest court challenges, so the
stance behind them was later extended to the federal workplace under the direction
of Reagan administration drug czar Carlton Turner. Eventually, urine testing pro-
grams made their way into transportation, health care delivery, and educational set-
tings. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12564, which
required federal agencies to urine-test with the goal of guaranteeing a “drug-free
federal workplace.” Urine testing became commonplace in federally regulated U.S.
workplaces and educational institutions, and later in medium to large private-sector
organizations. When the American Management Association (AMA) first surveyed
its members’ corporate drug policies in 1987, only 21 percent had testing pro-
grams. Despite the expense of testing, that figure rose to 81 percent of major U.S.
firms by 1996. Additionally, school districts began urine testing programs, and they
also have survived challenges. 
In 1997, for the first time, the U.S. Supreme Court demarcated a boundary
between permissible and impermissible urine-testing programs (Chandler v. Miller,
117 U.S. 1295 (1997)). Permissible searches are those that are based on individual
suspicion as opposed to subjecting an entire “suspect class” to blanket testing.
Lack of clarity about what was permissible, and the overall expense of programs
that have relatively low rates of success at identifying drug users, have deterred
some employers and school districts from continuing their urine testing programs.
The effects of urine testing programs on workplace safety and productivity have
been negligible. Despite its presence in the military and the schools, the bulk of
urine testing continues to occur in workplace settings due to federal support and
subsidies for testing programs there.
Workplace drug testing may take place at several points: during the hiring or,
“pre-employment” phase; once an individual is on the job, particularly if there is an
accident or safety-related incident that provokes a higher level of scrutiny; or,
through random testing once on the job. The criminal justice system is another
locus for urine testing, especially for individuals involved in community correc-
tions programs and drug courts, where urine testing has become increasingly com-
mon. Medical institutions also have begun to extend routine urine testing beyond
diagnosis and monitoring for infection to testing for illegal drugs in the case of
pregnant women. The city of Charleston, South Carolina, developed a program that
led to pregnant and recently postpartum women being charged with drug crimes
based on a single positive urine test conducted in the routine course of their medi-
cal care. The Charleston Police Department had never arrested a male patient and
charged him with possessing drugs on the basis of a single positive urine test. The
U.S. Supreme Court, however, ruled that urine-testing pregnant women without
their knowledge or consent constituted an unlawful search and seizure that violated
the Fourth Amendment (Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001)). The
outcome of this case suggests that there are times when privacy interests outweigh
state interests.

V
Vernonia School District v. Wayne Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995)
In the late 1980s, the Vernonia (Oregon) School District perceived an increase in
drug and alcohol use among its students and quickly took measures to address the
problem. The district implemented drug education classes and used drug-sniffing
canines to help detect the presence of drugs on school campuses. Acting on the admin-
istrators’ claim that student athletes were heavily involved in the drug culture, the dis-
trict held a parent meeting to discuss a new drug policy that would require athletes to
submit to a urine analysis at the beginning of every sport season. The proposal also
required an additional submission, once a week, by 10 percent of the athletes chosen at
random. In addition, athletes would be required to provide a doctor’s authorization for
any medication they were taking at the time of a drug exam. To maintain personal pri-
vacy, the urine samples of male athletes would be collected while they were fully
clothed, with back turned, and at a distance of 12 to 15 feet from a monitor of the same
sex. Female athletes produced their samples inside an enclosed bathroom stall while
being monitored audibly by a person of the same sex from outside the stall. The sam-
ple would then be sent to a laboratory and analyzed for the presence of marijuana,
amphetamines, and cocaine. The parents unanimously agreed to the new policy. 
In the fall of 1991, the respondent, James Acton, was denied the right to play
football because he and his parents refused to sign the new policy’s consent forms.
An action was filed against the district claiming that the policy violated the Fourth
and Fourteenth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.
The district court quickly struck down the claim. Upon appeal, the Ninth Circuit
reversed the district court’s decision, holding that the policy was, in fact, a breach
of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment protection from searches and seizures with-
out due process. 
The United States Supreme Court granted a hearing of this case under a writ of
certiorari. The Court argued that the protection given by the Fourth Amendment,
and ratified to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, is only given for
searches and seizures that are unreasonable. To determine whether a particular
search is unreasonable, the Court must balance the extent of Fourth Amendment
\

intrusion against society’s benefit or need. Typically, probable cause is required to
establish the reasonableness of a particular search. However, under certain circum-
stances, the Court has allowed searches to be conducted without probable cause if
the circumstances were exigent or special in nature. 
The Court held that the interests of public schools exist in an area of law where
the special needs of the school outweigh the need for probable cause before con-
ducting searches. The Court has long held that because public schools have been
given the temporary custody of children, they have also been given the responsibil-
ity and authority to protect the well-being of those children. In normal circum-
stances the submission of urine analyses would be deemed unconstitutional if
requested at random and without any probable cause. However, schools have the
authority to require rules of conduct and to maintain a degree of control that would
not be allowed in normal circumstances.
The Court decided that the expectation of privacy is naturally diminished when
athletes choose to participate in a sport. Locker and dressing room activities, as
well as preseason physical exams, automatically reduce athletes’ reasonable
expectation of privacy. Because the submission of a drug sample is conducted in
such a way as to limit the further intrusion of privacy, the policy was an acceptable
means to the ultimate intention of the district’s policy. The Court viewed the sub-
mission of samples by both male and female athletes as nearly identical to the con-
ditions that students are exposed to every day while using the public restrooms.
Therefore, the way in which the submissions were conducted was not unreasonable
and did not violate the students’ Fourth Amendment rights. 
The Court also found that requiring the proof of medical authorization for the use
of prescription drugs was, likewise, not a violation of the students’ Fourth Amend-
ment rights. The policy did permit student athletes to provide the required informa-
tion directly to the laboratory in a sealed envelope, thus maintaining the same
standard of medical privacy that the student is provided under everyday protection.
In this case the Court balanced the randomness of the searches, the intrusiveness
of the searches, and the expectation of medical privacy against the district’s need to
halt a rising drug epidemic and decided that the policy only slightly intruded on the
students’ rights under the Fourth Amendment. The Court ruled that the policy’s
slight intrusion into the privacy of athletes was greatly outweighed by the need for
the district to ensure the safety of students.

Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988
After a list of Robert Bork’s video rentals was published in a newspaper during his
failed Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1988, Congress took swift action and

Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988
\
595
passed the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (VPPA), 18 U.S.C. ß2710. The act
prohibits videotape service providers from knowingly disclosing information regard-
ing a consumer’s rental or purchase of “prerecorded videocassette tapes or similar
audiovisual materials.” Disclosure of the names and addresses of customers is per-
missible under the act if the customer is given the chance to prevent such disclosure
(the opportunity to “opt out”). Disclosure of rental or purchase habits is permissible
if the customer consents; in such cases, it is not sufficient for the videotape service
provider to obtain consent via a membership sign-up form or some other document
that was signed by the customer prior to the request for disclosure. Rather, the cus-
tomer’s consent must be given at the time the disclosure is requested. 
An important exception to these general prohibitions on disclosure is that video-
tape service providers may disclose the subject matter of a customer’s videos if it is
for the exclusive use of marketing goods and services directly to the consumer. In
other words, the renting habits of customers may be shared with other companies
for marketing purposes.
Videotape service providers may also disclose customer records to law enforcement
officials pursuant to a warrant, a grand jury subpoena, or a court order. If law enforce-
ment officials seek disclosure pursuant to a court order, they are required to give the
customer prior notice; moreover, they must show that there is probable cause to believe
that the information they seek to obtain is relevant to a law enforcement inquiry. 
In civil proceedings where a person seeks the disclosure of video rental or pur-
chase information by court order, the individual whose information is at issue is
afforded certain protections: he or she must be given reasonable notice by the per-
son seeking disclosure and must be given an opportunity to appear in court to chal-
lenge that person’s claim. 
All records pertaining to a customer’s purchase or rental habits generally must
be destroyed one year after the information is no longer necessary for the purpose
for which it was collected. This has been construed to mean one year after a cus-
tomer terminates his or her account. Individuals whose privacy has been violated
by transgression of the act may bring a federal civil action for damages. However,
prevailing in such an action would likely prove difficult because the customer must
show that the videotape service provider knowingly made improper disclosures.
Moreover, because the remedy for violations of the act is a private remedy, cus-
tomers must self-police the privacy practices of videotape service providers. Such
self-policing is difficult because there is no provision in the VPPA that requires vid-
eotape service providers to disclose information regarding their handling of a cus-
tomer’s information if a customer makes a request for such information. However, a
number of states have passed videotape privacy statutes that are more stringent than
the federal VPPA.
Although it is unclear whether the act applies to DVDs and video games, most
commentators agree that the language of the statute extends the act’s scope to both
DVDs and video games. An unsettled question is how the VPPA interacts with the
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required
to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), which
allows law enforcement officials to obtain individuals’ purchasing information if it
is “in the course of an ongoing investigation”; this represents a much lower stan-
dard than the requirement for issuance of a warrant: probable cause.

Village of Bella Terre v. Borass, 416 U.S. 1 (1974)
In Village of Belle Terre v. Borass, the United States Supreme Court upheld a
village zoning ordinance targeting nontraditional residences consisting of more
than two unrelated people. The lower courts reached contradictory results based on
the challenge to the ordinance under the constitutional right to privacy. After apply-
ing the rational basis test, Justice William O. Douglas’s majority opinion found
that the ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
Upholding the ordinance, he determined that it did not infringe upon any constitu-
tionally protected fundamental right.
The village of Bella Terre lay on the north shore of Long Island, New York. At the
time of the lawsuit before the Court, the village’s total land mass of less than one
square mile held about 220 homes and 700 people. By ordinance, the village restricted
land use “to one-family dwellings excluding lodging houses, boarding houses, frater-
nity houses, or multiple-dwelling houses.” The term “family” included “one or more
persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage, living and cooking together as a sin-
gle housekeeping unit, exclusive of household servants. A number of persons but not
exceeding two (2) living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit though
not related by blood, adoption or marriage shall be deemed to constitute a family.” 
The owners of the house, the Dickmans, leased the house to six college students
at nearby State University at Stony Brook. None of the six was related to the other
through blood, adoption, or marriage, as the ordinance required. Upon finding this
out, the village served the Dickmans with an “‘Order to Remedy Violations’ of the
Ordinance.” As a result, the Dickmans and three of their six tenants brought an
action under 42 U.S.C. ß1983 demanding an immediate injunction and judgment to
declare the village ordinance unconstitutional. 
Upon hearing the challenge, the United States District Court for the Eastern Dis-
trict of New York upheld the ordinance as constitutional (367 F. Supp. 136), but the
Court of Appeals, Second Circuit (476 F.2d 806), reversed that decision. The vil-
lage appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which heard the case in 1971
and rendered its decision reversing the Court of Appeals.
 Justice Douglas’s majority opinion began by examining several recent zoning ordi-
nance cases that had come under scrutiny before the Supreme Court. Because of the
importance of remaining consistent with its earlier decision, the Court attempted to
analogize the similarities or explain the differences of earlier cases in line with this one.
Given that this ordinance was not identical in its restrictions to any other ordinance pre-
viously before the Supreme Court, Justice Douglas had to engage in a fresh analysis of
the constitutional challenges to the Village of Bella Terre’s housing ordinance.
The majority opinion began by addressing the challenges to the ordinance. Justice
Douglas identified the following challenges made against the constitutionality of the

Voice identification
\
597
ordinance: that it interferes with a person’s right to travel; that it interferes with the right
to migrate to and settle within a state; that it bars people who are uncongenial to the
present residents; that it expresses the social preferences of the residents for groups that
will be congenial to them; that social homogeneity is not a legitimate interest of govern-
ment; that the restriction of those whom the neighbors do not like trenches on the new-
comers’ rights of privacy; that it is of no rightful concern to villagers whether the
residents are married or unmarried; and that the ordinance is antithetical to the nation’s
experience, ideology, and self-perception as an open, egalitarian, and integrated society. 
Upon examining each of these challenges, Justice Douglas found that none
applied to the ordinance. Citing earlier cases decided by the Supreme Court, he
found that the ordinance was not aimed at transients and that it did not target a
“fundamental” right guaranteed by the Constitution, such as voting, free associa-
tion, access to the courts, “or any rights of privacy.”  
The majority’s most powerful argument focused on the role of the courts in seeking
to invalidate laws enacted by legislative bodies. The Court accepted that the “line
drawn” against more than two unrelated people living in a house together might seem
arbitrary or random. The Court entertained the question of why not three or four or
more people. However, the Court responded that “every line drawn by a legislature
leaves some out that might well have been included. That exercise of discretion, how-
ever, is a legislative, not a judicial, function.” Thus, the Supreme Court was reluctant to
second-guess a legislature in making a judgment call. Although the line drawn seemed
arbitrary, the Supreme Court decided that every line had to be drawn somewhere.
Finally, the Court ruled that the ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate gov-
ernment interest. This is the hallmark formulation of the so-called rational basis test. It
is the easiest form of constitutional scrutiny for a government regulation to meet, and
in this case the Supreme Court upheld the zoning ordinance under this very permissive
standard. The majority declared, “A quiet place where yards are wide, people few, and
motor vehicles restricted are legitimate guidelines in a land-use project addressed to
family needs.” Because the Supreme Court did not find that the village’s zoning ordi-
nance infringed upon the right of privacy, the right of freedom of association, or any
other constitutionally protected right, the ordinance survived the Court’s scrutiny.

Voice identification
Alexander Graham Bell’s father envisioned that a person could be identified by
the sound of his or her voice. The concept was to create a visual representation of
the spoken word based on subtle differences in pronunciation. In 1941, Bell Tele-
phone in New Jersey produced a sound spectrograph for mapping a voice on a

598
Voyeurism
\
graph by analyzing sound waves based on frequency, intensity, and time. The orig-
inal purpose was to assist in enabling deaf people to speak. During World War II,
the government began using the technology to identify enemy voices on telephones
and radios. Currently the National Security Agency uses the software to assist in
electronic espionage.
Biometric identification using speech is particularly appealing because it is
minimally intrusive. As with fingerprints, a suspect’s voice can be compelled for
the purpose of comparison without violating his or her Fifth Amendment rights
(see United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973)). An individual’s voice contains
enough individually unique characteristics to distinguish it from others through
analysis. In court situations, the standard for admissibility of an opinion as to the
identity of a speaker is merely that the identifier has heard the voice of the alleged
speaker at any time. The spectrogram assists the process by graphically displaying
sound in three dimensions: pitch, resonating characteristics, and rate of speech.
However, use of the spectrogram presents several challenges. Voiceprints, unlike
fingerprints, are not static. Fingerprint ridge details exist from cradle to grave. The
human voice, however, changes with factors such as age, stress, and health. Addi-
tionally, the process suffers when transmission quality is poor or when ambient
noise is present. The accuracy of voice identification depends on the conditions
under which the voice samples are made, the characteristics of the equipment used,
and the skill of the examiner. Although there is disagreement within the scientific
community on the accuracy of voice verification authentication, today’s voiceprint
technology has advanced to the degree that several circuit courts now allow com-
parisons of the spectrogram of an unidentified speaker with that of an identified
speaker in order to find similar patterns as admissible scientific evidence.

Voyeurism
Voyeurism is deriving sexual pleasure by secretly peering into the private affairs
of another individual, often while the other individual is disrobing or engaging in a
sexual act. Clinically, voyeurism is considered a type of paraphilia, a disorder in
which an individual has difficulty controlling certain sexual impulses that are con-
sidered antisocial. 
A central trait of voyeurism is that the observer or “voyeur” achieves sexual
gratification by seeking out opportunities secretly and furtively to observe another
person. In essence, a voyeur spies on an unsuspecting victim to fulfill a sexual fan-
tasy, which often may be accompanied by autoeroticism. The more severe and
compulsive these impulses are, the more likely they are to lead to difficulty func-
tioning normally within society. 
Typically, the victim of voyeurism has not consented to being observed and
often is unaware that his or her privacy is being surreptitiously invaded. For this
reason, voyeurism is considered to be inappropriate, even deviant, conduct and is
often illegal. Voyeurism may also involve trespassing and/or creating video or

Voyeurism

audio recordings of the spied-on individual. Typically, voyeurism is most often
associated with males in their 20s and 30s. Examples of paraphilias other than voy-
eurism include fetishism, exhibitionism, sadomasochism, bestiality, and pedo-
philia. 
Although there is no uniform definition of privacy, it is generally accepted that it
includes the desire to shield one’s body, including genitalia or private parts, as
well as certain activities—ranging from engaging in sexual conduct, to bathing, to
trying on clothing in a retail dressing room—from the plain view of others. For
example, people ordinarily seek and expect privacy when entering their own home,
when closing a bathroom or bedroom door, or when taking any other, similar mea-
sures to limit the access of other people to their body and personal space. Notions
of sexual conduct, nakedness, and certain bodily functions innately invoke a sense
of privacy; in fact, their public display is often considered taboo. 
Voyeurism is considered to be antisocial because it violates this expectation of
privacy. The classic term for a voyeur is “peeping tom.” A peeping tom is an indi-
vidual who hides and spies on another person with the intent to invade the victim’s
privacy, typically by watching that person while he or she is naked, undressing, or
exposing his or her genitalia. 
The phrase “peeping tom” has its origins in English mythology. During the elev-
enth century, a beautiful noblewoman, Lady Godiva, lived in the city of Coventry.
According to legend, she became engaged in a dispute with her husband, Leofric,
the Earl of Mercia, over an oppressive tax he levied on the people of Coventry.
According to the story, Lady Godiva rode naked on horseback through the city
streets in protest of this tax. Although the townspeople were ordered to stay indoors
and not to look upon Lady Godiva, one man, named Tom, disobeyed this proclama-
tion. Apparently, Tom peered at the naked Lady Godiva through a hole he carved in
his window shutters. As the legend has it, the tax was lifted, but Tom, forever
branded as Peeping Tom, was blinded as punishment.
While a voyeur, or peeping tom, typically does not come into direct physical
contact with his victim, the act of peeping, without consent to do so, into another
person’s private affairs is generally considered to be invasive. It often causes feel-
ings of shame, humiliation, distrust, and violation in the victim. For this reason,
voyeurism has long been prohibited by laws regarding secret peeping, window
peeking, indecent viewing, or eavesdropping. These statutes seek to protect an
individual’s right to privacy from unauthorized infringement by a voyeur, and often
they give rise to both criminal and civil liability. 
As a general matter, criminal law seeks to protect the greater public by prohibit-
ing certain antisocial behaviors, such as voyeurism, and by establishing a system of
punishment for breaking the law. As a companion measure, civil law seeks to pro-
vide a tort remedy through which a victim of voyeurism may seek compensation
and redress against an infringing voyeur. Both criminal and civil law generally hold
that the right to privacy is compromised when a voyeur intentionally and noncon-
sensually peers upon another person’s body or intimate bodily acts.
Unlike Lady Godiva, most victims of voyeurism never anticipate that their body,
their genitals, or their sexual acts will be viewed by an interloper. Voyeurism, by its
very nature, is a form of spying and is designed to pierce the veil of protection that
a victim has implemented to protect his or her body from disclosure to the outside

\
world, whether that barrier is clothing, a closed bedroom door, a drawn shower cur-
tain, or a privacy fence. Voyeurism is considered offensive because a voyeur seeks
to circumvent these privacy barriers. For example, a voyeur often may trespass to
peer inside a window, may use binoculars to view a victim from a distance, or may
employ a cellular telephone camera to capture images under or through a victim’s
clothing as he or she walks along a public street.
In fact, with the proliferation of video surveillance and micro-camera technol-
ogy, the impact and the incidence of voyeurism have magnified. Video voyeurism
is voyeurism involving the filming or recording of another person by use of a cam-
era or other image-recording device. With the aid of modern technology, the video
voyeur has the means to create a permanent record of the voyeuristic invasion, one
that is capable of repeated viewing and is easily disseminated to others across the
Internet.
Video voyeurs frequently use compact, hidden video surveillance equipment to
record surreptitious images of unsuspecting victims, typically women. For exam-
ple, the Internet is well populated with “up-skirt” and “down blouse” images, video
images taken up a woman’s skirt to view her underwear or down a woman’s blouse
to view her unclothed upper body. Unlike the traditionally solitary act of voyeur-
ism, the video voyeur can broadcast these privacy intrusions to a potentially wide
audience. 
The term “voyeurism” has also been used more generally within popular culture
to describe the act of deriving pleasure, but not necessarily sexual pleasure, from
peering into the affairs of others. The affairs may or may not be private, and the
peering may or may not be secretive. This derivative understanding of voyeurism is
commonly used to describe such societal behaviors as watching reality television,
reading gossip news stories, observing 24-hour Internet webcams, and being fasci-
nated with the lives of the rich and famous. Voyeurism in this context is generally
used to describe an interest in sensational, but not necessarily sordid, topics.
Because of the proliferation of video surveillance technology and the acceptance of
its legitimate uses in the mainstream of society, particularly in the news media, this
alternative usage of the term “voyeurism” has increased.

Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967)
In March 1962, an armed robber entered the Diamond Cab Company in Balti-
more, Maryland. The robber made off with several hundred dollars but was fol-
lowed by two cab drivers to a house on Cocoa Lane. One driver radioed a
description to the company dispatcher, who then relayed the information to the
police. Within minutes, the police arrived at the home, knocked on the door, and
announced their presence. Mrs. Hayden answered the door and offered no objec-
tion to a search when the police asked to search the house for the robber. The offic-
ers spread throughout the house in search of the robber and found him in an
upstairs bedroom. During the search for the robber, officers in other parts of the
house uncovered several items of evidence. One officer discovered a shotgun and
pistol in a toilet tank; another officer found a jacket and trousers matching the rob-
ber’s description in the washing machine; and another found ammunition and a cap
under Hayden’s mattress. All of the items recovered were introduced against Hay-
den at trial. The officers testified that they were looking for either the man or the
money in their respective searches of the house. 
In Hayden’s habeas corpus petition, relying on Harris v. United States, 331 U.S.
145 (1947), the petitioner contended that the clothing seized was improperly
admitted into evidence because the items had “evidential value only” and therefore
were not lawfully subject to seizure. In Harris, the principal issue was whether a
search could be regarded as incident to lawful arrest when the suspect was already
in custody before the search was made and any evidence had been seized.
The question before the Court was whether the seizure of the clothes violated
the Fourth Amendment because the items are considered to be mere evidence. In its
analysis, the Court distinguished Hayden’s case from the Harris case. In the case at
hand, the searches occurred prior to or contemporaneous with the arrest of Hayden.
The Court reasoned that the police acted reasonably when they entered the house
and began looking for the suspect and for any weapons he had used in the robbery
or that he might use against the police. The Fourth Amendment does not require
the police to halt an investigation if, in doing so, they would gravely endanger their
\
\

Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967)
\
lives or the lives of others. The Court reasoned that the search conducted by the
police was the only way to ensure that the suspect was alone and that the police had
control of all the weapons that could be used against them or for an escape. The
Court rejected arguments that the officer who seized the clothing in the washing
machine was not looking for the suspect or weapons. Instead, the Court made the
logical inference that the officer was in search of weapons.
The Court then turned to the distinction between seizure of items of evidential
value and seizure of instrumentalities, fruits, or contraband. The Court found that
the language of the Fourth Amendment provided for no distinction between the
notion of mere evidence and that of instrumentalities, fruits, and contraband; the
requirements of the Fourth Amendment secure the same protection of privacy for
both. The Court did acknowledge that there must be a nexus, or common set of
facts, events, or circumstances, provided in the case of seizure of fruits, instrumen-
talities, or contraband between the item to be seized and criminal behavior. There-
fore, in the case of “mere evidence,” probable cause must be examined in terms of
cause to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a particular apprehension or
conviction; thus the purposes of a police search must be considered. In this particu-
lar case, the clothes found in the washing machine matched the description given to
the police and thus could be used to help police identify the suspect.
Launching into a history of warrants in both English and American jurisprudence,
the Court dismissed the distinction between the two types of seizure, stating that it
was unsupported by language in the Fourth Amendment. To the Court, the right of
privacy is disturbed to the same degree in both instances, and thus the clothing seized
in Hayden’s house was admissible, regardless of the purpose for which it was seized.
The dissent, given by Justice William O. Douglas, viewed the question before
the Court differently. The question, in the eyes of Douglas, was whether the gov-
ernment could lawfully seize testimonial evidence pursuant to a proper search
warrant, to be used at a trial, where otherwise the Fifth Amendment would bar
such evidence. Douglas viewed the evidence of the clothing as testimonial because
it identified the suspect, and the suspect should be free from such evidence viewed
as self-incriminatory.

Warrantless search.  See Search warrant
Washington et al. v. Glucksberg et al., 521 U.S. 702 (1997)
Glucksberg was a doctor in the state of Washington. Along with several other phy-
sicians, a few terminally ill patients who later died, and a nonprofit organization,
Glucksberg brought suit challenging the state’s ban on physician-assisted suicide. 
The question before the Court was whether the state’s ban on physician-assisted
suicide violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause by denying termi-
nally ill adults the right to choose death over life. Using a two-part analysis, the
Supreme Court held that the statute was constitutional. The Court interpreted the
statute using a historical, contextual test as well as a rationality test. Both parts of
the analysis achieved the same result. 
Washington’s suicide assistance statute made it a felony to knowingly cause or
aid another person to attempt suicide. In its examination of the history surrounding
suicide assistance statutes, the Court stated that for over 700 years Anglo-Ameri-
can common law has disapproved or punished suicide or the assistance thereof.
However, such prohibitions have never been considered in light of those people
near death. But in recent years this incongruity has been re-assessed, culminating
with the presidential signing of the Federal Assistance Suicide Funding Restriction
Act in 1997. The law prohibited the use of federal funds to perform or support phy-
sician-assisted suicide. Therefore, the Court reasoned that suicide has been prohib-
ited in Anglo-American law and saw no constitutional purpose in deviating from
that historical norm.
The next step of the Court’s two-part analysis was a rationale test. The Due Pro-
cess Clause was intended to protect fundamental rights and liberties. Given the his-
torical perspective of suicide, the Court reasoned that there existed no right to
assistance in committing suicide. To suggest the alternative would violate Amer-
ica’s traditions and values. It would reverse hundreds of years of practice and doc-
trine, and it would go against the commonly accepted policy choice of a majority of
the states. 
In order for Washington’s law to pass constitutional muster, it must be substan-
tially related to a governmental interest. The primary interest served by this statute
is to preserve human life. Other interests fulfilled include protecting the integrity of
the medical profession, preserving the role of doctors as healers rather than killers,
preventing the problem of suicide in society, and shielding vulnerable groups and
persons from outside pressures to end their lives. 
Previous case law, namely Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497
U.S. 261 (1990), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, had no
stare decisis effect in the Court’s opinion. Cruzan focused on the right to refuse
hydration and nutrition as the right to refuse medication. Any person may refuse
lifesaving treatment at any time as an exercise of his or her personal rights.
Casey also recognized that many rights, liberties, and interests protected by due
process are grounded in the notion of personal autonomy: the notion that indi-
viduals are in control of their own bodies and can make personal decisions
regarding how they use their bodies. However, the case at hand is distinguish-
able from these cases. 

604
Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178 (1957)
\
Glucksberg embraces the dignity of human life. Other cases speak to the right to
accept or refuse medication, the right to use birth control, or other such matters.
None of the cases relied on by the petitioners deal with the alleged right to end
one’s life. Granted, refusing lifesaving medication is in fact a means to end one’s
life; however, it is medication that is being refused, not an affirmative action taking
place that would directly result in the termination of human life. Using this reason-
ing, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Washington statute that made it a
felony to assist in the suicide of another person.

Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178 (1957)
In 1954 John Watkins, a labor organizer, appeared in front of the Subcommittee
of the Committee on Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives in
compliance with a subpoena. The purpose of the committee was to investigate and,
in some cases, expose, the activities of members of the Communist Party.
Watkins had either been a member of, or was associated with, several organiza-
tions connected with the Communist Party. Between 1935 and 1953, Watkins had
been an employee of the International Harvester Company. During the last 11 of
those years, he served as an official to the Farm Equipment Workers International
Union, later the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers. He later rose to
the position of president of District No. 2 of the Farm Equipment Workers. In 1953
he became a labor organizer for the United Automobile Workers International
Union. The committee had obtained his name through the testimony of two prior
witnesses. 
Appearing in front of the committee, Watkins agreed to describe his connections
with the Communist Party and to identify its current members. However, he
refused to give information concerning individuals who had left the party or who
had fallen into disassociation. Watkins argued that such inquiries were beyond the
scope and authority of the committee, that they served no public purpose, and that
the committee was engaged in a program of exposure for the sake of exposure. 
The question before the Court became whether the activities of the House Un-
American Activities Committee (HUAC) was an unconstitutional exercise of con-
gressional power. The answer the Court gave rests on the principles of the power of
Congress and the limitations upon that power. The Court reasoned that every indul-
gence of legality must be given to the actions of the federal government but that flex-
ibility must give way to unreasonable infringements of constitutional freedoms. The
Court further reasoned, however, that there are instances, particularly in pursuit of
public need or welfare, when Congress may encroach upon an individual’s rights, but
these instances must be justified by a specific legislative need. Without such justifica-
tion, Congress possesses no general authority to expose the private affairs of individ-

\
605
uals. Any inquiry made by Congress must be made in relation to a legitimate aim of
Congress and not for the sole purpose of public exposure.
Therefore, the Court determined that the committee’s actions exceeded the scope
of congressional power and that Watkins was within his rights to refuse the inquiries
regarding those individuals no longer associated with the Communist Party, because
he had not been given enough information revealing the aims of the committee.
The dissent by Justice Clark considered the notion that Watkins was not protect-
ing his won rights under the Fifth Amendment but rather was protecting the private
affairs of other individuals, namely his former associates. Because Watkins had
already admitted his own involvement, he should not have been allowed to invoke
the constitutional rights of another.
Furthermore, Clark pointed out that in his view the committee was acting with
complete clarity. To illustrate his point, Clark stated that the purpose and charter of
the committee authorized investigation into subversive activity—its extent, charac-
ter, objects, and diffusion. However, in his analysis Clark ignored the “plain mean-
ing” interpretation given to most statutory language and insisted on a more
contextual interpretation. Words such as “un-American” or phrases like “principle
of the form of government” may be vague, but still these are fairly well-understood
terms, and Clark stated that the Court should give them meaning if it could. In
addition, the Court should presume that a legislative body had a legitimate purpose
if the language giving it authority could be interpreted to do so. In Clark’s view, the
chairman of the committee made explicit comments regarding the functions and
purposes of the committee. Thus, Watkins should not be exempt from testimony
simply because he claimed he was not informed of the committee’s intentions.

Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989)
This case follows a long line of cases that have been decided since Roe v. Wade,
410 U.S. 113 (1973). In 1986 the state of Missouri passed legislation placing
restrictions on abortions performed in the state. The preamble to the statute stated
that life begins at conception, and it put into effect the following limitations: public
employees and public facilities were not to be used in performing or assisting abor-
tions unnecessary to save the mother’s life, encouragement and counseling to have

606
Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989)
\
abortions were prohibited, and physicians were required to perform viability tests
on women who were in their twentieth week of pregnancy or later. 
On appeal from the Eighth Circuit, the question before the Supreme Court was
whether the Missouri statute restrictions infringed upon the right of privacy or the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Supreme Court stated that it need not decide any matters relating to the pre-
amble of the statute. Previous case law stated that no state could justify any abor-
tion regulation otherwise prohibited by Roe v. Wade because it embodied that
state’s view as to when life begins. The preamble, in and of itself, is not regulatory
in nature, nor does it state any restrictions in the abortion practice. Rather, the
Court held that the language of the preamble was nothing more than a “value judg-
ment.” Nothing in prior case law, including Roe v. Wade, had barred a state from
expressing itself, and until the state applied the preamble to a situation or case, the
Court felt it would be inappropriate to address or interpret its meaning.
The Court also considered the subsequent language of the statute. The statute pro-
hibited the use of public employees and facilities for the performance or assistance of
abortions. The Court reasoned that the Due Process Clause prevents the state from
depriving anyone of life, liberty, or property interests, but it does not give citizens any
affirmative right to governmental aid or place any duty upon the state to give it
(DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. Social Services, 489 U.S. 189 (1989)). In
other words, this particular provision does not prevent a woman from receiving an
abortion; rather, it leaves her with the same choices as if the state had chosen not to
run any hospitals. It simply restricts her ability to obtain an abortion from a physician
working for a public hospital. The Court simply stated that nothing in the Constitu-
tion forces a state to enter or remain in the business of abortion.
For the second part of the statute, the Court used the same reasoning. However,
the appellees in the case no longer sought relief under this part of the statute, and
therefore the court of appeals was instructed to vacate the district court’s judgment
with prejudice pertaining to this part of the statute. 
The third part of the statute requires a physician, before performing an abortion
on an unborn child of 20 gestational weeks or more, to determine if the unborn
child is viable. The Court considered this part to be constitutional. The Court deter-
mined that the state had a permissible interest in protecting potential human life.
The section of the Missouri statute expressly states that Missouri had chosen via-
bility as the point at which its interest in potential life must be protected. Although
medical evidence clearly shows that a 20-week-old fetus is not viable, the evidence
also clearly showed that there might be a 4-week error in estimating gestational
age. Thus, the language of the statute requiring testing at 20 weeks was to compen-
sate for any error in estimating gestational age. Therefore, the last part of the Mis-
souri statute was found to be constitutional.

Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914)
Fremont Weeks was indicted for unlawful use of the mails for transporting lot-
tery tickets in violation of federal statute. He was arrested, without a warrant, by
a police officer in Kansas City, Missouri, at his place of employment. Other
officers had gone to Weeks’s house; a neighbor told them where he kept his key,
and the officers entered his house. They searched Weeks’s room and seized evi-
dence. They turned this evidence over to a United States marshal. Later that same
day, the officers returned with the marshal to search for more evidence. The door
was answered by a boarder, and the marshal searched Weeks’s room again, this
time seizing various papers and envelopes. Neither the officers nor the marshal
had obtained a search warrant. These articles were provided to the district attor-
ney and were offered as evidence against Weeks at his trial. Just before trial,
Weeks filed a petition arguing that this property had been seized in violation of
the Missouri and the United States Constitutions. He urged the court to order that
this property be returned. The trial court ordered the return of all property unre-
lated to the charges, but it denied his request as to property pertinent to the
crimes charged. At trial, Weeks again moved the court to return his property, and
again it denied the motion. 
The case was eventually appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which
delivered an opinion authored by Justice Day. It set out to analyze the case under
the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures.
The Court recited the history of the amendment and its attendant jurisprudence,
relying on the 1886 case of Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886). The Court
stated that the purpose and effect of the Fourth Amendment is to limit and restrain
courts and federal officials from exercising power and authority in violation of its
edict: to secure the people, their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unrea-
sonable searches and seizures under the guise of law. The Court noted that this pro-
tection extends to all, whether accused of a crime or not, and that courts should not
support any tendency of officers and officials to obtain convictions by means of
unlawful seizures and forced confessions. 
The Court then set out the issue in this case by stating that this case is not an
assertion by the government of a right “to search the person of the accused when
legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime.” Nor is it a
case concerning the admissibility of evidence found upon a person and within his
control at his otherwise lawful arrest. Rather, the Court held, this case involves the
right of a court to retain as evidence the letters and personal correspondence of the
accused, seized in his house in his absence and without his authority, by a marshal
without a warrant for the search or for the arrest. The Court held that if evidence

\
could be seized and held in this manner and used against the accused, then the pro-
tection of the Fourth Amendment was of no value and may as well be stricken from
the Constitution. The efforts of courts, officers, and officials to bring criminals to
justice are praiseworthy. These efforts may not, however, sacrifice the fundamental
laws of the country in doing so. Here, a warrant was necessary, and the invasion of
the sanctity of Weeks’s home under these circumstances violated Weeks’s most
basic constitutional rights. Because the evidence used against Weeks would not
have come into the possession of the district attorney but for the unlawful search
and seizure, the Court reversed the decision and remanded the case for proceedings
in accord with its opinion.

WHOIS database
WHOIS is the popular label for a variety of Internet directories that allow users
to find information on individual owners of specific domain names and Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses. As the only tool of its kind, it provides fairly limited infor-
mation (e.g., address, Internet service provider names); however, the program still
has been the source of much debate. The WHOIS system is frequently cited in dis-
cussions of the relative importance of the First Amendment, intellectual property
rights, and privacy on the Internet. 
Initially developed during the 1980s as a centralized system to query domain
names and other information, the program has grown and changed with the Inter-
net. Today, the WHOIS system primarily operates with information that domain
name registrars gather from registrants. While the system is not directly regulated,
the providers of its information are; the more than 150 registrars are all accredited
and monitored by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN). (Regardless of the ICANN standards in place, the veracity of the infor-
mation found within a WHOIS database is still at times questioned.)
The technology’s advocates present the WHOIS database as a highly effective
means of fighting fraud, piracy, and trademark infringement on the highly unregu-
lated Internet. It is cited as a source of consumer protection, free information, and
accountability. Its critics, however, argue that by readily providing personal infor-

Wiretapping

609
mation on website operators, the WHOIS database may threaten political speech,
free expression, and anonymity on the Internet. They also note that the WHOIS
system has been a lucrative source of information for electronic mail, physical
mail, and phone solicitors.
Like many contemporary technologies, the WHOIS system faces a pressing
challenge to respect the privacy of individuals while also providing open, accurate
information to the public.

Law enforcement uses a variety of tools to perform its functions, including con-
ducting investigations and using wire and net taps, called trap-and-trace devices, to
monitor or eavesdrop on suspected criminals. Use of such tools raises questions
about privacy and the use of information acquired under a wiretap. 
Generally, there are three kinds of devices used by law enforcement to eaves-
drop: wiretaps, net taps, and Data Collection System 2000, formerly Carnivore. A
full-content wiretap allows the government to intercept, listen to, and record tele-
phone calls. A net tap is similar to a telephone wiretap, except that the government
is intercepting data transmitted over wire or through the air. Net taps can access and
record both the pen register, which is used to identify which telephone has been
called by another phone, and the full content of the data being transmitted. Net taps
rely on a variety of filters to search and find targeted information.
Carnivore, renamed Data Collection System (DCS) 2000, is another type of
wiretap that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) uses but has not disclosed
much about. Carnivore is a packet-filtering program that allows someone to filter
and intercept electronic mail. Carnivore has “sniffers” that search a computer net-
work for usernames and passwords, using sophisticated filters to sift through pack-
ets of data and siphon out the relevant information from the irrelevant. Carnivore
has both pen register and full-content wiretap capabilities but must be physically
installed at the site, usually that of an Internet service provider (ISP). 
The right to privacy or the “right to be let alone” is a civil liberty that protects a
person from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. This right is
protected by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Statutory privacy pro-
tections generally apply to government action, which means that private companies
have much more latitude in what they can do without implicating privacy protections.
There are also state rights to privacy and state and federal civil rights statutes that can be
enforced to protect privacy interests.
The existence of a recognizable privacy interest turns on whether and the degree
to which a person has a reasonable protection of privacy in the place or thing being
seized or searched. The U.S. Supreme Court relied on a two-pronged test in the
landmark case Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), to establish a privacy
interest: (1) Does the person have a subjective expectation of privacy in the area

\
that is being searched, and (2) Is the expectation of privacy one that society is pre-
pared to recognize as being reasonable? While there is a reasonable expectation
of privacy in some types of communications, such as in letters and telephone calls,
courts have generally held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in e-
mail messages or in activities that occur at school or at the workplace, despite the
use of a password. 
Electronic monitoring at the workplace is common and permissible as long as
employees are given advance notice or there are exigent circumstances, such as if
the employer has reason to believe the company’s interests are in jeopardy. Most
employers should have a stated policy on randomly monitoring telephone calls for
quality assurance, accessing and reading employees’ e-mails, and owning com-
puter files of employees. Notice can be provided in employee manuals or other
documents that are given or made available to employees. Electronic monitoring
and eavesdropping at the workplace have been justified because many workplace
crimes, including computer crimes, are committed by employees. Employers are
required to post their privacy policy on company websites. 
The basic statute regulating wiretaps and electronic surveillance is the Omni-
bus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. ß2511, also known as
the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA). ECPA provides
broad statutory privacy protection for wireless, wire, and electronic communica-
tions and storage of digitized text information, such as e-mail. ECPA prohibits gov-
ernment agents and third parties from intercepting voice and e-mail, accessing and
reading e-mail or computer files, and accessing customer records from service pro-
viders without the authorization of one of the parties or a court order. Each intru-
sion is considered separately and therefore requires an independent justification.
Failure to get the required order means that the fruits of the illegal search may be
inadmissible in a criminal prosecution. ECPA also authorizes recovery of civil
damages for violations of the act. However, if the information is not used for pros-
ecution, there may be no effective remedy for persons whose rights are violated.
This issue becomes critical when one is trying to access information for investiga-
tion or interrogation purposes that could lead to other information that would be
admissible in a criminal prosecution.
To get protection under ECPA, a person must show not only that messages are
private, but also that the expectation of privacy is reasonable. ECPA covers only
state action and does not cover interception of business e-mail by private persons,
often used in commercial espionage. There are three exceptions to ECPA protection:
(1) when one party consents; (2) when the provider of the communication service
can monitor communications; and (3) when the monitoring is done in the ordi-
nary course of business. ECPA protects both the sender and receiver of public
mail and online services and has been extended to electronic communications,
bulletin boards, and remote computer services. Statutory damages are limited to
$1,000 for most offenses by government officers.
To conduct a wiretap or net tap, the government is required to show probable
cause of criminal activity or probability that a crime will be found. An interception
order requires more justification than a search warrant because the level of intru-
sion into a person’s privacy is greater. A search warrant is required to access a
physical space, a computer, or other device and to read e-mail or the contents of a

Wiretapping

611
communication. Application to the court requires the government to (1) identify
who is requesting the order; (2) state the circumstances justifying the order, includ-
ing the offense and the nature and location of the facilities where the communica-
tion is intercepted; (3) state other methods that have been tried and that have failed,
or state why they have appeared to fail or seem too dangerous; and (4) specify the
period of interception. The typical period of a wiretap is 30, 60, or 90 days. How-
ever, courts provide greater scrutiny the longer the period. 
 Law enforcement also has the right to conduct surveillance, including elec-
tronic eavesdropping, wiretapping, physical searches, and pen trap and trace, to
collect foreign intelligence under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of
1978 (FISA). Under FISA, law enforcement may collect foreign intelligence to
detect espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and related hostile intelligence upon a find-
ing of probable cause that the surveillance target is a foreign power or an agent of a
foreign power. The effect is that FISA created a limited exception to the probable
cause rule if the government is gathering foreign intelligence. There is a special
court that reviews FISA applications. 
The passage of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appro-
priate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA
PATRIOT Act) broadened existing law enforcement tools, particularly in the
area of surveillance and the Internet, and amended several sections of existing
statutes related to computer crimes, money laundering and asset forfeiture, immi-
gration, and the collection of evidence. The act also allowed broader use of infor-
mation obtained from grand juries and wiretaps by law enforcement and
government officials. 
The Patriot Act has neutralized some of the protections in ECPA by making it
easier for law enforcement to get customer records from service providers. The FBI
and other agencies can demand that service providers provide access to customer
records with a statement certifying that the information pertains to an investigation,
without a court order. The Patriot Act also permits voluntary disclosures and coop-
eration by private companies with law enforcement. 
Under Sections 216, 219, and 220 of the Patriot Act, law enforcement has nation-
wide authority to conduct search warrants for e-mail and to expand voice wiretaps so
that suspicion of a crime is sufficient cause to get a wiretap of any telephone, computer,
or cell phone used by a target in an investigation. This is known as a “roving wiretap”
and only requires the identification of the target. The national scope of the act was
intended to minimize the jurisdictional boundaries of investigating a crime and allow
investigators to go through the same process for collecting warrants, but only once. 
The Patriot Act also amended FISA to permit secret wiretaps without authorization
whenever law enforcement says that its investigation also has a “significant foreign
intelligence purpose.” This major change means that wiretapping for foreign intelli-
gence purposes only requires showing that the target is an agent of a foreign power. It
is not necessary to show that the target has engaged in criminal activity. A U.S. citizen
is an agent if he or she knowingly engages in espionage for a foreign power or intel-
ligence service and is about to violate any U.S. laws. The effect of this amendment
allows the government to initiate wiretaps under FISA’s lower standard when the
investigation’s primary purpose is to collect criminal evidence. Such information
can then be shared with other government agencies, and the target may never know

612
Wiretapping
\
about it because notification is not permitted, even though targets of criminal
searches and wiretaps must be notified eventually of the search. Many critics have
argued that the Patriot Act amendments to FISA have blurred the distinctions
between spying on foreign agents and spying on U.S. citizens. 
The Patriot Act has been criticized by civil libertarians as eroding Fourth Amend-
ment protections against unreasonable search and seizures. The government has
defended the act as being necessary to fix certain problems in existing statutes that treat
access to wire and wireless communications differently from electronic communica-
tions and to expand certain investigators’ tools to address the threat of terrorism. 
Civil libertarians argue that the act reduces the search warrant requirements and
allows law enforcement to gather U.S. and foreign intelligence and use illegally
obtained information abroad in domestic prosecutions. The concern is over lack of
appropriate reporting requirements and checks and balances to ensure against mis-
use and abuse that encroach upon the rights of U.S. citizens. 
The effect is that investigators’ powers are broadened without the same level of
judicial review as previously provided to U.S. citizens. The fear is that these
expanded powers will enable the government to conduct massive surveillance and
detain Americans without proving they are terrorists, similar to the government’s
response during the McCarthy era to the threat of Communism. 
Such suspicions seem to have some credibility, following disclosure that in
2001 President George W. Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency
to electronically spy on U.S. citizens placing calls overseas. Some credit this dis-
closure as being responsible for Congress authorizing only a five-week extension
of selected provisions of the Patriot Act that were due to expire on December 31,
2005, under the act’s sunset provisions. Among the most controversial of these pro-
visions are the roving wiretap and informational sharing between the FBI and the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In the end, however, Congress voted to
extend the sunset provision on “roving wiretaps.” Yet despite this action, whether
such provisions will be extended and for how long is unclear. However, it is clear
that the debate over balancing privacy concerns with effective law enforcement
tools will continue for the foreseeable future.

Women and privacy

Women and privacy
Women’s reasonable expectations of privacy are often infringed upon differ-
ently than those of men. Privacy most fundamentally means the right and ability to
keep others out. Women, like men, have longed for and sought freedom from
unwanted intrusion and forced intimacy. However, only recently have such forms of
privacy become realities for many women. Certain invasions into private bodily
spaces are uniquely female, including unwanted pregnancies and nonconsensual sex-
ual intercourse. Through the availability of effective contraceptives, women now can
often control whether and when to become pregnant. Through changes in laws, men
who rape women they know (who are the group that sexually assault women much
more frequently than do strangers) are now subject to criminal prosecution.
Women in the United States have greater control over what kind of privacy they
choose to have and choose to reject than women in many other cultures. In particu-
lar, reproductive rights and freedom have played a large role in increasing Ameri-
can women’s privacy by allowing them to decide when to have children and how
many to have. Four important constitutional privacy cases of the late twentieth cen-
tury are Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and Eisenstadt v. Baird,
405 U.S. 438 (1972), which held that the ability to obtain and use contraceptives
involves the fundamental right to privacy; and Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973),
and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which based the right to abortion on the
constitutional right of privacy. 
Invasions of privacy are often gender specific. Women are denied the right to
safely walk alone on public streets and beaches or in parks or forests. They con-
tinue to have to consider the time of day or night and what they are wearing when
alone in public. These rights of privacy in public spaces are denied women because
strangers threaten them with a serious risk of intrusion on their private space and
bodily integrity. Similarly, cellular telephones with webcams that film up
women’s skirts, street harassment such a catcalls and whistles, cyber stalking,
peeping toms, and obscene phone calls are violations of the right of privacy that
women endure much more frequently than men. 
Sexual violence, when it involves nonconsensual sexual intercourse, is a stark
example of a sex-based invasion of privacy. The act of rape in many cases creates
the risk of the further intrusion of an unwanted pregnancy. If a woman reports her
rape, she will likely be subjected to an invasive physical examination to confirm
that she was raped. She will also be subjected to intrusive questioning by law
enforcement officers and prosecutors. The victim may also experience unwanted
and embarrassing publicity concerning the rape and her conduct that led up to it.
Finally, if the case goes to trial, the rape victim will likely be subjected to prying,
hostile, and humiliating questioning by the accused’s attorney, described by many
sexual assault victims as being raped again. While there are more legal protections
concerning publicity and questioning today than in the past, the criminal justice
system remains highly invasive of a rape victim’s privacy. 
Privacy remains double-edged for women. In 1890 Louis Brandeis and Samuel
Warren wrote the first scholarly article in which a legal right to privacy was
asserted. The privacy they argued for was the “right to be left alone.” They
asserted that every man needs a place of solitude, a retreat from the hustle and bus-
tle and competition of public life. While women value the right to be left alone as

614

\
much as do men, social norms have traditionally relegated women to the private
world of home and childrearing, where they experience little personal privacy. The
darkest side of privacy for some women still is isolation in violent homes where
they are subject to sexual and physical violence. 
In 1929 Virginia Woolf’s book, A Room of One’s Own, explained why women,
like men, needed a private space to engage in intellectual creativity and achieve
self-fulfillment. Woolf’s demand that women have privacy in order to flourish has
been partially answered by enforcement of laws enacted in the late nineteenth cen-
tury giving women rights over their own finances and property. More recently
broad public support for enforcing laws against domestic violence has provided
women greater security in private spaces. In addition, date, acquaintance, and mar-
ital rape are all violent intrusions on women’s most intimate spaces that, like stalk-
ing and sexual harassment, have only been legally and socially recognized in the
United States since the 1980s. 
America’s recognition of a legal right to privacy began with DeMay v. Roberts,
an 1881 case involving the privacy expectations surrounding childbirth. On a
stormy night a doctor brought along a unmarried man to help him carry his medical
equipment to a childbirth at a private home. When the doctor and the young man
entered the home, the doctor failed to explain that the young man was not a medi-
cally trained assistant. During a paroxysm of pain, the laboring woman flailed
uncontrollably and the doctor yelled “catch her” to the young man, who grabbed
her hand briefly and then returned to a corner by the fire. After the child was deliv-
ered and the doctor left, the woman discovered that the man who held her hand dur-
ing childbirth was not medically trained. She sued for this misrepresentation and its
intrusion. The court in DeMay was the first to permit someone to sue for an injury
based on the interference with her right of privacy. 
While the facts of DeMay are somewhat dated, the concept of a woman’s rea-
sonable expectation of privacy during childbirth remains. Women expect to be
informed of and have control over who attends them when they are in labor. Inva-
sion of this right is something that a man can never experience. 
Recent cases that rely on the DeMay case as precedent for women’s right of personal
privacy also involve specifically feminine privacy interests. In a 1984 case, Harkey v.
Abate, a court held that a hidden viewing device in a public women’s restroom at a skat-
ing rink violated women’s rights of privacy. In Lewis v. LeGrow (2003), a court held
that three ex-girlfriends could sue the defendant for invasion of privacy for secretly vid-
eotaping his consensual sexual encounters with them. In Sanchez-Scott v. Alza Pharma-
ceuticals (2001), a breast cancer patient was allowed to sue a male drug salesperson for
invading her privacy by his attending a breast exam given by her oncologist. 
A 2006 Kansas case demonstrates further how certain kinds of invasions of pri-
vacy are specifically targeted at women or more often affect them. In Alpha Medical
Clinic v. Anderson, the Kansas Supreme Court invalidated a demand by the Kansas
attorney general that clinics provide him with the names of all their patients who had
late-term abortions. The attorney general demanded the names because he alleged
that some of these patients might have committed the crime of child abuse by termi-
nating their pregnancies without legal justification. Holding that this demand was an
unconstitutional invasion of the women’s privacy, the court found that three rights of
privacy were at issue: the right to maintain the privacy of certain personal informa-

\
615
tion; the right to obtain confidential health care; and a woman’s right to obtain an
abortion without the government imposing an undue burden on that right. 
Feminist theorists have argued that women have a greater need and preference
for connection and intimacy than do men. Carol Gilligan’s book In a Different
Voice, published in 1982, has been the basis of claims that women see the world
through a connection lens while men value separation from others. Robin West, in
her article Jurisprudence and Gender, asserts that men value separation and fear
connection while women value connection and fear separation. Even if there is fac-
tual basis for such claims, it is only chosen connection and intimacy that women
value; often connection and intimacy are imposed on women instead.
Anita Allen in her 1988 book Uneasy Access examines the lack of meaningful
privacy for women. She discusses how women’s positive values, such as caring,
connection, selflessness, and intimacy, often conflict with their ability to experi-
ence the kind of privacy that men assume as their right. The economic realities for
women, especially battered women and single mothers, often continue to make
decisional privacy and a room of her own very hard to achieve.
Women in the United States today often have far more chosen privacy than
women had in the past. Nevertheless, they continue to confront certain invasions of
privacy that affect them much more than they affect men.

Workplace privacy
The field of workplace privacy involves a vast number of disparate topics and is
governed by a wide range of different laws, from the United States Constitution to
state and local laws in a number of jurisdictions. Accordingly, the law of workplace
privacy varies from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. What issues of
workplace privacy have in common is a focus on the regulation or limitation of the
activities of employers that threaten to violate the interests of employees in keeping
personal information and personal activities private from their employers and in
safeguarding their individual dignity and autonomy.
The United States Constitution restricts the actions that public-sector employers
can take with respect to the privacy interests of their employees. The two primary
protections for the workplace privacy interests of public-sector employers are
found in the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and
seizures and the Ninth Amendment’s more general right to privacy. The Fourth
Amendment generally restricts physical intrusions upon employees’ privacy inter-
ests, such as the right to be free from the searches caused by employer drug testing,

616
Workplace privacy
\
medical and genetic testing, employer searches of the person and property of
employees, and employer surveillance and monitoring of employee activities and
communications. In addition, the constitutional right to privacy restricts employer
intrusions of a less tangible or physical nature, such as employer interference with
employees’ interests in making certain personal decisions and in avoiding the dis-
closure of personally identifiable information.
The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. An
action constitutes a search or seizure if it intrudes upon an individual’s subjective
expectations of privacy that society is prepared to accept as objectively reasonable.
That is, a public-sector employer’s action will implicate the Fourth Amendment if
it invades an employee’s reasonable expectation of privacy; if the employee’s
expectation of freedom from intrusion is not deemed to be reasonable, no constitu-
tionally regulated search or seizure has occurred. Although traditional Fourth
Amendment analysis would find a search or seizure to be unreasonable if not con-
ducted pursuant to a warrant issued upon probable cause, an exception to these
requirements has been recognized in the case of intrusions upon privacy that occur
in the context of the workplace. In the workplace context, courts have allowed
searches and seizures to be justified based on “special governmental needs” not
tied to law enforcement. When that special needs test is met, the courts have
allowed a workplace search or seizure to be justified based on a balance between
the interests of the governmental employer in conducting the search and the degree
of intrusion upon the privacy interests of the affected employee. 
Accordingly, the courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have
upheld public-sector employer drug testing programs against Fourth Amendment
challenge when those drug testing programs have been deemed necessary to safe-
guard public or employee safety. On the other hand, when the employer has been
found to have adopted a drug testing program based on less compelling circum-
stances, such as a general interest in employee productivity or efficiency or a sym-
bolic desire to demonstrate the integrity of employees by showing that they are
drug free, the courts have generally refused to uphold such programs. In addition,
in applying the balancing test to employer use of drug testing, courts have consid-
ered whether the method of drug testing is particularly invasive, such as whether it
involves direct observation of the act of urination in providing a test sample or
whether the drug test measures largely off-duty, as opposed to on-duty, activities.
While Fourth Amendment challenges in the employment setting may occur
most commonly in the context of drug testing, similar challenges have been made
to other forms of employer activities, such as employer use of video, computer,
and electronic surveillance. Because the intrusions deemed to be caused by such
employer actions are generally considered less invasive than that occasioned by
drug testing, employers have generally been required to provide less justification
for those types of actions. In addition, the existence of an employer policy inform-
ing employees of the potential or certainty of such monitoring has been deemed to
decrease the reasonable expectations of employees that they will not be subject to
such monitoring.
Ninth Amendment right-to-privacy challenges have been brought when public-
sector employers have sought disclosure of, or made employment decisions on the
basis of, sensitive personal information about employees. For example, these types

Workplace privacy
\
617
of challenges have been brought when current or prospective employees have been
questioned—in polygraph examinations, honesty or psychological examinations,
or just employment interviews—about intensely private information, such as infor-
mation about sexual practices, religious beliefs, or stigmatized medical conditions.
As in the Fourth Amendment area, these challenges have been resolved by balanc-
ing the employer’s interest in and need for the requested information with the pri-
vacy interests of the employee or job applicant. The more private the information,
the stronger the employer’s interest in the information needs to be.
There are also a number of federal statutes that have implications for employer
actions that threaten the privacy interests of employees. For example, the federal
Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 limits the ability of private-sector
employers, but not public-sector employers, to conduct polygraph examinations
and other lie detection tests of employees and job applicants. In general, pre-
employment polygraph testing is allowed of job applicants in very limited circum-
stances, specifically when employers are involved in providing security services or
in manufacturing or distributing controlled substances. With respect to current
employees, private-sector employers can conduct polygraph examinations only in
connection with an ongoing investigation of economic loss or injury to the
employer and then only of employees with access to the property at issue and for
whom there is reasonable suspicion of involvement in the loss or injury.
Another federal statute that places some restrictions on the actions of employers
that may implicate employee privacy rights is the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe
Streets Act of 1968, as amended by the Electronic Communication Privacy Act
of 1986. This act, known generally as the federal Wiretap Act, places restrictions
on the ability of employers to intentionally intercept or attempt to intercept oral,
wire, or electronic communications of employees. Accordingly, recording oral
communications and conversations of employees can violate the act if the employ-
ees have a reasonable expectation that their conversations will not be overheard.
Similarly, the federal Wiretap Act can be violated when employers listen in on or
record the telephone conversations—a wire communication—of employees, unless
the employer can justify that monitoring by either implied or express consent of the
employee or can show a business-related justification for the monitoring. In gen-
eral, while employers are allowed to monitor the business telephone calls of
employees, they are not authorized to monitor personal telephone calls, at least no
longer than is necessary to determine if the call is in fact business or personal. The
federal Wiretap Act, however, has been interpreted to provide little protection to
electronic communications, such as voice mail and electronic mail. In general,
employers have not been found liable for intercepting those types of employee
communications unless the communication was intercepted at the moment of trans-
mission; accessing those communications while they are in storage has generally
been held to fall within an exception to the act’s prohibitions.
Other federal restrictions on employer actions that threaten employee privacy
rights arise not directly from an effort to protect privacy interests but indirectly
from an effort to prohibit employer discrimination against members of protected
groups. Accordingly, while the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may restrict
the ability of employers to seek private medical information from their employees
and job applicants, the purpose of that statute is to prohibit discrimination on the

618
Workplace privacy
\
basis of disability. Similarly, when some courts have sought to protect employees
from discrimination and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation or status as a
transsexual, the focus of those courts has been on whether the employer’s action
constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, not whether the employer’s action violates a private right to not have
to disclose information or to not have employment decisions made on the basis of
personal information.
A number of states have enacted state legislation to protect the privacy rights of
employees, filling gaps left in federal protection for privacy. Indeed, these state
statutes may be the only protection that most employees and job applicants have
with respect to their privacy interests. These state statutes seek to regulate a number
of different types of employer actions that may implicate employee privacy rights.
For example, a large number of states have enacted drug testing statutes. While
some of these statutes seem motivated by a desire to clear the way to allow employ-
ers to conduct such drug testing of employees and job applicants, a number of pro-
visions of these statutes—restricting the manner in which the tests are conducted
and the circumstances under which they can be conducted—appear to be drafted
with employee privacy interests in mind.
Similarly, many states have adopted statutes regulating employer use of polygraph
tests, and many of these statutes are more restrictive than the federal act. Among the
provisions of such statutes are requirements that certain types of questions not be
asked of employees, apparently out of concern for employee privacy interests. Other
statutes restrict the ability of employers to conduct psychological testing of employ-
ees; their intent is to ensure that employers do not use these tests without a proper jus-
tification and that the use of such tests is not more intrusive than is needed to serve
the employer’s legitimate interests. States have also enacted legislation to protect the
privacy interests of employees in the areas of sexual orientation, genetic testing, and
employer efforts to regulate the off-duty activities of employees.
Employer actions that threaten employee privacy can also be challenged as a
violation of the common law right of privacy, which is recognized as a claim in the
employment setting in a number of states. Although there are several types of
“invasion of privacy” claims that have been recognized, the common law privacy
claim that is most likely to be applicable in the employment setting is the claim that
an employer’s action is an “unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another.”
In general, the ability to make out a claim under this theory requires that the
employee establish that the employee has suffered an intrusion that is offensive to a
reasonable person and that the reason for the intrusion does not justify that intru-
sion. Employees have relied on the common law right of privacy, with some suc-
cess, to challenge drug tests, polygraph examinations and psychological tests,
physical searches of the persons and property of employees, electronic and video
monitoring of employees, and attempts by employers to regulate the off-duty con-
duct of their employees. As with the similar challenges that are brought under the
constitutional right to privacy, the success that employees have had in asserting
common law right of privacy claims depends both on the degree to which the
employer’s actions intrude upon privacy interests that the courts are willing to
accept as reasonable and the legitimacy and gravity of the employer’s interest in
and need for the requested information.

619
This brief summary of the various laws that touch on issues of privacy in the work-
place illustrates the lack of comprehensive regulation of employee privacy. The
patchwork of federal and state constitutional, statutory, and common law indicates
that the protection of one’s privacy interests depends on the particular type of
employer activity that threatens those interests and the particular jurisdiction in
which one is employed. This state of affairs has led some commentators to argue for
comprehensive federal legislation that would protect the privacy rights of employees.
While some would oppose such comprehensive legislation on the ground that such
issues are better left to the states, those arguments have not been sufficient to prevent
the enactment of other comprehensive federal legislation dealing with workplace
issues. These same kinds of arguments were made, and rejected, when the various
federal anti-discrimination laws—Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age
Discrimination Act of 1967, and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990—were
enacted. Nor have these arguments been sufficient to defeat other federal legislation
relating to the workplace, such as the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988.
The law of employee privacy would, in the opinion of this commentator, best be
regulated by comprehensive federal legislation that imposed uniform minimum
standards for the protection of the privacy rights of employees. All individuals
would then be entitled to have some basic protection from employer intrusion into
their off-duty activities and personal characteristics that are unrelated to their abil-
ity to perform the duties of their jobs. As in other areas of the law, such as the anti-
discrimination field, states could continue to be given the authority to provide more
protection than the federal minimum, but they would not be allowed to enforce
state standards that were not as protective as the federal minimum. Although this
approach would likely further restrict employers’ actions that threaten privacy
rights, employers would also gain some certainty about the validity of any actions
taken in compliance with the proposed federal standard.
Although congressional legislation dealing with specific types of employer
actions might be beneficial, it might also pose difficulties, particularly if Congress
cannot keep up with new technologies that might threaten employee privacy inter-
ests. Although not without its problems, more legislation would likely be needed to
address the full range of possible employer activities. Prohibiting regulation of off-
duty conduct that does not adversely affect an employee’s job performance would
be a critical aspect of any proposed federal legislation, as would prohibiting inquir-
ies about private off-duty conduct and other private information irrelevant to job
performance. Finally, any proposed federal legislation should also regulate the
manner in which employers seek private information that is sufficiently job-related
so as not to be prohibited; such inquiries should be made in the least intrusive man-
ner, and employers should be required to safeguard the confidentiality of any pri-
vate information obtained. More specific rules on limiting or regulating employer
activities would presumably be left to the courts or to an administrative agency
charged with enforcement of the statute.
While there would presumably be employer opposition to more regulation of
their activities relating to privacy, the existence of scattered federal and state legis-
lation relating to privacy demonstrates that legislatures continue to be concerned
about these issues. Comprehensive federal legislation is necessary if significant
protection is to be given to employee privacy rights.

X-ray devices
Discovered in 1895 by W. C. Roentgen, x-rays are a form of invisible, highly
penetrating electromagnetic radiation. Because of their ability to pass through most
material, x-rays are used in a variety of applications, including security settings.
Since the events of September 2001, the U.S. government has been investing enor-
mous amounts of money and effort in technology to prevent future terrorist attacks,
especially in U.S. transportation systems.
Currently, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is field-testing a
noninvasive x-ray system known as a “backscatter portal” that can see items hidden
on a person’s body, concealed in vehicles, or secretly stashed in cargo containers.
The system’s signals interact with explosives, plastics, and metals, revealing their
shape and form and thereby making them easy to visually identify.
The backscatter technology works by measuring the solar radiation reflected by
the person or object under scrutiny. The system is sensitive enough to detect metal
objects, plastic explosives and weapons, nonmetallic handguns, and drugs. In vehi-
cle inspections, the driver briefly exits while the screening van slowly passes by the
target, screening for contraband. When a person is screened, the individual steps
into the refrigerator-sized machine, and the technology performs a virtual strip
search, which provides inspectors with a clear view of what is underneath the per-
son’s clothes—skin or weapons. Whether the technology is used to screen a vehicle
or a person, TSA claims that the process takes less than a minute and asserts that
the technology is physically harmless; however, critics purport that generating such
a realistic image of an individual’s naked body violates privacy rights.
The TSA is aware of the revealing nature of the images. It is working with com-
panies to create software that would substitute a generic body but leave in place the
outlines of the suspected contraband. The TSA’s proposed goal for using this tech-
nology is to reduce the long queues in airports and to reduce security threats posed
by vehicles containing explosives.
The devices are currently used by U.S. Customs agents at 12 airports to screen
suspected drug smugglers, at London’s Heathrow Airport, and in London’s under-
ground subway tube since the July 2005 bombings. Furthermore, the backscatter
technology is being used as part of the Secure Automobile Inspection Lanes

Zone of privacy
In Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), William O. Douglas, who
wrote the majority opinion, argued that the choices made by married couples with
respect to family planning are contained within a “zone of privacy” into which the
government should not intrude. Acknowledging that the right to privacy is not
specified anywhere in the Constitution, Douglas maintained that specific guaran-
tees in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments provide ways in
which citizens can make autonomous decisions pertaining to married life. Dou-
glas’s reasoning has drawn heavy criticism, not only from opponents of free access
to birth control products and abortion, but also from legal theorists who favor
strict adherence to the text of the Constitution. According to these strict construc-
tionists, the problem with Griswold is not that it enabled married couples to make
choices about reproduction, but that its notion that zones of privacy could be cre-
ated under the cover of various amendments went too far beyond the Bill of Rights.
The language Douglas used to support the recognition of zones of privacy has
been characterized as needlessly confusing, but it draws from a relatively estab-
lished legal vocabulary. According to Douglas, certain protections included in the
Bill of Rights give off “penumbras,” which are partial or incomplete shadows pro-
duced by “emanations,” that is, implications that are vital to those protections. In
other words, particular guarantees in different amendments create rights that are
implied but not explicitly specified. Although it might be too much to suggest that
these concepts are sufficiently well defined to amount to a “penumbral theory,” the
term “penumbra” was applied to provisions within the Bill of Rights in earlier
cases, most notably by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in his dissent in Olmstead v.
United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928). There, commenting on the “penumbra” sur-
rounding the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, Holmes suggested that it is not wise to
adhere too closely to the actual wording of a law if doing so would obviate its pol-
icy implications.
Although Douglas discussed multiple zones of privacy—indicating that there
may be various types—the area he focused on most intently in Griswold was the
family home. Thus, he cited Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 630 (1886),
\
\

624
Zone of privacy
\
which held that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments specifically protect “the sanctity
of a man’s home and the privacies of life.” Moreover, he conjured up the image of
the police barging into the “sacred precincts of marital bedrooms” to stress the
home as deserving of special consideration. In his concurring opinion, Justice
Arthur Goldberg reinforced this perspective, quoting Justice John Marshall Har-
lan’s dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961), which emphasized that the
home is so central to family life that it falls under the protection of several explic-
itly stated constitutional rights.
With the highly significant exception of Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973),
which underscored Griswold’s stipulation of a constitutional “guarantee of certain
areas or zones of privacy,” the Court has generally tended to adopt Goldberg’s
approach. In Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969), for example, the Court
affirmed important aspects of Griswold but dropped the term “zone” and simply
pointed to broad social and legal agreement on the need to respect the “privacy of
the home.” Similarly, Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980), acknowledged that
privacy might be protected in other environments, but noted that the “zone of pri-
vacy” is nowhere “more clearly defined than when bounded by the unambiguous
physical dimensions of an individual’s home.” Later, in United States Department
of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Authority (1994), the Court described the
privacy of the home as a settled principle within constitutional law: “We are reluc-
tant to disparage the privacy of the home, which is accorded special consideration
in our Constitution, laws, and traditions.”
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in Lawrence v.
Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), focused more on liberty than on privacy in overturning
Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986). However, he cited Griswold as the start-
ing point for Lawrence and, rather than adopting the phrase “zone of privacy,” ech-
oed the pronouncements made in previous cases by starting off with the declaration
that “liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a
dwelling or other private places.” Thus, without decisively rejecting Douglas’s con-
cept of “zones of privacy,” or ruling out privacy protections in other areas, the
Court has located the right to privacy most consistently within the home.
