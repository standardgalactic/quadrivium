Preface
Perhaps the best way to introduce a book about supply chain risk manage­
ment (SCRM) is to start with some real although not necessarily uplifting 
stories. Each of the following occurred in the same week and year during a 
December holiday season. The names of the companies involved have not 
been changed to protect the innocent.
Guaranteed On-­Time Delivery, Except When It’s Not. In its end-­of-­
year edition, Business Week magazine prominently featured a cover story 
about how UPS was going to save Christmas. The magazine chronicled the 
efforts of the man responsible for making sure all those packages ordered 
just before Christmas would make their way under the tree in time. 
Retailers such as Amazon guaranteed that orders placed by December 23 
would arrive in time for the big day. This was going to be a defining 
moment for supply chain managers and online retailers! A convergence of 
events, however, ensured that Scrooge would have the final say.
What actually happened is a perfect storm that will be studied for 
many years. While big shippers like Amazon claimed their innocence by 
announcing that its shipments were given to UPS on time (failures from 
risk events almost always feature blaming someone else), not enough 
planes at UPS were available to move such a large number of packages, 
creating huge bottlenecks.
So, what happened? More consumers than forecast shopped online 
that holiday season, creating higher-­than-­anticipated demand. And, only 
26 days separated Thanksgiving and Christmas, compared with 32 days 
the previous year. A great deal of shopping was crammed into fewer shop­
ping days. It did not help that bad weather across much of the United States 
during this period interrupted package delivery service. Bad weather had 
a secondary effect of keeping consumers inside where they proceeded to 
do to even more online shopping. And not surprisingly, many consumers 
waited until the last minute to place their orders. Why not wait? Retailers 
such as Amazon guaranteed delivery even though UPS has some fine 
print stating that delivery is not guaranteed during peak holiday periods. 
Unfortunately, UPS took a substantial hit to its earnings and reputation.
When Swiping Means Getting Swiped. Target Corp. announced that 
40 million customer credit cards were in jeopardy because of a security 

xiv  •  Preface
breach at its point-­of-­sale store registers. A few days later Target admitted 
that personal data for up to 70 million customers was also compromised. 
The retailer told customers they should examine transactions made on 
their credit and debit cards during a 19-day period and report any fraudu­
lent sales. Making matters worse, credit and debit card accounts stolen 
during this period reportedly flooded underground black markets, going 
on sale in batches of one million cards. A fraud analyst at a major bank 
said his team purchased a portion of the customer accounts from an 
online store advertised in cybercrime forums. The reporting of this secu­
rity breach coincided with a subsequent drop in Target’s sales, likely due 
to a loss in customer confidence.
Shortly after the security breach Target, executives announced a set of 
actions that cost some serious money
Target closed the access point that the criminals used and removed the 
malware they left behind; hired a team of security experts to investigate 
the security breach; communicated that its customers would have zero lia­
bility for any fraudulent charges arising from the breach; and offered one 
year of free credit monitoring and identify theft protection to all custom­
ers. It’s no fun getting swiped.
Heavy Metal Hoarders. A report in The Wall Street Journal revealed 
that banks, hedge funds, commodity merchants, and other investors were 
hoarding tens of millions of tons of aluminum, copper, nickel, and zinc in 
a system of hidden warehouses around the world. So what’s the big deal? 
Once hidden in these warehouses, these metals are no longer tracked, mak­
ing accurate calculations of market supply, something that is needed to 
determine commodity prices, next to impossible to determine. Producers 
are bracing for wild swings in metals’ prices as speculators withhold data 
to take advantage of pricing volatility. Market manipulation is likely as 
metals are controlled by fewer and fewer hands whose interests are likely 
not aligned with legitimate commodity users.1
Toss This Example. In an unfortunate case of how the Internet and 
social media can place a company’s reputation at risk in the blink of an 
eye, a home security video system captured a FedEx driver tossing a pack­
age onto a customer’s porch. This might have remained a local event except 
for the fact that millions of people watched the uploaded video as it went 
viral. Judging from the driver’s throwing technique he is likely the star of 
his Frisbee golf team.
Welcome to the world of supply chain risk management. It is a world 
where the end of your day might not be nearly as good as the start of your 

Preface  •  xv
day. While the examples presented here caused problems at many levels, 
and we do not want to diminish the harm that came to innocent bystanders, 
they illustrate that what can happen in a typical week is not always all that 
typical. As we will discuss, the supply chain world is becoming riskier rather 
than safer. A survey used to calculate the Allianz Risk Barometer recently 
concluded for the first time that supply chain risk is now the top concern of 
global insurance providers. This reinforces our belief that a book about sup­
ply chain risk management is relevant and timely. So, how was your week?
SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT THEMES
As we progress through this book, certain themes are revealed that under­
lie our view of supply chain risk management. These themes support the 
basis for everything we present.
•	 The financial impact of supply chain disruptions can be deva­
stating but is often not understood until it is too late. Studies 
show that, on average, if a publicly held company experiences a 
moderate or higher risk event, it can expect a 7%–10% reduction 
in shareholder value. And, approximately 30% of companies that 
experience a major risk event are out of business within 24 months 
of the event, and another 25% are out of business after three years.
•	 The supply chain management profession has become too comfort­
able with the deterministic models and tools developed over the 
last 35 years. The relatively stable environment of the last 35 years 
is no longer in existence, and deterministic tools such as forecasting 
models and sales and operations planning (S&OP) processes have 
never taken uncertainty into account. Unfortunately, global supply 
chain growth has resulted in uncertainty, complexity, and risk grow­
ing in frequency and severity. The time has come to utilize probabi­
listic tools that take into account uncertainty in order to manage risk.
•	 SCRM is an evolving discipline and will remain so for the foresee­
able future. To be successful in a new global environment, becoming 
a risk management leader demands mastering four stages of SCRM 
excellence: visibility, predictability, resiliency, and sustainability. 
These are part of something we call the 21st Century Supply Chain 
Risk Maturity Model.

xvi  •  Preface
•	 Supply chain strategies driven primarily by cost management 
and delivery improvements are no longer comprehensive enough. 
The time has come to make supply chain risk assessments part of the 
supply chain planning process. Today these risk assessments are still 
unfortunately more of an afterthought.
•	 Showing a hard return on investment for risk management initia­
tives is a difficult sell. How do you justify an investment for manag­
ing something as vague as a potential risk event? Our view is that 
traditional financial models are proving to be inadequate when eval­
uating risk management investments.
•	 Social media is the new risk wild card. A brand built over 50 years 
can come under attack with a tweet (regardless of whether the tweet 
is true or not). A negative video on YouTube can go viral in minutes. 
Social media can amplify the outcome from risk events that may 
have previously been localized.
•	 The risk ledger has two sides. One side of the risk ledger is the neg­
ative side of risk. The other side of the ledger, however, represents 
opportunity management. It is the upside of risk, as someone’s risk 
is often another’s opportunity. Our focus, while recognizing both 
sides of this ledger, will stress the downside of risk.
•	 Supply chain risk is making it to the big leagues. Companies are 
placing supply chain risk management verbiage in their 10K and 
annual reports, something that was rare not too long ago. This illus­
trates how seriously supply chain risk is being taken at the corpo­
rate level. Unfortunately, it also shows how serious the impact can be 
from supply chain disruptions.
•	 Risk heroics must give way to risk prevention wherever possible. 
Interviews with leading executives lead us to a clear conclusion. 
Most companies are tired of responding, sometimes heroically, 
when a risk event occurs. Increasingly these companies would like to 
model, anticipate, and even prevent risk events from occurring. The 
pendulum needs to shift from heroic responsiveness to proactive risk 
prevention wherever possible. Constantly running around with your 
hair on fire gets tiring.
•	 We need to take a broader rather than narrower view of supply 
chain risk management. As a concept, SCRM is similar to Lean 
and Six Sigma. A narrow view of these concepts considers them 
mainly as a set of tools and techniques. The broader view, and the 
one endorsed throughput this book, is that SCRM, like Lean and Six 

Preface  •  xvii
Sigma, is supply chain–­wide, affects an organization’s culture, and 
can have a positive or negative strategic impact.
•	 Supply chain risk is increasing, not decreasing. With globaliza­
tion expanding at a remarkable rate over the last 20 years, supply 
chains have moved into areas where they’ve never operated. Thus, 
uncertainty, complexity, and risk have grown exponentially. If any­
one claims that supply chain risk is decreasing in terms of impact 
and concern, ask to see their evidence. We will show an abundance 
of evidence to indicate the contrary.
ORGANIZATION OF THIS BOOK
This book is organized into four sections. The first section sets the stage 
by positioning our understanding of supply chain risk management. 
Chapter 1 explains the important concepts and terminology that appear 
throughout this book. The second chapter provides an overview of the 
“as is” state of SCRM, an overview that reveals that while most manag­
ers appreciate the importance and danger of risk, few organizations are 
prepared for this new environment. Chapter 3 recognizes that achieving 
excellence in any area, including risk management, does not happen simply 
because a company announces its desire for excellence. It also highlights a 
set of enablers that provide the foundation for effective risk management.
The second section of this book presents a traditional but still important 
view of SCRM. Here, we address strategic risk (Chapter 4), hazard risk 
(Chapter 5), financial risk (Chapter 6), and operational risk (Chapter 7). 
These chapters will describe many approaches for addressing risk within 
these four categories.
Section III dives into the emerging discipline called supply chain risk 
management. Chapter  8 addresses fraud, corruption, theft, and coun­
terfeiting; while Chapter 9 presents a set of emerging risk management 
frameworks. This is followed by two leading-­edge topics—using probabi­
listic models to understand risk (Chapter 10), and using analytics to pre­
dict the future (Chapter 11). Chapter 12 presents an emerging set of risk 
management tools, techniques, and approaches that are broader than what 
we typically associate currently with risk management. The important 
topic of risk measurement appears in Chapter 13, and Chapter 14 presents 
an overview of companies that are well respected in terms of their risk 

xviii  •  Preface
management capabilities. The final section of the book consists of a single 
chapter that provides a forward-­looking perspective in terms of SCRM. 
This chapter also includes a set of steps for moving a company’s risk man­
agement agenda forward.
This book also includes an appendix, which presents a risk self-­
assessment tool that will provide value far beyond the cost of this book. 
We also provide a web address for free access to this tool.
Although this book is not a novel, we recommend reading the chapters 
in the sequence they are presented. Rest assured, however, that moving out 
of sequence will not get anyone in too much trouble.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
As we proceed, it is important to keep in mind that risk management 
capabilities are often relative, which the following narrative illustrates: 
The CEOs of two competing companies are walking through the woods 
when they come upon a very large and ornery bear. As the bear roars men­
acingly, one CEO drops quickly to his knee and begins to tighten his shoe­
laces. The other CEO says, “What are you doing? You can’t outrun that 
bear!” The first CEO replies, “I don’t have to outrun that bear. I only have 
to outrun you!”
Often in business we only have to run a bit faster than our competitors. 
The same is true in risk management. While we would always like to antic­
ipate and then prevent risk from happening, when risk events do occur, 
being faster, flexible, and more responsive than others can make a world 
of difference. A primary objective of this book is to understand within the 
domain of supply chain risk management how to run a bit faster and bet­
ter than the others. Let the journey begin!

Supply Chain Risk Management
Setting the Stage
Floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, and billowing clouds of ash 
from obscure volcanoes all share something in common. Over the last sev­
eral years these events have been featured prominently in the news—and 
each has had the inevitable effect of disrupting the supply chains of entire 
industries. But these kinds of disruptions were not on the minds of Astellas 
Pharma executives when thieves stole a trailer from a truck stop containing 
$10 million of the company’s pharmaceutical products. What followed was 
a lesson in supply chain risk that felt like a swift punch in the gut.
When the accountants had completed their final tabulations, they found 
that the stolen products represented only a fraction of the losses suffered 
by Astellas. Based on a recommendation from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, the company contacted every party in its supply chain, 
ranging from wholesalers to hospitals, warning them of the stolen drugs. 
As a preventive measure the company withdrew from the marketplace all 
drugs with the same lot numbers as those that were stolen. Some of the sto­
len pharmaceuticals required strict climate control, something the thieves 
(who were eventually caught) were not too concerned about, making a 
return of these products a necessity. The loss of this trailer eventually cost 
the company $47 million, wiping out a large chunk of its North American 
profit for that quarter.1
Welcome to the sometimes unpleasant world of supply chain risk man­
agement. This chapter starts our journey into this evolving discipline by 
setting the stage for important concepts that appear throughout this book. 
We begin by providing various definitions and perspectives of this thing 
called risk. Next, we present reasons why a focus on supply chain risk 
management has become a necessity rather than a luxury. This is followed

by an explanation of various risk terms and concepts, a categorization of 
risk, and a presentation of generic risk management approaches.
THE CONCEPT OF RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT
A logical place to start is to explain what we mean by risk, particularly 
since this concept can be defined in various ways. One common perspec­
tive simply says that risk is a situation involving exposure to danger or 
loss. Another perspective takes this a step further by adding that risk is the 
probability or threat of damage, injury, liability, loss, or other negative 
occurrences that are caused by external or internal vulnerabilities and 
that may be avoided through preemptive action.2 Another view states that 
risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives. Risk can also be viewed, 
at least partly, as the inability to capitalize on an opportunity. For our 
purposes we define risk as the probability of realizing an unintended or 
unwanted consequence that leads to an undesirable outcome such as loss, 
injury, harm, or missed opportunity. Warren Buffet once observed that 
risk comes from not knowing what you are doing.
Most risk observers believe that when a risk becomes a reality, something 
bad usually happens. Not surprisingly, supply chain managers almost 
always look at risk in terms of something to be avoided. And to say that 
most supply chain managers are generally risk averse would be an under­
statement. Conversely, entrepreneurs look at risk through a different lens. 
They view risk in terms of upside opportunities and missed opportunities 
when failing to act. To those individuals, creative risk taking is essential 
to any goal where the stakes are high. Thoughtless risks are destructive, 
of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution, which 
prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize an opportunity.3
Aswath Damodaran, a professor at New York University, writes that 
every major advance that civilizations have made involves someone will­
ing to take a risk by challenging the status quo. He further states that the 
most successful firms in any industry actively seek out and exploit risk to 
their own advantage.4 He states, “Successful firms, over time, can attri­
bute their successes not to avoiding risk but to seeking out and taking 
the “right” risks. This perspective views risk as an event or activity that 
may have an impact on an organization’s ability to achieve its objectives 

Supply Chain Risk Management: Setting the Stage  •  3
or may cause a missed opportunity. The single-­minded view that risk is 
all about avoidance is, in his view, narrow and constraining. It can also be 
quite paralyzing.
Damodaran’s review of risk supports three conclusions that align well 
with the philosophy of this book. The first is that while some risk defini­
tions focus strictly on the probability of an event occurring, richer per­
spectives extend this to incorporate a valuation of the consequence of that 
event. In other words, risk is multidimensional. Throughout this book we 
will present techniques that consider probability and consequences and 
model them accordingly. A second conclusion is that in some disciplines a 
clear distinction is made between a risk and a threat. With this perspective 
a threat is thought to be a lower probability event while risk is regarded as a 
higher probability event. Finally, some definitions of risk focus only on 
the downside of risk, whereas other perspectives are more expansive and 
consider all variability as risk, including lost opportunities. A company 
that has more demand for its products than what it is capable of producing 
appears to have a welcome problem. In reality, the strains placed on that 
company as it struggles to satisfy demand can affect customer satisfaction, 
brand reputation, profitability, and even survival.
Each day every company and human being face risk situations. At the 
individual level, did you drive a car or fly in a plane today? Did you cross 
a busy street or share the road with cars while riding a bike? Did you eat 
food at a restaurant where you did not see how the food was prepared? Did 
you walk down a flight of stairs? Did you step into the shower? Do you have 
money in the stock market? Did you take an exam without studying? If the 
answer to even a few of these questions is yes, you have exposed yourself 
to risk, just like everyone else on the planet. The challenge becomes one 
of not allowing a fear of risk to paralyze us from pursuing opportunities 
that are important to our personal and professional advancement. Risk is 
something we need to manage.
Defining Enterprise Risk Management
It is important to differentiate between enterprise risk management 
(ERM) and supply chain risk management (SCRM), distinctions that are 
central to this book. Almost all corporate executives are aware of ERM, a 
concept that has been around for decades. Using a definition developed by 
the Aberdeen Group, ERM is

4  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
the process for effective identification, assessment, and management of all 
significant risks to an entity. This includes not only the traditional areas of 
financial and hazard risk, but also larger operational and strategic risks. 
ERM refers to the people, tools, systems, and structures that are part of a 
broader framework of Governance, Risk, and Compliance.5 
Chapter  9 will highlight several ERM frameworks, including the 
then COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway 
Commission) framework and the ISO (International Organization for 
Standardization) standards relating to risk as well as Governance, Risk, 
and Compliance.
Corporate executives have been concerned with enterprise risk for years, 
particularly at publicly traded companies. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded companies to identify the 
material risks they face at the corporate level in Section 1A of their com­
pany’s 10-K report. Failure to identify these risks can result in claims by 
shareholders that the company did not adequately warn them of potential 
risks, which could present some liability to a company.
Risk identification within the 10-K reporting requirements is an impor­
tant part of the ERM process. Historically, the vast majority of risks iden­
tified in the 10-K report related to financial and legal risks. Operating and 
other supply chain risks simply were not perceived as important enough 
to be addressed at the ERM or 10-K level. Unfortunately, the world has 
changed and, from a risk perspective, not for the better.
Table 1.1 identifies the enterprise risks identified in Apple’s 10-K report. 
More than one third of the key risks identified by Apple have supply chain 
connections or implications (those risks are designated with a check 
mark); something that is becoming increasingly prevalent as supply chain 
risks earn the dubious “honor” of making the enterprise risk list. While 
supply chain managers have been asking for increased attention at the cor­
porate level for years, increasing the number of supply chain–­related risks 
on the 10-K report is probably not what they had in mind. Watch what 
you wish for.
ERM is traditionally the responsibility of finance, treasury, insurance, 
and legal groups at the corporate level. In fact, a survey by Accenture 
revealed that at the corporate level, 98% of organizations have what they 
consider to be a chief risk officer. And, according to Accenture, 96% of risk 
management owners report to the CEO.6 With that said, the chief risk offi­
cer is often a dual position. At General Motors, for example, the chief risk

officer is also the company’s general auditor. At other companies the chief 
risk officer may be the chief financial officer (CFO). And at some compa­
nies the chief risk officer may be part of the insurance group.
Defining Supply Chain Risk Management
Now that we have a working knowledge of ERM, what is supply chain 
risk management (SCRM)? The definition partly reflects someone’s 
professional discipline or where they reside in the supply chain. In the 
information technology space, the National Institute for Standards and 
Technology defines supply chain risk management as a “multidisciplinary 
practice with a number of interconnected enterprise processes that, when 
performed correctly, will help departments and agencies manage the risk 
of using information technology products and services.”7 MITRE, a pri­
vate, not-­for-­profit corporation that provides engineering and technical 
services to the federal government, defines SCRM as “a discipline that 
addresses the threats and vulnerabilities of commercially acquired infor­
mation and communications technologies within and used by government 
information and weapon systems. Through SCRM, systems engineers can 
minimize the risk to systems and their components obtained from sources 
that are not trusted or identifiable as well as those that provide inferior 
material or parts.”8 A third perspective, and the one that most closely aligns 
with our philosophy, says that supply chain risk management (SCRM) is 
“the implementation of strategies to manage everyday and exceptional

risks along the supply chain through continuous risk assessment with the 
objective of reducing vulnerability and ensuring continuity.”9
One way to view supply chain risk management is to think of it as the 
intersection of supply chain management and risk management. One 
thing we know about SCRM is that no standard definition exists. This is 
one indicator that SCRM is still an evolving discipline. Risk is embedded 
within so many business disciplines that it should come as no surprise that 
different groups perceive this concept differently.
WHY FOCUS ON SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT?
Anecdotal accounts of why supply chain risk management must become a 
corporate concern are not hard to come by. In fact, we will present dozens 
of examples that reveal the downside of risk. While natural disasters like 
hurricanes and floods grab the headlines, the reality is that supply chains 
face a whole range of risks that most observers believe only to be increasing. 
A survey by American Productivity and Quality Center (APQC) revealed 
that 75% of responding companies indicated they were hit by a major supply 
chain disruption during the two-­year period prior to the date of the survey.
A classic example of supply chain risk involves a fire that destroyed an 
electronics supplier in New Mexico that supplied Nokia and Ericsson with 
critical components for their phone businesses. The response to this risk 
event shows the strategic implications of effective (or ineffective) risk man­
agement. Nokia’s ability to quickly secure components from other sources, 
compared with Ericsson’s lack of preparation for responding to this event, 
resulted in a dramatic industry shift. Ericsson’s supply disruption not only 
cost the company several hundred million dollars in lost sales, but it essen­
tially ended the company’s position as a player in the growing wireless 
phone business. Chapter 9 will investigate this example in greater detail. 
Consider some other supply chain risk events:
•	 A U.S. producer of power tools was surprised to find that the Asian 
supplier it contracted with to produce its lower-­end products began 
selling those products under its own label in Asia. The U.S. company 
was further surprised to find that the supplier shared its product 
designs with other Asian companies. The U.S. producer eventually 
found itself competing in North America with its own products.

•	 Some German thieves developed a creative way to steal freight on 
highways. The thieves position a car in front of a truck to slow it down 
while another car is positioned next to the truck to prevent it from 
passing the car in front. Then, a third vehicle pulls up behind the 
truck and at that point one of the gang members opens the back of 
the truck to remove cargo. Thieves have used this method to steal 
cargo more than 50 times.10
•	 Nylon-12 is a critical resin for producing fuel lines and other automo­
tive components. Unfortunately, the resin supply for the entire world 
is essentially produced in a single facility in Germany. What is even 
more unfortunate is the explosion that ripped through that plant, 
taking out half of the world’s output in the blink of an eye. Within 
hours automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) had 
established crisis management teams to scour the globe for new sup­
ply sources.
•	 Eight heavily armed thieves dressed as police and driving two police 
vans with flashing lights drove through a hole in the perimeter fence 
of the Brussels, Belgium, airport and onto a runway. In less than 
five minutes the thieves opened a plane’s cargo door and unloaded 
120 packages holding $50 million worth of polished and uncut 
diamonds. The thieves escaped with the diamonds and are forever 
embedded in criminal folklore.
We could go on, but you get the idea. Moving beyond anecdotal accounts, 
an emphasis on supply chain risk management is necessary today because 
supply chains face many factors that result in higher risk, more so than at 
any time in modern history. Some of these risk factors are self-­inflicted; 
others are not. IBM researchers have identified a solid set of factors that 
lead us to a clear conclusion—supply chains are becoming more, rather 
than less, risky. Table 1.2 summarizes this important set of factors.
Other factors inadvertently expose a company to heightened supply 
chain risk through unintended consequences. This includes just-­in-­time 
delivery and lean systems that result in little to no buffer inventory; a trend 
toward centralized decision making that may reduce response times and 
flexibility at local levels; continuous cost reductions that may affect a com­
pany’s ability to plan and respond to risk events; greater use of single sourc­
ing, which often leaves a company with few supply options and higher 
supplier switching costs; and widespread outsourcing, potentially leading 
to a loss of supply chain control. Sometimes we are our own worst enemy.

Supply Chain Risk Management: Setting the Stage  •  9
A study by the Aberdeen Group identified some good reasons why a 
company should make SCRM an embedded part of its corporate culture. 
First, a need to protect an organization’s brand and competitive advantage 
is a strategic necessity. Risk events have a nasty way of affecting brand 
value quickly. Simply think about how stories, whether they are true or 
not, can impact the value of a brand. Next, the increasing volatility of 
the global economic environment and markets is resulting in greater risk 
exposure. Third, corporate mandates to institute and/­or improve risk 
management and governance programs are only going to increase. And, a 
growing need to comply with new or changing regulatory requirements is 
forcing a greater emphasis on risk management. Finally, constant pressure 
to improve shareholder and customer confidence while trying to reduce 
costs may result in actions that result in greater risk exposure, such as 
searching for suppliers in untested emerging supply markets.
A range of surveys and studies conclude that supply chain risk is grow­
ing. To disregard what has become obvious is short-­sighted and danger­
ous. We can easily cite source after source that concludes essentially the 
same thing—supply chain risk and its impact on corporate performance 
continues to grow. It would be challenging to argue that supply chains are, 
on average, becoming less risky.
TABLE 1. 2
Factors That Make Supply Chains Riskier
•	 Increased globalization through outsourcing, which stretches end-­to-­end supply chains
•	 Additional regulatory compliance imposed by government entities, further 
complicating international trade (such as C-­TPAT and SEC conflict mineral 
reporting requirements)
•	 Increased levels of economic uncertainty and market volatility, which create 
additional variability in demand and supply and make it more difficult to 
accomplish demand–supply planning
•	 Shorter product life cycles and rapid rates of technology change, which increase the 
risk of inventory obsolescence
•	 Demanding customers that create additional time-­to-­market pressures by requiring 
better on-­time delivery, higher order fill rates, and improved service level efficiencies
•	 Supply side capacity constraints, making it more difficult to meet demand 
requirements
•	 Natural disasters and external environmental events, which affect global supply 
chains
•	 Complex networks of suppliers and third-­party service providers, as well as large 
interdependencies among multiple firms, which increase the need to coordinate risk

Some SCRM Observations
Extensive experience and research enables us to make some observations 
about the state of risk management. (Chapter 2 will provide a more in-­
depth presentation of the “as is” state). Perhaps most importantly, most 
observers have concluded that the potential impact of risk has increased 
over the last 15 or 20 years. In one survey, almost 75% of risk managers say 
that supply chain risk levels are higher than in 2005. More than 70% say 
the financial impact of supply chain disruptions has also increased.11 And, 
there is no question that supply markets have become more volatile. The 
size of fluctuations in commodity prices has more than tripled since 2005 
compared with the period of 1980–2005, based on International Monetary 
Fund data. If you really think about this hard enough, you might just 
get depressed.
We can also conclude that too many firms are not prepared to handle 
the supply chain risks that may come their way, even though most manag­
ers understand that supply chain risk is a growing concern. While ERM 
has been at the forefront for many companies, SCRM has been more of 
an afterthought. A recent study revealed that for firms with less than 
$500 million in annual revenue (which is the vast majority of companies), 
only 25% take a proactive approach to risk management.12
Another observation is that while many risk categorizations and topol­
ogies exist, a convergence appears to be happening around the key cat­
egories of supply chain risk—a convergence this book uses. Finally, as it 
relates to mitigating or lessening the impact of risk events, we tend to see 
the same set of standard approaches that fail to reflect bold or innova­
tive thinking. While “blocking and tackling” will always be important, 
it is time to see a bit more creativity and sophistication within the SCRM 
arena. Later chapters will look at some more advanced SCRM approaches.
Why Aren’t We Prepared for SCRM?
The reasons why so many firms are not prepared to manage supply chain 
risk effectively are varied. We cannot ignore what is perhaps the most 
likely reason of all—risk management has simply not been a part of the 
supply chain domain. Why would we focus on something that is not con­
sidered all that relevant? It is easy to view the efforts put forth toward risk 
planning as a big exercise in busy work. This may not be the kind of work 
that gains personal recognition and promotions.

Supply Chain Risk Management: Setting the Stage  •  11
A study by the Supply Chain Council (SCC) identified a set of barriers 
that affect the practice of supply chain risk management. One barrier is 
the tendency of senior management to focus on risk management only 
during times of crisis, something that needs to shift from responsiveness 
to prevention. A second barrier is that SCRM requires many functions to 
cooperate, something that is challenging even on a good day. Third, the 
study concluded that SCRM responsibilities are typically added to exist­
ing staff responsibilities. While everyone should be a risk management 
stakeholder, adding responsibilities to existing duties clearly creates a 
competition for resources, a competition that SCRM will often lose. Next, 
the increasing complexity of products, divisions, regions, and supply 
chains makes a coordinated SCRM effort more of a challenge. A final bar­
rier is that a partial effort to SCRM dilutes the perceived need for a real 
and sustained risk management effort. A “close enough is good enough” 
attitude toward SCRM often prevails. These barriers will clearly affect the 
state of SCRM.
SOME IMPORTANT RISK CONCEPTS
A working knowledge of some important risk concepts is essential when 
talking about SCRM, particularly since these concepts are mentioned 
repeatedly throughout this book. We also do not want someone to appear 
ill-­informed when talking about risk management with others. Part of 
understanding risk management is having a working knowledge of the 
terms and concepts that populate this body of knowledge. The following 
presents some important terms and concepts that will help you speak the 
language of a risk manager.
Risk Event
An important distinction exists between risk and risk events. Every day 
we face hundreds of risks with various probabilities attached to them 
(although we rarely quantify those probabilities). But, and this is impor­
tant, a risk is relatively harmless until it happens. There is always a risk that 
someone will fall off a roof when they are working on their house. Until 
that person actually takes the plunge, the risk of falling remains simply a 
risk. If the person falls, the risk is now a risk event. A risk event is simple 

12  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
to conceptualize—it is a risk that has become a reality. Formally defined, 
a risk event is a discrete, specific occurrence that negatively affects a deci­
sion, plan, firm, or organism.13
Risk events are not only episodic, temporary occurrences. Risk events 
can be continuous, particularly if they relate to operational performance 
problems. Any supply chain performance problem that is ongoing pres­
ents continuous risk to multiple parties in a supply chain.
A word of caution is in order here. A tendency exists to identify a grab 
bag of risk events and then label each event as a risk category. This is gen­
erally an unorganized way to approach risk management. Late supplier 
deliveries or supplier quality problems might comprise two such catego­
ries even though they are risk events. Risk events should be organized and 
placed into broader risk categories. In the supply chain space a number 
of risks might relate to financial risks, for example, and therefore should 
be placed under a financial risk category. Subcategories of financial risk 
may then be developed that include supplier financial risk, working capital 
risk, or currency risk. A later section will present risk typologies.
Risk Exposure and Vulnerability
Risk exposure involves the quantified potential for loss that might occur 
as a result of a risk event. The risk exposure value is often the outcome of a 
comprehensive risk analysis that uses algorithms to combine risks accord­
ing to their probability of occurring against the potential loss if the risk 
occurs. A company that can seamlessly switch production between mul­
tiple supplier locations has less risk exposure to a supply disruption com­
pared with a buyer that has access to only a single production location. 
Even before a garment factory collapsed in Bangladesh, killing 430 work­
ers in the country’s worst apparel-­industry accident, major buyers such 
as Walmart and Levi Strauss had ceased doing work with vendors who 
operated in multistory buildings. The risk exposure from these operations 
was simply too great.14
For our purposes we view risk exposure and vulnerability as closely 
related concepts, although vulnerability tends to be a less quantified con­
cept. We are vulnerable to something if we are susceptible to harm or 
injury. Anyone who has built a house on an earthquake fault will grasp the 
concept of vulnerability to earthquakes. Or, someone traveling to certain 
parts of the world without getting proper vaccinations should appreciate 

Supply Chain Risk Management: Setting the Stage  •  13
being more vulnerable to diseases. In the information technology (IT) 
world, vulnerability refers to the security flaws that allow a successful sys­
tem attack by hackers.15 IT vulnerability is an important concept because 
supply chains today are increasingly information enabled.
Risk Resilience
Risk resilience is becoming one of the most researched and discussed top­
ics in supply chain risk management. At a basic level, resilience refers to 
the ability to recover from or adjust to misfortune or change.16 It repre­
sents the ability of a company and supply chain to “bounce back” after 
an event. While the concept of resilience has been studied scientifically 
in development psychology and ecosystems for many years, it is still an 
emerging topic in SCRM. Even in well-­developed disciplines the defini­
tions of resilience are often contradictory and confusing.17
A good example of pursuing resiliency as an objective comes from the 
utility industry. As utilities work to storm-­harden their networks (a form 
of risk prevention), some are also investing in technology to recover faster 
from outages (risk responsiveness or mitigation) through an approach 
called the “smart grid.” New systems use advanced technology to pinpoint 
problems, reroute power around problem areas, and identify where repair 
crews need to go first to get the most customers restored the fastest.18 One 
emerging technology cuts off power at the spot where a tree falls into 
a power line and then reroutes electricity so nearby customers still retain 
power. Using a boxing metaphor, resiliency means being able to take a 
punch and still be standing.
A second resiliency example involves offshore oil exploration in the Gulf 
of Mexico. It became obvious that following the 2010 explosion at BP’s 
Macondo well an array of new and complex regulations would emerge 
addressing offshore drilling safety. And that is exactly what happened. 
Some observers predicted that drilling in the Gulf of Mexico would not 
recover for years, if ever. But that does not seem to be the case. In the 
words of one analyst, “Bottom-­line, Gulf of Mexico oil production is in 
considerably better shape than even the most ardent optimists envisioned 
following Macondo.”19 Part of the reason for such optimism is the oil 
industry’s resiliency as it learns to live with stricter safety oversight and 
slower permit reviews. Estimates indicate that by 2022 oil output from the 
Gulf of Mexico will be 28% higher compared with current levels.

14  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Risk Appetite
Risk appetite reflects the degree of risk that an organization or individual 
is willing to accept or take in pursuit of its objectives. This can be mea­
sured in terms of both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. Some also 
refer to this concept as risk tolerance or risk propensity, a topic that is well 
grounded in the financial community.
Finance experts view risk appetite as reflecting the type of risk that an 
institution or individual is willing to undertake in pursuit of a desired 
financial performance. Clearly, someone who invests in derivatives rather 
than guaranteed government bonds (assuming they are not Greek bonds) 
has a higher appetite for risk. When an organization or individual has a 
low risk appetite, we say they are risk averse. As it pertains to supply chain 
risk, we can safely conclude that most organizations tend to be risk averse. 
Remember, the typical supply chain professional looks at risk in terms of 
loss or harm.
Complex models have been developed to identify risk utility functions. 
Utility functions transform monetary values (payoffs and costs) into util­
ity values that specify preferences for various monetary payoffs and costs. 
This encodes a company or individual’s attitude toward risk. A time-­
consuming step when developing utility functions is to assess a company’s 
or individual’s attitude toward risk. At the company level, this assessment 
is part of a dialogue between the board of directors and senior manage­
ment and includes factors such as business model aspirations, institutional 
principles, shareholder expectations, and core competencies.20
An analysis by The Wall Street Journal concluded that the United States 
is becoming more risk averse (i.e., a lower risk appetite) as a nation com­
pared with previous periods. If this is true it does not bode well for the 
longer-­term growth prospects of the U.S. economy as fewer individuals 
start new ventures. The Wall Street Journal analysis concluded that three 
shifts are causing Americans to become more risk averse, an aversion 
that will result in fewer new businesses being created and a reluctance to 
change jobs or move to take advantage of new opportunities. These shifts 
include an aging population (older citizens are not known as risk takers), 
the emerging dominance of large corporations in many industries that 
shuts out new players and ideas, and a reluctance of venture capitalists to 
invest in new opportunities. As one observer says, “The pessimistic view is 
we’ve lost our mojo.”21 At a national level we need risk takers to grow the 
economy through innovation and change.

Supply Chain Risk Management: Setting the Stage  •  15
Risk Analysis or Assessment
Risk analysis, also called risk assessment, is the process of qualitatively 
and quantitatively assessing potential risks within a supply chain. At a 
basic level risk analysis involves identifying risks and then evaluating 
or mapping these events, at a minimum, across two dimensions. These 
dimensions include the probability of a risk occurring and the impact if 
the risk were to become a risk event. Some techniques will score the two 
dimensions and multiply them together to arrive at an overall risk score. 
Chapter 13 will discuss some validity issues related to this approach.
In the financial sector, risk analysis refers to the uncertainty of fore­
casted future cash flows streams, variance of portfolio and stock returns, 
statistical analysis to determine the probability of a project’s success or 
failure, and possible future economic states. Remember, risk analysis (and 
risk management) is far more evolved in the financial community com­
pared with the supply chain community.
Risk Response Plan
A risk response plan is a logical extension of a risk analysis. The risk plan 
is a document that defines known risks and includes descriptions, causes, 
probabilities or likelihood of risk occurrence, costs, and proposed risk 
management responses. A word of caution is in order here. We have all 
been presented with (or assigned to write) the dreaded 125-page report 
that no one will ever read. In the old days this report would sit on a shelf 
in someone’s office collecting dust. Now, these reports sit in electronic 
directories collecting virtual dust. A risk response plan should be a crisp, 
actionable document that is not someone’s idea of busy work.
Risk Compliance
Risk compliance includes the internal activities taken to meet required or 
mandated rules and regulations, whether they are governmental, industry 
specific, or internally imposed. Companies have always had compliance 
requirements relating to financial reporting, environmental compli­
ance, and a host of other areas. At an organizational level, compliance is 
achieved through management processes that (1) identify applicable laws, 
regulations, contracts, strategies, and policies; (2) assess the current state 
of compliance; (3) assess the risks and potential costs of noncompliance 

16  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
against the projected expenses to achieve compliance; and (4) prioritize, 
fund, and initiate any corrective actions deemed necessary.22 While com­
pliance reporting requirements have been around for many years, the 
hazard events of the last 15 years have brought about new compliance 
requirements, particularly in the area of international supply chains.
Risk Governance
Risk governance includes the frameworks, tools, policies, procedures, 
controls, and decision-­making hierarchy employed to manage a busi­
ness from a risk management perspective. At times the governance struc­
ture includes a chief risk officer, who is normally identified as the person 
responsible to coordinate and oversee the risk management process and 
approve reports to the corporate audit committee of the board of directors. 
Chapter 3 will address the pros and cons of designating chief risk officer.
The risk concepts presented here are certainly not the only ones that 
comprise the vocabulary of SCRM. They are, however, the more impor­
tant ones. It would be difficult to proceed with our risk discussion without 
having this working knowledge of risk terminology.
CATEGORIZING RISK
While various frameworks categorize the domain of supply chain risk, 
no standard agreement exists regarding what these categories should be. 
Any categorization scheme should identify broader risk categories and 
then place specific risks within those categories. One perspective classifies 
supply chain risk into nine categories—design; quality; cost; availability; 
manufacturability; supply; financial; legal; and environmental, health 
and safety.23 We think that a more simplified approach might better suit 
our needs.
Perhaps the most logical way to look at supply chain risk is to consider 
the four categories that define enterprise risk management—strategic, 
hazard, financial, and operational risks. While some frameworks present 
more categories, the thriftiness of these four categories is a virtue. The fol­
lowing describes these categories.
Strategic Risk. For something to be strategic, it must be necessary to 
or important in the initiation, conduct, or completion of a strategy or 

Supply Chain Risk Management: Setting the Stage  •  17
strategic plan. Strategic risks are those risks that are most consequential to 
an organization’s ability to carry out its business strategy, achieve its cor­
porate objectives, and protect asset and brand value. Chapter 4 explores 
strategic risk in detail.
Hazard Risk. This category of risk pertains to random disruptions, 
some of which involve acts of God. This category includes bellowing ash 
from a volcano in Iceland, a tsunami that devastated Japan, serious floods 
in Thailand, and a super storm named Sandy that affected the eastern 
United States. This category also includes fires and malicious behavior 
such as accidents, product tampering, theft, and acts of terrorism. Hazard 
risk is normally what we think of when we purchase insurance as a form 
of risk protection. Chapter 5 addresses this risk category.
Financial Risk. Financial risks relates to the internal and external 
financial difficulties of the participants within an integrated supply chain. 
While we can make the argument that all supply chain risk events eventu­
ally have financial risk implications, we categorize a risk as financial when 
the primary and immediate effect of the risk, rather than a subsequent or 
secondary effect, is financially related. Chapter 6 explores financial risk 
in detail.
Operational Risk. Operational risk arises from daily operations. By far 
a disproportionate set of supply chain risks will be categorized as opera­
tional since this category includes internal and external quality problems, 
late deliveries anywhere in the supply chain, service failures due to poorly 
managed inventory, problems related to poor forecasting, and a thou­
sand other events related to operational performance failures. Chapter 7 
addresses operational risk specifically.
Other Ways to Look at Risk
A somewhat different way to look at risk is according to a three-­category 
system that categorizes risks as systemic, event, or idiosyncratic.24 Systemic 
risks pertain to widespread risks that impact most players in an indus­
try. Chinese wage inflation and currency reevaluations are risks that will 
affect a large number of players from many different industries. Event risks 
include narrow or localized events that impact participants selectively. An 
earthquake in Taiwan, for example, may selectively impact semiconduc­
tor foundry operations. Or, a tornado in Oklahoma only impacts directly 
a certain part of the United States. Idiosyncratic risk pertains to highly 
localized events that impact very few players. A delayed truck delivering 

18  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
goods to a single retail store is an example of a risk that has a limited affect 
in terms of its impact.
Still another way to look at risk involves hard versus soft risks. Hard risks 
are easily measurable and tangible, such as risks that affect assets, inven­
tory, and facilities. With hard risks a company can identify reasonably 
precise losses if a risk materializes and a reasonable history of occurrences 
and probability exists. Soft risks are more difficult to measure or identify.
Because soft risks are usually present to some degree, they increase the 
overall probability of risk occurrence but in ill-­defined or imprecise ways. 
An analogy here involves total cost models. Some costs are easily identifi­
able and quantifiable (transportation costs and unit price, for example) 
while other costs are “hidden” and difficult to calculate (the cost of com­
munication and time-­related problems when dealing with remote Chinese 
suppliers). These hidden costs (which are analogous to soft risks) still 
increase the true total cost, although in ill-­defined or imprecise ways.
Still an additional way to think about risk is in terms of known and 
unknown risks. Known risks are specific risks that we have encountered 
previously or can foresee or anticipate with a reasonably good estimate of 
occurrence. During risk analysis and planning known risks are good can­
didates for practicing risk prevention. Unknown risks consist of unfore­
seen combinations of outcomes or events that produce a risk. This includes 
unexpected or unanticipated surprises. Managing unknown risks will 
benefit from strong risk mitigation plans.
GENERIC RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACHES
Literally hundreds of activities, tools, and approaches have the potential 
to be part of a company’s risk management portfolio. At a very high level 
we can organize these approaches by their primary risk objective, which 
includes mitigating, avoiding, preventing, accepting, or sharing risk.
Risk Mitigation
Some will use the term risk mitigation to describe almost everything that 
is undertaken in the name of risk management, including preventive 
actions. According to its most basic definition, mitigate means to lessen 

Supply Chain Risk Management: Setting the Stage  •  19
the impact of something. That “something” could be the effect of a risk 
event such as a supplier fire or supply chain quality problem. In a broader 
sense, mitigation can also be the result of action taken to either reduce the 
likelihood of a risk occurring or minimize the extent of its impact. This 
broader perspective is why many sources refer to just about any risk man­
agement initiative as risk mitigation.
When speaking in broad terms about how to manage risk, we will use 
the term risk management rather than risk mitigation. We view mitigation 
more in terms of responding to risk events rather than preventing risk. 
Prevention is a risk management response that is largely separate from 
mitigation. Mitigation or risk responsiveness is essential when unknown 
risks are present. Not everything can be anticipated or prevented.
Risk Avoidance
Avoidance involves exiting those activities that give rise to a risk. A com­
pany may decide (and many have) that sourcing a material from a certain 
supplier is too risky, so it avoids that supplier. Or, a certain line of products 
is not earning enough profit, so a company decides to stop making those 
items (or sell the brand to another company). With avoidance, a com­
pany has made a conscious decision to reduce, perhaps even eliminate, its 
risk exposure.
Risk Prevention
Prevention involves taking action to ensure that a risk does not become a 
risk event or, if it does become an event, that it will have an inconsequential 
effect. This approach to managing risk is often preferable when dealing 
with known risks. Prevention is different from avoidance in that a com­
pany did not exit something as a means of addressing risk. We expect 
a greater focus on prevention as supply chain managers become more 
focused on anticipating and averting risk rather than experiencing and 
responding to risk. We have heard numerous business leaders comment 
that their firms, while good at responding to risk events, need to do a bet­
ter job preventing the risk event in the first place.
At a personal level most of us understand the concept of prevention, 
particularly as it relates to our personal health. We know that if we watch 
our weight, exercise, avoid smoking and excessive alcohol, avoid harmful 

20  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
drugs, drive prudently, and eat correctly, we may prevent a host of seri­
ous ailments.
We will clearly differentiate between mitigation and prevention activi­
ties as we try to anticipate and then take steps to ensure that a risk does not 
become a reality. A primary argument put forth in this book is that most 
companies are conversant or even qualified in terms of risk responsiveness 
(mitigation) but not nearly as advanced when it comes to prevention.
Risk Acceptance
Acceptance means to take on and assume a risk. SCRM may not be a 
priority at a company, so therefore no specific risk management action 
is taken. In this case acceptance occurs essentially by default. A second 
reason for risk acceptance is that a cost/­benefit analysis reveals that the 
cost of addressing a risk outweighs the expected impact of the risk. A third 
reason is that no practical way exists to prevent, share, or mitigate the 
risk. This is usually an acknowledgment that, at least in the short run, no 
viable action or alternative is available that will effectively address a risk. 
No practical choice exists except to assume the risk.
Risk Sharing
Risk sharing involves transferring or sharing a portion of a risk to reduce 
or mitigate it. Sharing product development costs with suppliers or buying 
insurance is a risk-­sharing method. We all practice risk sharing when we 
buy home, car, or life insurance. Financial managers enjoy the benefits of 
risk sharing when they engage with other traders to hedge commodities 
and currencies. And supply chain managers often write contracts with sup­
pliers that feature some level of currency or commodity risk sharing.
Risk pooling is an important form of risk sharing. A risk pool involves 
insurance companies controlling the risk of insuring against catastrophic 
events or extending insurance to individuals or businesses that are likely 
to create sizable claims. If a claim arises from a natural disaster or cata­
strophic weather event, the companies spread losses among all members 
of the risk pool. Single members of the risk pool are protected from large 
claims that would bankrupt the insurance company, leaving their claim­
ants with nothing.25

Supply Chain Risk Management: Setting the Stage  •  21
Prevention versus Responsiveness
Often times we look at risk simply in terms of trying to prevent an event 
from occurring versus responding after the fact. While prevention sounds 
like an ideal way to approach risk management (who would not want to pre­
vent problems?), not all risks can be predicted or anticipated, particularly 
hazard risks. What we see today at best practice firms is a combination of 
preventive actions wherever possible combined with responsiveness plans 
that support risk resiliency. The bottom line in the prevention-­versus-­
responsiveness debate is that an increase in known risks favors pre-­risk 
preventive approaches. And an increase in unknown risks favors post-­
risk response agility. How a specific company approaches risk manage­
ment will be affected by this mix of known and unknown risks.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
This chapter starts our journey through the evolving world of supply 
chain risk management. Something to remember as we progress through 
later chapters is that companies that are effective at managing risk are sup­
ported by a corporate culture and a foundation that promote a company­
wide approach to risk management. A culture that stresses risk awareness 
and management must then be supported by a set of enablers and sophis­
ticated tools and techniques, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to 
quantify the value of risk management efforts. When the right corporate 
culture is supported by effective tools, techniques, measures, and skills, 
a company can engage in thoughtful risk taking rather than being para­
lyzed by an irrational fear of risk.
Summary of Key Points
•	 One common perspective for defining risk simply says that risk is a 
situation involving exposure to danger or loss. A broader perspec­
tive takes this a step further by adding that risk is the probability or 
threat of damage, injury, liability, loss, or other negative occurrences 
that are caused by external or internal vulnerabilities and that may 
be avoided through preemptive action.

22  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
•	 It is important to clarify the distinction between enterprise risk 
management and supply chain risk management. Almost all corpo­
rate executives are aware (or should be aware) of ERM, a concept that 
has been around for decades. SCRM is an evolving discipline.
•	 SCRM is the implementation of strategies to manage everyday and 
exceptional risks along the supply chain through continuous risk 
assessment with the objective of reducing vulnerability and ensuring 
continuity. One way to view SCRM is to think of it as the intersec­
tion of supply chain management and risk management.
•	 An emphasis on SCRM is necessary today because supply chains 
face many factors that result in higher risk, more so than at any time 
in modern history. Some of these risk factors are self-­inflicted; some 
are not.
•	 A working knowledge of some important risk concepts is essential 
when talking about SCRM, including what is a risk event, risk expo­
sure and vulnerability, risk governance, risk resilience, risk appetite, 
risk compliance, risk response plan, and risk assessment and analysis.
•	 While various frameworks are available to categorize the domain 
of supply chain risk, no standard agreement exists regarding what 
these categories should be. A logical way to look at risk is to consider 
the four categories that have defined enterprise risk management for 
many years—strategic, hazard, financial, and operational risks.
•	 Literally hundreds of activities and approaches have the poten­
tial to be part of a company’s risk management portfolio. At a very 
high level we can organize these approaches by their primary risk 
objective(s), which includes mitigating, avoiding, preventing, accept­
ing, or sharing risk.
•	 When the right corporate culture is supported by effective tools, 
techniques, and measures, a company can engage in thoughtful risk 
taking rather than becoming paralyzed by an irrational fear of sup­
ply chain risk.

Supply Chain Risk Management
The As-­Is Landscape
In this chapter we provide an overview of the growth of supply chain risk 
management (SCRM) during the last few years and provide additional 
insight into who is talking about SCRM, what they are saying, and the 
tone of the dialogue. We will provide a summarized view of SCRM top­
ics, announcements, articles, reports, and survey results that help define 
the state of SCRM today. We will also share a perspective on SCRM 
through a different prism: the Four Pillars of SCRM. We will then provide 
a maturity level for each pillar. The chapter concludes with discussion of 
SCRM adoption.
A CHRONOLOGY OF SUPPLY CHAIN 
RISK MANAGEMENT
Let’s start by providing a sense of the growth of SCRM in terms of aware­
ness, discussions, articles, papers, surveys, solutions, tools, and more. 
During our research for this book we compiled hundreds of reference 
works in order to provide a comprehensive, end-­to-­end perspective of 
SCRM. Using these reference works and our experience, we have com­
piled a chronology of the growth we’ve witnessed and the tone and tenor 
of the dialogue.
While many risk management studies and surveys were conducted dur­
ing 2000–2010, our focus starts with the latter part of that decade. Most 
supply chain executives became interested in SCRM after the financial 
meltdown of 2008. Company after company watched, almost helplessly, as 

26  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
customer orders were canceled, suppliers entered bankruptcy, and com­
modity markets became increasingly volatile. For many, 2008 was the 
genesis of their risk management efforts.
2009
Most operations management and supply chain management profession­
als are familiar with the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) Group and its set of standards that revolve around quality control 
and process reliability, such as ISO 9000. In 2009, the ISO Group delivered 
its first set of standards directly relating to supply chain risk, which was 
a major recognition of the importance of SCRM. These standards include 
ISO 73 and ISO 31000. ISO 73 profiles the vocabulary and taxonomy of 
risk within the supply chain, and ISO 31000 provides insight into the prin­
ciples, practices, and guidelines to effectively identify, assess, mitigate, and 
manage supply chain risk.
A key report during this period was Accenture’s 2009 Managing Risk for 
High Performance in Extraordinary Times.1This global report, which sur­
veyed 260 CFOs, chief risk officers, and other executives across 21 coun­
tries, came right after the 2008 financial meltdown. This report explored 
the details of what was going on around the globe relative to risk and its 
impact on businesses and supply chains. It was one of the first compre­
hensive analyses of the cause and effects of risk to global supply chains. 
This report revealed that 85% of executive respondents said their com­
pany needed to overhaul its approach to risk management; 40% said their 
companies already had increased or would increase their investments in 
broader risk management capabilities; 41% stated their risk management 
costs increased by at least 25% over a three-­year period; and only 27% 
said their risk management function was involved, to any great extent, in 
objective setting and performance management.
Accenture concluded that steps needed to be taken to manage supply 
chain risk to protect a company’s competitive advantage, reputation and 
branding, and credit ratings; to maintain positive comments by ana­
lysts; and to ensure access to capital over time at a reduced cost. Overall, 
Accenture reported that many companies had a long way to go before they 
should feel comfortable about their company’s state of risk management.
AMR released a report on risk in U.S. manufacturing to get a sense of 
how businesses feel about the future and what they saw in terms of risk. The 
top three concerns of U.S. manufacturers were supplier quality failures, 

Supply Chain Risk Management: The As-Is Landscape  •  27
commodity price volatility, and intellectual property infringement. In 
particular, supplier solvency was a key concern. Furthermore, respondents 
said that doing business with Chinese suppliers was contributing the most 
to overall risk, scoring the highest in 11 out of 15 risk categories evaluated.
2010
In 2010, we began a course for a master’s of business administration degree 
by explicitly profiling the emerging elements of supply chain risk manage­
ment. The initial courseware was made up of articles, survey outcomes, 
reports from the insurance industry, and the basics of good risk manage­
ment. As the course grew in maturity, a Supply Chain Risk Assessment 
Tool emerged that codified the effects of supply chain maturity as it relates 
to mitigating risk. The basic premise was that as the supply chain matures, 
the inherent risks faced by that supply chain diminish.
The Supply Chain Risk Assessment Tool, featured in Figure 2.1, encom­
passes about 100 questions-­of-­discovery about a company’s supply chain 
across 10 tenets of the entire supply chain. It is a perception-­based tool that 
captures the complexion of a company’s operating environment relative to 
a maturity model and then develops an inherent risk factor for every tenet. 
Risk factors are then plotted inside a spider diagram for visual presenta­
tion using a red, yellow, and green designation. There will be more discus­
sion about this tool later in the book.

28  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
During 2010, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center 
for Transportation and Logistics produced its preliminary findings from 
the Global Supply Chain Risk Management research project. The survey 
collected 1,400 usable responses from companies in 70 countries. The 
project’s primary goal was to understand if regional and cultural differ­
ences affect how people think about and manage supply chain risks. This 
survey was a seminal point in the birth of SCRM. The final report covers 
differences in attitudes about risk, differences in risk frequencies (internal 
and external events) and priorities, and differences in practices across 
countries and industries.2 It is one of the few reports that approached risk 
from a cross-­cultural perspective.
The MIT report concluded that respondents showed a marked prefer­
ence for risk prevention as opposed to planning and response, but that 
was influenced by national culture. Furthermore, most respondents indi­
cated that risk planning and prevention should be carried out centrally 
in an organization, while actual responses to most risk events should be 
managed locally. Respondents were also asked to rank the top supply 
chain disruptions for which their company should prepare. A breakdown 
in supply quality, supplier financial failures, and internal process failures 
topped the list.
Aberdeen Group also produced a comprehensive report on SCRM. 
Their findings further supported the notion that SCRM is evolving as 
a concept.3 One of the key findings from this study was an analysis of 
the reasons behind pursuing an aggressive risk management agenda. The 
top reasons include protecting the organization and its brand, safeguard­
ing against an unpredictable global economic environment, a corporate 
mandate to institutionalize/­improve risk management, complying with 
new and changing regulations, and maintaining and improving share­
holder value.
And what did the Chief Procurement Officers (CPOs) plan to do to 
manage risk according to Aberdeen? The CPOs expected to develop 
clearly defined metrics for supply performance and risk, develop con­
tingency plans for supply disruptions, use external information services 
to monitor and assess supply risk, and define ownership of risk within 
the organization.
This groundbreaking report was one of the first times a research orga­
nization put together a comprehensive profile in an effort to codify the 
elements of a good SCRM journey. Figure 2.2 illustrates the actions items, 
capabilities, tools, and techniques that will help ensure success within the 

Supply Chain Risk Management: The As-Is Landscape  •  29
risk management arena. The bulk of Aberdeen’s findings about and jour­
ney toward good SCRM hold true today.
Also in 2010 PRTM (now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers) released its 
Global Supply Chain Trends Report.4 A few of the novel themes emanat­
ing from this study were that almost 75% of all the respondents believed 
that demand and supply volatility will become the biggest roadblock to 
capturing profits in the economic upturn, and more than 80% expected 
complexity in their supply chains to increase dramatically, partly due to 
an increase in product proliferation. The PRTM study produced several 
important takeaways:
•	 Demand and supply volatility is here to stay.
•	 Supply chain complexity will be with us for many years.
•	 End-­to-­end supply chain cost optimization will be critical mov­
ing forward.
•	 Risk and opportunity management should span the entire supply 
chain, including with key partners.
This research concluded, and this has certainly been borne out by 
subsequent experience, that supply chains will become more volatile

and complex. The researchers also concluded that most companies are 
ill-­prepared to manage this complexity and that risk management will be 
a critical success factor affecting corporate success.
We also saw two more reports explicitly targeting supply chain disrup­
tions and their financial impacts. Chainlink Research and Hendrick & 
Singhai had been working on attempting to codify the financial impacts 
of supply chain disruptions on company bottom lines. According to these 
resources, a publicly traded company that experiences a moderate to 
severe supply disruption should expect to realize a 107% drop in operating 
income on average, 114% drop in return on sales, 93% drop in return on 
assets, 7% lower sales growth, 11% growth in cost, 14% growth in inven­
tories, and a 10% reduction in shareholder value. This is one of the first 
reports that linked risk events to tangible performance shortfalls.
Finally, a report from the Business Continuity Institute (BCI) in the 
United Kingdom revealed serious levels of supply chain failures and dis­
ruptions around the globe. This study found that weather disruptions 
affected more than half of all companies in 2010, up from 29% the previ­
ous year. Unplanned IT and telecommunication outages were second on 
the list of most frequent disruptions. More than one third of companies 
mentioned service failures by outsourcer providers, up from 20% the pre­
vious year. More than 50% of the respondents stated that their disruptions 
led to a loss of productivity and 20% of the respondents admitted they had 
suffered damage to their brand or reputation as a result of a disruption.
The report concluded that the serious levels of supply chain disruption 
experienced by organizations around the globe, coupled with the wide 
range of threats, underscores the business case for investment in business 
continuity planning (BCP). We will go into more detail later about BCP. 
For now, consider BCP to be an internal insurance policy or risk response 
plan that identifies, assesses, mitigates, and manages risk scenarios.
2011
During 2011 Accenture began to talk about the “new normal” of global 
supply chains. The new normal featured more global sourcing and manu­
facturing, hyper-­demand requirements, longer supply chain lead times, 
more potential points of failure, and managing supply chains in far-­flung 
corners of the world.5 With these elements of supply chain risk coming to 
the surface, Accenture produced a set of principles that support the birth 

Supply Chain Risk Management: The As-Is Landscape  •  31
of supply chain risk management as a discipline. These six principles 
include the following:
	
1.	Integrate risk management practices across all business functions to 
ensure understanding, commitment, and alignment
	
2.	Identify, measure, and prioritize risks by mapping out the complete 
supply chain “ecosystem”
	
3.	Emphasize operational flexibility, global visibility, and diversified 
supplier portfolio to blunt the impact of supply chain calamities
	
4.	Use probability modeling to identify unknown risks and develop 
contingency plans
	
5.	Insist that suppliers and business partners perform up-­front due 
diligence
	
6.	Hedge risk by making prudent choices about insurance
We will dig deeper into every one of the six tenets throughout the book.
AMR surveyed more than 500 executives worldwide during 2011 and 
asked questions about supply chain risks, disruptions, effects of those dis­
ruptions, and methods to mitigate and manage risk. Supply failures were 
the most cited disruption noted by executives. Quality failures, natural 
disasters, and commodity price volatility were also cited by almost one 
third of respondents. In terms of the most common risk management 
approaches, executives said they relied on (in order of mention) meetings/­
discussions with external partners and suppliers, predictive analytic tools, 
staying current with supplier business continuity plans, utilizing reports/­
data from third-­party sources, and utilizing performance risk dashboards.
In October 2011 SCM World, the global institute for supply chain learn­
ing, training, and development at Stanford University, released its annual 
Chief Supply Chain Officer (CSCO) study.6 The survey involved 750 global 
executives of which over 50% were vice presidents or higher. The report was 
conducted during the immediate aftermath of the Japanese earthquake 
and tsunami, creating an interest in understanding how supply chains 
were reacting to these disruptions. The report highlighted the disruptions 
due to the tragic events, how many companies had suffered shortages in 
supply and capacity, lost sales, inventory write-­offs, and plant closures 
across many industries. Even though the report didn’t examine supply 
chain risk specifically, it did talk at length about how the supply chain 
is a critical success factor and a driving force for competitive advantage. 

32  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Another key theme throughout the report was that supply chain sustain­
ability is critical in terms of driving value for the corporation, especially 
in times of demand and supply volatility.
During this period we also picked up on definitions of a resilient supply 
chain from the Supply Chain Council.7 While the Supply Chain Council 
was updating its SCOR Model and risk definitions and frameworks, the 
importance of resiliency in the supply chain came to the surface. Essentially, 
the council concluded that in a world of technical change, financial risk, 
political turbulence, and mounting regulatory pressures, industry growth 
does not always proceed smoothly. Risk management is especially chal­
lenging when threats are unpredictable. At the same time, corporations 
are accepting broader responsibility for social and environmental impacts 
of their supply chains. A resilient enterprise has the capacity to overcome 
disruptions and continually transform itself to meet the changing needs 
and expectations of its customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.
2012
Another study by the Business Continuity Institute addressed the impact 
of the Great East Japan earthquake and Christchurch earthquake in New 
Zealand. The key take-­away from this research was the wide-­ranging dif­
ferences in an important SCRM metric, time-­to-­recovery. BCI assessed 
how long it took supply chains to recover from the impact of the earth­
quakes. The compelling statistic is that almost 50% of all the respondents 
needed more than five weeks to recover.
Aberdeen Group released a report on risk from a financial perspec­
tive.8 Coming off the heels of the Japanese disasters, the report attempted 
to understand the risk-­adjusted strategies actually operating inside the 
CFO’s office. The report concluded that whether a company is looking to 
reroute a supply source away from a natural disaster or seeking to miti­
gate the risk associated with tax audit exposure, it is clear that companies 
with processes and tools that enable clear visibility to risk entities and a 
means to react quickly are going to be the ones that hold the key to effec­
tive budgeting and profitability.
Zurich, one of the largest insurers in the world, published a set of sup­
ply chain risk statistics and some revealing numbers associated with supply 
chain business interruptions.9 The insurer released a report that profiled 
the causes behind supply chain disruptions derived from an analysis of 

Supply Chain Risk Management: The As-Is Landscape  •  33
insurance claims over a several-­year period. Clearly, this analysis addressed 
primarily hazard risk. The insurer found that 85% of organizations expe­
rienced at least one supply chain incident that caused disruption to their 
business. More than 50% of supply chain disruptions occur because of 
adverse weather, and just over 40% occur because of unplanned IT or tele­
com outages. Other significant disruptions occurred because of loss of 
talent/­skills, product quality incidents, civil unrest/­conflicts, and cyber­
attacks. Of the disruptions that occurred, nearly 40% originated below the 
tier-­one supplier level.
A research article titled Researcher’s Perspectives on Supply Chain Risk 
Management presented a study of the diversity of perspectives surround­
ing supply chain risk management.10 This study identified three gaps in the 
body of knowledge:
•	 Definition gap—there is no clear consensus on the definition of 
SCRM because many limit the scope of SCRM to rare but large 
events, while others believe that SCRM is about supply–­demand 
uncertainties. (Hopefully, the definitions we presented in Chapter 1 
help to clarify this term.)
•	 Process gap—there is a lack of research on an important aspect of 
the risk management process, namely, the response to supply chain 
risk incidents.
•	 Methodology gap—there is a shortage of empirical research in the 
area of SCRM.
During this period an important study on supply chain risk was con­
cluded by Deloitte and Forbes Insights. This survey covered 192 U.S. exec­
utives, CEOs, CFOs, SVPs, and directors across multiple industries. One 
finding that stands out from this work is that 91% of respondents said they 
planned to reorganize and reprioritize their approaches to risk manage­
ment during the subsequent three years.
A disconcerting aspect of this survey was the completely scattered 
approach toward risk responsibility. Fully one quarter of respondents 
indicated the CEO is primarily accountable for risk management; almost 
a quarter said the said the CFO/­treasurer’s office is primarily responsible; 
almost 20% said the chief risk officer/­treasurer is responsible; and fewer 
than 15% said legal/­compliance is responsible. The remaining respondents 
were spread across various other groups. Future risk management plans 

34  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
include more than half of respondents saying their company planned to 
elevate risk management within their organization, while almost 40% 
said they will reorganize to support enterprise risk management (ERM), a 
framework introduced in Chapter 1. Almost 40% of respondents said they 
will provide more staff training, while almost one third planned to incor­
porate more technology into their risk management efforts.
And finally, SCM World, which we referenced previously, released its 
annual Chief Supply Chain Officer report. This report surveyed more than 
twice the number of companies as in 2011 and explored five main topics, 
one of which was risk management. A novel aspect of this survey involved 
SCM World asking respondents what they were doing to identify, assess, 
mitigate, and manage risk and profiled the impact of risk events from 
both demand and supply disruptions. From this study we learned that 
the highest impact from supply and demand disruptions over a two-­year 
period was a loss of sales/­revenue. In order of impact, subsequent impacts 
included lower profits, delays in product launches and growth plans, loss 
of customers, higher cost of capital, damage to image and reputation, 
and lower share price/­shareholder value. This research revealed the many 
damaging effects of supply and demand disruptions.
2013
The start of 2013 featured the release of a report from the World Economic 
Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. The sponsors of the report were 
Zurich Insurance, Accenture, Partners against Corruption (PACI), and the 
World Economic Forum. The report, titled Building Resilience in Supply 
Chains, was an outcome of WEF’s initial Supply Chain Risk Initiative 
started in 2011. A clear finding in this report is the need for organizations 
to shift from reactive to proactive risk management. Another relevant 
finding is that more than 80% of companies are now concerned about sup­
ply chain resilience. Study participants also indicated there is a need for 
a common risk vocabulary and that cyber risk may have the greatest risk 
implications for supply chains.
The World Economic Forum’s report touched on what it will take to 
make SCRM a bona fide business discipline. Perhaps most importantly, 
risk management must become an explicit and integral part of supply 
chain governance. Other high-­level suggestions for moving SCRM to a 
business discipline include the following:

Supply Chain Risk Management: The As-Is Landscape  •  35
•	 Institute a multistakeholder supply chain risk assessment process 
across the enterprise
•	 Mobilize international standards’ bodies to further develop resil­
ience standards
•	 Incentivize corporations to follow agile, adaptable supply chain strategies
•	 Expand the use of data-­sharing platforms for risk identification 
and responses
A RIMS.org article mentioned the Risk Maturity Index developed by 
AON Insurance and the Wharton School of Business. The index suggests 
that companies with the highest level of risk maturity (a measure that 
gauges the development of an organization’s risk strategy and framework) 
experience 50% lower stock price volatility than less-­developed counter­
parts. Over a two-­year period (2010–2012) companies with higher risk 
maturity ratings saw greater annual stock price returns. This was espe­
cially apparent when the only companies to see positive returns during 
that volatile period were those with the highest risk maturity levels. Those 
lower on the maturity scale saw losses between 17% and 30%. This work 
again pointed out the critical relationship between risk management and 
financial outcomes.
Lloyd’s of London released several statistics in 2013 associated with 
the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and Thailand floods. The first sta­
tistic they shared was the combined property and business interruption 
losses, which reached a record-­breaking $240 billion, with just $47 billion 
of the losses covered by insurance. The insurance industry provides sup­
ply chain interruption products called contingent business interruption 
(CBI). However,a large majority of companies impacted only had asset-­
based property damage insurance. Some of the elements covered by CBI 
include getting workers in and out of damaged facilities, working to get 
power to facilities, and shipping and receiving goods into and out of facili­
ties. Chapter 5 will reexamine the floods in Thailand from a risk quanti­
fication perspective.
An interesting report from the Association of Insurance and Risk 
Managers in Industry and Commerce (AIRMIC) titled Supply Chain 
Failures: A Study of the Nature, Causes, and Complexity of Supply Chain 
Disruptions, identified seven underlying factors that tend to be present 
whenever supply chains go wrong: off-­shoring, increasing complexity, cost 
pressures, geographic clustering, modern communications, modern pro­
duction methods, and increasing dependency. The report also estimated 

36  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
that economic losses from supply chain disruptions have increased 465% 
between 2009 and 2011.
And finally, Ernst & Young interviewed more than 420 CFOs and heads 
of supply chains at technology, automotive, manufacturing, aerospace, 
and defense companies. The report concluded that when CFOs and supply 
chain leaders form a closer business partnership within a company, they 
report better results in a number of areas, including the company’s finan­
cial position. The study found, for example, that 70% of CFOs and 63% of 
supply chain executives said their relationship had become more collab­
orative over the past three years. The merger between finance and supply 
and supply chain professionals appears to be an inevitable one.
The intriguing outcome from this survey is, because CFOs take a long-­
term approach to formulating business strategy, they are in a unique 
position to manage risk and plan for business continuity, something that 
challenges supply chain managers who tend to think in terms of shorter 
time horizons. The CFO also has the opportunity to work with the pro­
curement and treasury groups to determine the extent to which risk is 
owned and managed by the company and the extent to which it is pushed 
down through the supply chain.
In 2013 the authors of this book published several articles on SCRM. 
One key article was SCRM: The New Discipline of Supply Chain Excellence. 
After several years of teaching in the classroom and conducting workshops 
around the globe, we became thoroughly convinced of the need for SCRM 
to become a discipline. The article identified what was emerging from the 
classroom and from the practical application of the body of knowledge in 
the field. This article was a major impetus for this book.
FOUR PILLARS OF SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT
We would like to finish up our “as-­is” discussion by providing an assess­
ment of the state of supply chain risk management. This will involve some­
thing we call the Four Pillars of SCRM. These pillars include supply risk, 
process risk, demand risk, and environmental risk. Each pillar encom­
passes its own set of tools, techniques, tactics, metrics, people, processes, 
and program issues. The complexion of each pillar is below.

Supply Chain Risk Management: The As-Is Landscape  •  37
Supply Risk
The complexion of this pillar encompasses areas such as supplier conti­
nuity, strategic sourcing, supplier viability and capability, raw material 
pricing, supplier assessments, inbound logistics, fraud, corruption, and 
counterfeiting. Inherent risks here are disruptions caused by the inability 
of suppliers to deliver on time, quality failure, financial failure, compli­
ance failure, channel complexity, and communication failure.
Process Risk
This pillar includes IT systems, mergers and acquisitions, marketing 
strategy, organizational structure, frameworks and metrics, supply chain 
strategy and execution, manufacturing and quality, organizational risk 
assessment, heat maps, and war rooms. The inherent risks here include 
disruptions caused by quality problems, inventory shortages, late deliver­
ies, capacity shortages, equipment breakdowns, IT outages, poor overall 
execution, and misalignment of strategy and metrics.
Demand Risk
The complexion of this pillar covers areas such as new customers, market 
trends, consumer interest/­spending, demand management/­forecasting, 
distribution requirements planning, product integrity, customer service, 
and scenario planning. Inherent risks here are disruptions caused by prob­
lems in distribution, actions by competitors, product reputation, brand 
management, social media/­trending, logistics, and customer sentiment.
Environmental Risk
This final pillar encompasses areas such as government regulations, taxes, 
economic volatility, currency exchange, natural disasters, and compli­
ance. Inherent risks are natural disasters, geopolitical and energy risks, 
port security, logistics and facilities security, currency exchange fluctua­
tions, global economics, war, pandemics, and civil disobedience.
We have compiled a profile of the maturity and activity level for each 
pillar. Figure 2.3 depicts our assessment of the maturity and activity level 

38  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
for each pillar. On the left or y-­axis is the maturity level of each pillar. The 
horizontal x-­axis depicts the Four Pillars, and the size or length of each 
“box” is an indication of the activity level within each pillar.
From a maturity point of view, we feel the supply pillar is by far the most 
mature of the four, positioned at about 70 out of 100. Why? Procurement 
professionals have been dealing with supplier uncertainty and risk for 
more than 50 years. This discipline has become a profession, supported by 
member-­driven organizations who are providing certifications to demon­
strate that these professionals have a command of the body of knowledge 
and best practices. Tools such as supplier relationship management (SRM), 
spend management, credit and financial reporting by public credit orga­
nizations, and more have matured over the years. And the present activ­
ity level of new techniques such as supplier risk assessment; supply chain 
mapping; and fraud, bribery, and corruption identification supported by 
new cloud-­based software systems is providing the procurement profes­
sionals with a host of new tools and techniques to leverage in an effort to 
identify, assess, mitigate, and manage supplier risk.
The next-­highest level of maturity and activity, in our opinion, is the 
demand pillar. Positioned at about 50 out of 100, demand management 
solutions, such as sales forecasting and many other deterministic tools 
have been around as long as the supply tools. So why then do we feel this

pillar is at a lower maturity level than supply? The tools utilized in this pil­
lar have been developed to support processes that are purely forward look­
ing and one-­dimensional, such as sales forecasting, and do not involve 
any element of uncertainty or risk. Another tool, collaborative planning, 
forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR), does provide some coverage of 
risk because it attempts to support information sharing between supplier 
and customer in an effort to minimize demand surprises and shocks to 
the supply chain. New techniques and tools such as probabilistic plan­
ning, discrete-­event simulation, and digital modeling are emerging to 
assist demand managers and sales and operations planning (S&OP) pro­
cess owners to run “what-­if” scenarios that will demonstrate how their 
supply chains will act when a risk event shocks their organization. These 
new tools overtly handle uncertainty and risk and will take some time 
to mature.
Next in the maturity and activity level is the process pillar. A tremen­
dous number of tools and techniques support all the processes we’ve 
highlighted in this pillar. Many have been around for more than 40 years 
and are supported by professional organizations such as APICS, CSCMP, 
ASQC, ISSSP, and others and also include professional certifications. 
Again, our reasoning for the pillar’s positioning is that many of the tools 
do not embrace uncertainty and risk. They support discrete, linear func­
tions, such as planning inventory, planning capacity, production schedul­
ing, quality, logistics, and more. These functions are driven by solid supply 
chain management metrics such as maximizing service, reducing cost, 
and improving asset utilization, not mitigating risk.
And finally, the environmental pillar is very new and continues to 
expand because of new industry-­specific and governmental rules and reg­
ulations. There is more and more activity in this area, but with new and 
ever-­changing regulations, this pillar will take a long time to solidify.
THE SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ADOPTION
We’ll finish this chapter with a brief discussion on what we call SCRM 
Adoption. This utilizes a categorization scheme revolving around lag­
gards, industry average, and early adopters. We want to leave you with a 
sense of the operational complexion for each category in terms of SCRM 
along with a few salient statistics from the early adopter companies.

40  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
SCRM Adoption
We know that leading-­edge companies are much more likely to integrate 
and align risk with corporate goals. They generally have more visibility 
into their organization as they are substantially more likely to perform 
“what-­if” scenario-­planning and change analysis. On average, leaders 
achieve almost 95% better accuracy of cash flow forecasts, which is clearly 
better than what their peers achieve. And they tend to mitigate their finan­
cial losses down to 3% of revenue as opposed to their peers, who average 
10% of revenue due to financial loss. What characterizes early adopters, 
industry average, and laggards?
Early Adopter Companies. Early adopters leverage their ERM tools 
and technology to enhance the integration of risk management across the 
business. They continually link risk management to company goals and 
compensation. And, they are improving visibility and monitoring of Key 
Risk Indicators with new business analytic tools.
Early adopters also implement processes that are aligned with risk man­
agement and compliance, build a risk awareness culture throughout the 
organization, and secure executive commitment for risk management ini­
tiatives. These practices are being driven by the early adopters by a factor 
of two- or three-­to-­one above the industry average and laggard companies.
Other attributes characterize early adopters. These companies maintain a 
senior management champion of risk, segment risk duties, cross-​­functionally 
coordinate risk management, establish roles and responsibilities to execute 
risk, and establish a risk committee to oversee key risks. These commit­
ments by early adopters eclipse the industry average and laggards again by 
a factor of two- or three-­to-­one.
Industry Average Companies. Average companies attempt a standard­
ized approach to communication and organizational collaboration rela­
tive to risk. Some of these companies are beginning to integrate and align 
risk with corporate goals. Some are also developing and measuring risk 
and performance. Several are beginning to improve the time-­to-­decision 
by optimizing risk knowledge management activities and expanding risk 
visibility throughout the organization. Senior management oversight and 
engagement associated with risk to improve executive buy-­in is starting to 
occur at this level.
Laggard Companies. Laggards talk about supply chain risk but do not 
fund projects to prepare for and respond to risk events at any real level. 
Most have someone in the CFO’s office reviewing enterprise risk in the 

Supply Chain Risk Management: The As-Is Landscape  •  41
classical financial terms, such as hazard, financial, and strategic risk. The 
average operational and supply chain professional does not maintain sce­
nario game plans for risk events; therefore, SCRM is an event-­driven, ad 
hoc, or part-­time experience. Most executives in this category assume 
incorrectly that their people will know what to do in a risk event.
Figure 2.4 depicts a graph encompassing laggards, industry average, and 
early adopter companies in terms of the adoption rate of SCRM concepts. 
In terms of the as-­is state, it is safe to conclude that a majority of compa­
nies are still considered laggards in terms of their SCRM capabilities. This 
suggests that we have more work to do to move companies away from the 
laggard status. Subsequent chapters will concentrate on how to do that.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
The purpose of this chapter is to help us understand the current state of 
supply chain risk management. From our analysis we can reach some over­
arching conclusions. First, the negative outcomes from supply chain risk 
events are often quite severe. Only a fool would believe otherwise. Second, 
no consensus exists among companies or industries concerning how 
to organize for or manage supply chain risks. The ways that companies 
approach SCRM are varied. Third, most companies are ill-­prepared from

an employee, measurement, organizational, and IT perspective to operate 
in an environment characterized by increased uncertainty and volatility.
Another major conclusion is that most companies recognize the threat 
of supply chain uncertainty and understand that operating in a condition 
called the “new normal” will not be as enjoyable as operating in the “old 
normal.” A study by Zurich Insurance, for example, reported that 75% of 
respondents state they still do not have full visibility into their supplier 
base. This is concerning because several studies have concluded that sup­
ply disruptions are the most widely cited supply chain risk event.
Finally, most SCRM efforts rely on heroics rather than planning and pre­
vention. In terms of SCRM maturity, most companies are considered lag­
gards with some movement toward average. Minimal proactive supply chain 
risk management appears to be occurring. Growth along the maturity curve 
needs to accelerate, especially when we consider that almost 75% of risk 
managers believe that supply chain risk levels are higher than just a few years 
ago and that risk will continue to increase. More than 70% of risk manag­
ers say the financial impact of supply chain disruptions has also increased 
compared with just a few years ago.11 As a sign of the times, the Allianz Risk 
Barometer in 2013 ranked for the first time ever business interruption and 
supply chain risks as the top concerns of businesses globally. One of the main 
objectives of this book is to prepare us to manage in this “new (ab)normal.”
Summary of Key Points
•	 Most supply chain executives became interested in SCRM after the 
financial meltdown of 2008. For many, 2008 was the genesis of their 
risk management efforts.
•	 In 2009, the ISO Group delivered its first set of standards directly 
relating to supply chain risk, which was a major recognition of the 
importance of SCRM. These standards include ISO 73 and ISO 31000.
•	 The Supply Chain Risk Assessment Tool encompasses about 100 
questions-­of-­discovery about a company’s supply chain across 
10 tenets covering the entire supply chain. The basic premise is that 
as the supply chain matures, the inherent risks faced by that supply 
chain diminish.
•	 The new normal of global supply chains features more global sourc­
ing and manufacturing, hyper-­demand requirements, longer supply 
chain lead times, more potential points of failure, and managing 
supply chains in far-­flung corners of the world.

Supply Chain Risk Management: The As-Is Landscape  •  43
•	 Over a period of several years, Zurich found that 85% of organiza­
tions experienced at least one supply chain incident that caused dis­
ruption to their business.
•	 The Risk Maturity Index suggests that companies with the highest 
level of risk maturity experience 50% lower stock price volatility 
than less-­developed counterparts.
•	 The Four Pillars of SCRM are supply risk, process risk, demand risk, 
and environmental risk. The supply pillar is by far the most mature 
of the four because procurement professionals have been dealing 
with supplier uncertainty and risk for over 50 years. The demand 
pillar ranks second in terms of maturity, followed by the process pil­
lar and finally the environmental pillar.
•	 SCRM Adoption utilizes a categorization scheme revolving around 
laggards, industry average, and early adopters. In terms of the as-­is 
state, it is safe to conclude that a majority of companies are still con­
sidered laggards in terms of their SCRM capabilities.

Building the Risk 
Management Foundation
Achieving excellence in any area does not happen because a company sim­
ply announces its desire to be excellent. Many organizations have been 
frustrated because they lack the ability to develop the kinds of supply chain 
approaches and techniques that create a differential advantage. These 
organizations fail to recognize the importance of mastering something we 
call the “enablers,” four distinct areas that support more advanced supply 
chain and risk management initiatives.
This chapter highlights a set of enablers that are essential for effective risk 
management. These enablers include a supportive organizational design; 
information technology systems that provide real-­time or near real-­time 
access to data and information; risk-­related measures and measurement 
systems that provide insight into potential risks as well as the effective­
ness of risk management efforts; and the availability of capable human 
resources. This chapter also discusses how to integrate risk management 
with supply chain strategy development. We conclude with a case that 
describes how one organization relied on these four enablers, as well as a 
centrally led approach to strategy development, to manage strategic risk.
SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ENABLERS
As mentioned, what separates companies that achieve real advantage 
from their risk management efforts is a commitment to the four enablers 
of supply chain excellence. While we could commit entire chapters to each 
enabler, the following provides an overview that should help the reader 

46  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
understand what we are trying to present. If 50 books are written next 
year addressing risk management, the probability that any of them com­
mits any space to these four enablers presented here is slim. And, in our 
opinion, that is a serious mistake.
A Supportive Organizational Design
Perhaps one of the most underappreciated parts of corporate success is 
the role that organizational design plays. The Corporate Executive Board 
has concluded that to be successful, executives must first consider how 
their organizational design can lead to sustainable improvements in per­
formance and operational excellence. Organizational design refers to the 
process of assessing and selecting the structure and formal system of com­
munication, division of labor, coordination, control, authority, and respon­
sibility required to achieve organizational goals.1 An organization’s design, 
including the varied features put in place to support that design, is much 
more than what an organizational chart can ever depict. Because this topic 
does not appear elsewhere in the book, it will receive the most attention of 
the four enablers.
In our experience, supply chain risk management (SCRM) is rarely 
established as a distinct function within a company, although many 
organizations have a “point person” who has responsibility for risk man­
agement. One conclusion that we (as well as others) have reached is that 
businesses have not yet agreed upon any typical way to integrate SCRM 
into their decision-­making processes.2 The challenge is not about creating 
an organizational design that is dedicated to risk management, something 
that is unlikely to happen at most organizations. Rather, the challenge is 
to take various design features, many of which are already in place, and 
incorporate risk management responsibilities. The following illustrates a 
variety of design features that are ideal for including risk management as 
part of their scope.
S&OP Processes. Sales and operations planning is an internal, cross-­
functional process, usually supported by teams, whose primary output is 
a 6- to 18-month production schedule for product categories and families. 
The objective of S&OP is to develop an output plan that minimizes total 
costs given a specific demand plan. This process is an ideal way to bring 
the demand and supply sides of a value chain together, something that 
in itself has positive risk implications. Given that cost minimization is a 
major objective of any S&OP process, finance will play a major role in 

Building the Risk Management Foundation  •  47
any planning exercises. The S&OP process, which is conceptually simi­
lar to the more traditional aggregate planning process, formally reviews 
customer demand and supply resources and updates plans quantitatively 
across a rolling time horizon. An S&OP process may be one of the best 
preventive steps a company can take to address operational risk, particu­
larly those risks that arise from poor supply and demand planning.
Companies have been creative in how they practice S&OP. A central 
supply chain planning group at a leading chemical company has extended 
its S&OP concept by assuming responsibility for all of the activities associ­
ated with demand and supply planning and execution except production. 
Using sophisticated algorithms, supply chain planners have responsibility 
for managing the flow of a product’s raw materials and information from 
suppliers all the way through to customers. No hand-­offs of information 
take place between demand and supply groups, creating a clear respon­
sibility and accountability for demand planning, supply planning, and 
customer service. Other companies have expanded their S&OP process to 
directly include inventory planning and management, calling their process 
S&IOP. Here, the letter “I” represents inventory planning. Advanced com­
panies are also beginning to model external risk probabilities and scenar­
ios into their S&OP process. Chapter 14 will highlight one such company.
Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) 
Process. CPFR follows a defined organizational framework that combines 
the intelligence of multiple trading partners in the planning and fulfill­
ment of customer demand across a supply chain. It has the stated objective 
of increasing product availability to customers while reducing inventory, 
transportation, and logistics costs.3 A key part of CPFR involves collab­
orative forecasting, which is the process of collecting and reconciling 
information within and outside the organization to come up with a single 
projection of demand. Like S&OP, the direct linkages between effective 
planning and better risk management should be clear. And, like S&OP, it 
is relatively easy to see how this process can be expanded to consider risk 
issues during the planning process.
Executive Responsibility. Another organizational approach involves 
making a single executive ultimately responsible for demand and supply 
planning activities. A leading U.S. company has created the position of 
vice president of supply chain management and charged that executive 
with responsibility for worldwide supply planning and replenishment, 
demand and finished good forecasting, inventory planning, primary 
customer order fulfillment and logistics, and integrating supply chain 

48  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
activities with operational positions. The primary objective here is to cre­
ate a single point of accountability for satisfying end customer require­
ments at the lowest total cost. A logical step would be to expand these 
responsibilities to include risk planning and assessment. Figure 3.1 illus­
trates how an executive position that also has oversight for supply chain 
risk management might be structured.
Aligned with the idea of executive responsibility (and accountability) is 
the position of a chief risk officer. No clear agreement exists among aca­
demics and practitioners whether a chief risk officer responsible for supply 
chain risk is a good idea, although a survey by Accenture reveals that at 
the corporate (i.e., enterprise resource management, ERM) level, 98% of 
organizations have a chief risk officer.4 The need for a chief risk officer 
within the supply chain domain is often situation specific and will vary 
from company to company, perhaps even from industry to industry. It is 
always tempting to create a new position, whether it is the czar of lean, 
total quality, or sustainability, and to charge that individual with responsi­
bility for “making things happen.” Isn’t this new position visible evidence 
that decisive action is being taken? If only it were that easy. The success 
record for such positions is, unfortunately, mixed. These positions often 
lack the resources and authority to effect meaningful change across well-­
protected organizational turfs. With this model, far too many people are 
content with letting someone else take responsibility for managing risk, 
and conversely, taking the blame when things do not go well.

Organizing around Processes. Something that we know for certain 
is that effective risk management requires open sharing of supply chain 
information. Another thing we are certain about is that functional orga­
nizational designs, while generally effective at moving information up 
and down the command and control structure, are not nearly as effective 
sharing information laterally across functional groups. Unfortunately, as 
it relates to supply chains, vertical movement increases the possibility that 
the right groups will not have access to the right kinds of information, 
including risk information. Functional designs tend to be risk manage­
ment inhibitors rather than enablers. We can safely assume that effective 
risk management will benefit from a horizontal (i.e., cross-­functional) 
rather than vertical (i.e., functional) view of the supply chain.
One way to counter any potential issues or risk from inadequate sharing 
of information or poor coordination of activities across the supply chain 
is to create a process-­centric organization. Numerous books and articles 
have been written highlighting the advantages of a process-­centric orga­
nization.5 Research evidence suggests that an often-­predicted movement 
away from strict functional alignments is already occurring. One study 
revealed a clear link between organizations that are structured around 
major processes and their ability to attain their supply chain objectives, 
including better management of risk.6 This study also concluded that 
process-­centered design features, such as the use of cross-­functional teams 
along with executive positions responsible for overseeing processes rather 
than narrower functional tasks, should show large increases in usage com­
pared with more traditional design features.
Taking a process view helps manage the conflicts and trade-­offs that 
inevitably occur as work crosses functional boundaries. Ineffectively 
managing these conflicts and trade-­offs can have serious risk implica­
tions. (A trade-­off is a balancing of factors, all of which are not attainable 
simultaneously.) Left unattended these crossing points can easily lead to 
conflict, competition, and inefficiency. A process orientation, at least in 
theory, should promote the seamless movement of work and information 
across boundaries.
Part of the reason that conceiving of work in terms of processes can be 
challenging is that most of us have been trained to think in terms of physi­
cal processes. This includes the technology and equipment to convert raw 
and direct materials into finished products. These are the processes that 
we see, touch, and hear. But that is not the only kind of process that we 

50  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
see in supply chains. Most of us work within organizational or business 
(i.e., nonphysical) processes such as fulfilling customer orders, develop­
ing new products or services, estimating customer demand, or evaluating 
and selecting suppliers. Some refer to organizational processes as busi­
ness processes.
Organizational Work Teams. Whether we like it or not, the use of 
teams is just about everywhere in supply chains and is a popular and grow­
ing organizational design option. A partial listing of teams and groups 
involved with some aspect of supply chain management is as follows:
•	 Customer Advisory Board—An executive-­level group that brings 
suppliers, customers, and the original equipment manufacturer 
(OEM)/producer together to share information such as end cus­
tomer requirements and risk issues
•	 Buyer–­Supplier Council—An executive-­level group that includes an 
OEM/­producer and a rotating group of key suppliers to share infor­
mation such as product and strategy development plans
•	 Global Sourcing Steering Committee—An executive-­level group that 
has responsibility for overseeing centrally led global sourcing initiatives
•	 Commodity Management Team—A team that has responsibility 
for managing commodity groups or categories of purchase require­
ments with responsibility for supplier selection decisions, relation­
ship management, and increasingly risk management
•	 Demand and Supply Planning Team—A cross-­functional planning 
group that identifies and balances downstream customer demand 
requirements with upstream supply availability
•	 Buyer–­Seller Improvement Team—A cross-­organizational team that 
focuses on tangible supply chain improvement opportunities and 
projects between the buyer and seller, such as supplier development 
opportunities
•	 Value Analysis/­Value Engineering Team—A continuous improve­
ment team that has responsibility for enhancing customer value by 
systematically analyzing the relationship between product/­service 
function and cost
•	 Customer Order Fulfillment Team—A cross-­functional team that 
has responsibility for managing the customer order fulfillment pro­
cess from order entry to final delivery, sometimes including through 
final customer payment

Building the Risk Management Foundation  •  51
•	 New Product Development Team—A cross-­functional team that has 
responsibility for developing new products and services, ideally with 
supplier and customer support
•	 Supply Chain Process Management Team—A cross-­functional team 
that has responsibility, usually on a full-­time basis, for managing 
and improving critical supply chain processes
•	 Customer Relationship Management and Service Teams—Teams 
that have responsibility for managing longer-­term relationships with 
key customers
What does such a wide variety of groups and teams have to do with sup­
ply chain risk management? While the use of teams presents challenges 
that are beyond the scope of this chapter, they also present a tremendous 
opportunity to embed risk considerations into many settings. Every team 
listed above should address risk issues as part of their scope.
The use of organizational design features across a supply chain is var­
ied, which means that opportunities exist to engage in risk-­related dis­
cussions that consider supply chain management and risk management 
topics simultaneously.
Information Technology
Information technology supports risk management excellence by enabling 
the seamless availability, analysis, and movement of supply chain data 
and information, thereby allowing more informed decisions. Regardless 
of the type of information technology platform or software used, supply 
chain systems should have the ability to capture and share information 
across functional groups and organizational boundaries in real time or 
near real time. This may involve transmitting the location of transpor­
tation vehicles with global positioning systems, transmitting material 
requirements with web-­based electronic data interchange systems, or cap­
turing demand and replenishment data using bar code technology. Radio 
frequency identification (RFID) tags are also beginning to capture real-­
time data about material and product movement.
It is important to understand the important role that shared, real-­time 
data can provide to risk managers. A powerful outcome occurs when real-­
time data and predictive analytics are combined to anticipate what will 
happen rather than react to what did happened. Knowing what will happen 

52  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
with a relative degree of certainty enables supply chain mangers to take 
preventive action, something that is the holy grail of risk management.
There is no question that “big data” is the next big thing in the IT world. 
Big data is the efficient analyzing of massive amounts of the data that 
organizations collect every day. Combining massive amounts of data with 
sophisticated algorithms comes under a variety of names, including 
big data, predictive analytics, data analytics, and business analytics. 
Predictive analytics are being used to anticipate customer purchases, iden­
tify demand patterns, predict the occurrence of crimes (something called 
predictive policing), anticipate patient heart attacks, and identify truck 
maintenance problems (to name but a few applications). Its relevance to 
better risk management practices is obvious.
Some companies scan massive amounts of data to determine the best 
combination of operating variables to achieve a desired outcome at the 
lowest total cost. A major trucking company, for example, monitors in 
real time every aspect of the performance of its fleet as well as the driving 
behavior of its drivers. Is a driver driving too fast or slow? Is the engine 
performing properly? Is the driver letting the truck idle too long? What 
is the best combination of operating parameters that yields the highest 
miles per gallon? Besides helping the company optimize its fleet opera­
tions, the data also track compliance to hours of service regulations. Of 
course, the drivers have their own opinion about this real-­time visibility.
What has made the predictive analytics suddenly become popular is the 
development of Hadoop (named after the developer’s son’s toy elephant), 
an open source system that mimics the “divide and conquer” approach 
taken by Google.7 This system can also handle data that do not fit neatly 
into a spreadsheet. The Hadoop approach spreads tremendous amounts of 
information across data centers and then probes that pool of data quickly 
and inexpensively for answers to queries. This is in contrast to traditional 
data warehouses that cram as much well-­organized information as possi­
ble onto a few expensive computers and then “crunch” the data as the sys­
tem searches for answers. A second wave of new start-­ups, as well as some 
big-­name companies, is developing easier-­to-­use versions of Hadoop. They 
are also extending the use of inexpensive servers to analyze new categories 
of data, including blogs, pictures, videos, tweets, and even medical images. 
The ability to use analytics to predict risk events will be a “game changer.” 
This topic is so important that Chapter 11 focuses on using analytics to 
predict the future and manage risk.

Building the Risk Management Foundation  •  53
Measurement Systems
A third enabler includes the measures and measurement systems that are 
in place to provide insight into the many facets of SCRM. Measurement 
systems in general come under criticism for some good reasons (too many 
measures, too few measures, measures that drive the wrong behavior, mea­
sures that are backward looking, measures that focus on activity rather 
than accomplishment). In the risk management arena, the most obvious 
criticism is the lack of measures that relate directly to risk, although many 
measures have indirect risk connections. A parts-­per-­million quality met­
ric provides insight into quality problems, which will have a secondary 
relationship to operational risk. What we often fail to see in supply chain 
management are measures whose primary objective is to capture and 
report on some element of supply chain risk. Chapter 13 will present a set 
of leading-­edge measures that address supply chain risk specifically.
Why do we even need risk-­related measures and measurement systems? 
First, objective measurement supports making fact-­based decisions about 
risk issues. Measurement is also an ideal way to communicate informa­
tion across a supply chain and to promote continuous improvement and 
change. Measurement also conveys what is important by linking critical 
risk-­related measures to strategies and desired business outcomes. Finally, 
measurement helps identify whether new initiatives are producing the 
desired results. Measurement may be the single-­best tool to make risk 
management an embedded part of a company’s culture.
An example of a system that uses defined measures and algorithms to 
focus directly on risk is Boeing’s SINC (Supplier Insight and Control) sys­
tem. The vision of the SINC process is to deliver early identification of sup­
ply chain risks and improve decision-­making capabilities. In this system, 
suppliers input data that pass through various measures and algorithms 
to arrive at performance predictions. The SINC process promotes collabo­
ration with suppliers and provides early risk identification through the 
collection and use of Boeing and supplier process data. The SINC system 
focuses on insight rather than oversight.
While measurement is a critical enabler, it is certainly not unique to 
supply chain or risk management. A convincing argument can be made 
that risk measurement systems are not nearly as developed as they are 
in finance or marketing, for example. It might be tempting to ask why 
measurement is important enough to be considered a risk management 
enabler. The bottom line is that any major strategy or change, including 

54  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
cultural changes, requires a way to validate success. Measurement is a pri­
mary way to validate that success.
Talent Management
Something that we are confident about is that risk management, while 
increasingly supported by sophisticated tools and techniques, is still a 
“people” operation. Those who make risk decisions often have dozens of 
years of experience and insight, something that is called “deep smarts” 
or organizational wisdom. And therein lies the challenge. In the United 
States, every eight seconds on average a member of the 76 million baby-­
boomer generation turns 65. So what does that mean? It means that a huge 
generation of employees has started to retire, taking with them years of 
knowledge and experience. Instead of viewing this as a negative, it can 
also be an opportunity to craft a workforce that is not committed to exist­
ing ways of doing business. It also offers the opportunity to practice some­
thing called talent management, arguably a term that is becoming trendy 
and overused.
Talent management is the process through which employers anticipate 
and meet their needs for human capital.8 Without question, effective sup­
ply chain risk management benefits from having the right set of tools and 
techniques. Never forget, however, the importance of having the right 
people who know how to develop these tools as well as how to use them.
An ongoing challenge is finding employees who are capable of more 
than simply taking a tactical and limited view of the supply chain. This 
includes understanding how to incorporate risk topics with everyday 
business topics. Ideally, we want employees who not only understand the 
basics of supply chain management; they also need to have the ability 
to identify and anticipate potential risk outcomes. Over and over we see 
companies that have developed decentralized supply chain groups that are 
proficient at tactically managing transactions and material flow through 
a relatively uncoordinated network (something that itself presents risk). 
Understanding how various internal and external groups must collaborate 
to manage a value chain, including from a risk management perspective, 
is not as well understood.
What should we broadly look for in terms of human capital and risk man­
agement? First, employees who can view the supply chain holistically and 
in terms of linked processes are an absolute requirement. These employ­
ees must also understand their company’s business model, including how 

Building the Risk Management Foundation  •  55
risk management fits into that model. They must also understand how to 
manage critical supply chain relationships with a keen eye on risk man­
agement. A strong knowledge of cost and risk management techniques 
combined with the ability to engage in statistical analysis and fact-­based 
decisions is also a necessity. The ability to walk on water would also be a 
definite plus. The knowledge and skill set required of tomorrow’s supply 
chain professional is a bit more demanding than what we see today.
A challenge moving forward concerns how to acquire, assess, retain, and 
develop people with the knowledge and skills who are proficient at supply 
chain risk management. Table 3.1 provides some approaches for ensuring 
a continuous flow of highly qualified supply chain personnel. As this table 
shows, there are many ways to acquire and develop human resources.
As it pertains to how people view and perhaps even manage risk, inter­
esting differences occur between genders. A body of research has con­
cluded that women tend to focus on the odds of winning (the risk), while 
men focus on the payoff or reward. As a result men, on average, are more 
willing to take risks even when empirical evidence shows something to 
be inherently risky. Women tend to be more cautious in their actions and 
deliberate in their analysis. While at first glance this timidity may appear

to be a sign of weakness, it can also provide the correct reading of risk. 
And when women do select a course of action, they will work as diligently 
and often more successfully than men because they are selecting battles 
they are more likely to win.9
It is difficult to overstate the relationship between these four enabling 
areas and the successful pursuit of risk management strategies. The 
importance of people, organization, systems, and measurement will not 
diminish over time, making the need to build a strong foundation across 
these four areas a continuous challenge.
LINKING SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGY
A second major part of building a risk management foundation is forging 
the critical linkages between risk management strategy and supply chain 
strategy development. At some point we expect to see risk management 
become an embedded consideration during the development of not only 
supply chain strategies but also corporate or business strategies.
The concept of strategy, at least on paper, is relatively straightforward. 
A strategy is a conceptualization of an organization’s long-­term objectives 
(which are aspirations) and purposes, broad constraints and policies that 
affect activities, and the current set of action plans (tactics) and near-­term 
goals expected to help achieve an organization’s objectives. An effective 
supply strategy consists of a number of parts—objectives, constraints, 
plans, and goals. A clear sign that an organization has achieved a level of 
maturity within a particular area is the presence of well-­crafted strategies.
Making risk assessment a required part of any strategy development 
process makes sense for several reasons. Combining risk assessments with 
business strategies requires participants to consider risk issues. No longer 
can ownership for risk be deferred to another individual or group or an 
assumption made that risk will be considered at a later date. Making risk 
plans part of the strategy development process also helps embed risk man­
agement into the corporate culture. Participants begin to understand they 
cannot propose a strategy without a well-­thought-­out risk plan as part 
of that strategy. And these participants will come to realize they are the 
owners of the risk management process. Finally, making risk assessment 

Building the Risk Management Foundation  •  57
part of any strategy development process usually does not require major 
changes to the strategy development process.
It should not be hard to grasp the logic behind identifying potential 
risks whenever strategies are developed. Many of these risks will qualify 
as constraints that have the potential to affect strategy success. The risk 
management approaches and techniques that are put in place should be 
viewed as tactics. The following identifies an important way to link risk 
management strategies and supply chain commodity strategies.
Integrating Risk Management with Commodity 
Strategy Development
Clear evidence of organizational maturity is the presence of well-­thought-­
out strategies, which in supply chain management includes commodity or 
category strategies with suppliers. A purchase commodity or category is 
simply a like grouping of items or services. Some easy yet powerful ways 
are available to embed supply chain risk management directly into the 
commodity strategy development process.
A set of questions should be asked when crafting commodity strategies. 
The following provides a listing of the kinds of questions to consider when 
crafting a commodity strategy. It becomes relatively easy to incorporate 
risk management into this list. Performing a thorough strategy assessment, 
as demanded by the items below, is in itself a risk management technique. 
When crafting a commodity or category strategy, participants should ask
•	 What are the broad objectives of the strategy?
•	 What functional groups should be involved in strategy development?
•	 What are the internal customer requirements for this item or commodity?
•	 What are the current expenditures by commodity and supplier?
•	 What are the future volume requirements for this item or commodity?
•	 What is the performance of the current supplier?
•	 Who are the other potential suppliers in the marketplace and what 
are their capabilities?
•	 What other companies are competing for supply?
•	 Should we develop a domestic, regional, or worldwide contract?
•	 Should we rely on single or multiple suppliers?
•	 How should we divide the total spend if multiple suppliers are used?
•	 Do we want short-­term or longer-­term contracts?

58  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
•	 What are our pricing targets?
•	 What nonprice issues should we consider during contract negotiation?
•	 How do we measure supplier performance during contract 
performance?
•	 What specific services, such as inventory management or design 
support, will we seek from the supplier?
•	 What is the power relationship among the participants in the sup­
ply market?
•	 How can we promote continuous performance improvement?
•	 What type of supplier relationship should we pursue?
•	 Who will have responsibility for managing the supplier relationship?
•	 What specific contract clauses should we include?
•	 What is our negotiating strategy?
•	 What contract and supply chain performance risks do we need to 
consider?
•	 What risks may affect the supply market and suppliers?
•	 What risk prevention and mitigation actions should we put in place 
to address commodity and supplier risks?
Something that should increasingly be required is for commodity teams 
to include risk assessment plans as part of their formal commodity strate­
gies. This forces commodity teams to assume responsibility for risk man­
agement rather than shifting that responsibility to another party. Recall 
from Chapter 1 that a risk assessment plan is an extension of a risk analy­
sis. The risk plan is a document that defines known risks and includes 
descriptions, causes, probabilities or the likelihood of risk occurrences, 
costs, and proposed risk management responses. It can easily be included 
as part of a formal commodity strategy.
Commodity Risk Analysis and Plans. What does a risk analysis look 
like? The following provides some guidance regarding the format and 
content of a risk analysis report that could become part of a commodity 
strategy. These risk plans can also be developed independent of commod­
ity strategies. To the best of our knowledge, no industry-­accepted format 
exists regarding what a risk analysis should or should not include.
Section  1: This section includes an external intelligence report that 
describes in detail the supply market for the commodity/­material. 
Who are the major suppliers and where are they located? Who are 
the major customers? What are the supply trends? Are there specific 

Building the Risk Management Foundation  •  59
supply and demand price drivers? What is the overall competitive 
environment of the market for this commodity?
Section 2: This section identifies and categorizes risk(s), including a 
detailed description of each risk (i.e., not a generalization such as 
“potential supply disruption” or “bad weather”).
Section 3: This section requires the development of a risk scenario map 
with each risk numbered and plotted on the map. The dimensions 
of the map can include the probability of a risk occurring and its 
expected impact if it were to occur.
Section  4: This section contains a comprehensive risk management 
plan that identifies risk management actions that describe how to 
manage the risks identified in Section 2. This section should also 
include a timeline that shows how and when to carry out risk man­
agement actions.
Section 5: This final section includes a listing of objective references 
and information sources about the demand and supply market for 
that item and supplier(s). It should identify why each information 
source is valuable. Particular emphasis should be given to informa­
tion sources that are updated on a regular basis.
THE ULTIMATE RISK—IMPROVE OR ELSE!
A number of years ago executive management at a major steel producer 
presented an ultimatum to its subsidiary railroad units: Achieve a certain 
level of return on net assets (RONA) or risk divestiture from the parent 
company. Historically each railroad operated as its own business entity, 
and the parent company measured the financial performance of each unit 
separately. For the first time it became obvious that the different railroads 
needed to coordinate their activities across many different dimensions or 
face a very uncertain future.
This case illustrates how a strategic risk (divestiture from the parent 
company) was avoided through actions supported by stressing the four 
enablers described in this chapter—effective measurement, organizational 
design approaches supported by strong central leader­ship, capable human 
resources, and the extensive use of information technology. Combining 
these four enabling areas with strong central leader­ship changed the way 
this company conducted business with its suppliers.

Rallying around a Superordinate Measure
A key learning from this case involves the power of a seemingly ordinary 
measure (RONA) to become a superordinate measure that helps reduce 
risk at the corporate level (the measurement enabler). A superordinate 
measure is one that no single part of an organization can achieve on its 
own. By definition, the presence of superordinate measures demands that 
different groups work together or fail individually.
An emphasis on net asset return began when executive management 
challenged the railroads to develop new ways to meet or exceed an estab­
lished RONA target. Figure 3.2 shows how this company measures RONA. 
A focus on this measure forced different functional groups to think 
about the big picture and how they each impacted that picture. The cor­
porate decree to improve RONA forced functional groups to devise cre­
ative ways to increase earnings while simultaneously reducing assets and 
other liabilities.
Figure  3.2 also shows how various groups were responsible for dif­
ferent parts of the RONA equation. Accounting worked to improve 
accounts receivable and payable while marketing assumed responsibility 
for increasing revenue outside the parent company. Finance had respon­
sibility for validating the savings and the numbers that populated the 
RONA equation.

A small centralized purchasing group (the organizational design 
enabler) focused extensively on the denominator of the RONA equation. 
This group was responsible for developing innovative ways to manage 
spare inventory, which for the railroads represents a major financial com­
mitment. This group radically changed how the railroads contracted with 
suppliers, changes that resulted directly in better financial performance 
and reduced risk.
Managers from the departments responsible for supporting the RONA 
target met regularly to share information and to discuss progress against 
their financial return targets. A sense of urgency surrounded these meet­
ings simply because the risks were so high. The railroads viewed their asset 
return achievements as objective evidence of their contribution to the par­
ent company.
Reducing Supply Risk through a New Approach to Contracting
The central purchasing group’s approach to improving RONA involved the 
development of three-­year systems contracts that featured consignment 
inventory. Previously, contracts with suppliers, if they could be called that, 
were developed by the individual railroads annually. Inventory consign­
ment involved deferring payment for an item until a user at a railroad 
physically takes an item from a yard or warehouse and receives it into 
the railroad’s inventory. The central procurement group developed 25 to 
30 systems contracts, each covering around 25 items, with six suppliers. 
Contract renewal or renegotiation occurred every three years.
The procurement group redefined how the railroads sourced materi­
als, a change that reduced financial and strategic risk. The previous pro­
curement model featured each railroad issuing its own annual purchase 
orders. This model, which almost always featured annual price increases, 
was replaced by contracts that combined the volumes of the six railroads 
to realize more attractive prices and service. The central procurement 
group represented the interest of the six railroads not only when develop­
ing companywide contracts and but also during supplier negotiations.
While systems contracting is a radical departure for this company and 
its suppliers, it was not new to the head of the purchasing group. This indi­
vidual had extensive experience with systems contracts and consignment 
inventory while working at General Electric (the human talent enabler). 
This highlights a major lesson here—transferring knowledge from one 

62  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
industry to another can provide tremendous benefits, particularly when 
dealing with a less-­sophisticated industry.
Early in the process, purchasing announced that it would not accept 
higher prices due to any inventory carrying costs for the consigned inven­
tory. During negotiation planning, purchasing used previous costs as a 
basis for price negotiation, although some suppliers attempted to add con­
signment costs into their purchase prices.
Why would suppliers agree to a systems contract that requires them to 
assume inventory carrying costs? The major incentive was three-­year con­
tracts that resulted in greater volumes that offset any consignment costs. 
Furthermore, the willingness of the railroads to take ownership of unused 
consigned material from suppliers at the end of each year reduced some 
supplier risk exposure.
Purchasing relied extensively on spreadsheet tools to analyze purchased 
items. Tying into the railroads’ automated inventory databases, the pur­
chasing group calculated actual usage and company-­wide requirements, 
identified potential systems contract part candidates, and calculated 
inventory investment figures (the IT enabler). Spreadsheets were also used 
to analyze supplier-­provided data before commencing formal negotiations. 
Computerized spreadsheets that retrieved data from various databases 
were invaluable when developing systems contracts. What became evident 
from this analysis was that a supplier may not be competitive across all 
items being considered on a systems contract, something that encouraged 
the development of “configured supply networks.” Figure 3.3 explains the 
concept of a configured supply network with a simple set of data.
The purchasing group also conducted frequent meetings with the presi­
dent of the railroads to report on progress. The president’s agreement with 
the systems contracting approach sent a strong message to suppliers con­
cerning the seriousness of this new way of doing business. Meeting with 
executive management also served to protect the president from being 
caught unaware or being unduly influenced when contacted by suppliers 
who preferred the old way of doing business.
Systems Contracting Benefits
Systems contracting featuring consignment inventory produced direct 
benefits for the railroads. First, purchasing achieved its primary goal of 
reducing inventory investment by almost 50%. Cash flow also improved 

Building the Risk Management Foundation  •  63
due to lower ordering and inventory carrying costs. The railroads also 
avoided or deferred price increases due to fixed pricing agreements. 
Systems contracts have also allowed for some downsizing as suppliers 
assumed responsibilities for delivering and placing physical inventory in 
storage at the rail yards and warehouses. In short, there was a great deal 
to like here.
While the parent company failed to achieve its own financial targets, 
the railroads achieved net asset returns of over 50%, prompting some to 
suggest that perhaps they should divest themselves of the parent company. 
This new way to operate, supported extensively by the four enablers out­
lined in this chapter, helped the railroads avoid their ultimate risk—their 
own demise!

agement is going to be more complex, sophisticated, and demanding

strategies must become more commonplace, and this demands building 
a foundation of people, systems, measures, and organizational design 
that supports risk management excellence. After thinking about the four 
enablers presented in this chapter, how many of us would logically con­
clude these enablers are not critical to effective risk management?
Summary of Key Chapter Points
•	 Perhaps one of the most underappreciated parts of corporate suc­
cess, including successful risk management, is the role that organi­
zational design plays.
•	 Supply chain risk management is rarely established as a distinct 
function within a company, although most organizations designate 
a “point person” with responsibility for risk management. Businesses 
have not yet agreed upon any typical way to integrate supply chain 
risk management into their decision-­making processes.
•	 Various design features are ideal for including risk management as 
part of their scope, including sales and operations planning; collab­
orative planning, forecasting, and replenishment processes; execu­
tive responsibility; organizing around processes; and organizational 
work teams.
•	 Regardless of the type of information technology platform or soft­
ware used, supply chain systems should have the ability to capture 
and share information across functional groups and organizational 
boundaries in real time or near real time.
•	 It is important to understand the important role that shared, real-­
time data can provide to risk managers. There is no question that 
“big data” is the next big thing in the IT world.
•	 Measurement supports making fact-­based decisions about risk issues. 
Measurement is also an ideal way to communicate information, pro­
mote continuous improvement, convey what is important, and iden­
tify whether new initiatives are producing the desired results.
•	 A second major part of building a risk management foundation is 
forging the critical linkages between risk management strategy and 
supply chain strategy development.
•	 Making risk assessment plans a required part of any strategy devel­
opment process forces participants to consider risk issues when 
developing strategies while helping to embed risk management into 
the corporate culture.

Building the Risk Management Foundation  •  65
•	 A supply market risk analysis should include a supply market intel­
ligence report, a categorization of identified risks, a risk scenario 
map, a comprehensive risk management plan that identifies specific 
risk management action, and a listing of references and information 
sources that include objective information about the demand and 
supply market.

Strategic Risk
If there is one item that is the lifeblood of chocolate producers, it is cocoa. 
And if there is one item that presents a strategic risk to chocolate produc­
ers, it is cocoa. Around 70% of the world’s cocoa crop is concentrated in five 
African countries, in a region that is not known as the most stable place to 
obtain raw materials. Furthermore, several years ago, a handful of traders 
took possession of almost all the cocoa beans in certified warehouses in 
Europe, raising legitimate concerns about commodity manipulation.
Even on a good day cocoa can be risky to grow as yields are lower com­
pared with other crops, access to fertilizer is limited, and the cocoa crop 
is highly susceptible to pests. Not surprisingly, cocoa growers are increas­
ingly shifting to more profitable crops such as rubber while younger farm­
ers are reluctant to become cocoa farmers in the first place. None of this is 
good news to chocolate companies.
Major chocolate companies have come to the conclusion that they must 
work directly with farmers to introduce trees that increase crop yield, 
to eradicate pests and disease, to provide training and education, and to 
make sure farmers have access to fertilizer.1 They are also working to make 
the financial model for growing cocoa beans more viable. These compa­
nies are trying to be proactive in the face of a strategic risk that can affect 
the success of a global industry.
This chapter addresses a specific category of risk called strategic risk. 
While countless corporate-­level actions, decisions, and random events 
can create strategic risk, this chapter focuses on supply chain areas that 
have clear strategic linkages when not managed or anticipated properly. 
We will focus on strategic risk within three areas—strategic risk that 
results from new product failures, theft of intellectual property, and exter­
nal intelligence failures. We also provide advice about how to minimize 
the strategic risk related to each area.

68  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
WHAT IS STRATEGIC RISK?
Before discussing various supply chain areas that can elevate risk to the 
strategic level, let’s be clear about what we mean here. A good place to 
start is by understanding what is meant by strategic, a word that is one of 
the most overused terms in business. In fact, it is so overused that it often 
becomes difficult to know when something truly is strategic.
Something is strategic if it is necessary to or important in the initia­
tion, conduct, or completion of a strategy or strategic plan.2 Another per­
spective says that something is strategic if it relates to the identification of 
long-­term or overall aims and interests of an organization and the means 
of achieving them.3 However, all of the definitions tie into the notion that 
something is strategic if it has the ability or potential to affect the inte­
grated whole, which means affecting an entire business or its continuity.
Now that we understand the word strategic, let’s understand strategic 
risk. One perspective views strategic risks as those risks that are most 
consequential to an organization’s ability to execute its strategy, achieve 
its business objectives, and build and protect value.4 Another perspective 
views strategic risk as the current and prospective impact on earnings or 
capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation 
of decisions, or a lack of responsiveness to industry changes or forces.5 And 
a third view defines strategic risk as an array of external events and trends 
that can devastate a company’s growth trajectory and shareholder value. 
This third view further categorizes strategic risks into seven major classes: 
industry, technology, brand, competitor, customer, project, and stagna­
tion.6 Consider the strategic risk to the producers of the lucrative Fast 
and Furious franchise. When Paul Walker, a major star of this series, was 
killed in an unrelated accident during the filming of Fast and Furious 7, 
Universal decided to indefinitely postpone the $200 million project, even 
though the movie was well into filming. The death of a film star during 
production is perhaps the ultimate strategic risk for a movie company.
Strategic risks are those that capture the attention of the board of direc­
tors. And these are the risks that make their way onto the 10-K report as 
enterprise risks. These risks have the ability to affect business continu­
ity, erode a company’s brand image, and adversely impact market share. 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, supply chain risks are increasingly becoming 
part of the enterprise risk listing, something that makes supply chain risk 
management a growing concern to executive management. The following 

Strategic Risk  •  69
presents three supply chain–­related areas that minimize strategic risk 
when managed properly.
REDUCING STRATEGIC RISK THROUGH 
BETTER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
It is widely accepted that the successful development of products and ser­
vices is an important part of what differentiates one firm from the next. In 
fact, a large body of literature has identified product development as a core 
process playing a major role that supports global innovation and competi­
tiveness. The process of discovery, development, and commercialization 
of products and services is a major source for innovation and growth. It is 
also a process that when performed poorly has strategic risk implications, 
particularly as it relates to a company’s reputation and brand equity.
This discussion is not about how to develop new products and processes. 
Other sources address that topic well. Instead, we look at how to make 
product development better from two perspectives. The first perspective 
presents a set of best practices during product development. The second 
looks at the emerging process of integrating new product development and 
risk management. Better product development means less business risk.
New Product Development Best Practices
A well-­designed product development process can lead to many ben­
efits, including reduced market risk, shorter development times, and first 
mover advantages that capture market share or create barriers to entry. 
An analysis conducted by Industry Week revealed hundreds of ways to 
develop products and services faster, better, and smarter. Our experi­
ence with leading companies suggests that the biggest improvements in 
product development are the result of a well-­defined set of practices that 
requires a closer look.
Concurrency. Concurrency during product development is defined by 
two dimensions. The first is the simultaneous development of products 
along with the physical processes required to produce them. The second 
dimension involves the simultaneous rather than sequential involve­
ment of functional groups during development. Sequential development 
(or what some refer to as linear development) features a “handing off” 

70  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
of work from one functional group to another, something that requires a 
time-­consuming learning period after each hand-­off. It also results in far 
too much work being handed back for revision when a later group finds a 
design to be unworkable.
What is it about a concurrent approach with cross-­functional teams that 
is attractive? A concurrent approach requires cross-­functional agreement 
throughout the development process, which minimizes time-­consuming 
and costly design changes at later development stages. This approach also 
supports the interaction of competent professionals, something that usu­
ally leads to better decisions. Furthermore, concurrency offers opportuni­
ties for early customer and supplier involvement, accelerated learning as 
cross-­functional team members learn simultaneously rather than sequen­
tially, and the establishment of organizational rather than more limited 
functional goals. Some good reasons exist to pursue a concurrent approach 
to product and process development.
Early Involvement. Most executive leaders now appreciate the value of 
external involvement during product development, and they further rec­
ognize the need to involve suppliers and customers earlier rather than later 
in the process. Recently, a leading maker of appliances relied on a supplier 
to act as a system integrator for a complex module. The integrator assumed 
design leader­ship, selected the component suppliers, and managed those 
suppliers during development and production. For the first time this orig­
inal equipment manufacturer (OEM) did not suffer product launch delays 
or cost overruns related to this module. Launch delays and cost overruns 
are key risks that are part of every product development project.
A meaningful relationship exists between supplier involvement on 
teams, including product development teams, and a variety of desirable 
outcomes. Teams that involve suppliers, formally or informally, are gen­
erally more satisfied with the exchange of information with suppliers 
compared with teams that do not include suppliers. These teams also note 
fewer problems coordinating external work activity with a higher reliance 
on suppliers to support a team’s goals. Perhaps most importantly, external 
evaluators rate teams that involve suppliers as more effective with greater 
effort put forth toward their assignments or projects compared with teams 
where supplier involvement was lacking.
While early involvement with suppliers sounds easy, the process does 
bring with it some issues. Confidentiality of information continues to be 
a major concern when involving external organizations in something as 
strategically important as product development. Other concerns include 

Strategic Risk  •  71
not knowing how to pursue early involvement, maintaining too many 
suppliers for a given requirement, or external relationships that are adver­
sarial rather than cooperative. Given the expected growth in product 
teams that includes suppliers and customers, overcoming any barriers to 
early involvement, each of which presents a clear risk to the success of the 
process, must become a priority. Fortunately, none of these barriers vio­
lates the laws of physics.
Use of Information Technology. Successful product development 
groups rely extensively on software to accelerate and improve the devel­
opment process, another best-­practice characteristic. Software is avail­
able that supports product and process development through design of 
experiments, quality function deployment (i.e., translating customer 
wants and requirements into design specifications), and the methodical 
assessment of design for manufacturability or assembly, something that 
is essential when taking a concurrent product and process development 
approach. And let’s not forget about the importance of computer-­aided 
design (CAD), computer-­aided manufacturing (CAM), and rapid proto­
typing applications. Keeping with the software theme, failure mode effects 
analysis (FMEA) tools support the assessment of potential failures in a 
design or process, while TRIZ software supports a disciplined approach to 
complex problems that are encountered during development.
Without question we must include here additive manufacturing through 
3-D printing. This rapidly evolving technology is expected to be a disrup­
tive technology, especially during product development. Product design­
ers at Ford, an early adopter of 3-D printing, are now creating prototype 
parts for testing in days rather than months. Besides saving time, which 
is the holy grail of product development, Ford is saving millions of dol­
lars during development. On a new engine program, Ford will 3-D print 
most of the major components on the engine. According to a Ford execu­
tive, “When you learn about some of the ways additive manufacturing has 
positively impacted, and even in some cases saved product launches, you 
begin to understand its value. Our team is allowed so much more time to 
innovate and improve products because they have more opportunities to 
utilize multiple variations more efficiently.”7
Linking R&D and New Product Development. The fourth element 
characterizing leading product development involves a direct linkage 
between R&D and product development. Far too often worthwhile inno­
vations from the laboratory are not commercialized. Best-­in-­class compa­
nies have in place a process to develop and validate new technology and 

72  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
then link that technology to the product development process. While not 
all new technology emanating from R&D labs will be commercially viable, 
the linkage of one process to another ensures that market-­ready technol­
ogy can be designed into new products. When the pieces come together, 
it can create a difficult barrier for less-­effective competitors to overcome.
Target Pricing. Many product development efforts will benefit from tar­
get pricing (sometimes called target costing). With a traditional approach 
to product development, we arrive at the selling price by combining prod­
uct costs and adding a profit margin. Unfortunately, this approach often 
overstates the price a customer will accept or ignores what competitors are 
doing. It is an inwardly focused approach that does not consider the voice 
of the customer. Traditional pricing also tends to minimize the impor­
tance of cost management during product design.
Target pricing is a complete reversal of traditional pricing. Under a tar­
get approach, product development teams identify the price that custom­
ers are willing to pay for a product or service. After identifying a target 
price, profit margins are backed out to arrive at a product’s allowable costs. 
If allowable costs are below current cost levels, then the design team must 
identify ways to remove or lower costs or to accept a lower profit margin. 
With target pricing, costs are something to manage rather than take for 
granted. Surveys of competitive pressures almost always conclude that the 
need to manage costs is relentless and severe. Why not manage costs early 
during product development?
Subtle Control. Years ago Taguchi and Nonaka conducted a study that 
identified “subtle control” as a powerful yet simple concept that execu­
tive leaders should routinely practice when teams develop new products.8 
Simply stated, subtle control is a delicate balancing act that seeks to ensure 
that teams and processes proceed as expected during development but 
without the need for blatant control or micromanagement by executive 
leaders. Effective subtle control, which begins to resemble an organiza­
tional art form, is a product development best practice.
Executives have many ways to practice subtle control. They can iden­
tify which projects to pursue, select leaders and members for development 
teams, create and manage the development process that teams will follow, 
require performance updates at regular milestones, and establish broad 
performance targets that teams use when establishing their individual 
goals. Subtle control recognizes that while empowerment is an attractive 
idea, relinquishing complete control of product development is not quite 
as attractive.

Strategic Risk  •  73
Design for X. A final practice mentioned here is something called 
Design for X. Industry leaders appreciate the power of the product devel­
opment process to satisfy some important aspirations or objectives. The 
term X represents different aspirations the development teams consider 
even before beginning design work. Design for X aspirations can involve 
design for quality, reliability, serviceability, sustainability, end-­of-­life 
recycling, target price, assembly, cycle time, postponement, and even risk 
management. This is a powerful concept because it ensures that important 
objectives are considered early on during product development.
Integrated product development is a major source point for innovation 
and growth. We know that world-­class companies endorse certain prac­
tices that differentiate their product development process from those that 
are not leaders. Fortunately, what makes up this set of practices is becom­
ing increasingly clear. These practices will also go a long way toward 
reducing strategic risk exposure by improving the chances of successful 
product development. There is nothing quite like a product failure to tar­
nish a company’s brand reputation.
Bringing New Product Development 
and Risk Management Together
A typical model of new product development projects, particularly at 
higher technology companies, features engineering teams working quickly 
and as fast as possible to develop a new product or technology. Then, at 
some later point, suppliers are selected to support the design. Oftentimes 
the selection of suppliers is not the most-­thought-­out part of the project, 
although few companies will actually admit this. When this is the case, 
it is up to the supply group after product launch to address supply chain 
risks as they materialize. This model, where risk mitigation takes prece­
dence over risk prevention, is more common than we would like to admit.
It is challenging to locate case examples where companies explicitly 
address product development and supply chain risk simultaneously. 
While integrated product and process development is well understood, 
the integration of supply chain risk and new product development is not. 
The convergence of product development and risk management is an 
evolving practice that aligns well with the quality management principles 
of prevention and quality at the source.
What are the characteristics of a process that simultaneously brings 
together product development and risk management? First, supplier 

74  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
selection must happen early rather than later in the design process. From 
a risk perspective this means that selection teams will not only consider 
the traditional selection criteria they normally use when evaluating sup­
pliers, but they will also consider risk factors.
Next, each cross-­functional team involved in product development, 
with the help of the supply management group, will have responsibility 
for identifying a set of supply chain risks that may affect their part of the 
project. These risks are collected and categorized for easy access. Then, 
development team members will meet regularly to review not only prod­
uct development progress but also discuss the actions taken to address 
these identified risks.
Taking this a step further, the teams will estimate the probability of each 
risk occurring and the impact that risk will have on product launch if it 
occurs. A common approach is to arrive at a risk rating that equates with 
high, medium, or low risk that reflects the combined probability and impact 
of a risk. Priority is then given to evaluating the higher risks to determine 
what action can be taken to reduce their probability and impact, thereby 
turning a higher risk into a lower designed risk prior to product launch.
A high-­risk designation might result from relying on a critical material 
that is volatile in terms of price and availability. The design team might qual­
ify a less volatile material that could serve as a substitute if necessary. Or, a 
design team might be uncomfortable with the use of a single supplier. Here, 
the supply group might prequalify a secondary source to mitigate that risk.
The objective here is to launch a product with as few unresolved risks 
as possible. Any outstanding higher risks at product launch are an admis­
sion by the development team that it has decided, for whatever reason, 
to accept that risk. Any accepted higher risks should be kept to an abso­
lute minimum.
THE ART AND SCIENCE OF NOT GETTING 
CAUGHT BY SURPRISE
It would be quite a challenge to find an executive who says he or she enjoys 
getting caught off guard. Unfortunately, a lack of external intelligence can 
clearly lead to surprises that elevate strategic risk. External intelligence 
consists of the data, information, and knowledge that come from outside 
your company, including macroeconomic changes, legal and regulatory 

Strategic Risk  •  75
changes, industry trends and changes, supplier and competitor actions, 
social and labor force trends, customer expectations, technology innova­
tions, and risk factors. Two challenges associated with external intelli­
gence are that either we have information overload or we have our heads in 
the sand and fail to see what is going on around us. The underlying objec­
tive of external intelligence is to avoid surprises that mess up our lives.
A concept related to external intelligence is a company’s EIQ, or external 
intelligence quotient. EIQ represents how well your firm collects, assesses, 
and acts upon relevant external data, information, and knowledge. This is 
a particularly relevant risk management concept. When a lower organiza­
tional level senses a significant event about to happen (or has happened), 
how quickly is it before that event is part of an executive discussion? Let’s 
further subdivide external intelligence into two primary groups: market 
intelligence and supply market intelligence.
Consider a recent case with clear strategic risk implications. Next-­
generation smartphones are starting to feature biometric security devices 
to read fingerprints, which will enable a user to securely speed electronic 
payments and retrieve music, documents, and files from cloud storage. In 
2012 Apple bought fingerprint-­sensor company AuthenTec for $350 million, 
an amount of money that is pocket change to Apple.9 Shortly after the pur­
chase the newly acquired company stopped selling its product to HP, Dell, 
Lenovo, and Apple’s nemesis, Samsung. If this technology proves to be a 
game changer, and many observers expect that biometrics will be a disruptive 
technology, Apple could secure a strategic market advantage over companies 
that suddenly saw their primary source of biometric technology disappear. 
External intelligence is intended to help avoid waking up one day and finding 
another company disrupting, perhaps irreparably, your supply market.
Market Intelligence. Market intelligence deals with everyday informa­
tion about developments in the external marketing environment. It is very 
much oriented toward the customer and the downstream part of the sup­
ply chain. A market intelligence system is a set of procedures and sources 
used to obtain that intelligence. Most firms rely on market intelligence 
systems and marketing research to gain external knowledge about their 
markets. Companies can take a variety of steps to improve the quality of 
their market intelligence systems, including the following:
•	 Establish 1-800 phone number or web-­based customer feedback tools
•	 Set up a customer advisory board made up of representative custom­
ers or the company’s largest customers

76  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
•	 Purchase market intelligence information from outside providers
•	 Create a process to circulate relevant news stories and other infor­
mation efficiently across your company
•	 Train and motivate the sales force to spot and report new develop­
ments in your marketplace
•	 Encourage distributors, retailers, and other intermediaries to pass 
along important market intelligence
•	 Buy a competitor’s product
•	 Attend trade shows
•	 Subscribe to trade journals
•	 Review competitor brochures and websites
•	 Survey customers directly
Supply Market Intelligence. Supply market intelligence (SMI) is the 
output from obtaining and analyzing information relevant to a company’s 
current and potential supply markets for the purpose of managing risk 
and supporting effective decisions. Four levels of supply market intelli­
gence exist:
•	 Macroenvironment. This includes information about market dynam­
ics and global economic conditions, world trade, demographics, 
political climate, environment, and technology.
•	 Country level. This category includes economic topics specific to a 
country, such as the location of free trade zones, the tax environ­
ment, labor availability, population size and trends, and regulatory 
bodies. It also includes information about cultural issues, political 
climate and stability, and national holidays.10
•	 Industry and commodity. This relates to the size and relative 
strength of industries and the worldwide users of commodities.
•	 Supplier. This category relates to the number of potential suppli­
ers that exist, the products and services they provide, their size and 
capabilities, and location.
Let’s provide several examples showing the linkage between a lack of 
supply market intelligence and strategic risk. Warnings from a supply 
market intelligence network could help avoid nasty surprises later.
Rare Earth Elements and Chinese Market Dominance. It is a safe bet 
that many companies rely on rare earth metals somewhere in their supply 

Strategic Risk  •  77
chain. And it is a safe bet that many supply chain managers do not grasp the 
strategic risk presented by rare earth metals. While these metals are found 
just about everywhere in the earth’s crust, they are found in volume in only a 
limited number of commercially viable locations. Rare earth metals include 
17 elements: 15 that are known as lanthanoids, plus scandium and yttrium. 
These elements are essential to defense products, such as missile guidance 
systems, as well as high-­technology products. Unfortunately, at one point 
China controlled 97% of rare earth metal output around the globe. And the 
country has shown a willingness to play favorites, especially to its own com­
panies. During a recent one-­year period a rare earth composite price index 
increased 1,500%! Supply chain managers should immediately scan their 
supply chain, including subtier suppliers, to identify if and where these met­
als are consumed. Compounding this risk are the relatively few intermedi­
aries that are capable of turning these elements into a semifinished form.
Guar and Fracking. The energy boom in the United States from hydrau­
lic fracturing (fracking) has had an interesting secondary effect that 
involves, of all things, a bean. Guar, a beanlike vegetable grown mainly 
in India is used in countless products, such as ice cream, fertilizer, cattle 
feed, chocolate milk, hair conditioner, peanut butter, kitty litter, and cran­
berry sauce. It is what we call a ubiquitous item—it shows up just about 
everywhere. The real shock to the guar market occurred when oil and gas 
companies began using it as a key ingredient in their fracking solution. 
A single oil or gas well can require hundreds of acres of guar production. 
During the fracking process guar is mixed with water to thicken the fluid 
that is forced into the fractures of energy-­bearing rock, thereby allowing 
oil and gas to seep out.11 Needless to say, the guar market became quite 
volatile after the oil and gas industry became a major guar buyer. Many 
companies that use guar did not even know about the pending commod­
ity market disruptions until it was too late to do much about them.
We could present dozens of cases that all lead to one conclusion—com­
panies that are ignorant about their external environment elevate their risk 
exposure. Fortunately, thousands of resources are available that provide 
all kinds of valuable information and data. And unfortunately, thousands 
of resources are available that provide all kinds of external intelligence. 
What we are saying is there is almost too much information “out there.” 
The need to converge on a set of trusted external sources of information 
has never been greater. Table  4.1 summarizes some carefully selected 
sources of external intelligence, including supply market intelligence.

Strategic Risk  •  79
PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
International supply chains present a new set of risks compared with 
domestic supply chains. One area where this is of particular concern is the 
protection of intellectual property (IP). Intellectual property refers to cre­
ations of the mind, including inventions, literary and artistic works, sym­
bols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.12 Intellectual property 
falls into two main areas—industrial property and copyright. Industrial 
property includes inventions (patents), trademarks, industrial designs, and 
geographic indications of source. Copyright protects creative works by 
providing the copyright holder exclusive right to control reproduction or 
adaptation of such works for a certain time. A specific type of intellectual 
property theft involves counterfeiting, which Chapter 8 will explore.
Intellectual property protection is taken seriously, perhaps even for 
granted, in developed countries. The United States views intellectual 
property protection to be so important that the Constitution addresses 
this topic specifically in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8. Intellectual prop­
erty protection in the U.S. Constitution includes three kinds of intellec­
tual property: patents, copyrights, and trade secrets. IP rights have since 
expanded to include trademarks. The Founding Fathers hardwired the 
importance of IP protection directly into the U.S. DNA.
Unfortunately, perspectives about the importance of protecting intel­
lectual property differ widely worldwide. In fact, many social and legal 
topics are viewed differently from culture to culture, including what 
defines a normal workweek, child labor, environmental standards, treat­
ment of women, and safe workplaces. Bribery, which some quaintly refer 
to as facilitating payments, and reciprocity, while both illegal in the United 
States, are often not illegal overseas.
While reliable figures are next to impossible to calculate, intellectual 
property theft costs U.S. companies anywhere from $80 billion to $250 bil­
lion annually, a figure that rises dramatically when calculating IP theft 
from a worldwide perspective. Some argue that these figures are even too 
conservative since IP theft, particularly when it includes counterfeiting, 
involves many hidden costs. What are the costs to individuals and society 
from fraudulent pharmaceutical products that harm patients? Precise fig­
ures are hard to come by since those that steal intellectual property are not 
too open about the scope of their activities.

80  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Various studies have concluded that while intellectual property viola­
tions occur in many countries, the Chinese are clear offenders. A report by 
AMR Research (now part of Gartner) involving 130 international compa­
nies identified China as the “winner” in 9 of 15 risk categories, including 
intellectual property infringement, supplier and internal product quality 
failure, and security breaches. India earns top or second-­place ranking in 
9 of 12 problem areas. 13 Overall, earning the first or second spot in almost 
every problem area is a dubious distinction here. A major aerospace OEM 
is so concerned about intellectual property theft that its employees are not 
allowed to take electronic devices that store information into China when 
they visit on business trips. The company has also decided not to establish 
an R&D facility in the country, even though China is an emerging aero­
space center. Chapter 12 will talk about macro country risk indicators.
The search for new markets and lower costs, particularly in emerging 
countries, forces supply chain managers to put more effort into protecting 
their firm’s intellectual property. A fairly robust set of suggestions relates 
to protecting against intellectual property risk.
Develop Contracts. It is always a good idea to have a written and signed 
document that describes the expectations of the buyer and seller. This 
does not have to look like a U.S. contract. True international contracts 
exist if they adhere to the Convention on the International Sale of Goods 
(CISG), which the United States has signed. Be sure to perform a thorough 
reference check of prospective suppliers before entering a contractual 
agreement. And be sure the contract contains a well-­written nondisclo­
sure clause.
Limit Exposure to High-­Risk Countries. Advanced, industrial coun­
tries will have legal systems that can be trusted to treat foreign companies 
fairly, including the protection of intellectual property. On the other hand, 
developing countries may not offer effective legal protection against intel­
lectual property violations. While we have a good idea about the worst 
offenders, we often disregard this information. If nothing else, knowing 
where the potential trouble spots are located can result in greater caution.
Register Trademarks and Patents. A piece of advice here is to transliter­
ate your language into foreign characters to avoid embarrassing mistakes 
or usage by other parties. Transliterating means to represent or spell in the 
character of another alphabet. Although transliterating is not always easy, 
the process is critical to avoid infringement.
A second piece of advice is to move quickly to foreign trademark offices. 
In the United States, the first entity to use a trademark commercially owns 

Strategic Risk  •  81
the trademark. In China, the first to file the trademark owns that trade­
mark. Speed is of the essence or else you might wake up to find someone 
else owning your trademark. Run, don’t walk, to the trademark office. 
And be sure to retain a good trademark and patent lawyer.
A related concept to trademarks is something called trade dress. Trade 
dress, a form of intellectual property, is a legal term of art that generally 
refers to characteristics of the visual appearance of a product or its pack­
aging that signifies the source of the product to consumers. Trade dress 
protection is intended to protect consumers from packaging or appear­
ance of products that are designed to imitate other products, or to prevent 
a consumer from buying one product under the belief that it is another.14 
Registering a trade dress is a risk management approach for battling copy­
cats and illegal knock-­offs. According to one entrepreneur, “This [trade 
dress] is proving more effective than a patent because it falls under the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act. There is no debate. Either they [copycat 
websites] have to remove it [my product] from the Internet and stop selling 
it or Google will shut them down.”15
Divide Requirements. Another way to protect intellectual property is to 
disaggregate purchase requirements among several suppliers rather than 
providing a single supplier with access to an entire design. No single entity 
gets to see the big picture. Unfortunately, this approach clearly has the 
potential to increase costs, which begins to defeat the purpose of sourcing 
in emerging countries.
Establish Proprietary Assets in a Foreign Country. Some companies 
choose to establish operations in a foreign country or form a joint ven­
ture with a foreign partner, usually for the purpose of greater control. This 
may not be a realistic option for smaller companies or when sourcing raw 
materials or components. Rather, this is a more likely option when out­
sourcing finished products. Something that works against this option is 
reluctance by the finance types to take on new capital assets.
Seek Legal Support and Remedies. Legal experts can help identify pre­
ventive measures as well as legal remedies when intellectual property vio­
lations occur. These experts can also help develop contract language and 
nondisclosure agreements that address intellectual property protection, 
including the jurisdiction to resolve disputes. Legal groups can also help 
with the filing and protection of patents, trademarks, and copyrights out­
side a home country.
Some companies have taken an aggressive stand by pursuing IP violators 
wherever they exist. This strategy is both expensive and time consuming. 

82  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
However, pursuing offenders can be an effective way to deter IP theft, par­
ticularly if a company has the support of a foreign country and an objec­
tive court system to back these efforts. It might also be good to earn a 
reputation as a company not to cross paths with.
Work with Trusted In-­Country Representatives. A major risk inter­
nationally is not having a local representative that protects your interests. 
This representative, who should be intimately familiar with the region 
where business will occur, works in conjunction with a company’s pur­
chasing or sales office. Many smaller companies have found that using a 
trusted local representative is essential for protecting intellectual property.
Use International Purchasing Offices. Almost always staffed by a local 
staff, international purchasing offices can provide an invaluable in-­country 
presence. These offices perform an array of tasks and services for the home 
office, including the evaluation of potential suppliers and an assessment 
of the supplier’s willingness to respect intellectual property. The interna­
tional purchasing office can also maintain a list of suppliers to avoid.
Move Production Back Home. Reshoring means bringing work back to 
a home country, usually due to economic factors, quality considerations, or 
the need to protect intellectual property. In the United States any reshor­
ing that occurs is largely from China back to North America. Several U.S. 
companies have also closed facilities in Canada and Europe and shifted 
work back to the United States, although not because of intellectual prop­
erty issues. For a variety of reasons, and beyond the scope of our discussion 
here, China is becoming less attractive as a sourcing location. A secondary 
benefit of reshoring, which occurs largely because of economic consider­
ations, is to minimize the risk of intellectual property theft.
As this discussion shows, a variety of options are available that can pre­
vent and mitigate risk due to intellectual property violations. Chapter 8 
will expand on this topic by addressing fraud, corruption, counterfeiting, 
and theft.
WHEN STRATEGIC RISK BECOMES STRATEGIC REALITY
Supply chain risk managers and academics will be discussing the following 
case of strategic risk for many years. Anyone who is familiar with Class 8 
(heavy-­duty) trucks knows that Navistar has historically been a premier 
brand in that industry. A failed technological bet by Navistar’s (former) 

Strategic Risk  •  83
CEO has caused this once proud company to lose its luster. This case high­
lights the perils of strategic risk at its finest, or at its worst, depending on 
your perspective.16 It is also an example of how a relatively small matter 
escalated into a near-­death company experience. As if the technology fail­
ure was not enough, the company has also faced serious accounting issues 
with its auditor and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
To understand what went wrong, we have to step back in time. During 
2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency introduced sweeping 
new air quality regulations for diesel engines, requiring an eventual 90% 
reduction by 2010 in the amount of nitrogen oxide and soot these engines 
produced. New regulations even required a reformulation of diesel fuel to 
reduce its sulfur content. The total cost to industry of meeting these new 
regulations was estimated to be over $4 billion.
While these regulations may be daunting, this industry is no stranger 
to new regulations. The question became how to achieve these reductions? 
Truck makers had available to them at least three technological paths they 
could follow—two that were proven but still needed refinement and one 
that was in early stages of development. The proven technologies, which 
Navistar’s competitors eventually adopted, included nitrogen oxide adsorb­
ers (also called “traps”) and a chemical treatment system called selective cat­
alytic reduction, a system favored by European producers. Navistar’s CEO, 
who had a reputation as a risk taker, decided to pursue an unproven tech­
nology. Navistar’s engineers simply had to perfect the system, something 
that proved frustratingly elusive. And for whatever reason, the company 
neglected to develop a Plan B in the event the riskier path proved unworkable.
Navistar eventually committed $700 million, as well as its corporate 
reputation on exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), a technology that had lim­
ited application in engines. While other approaches eliminate nitrogen 
oxide by the use of a bulky chemical treatment system that requires an 
extra tank of fluid after treatment, EGR is radically different. With EGR 
the motor circulates exhaust gas back into the engine cylinders to burn the 
exhaust again, resulting in a cleaner, cheaper, lower-­maintenance solution. 
Instead of simply meeting new environmental regulations, Navistar saw a 
way to differentiate its engines through the use of a radical new technology.
Navistar’s competitors eventually outfitted their engines with a European-­
proven technology that relies on a catalytic converter and chemicals to break 
nitrogen oxide into nitrogen and water, an approach that has become the 
industry standard. The bottom line is that Navistar’s engineers could not 
make EGR technology work, something that became painfully obvious 

84  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
around 2008. Even after Navistar’s technical people informed the CEO they 
did not know how to make this technology work, he would tell them they 
had to come through and that he did not accept negative thinking. After a 
court eventually refused to allow Navistar to sell engines that failed to meet 
emission requirements, the company was forced to redesign its heavy trucks 
and engines while it still had the money to do so. In the interim, Navistar 
announced a deal to purchase engines and emission technology from 
Cummins that would enable its trucks to conform to EPA requirements.
This case illustrates how a company that spent decades building a world-­
class brand can lose brand equity and market share quickly. That, unfortu­
nately, is the nature of strategic risk, which is why it is called strategic risk. 
A second lesson is that while thoughtful risk taking can be a good thing, 
risk taking without a backup plan is not recommended. When the stakes 
are high, make sure Plan B can be rolled out quickly. And finally, the corpo­
rate culture created by the CEO contributed to even greater risk exposure. 
According to one Navistar executive, the CEO “made it abundantly clear 
that anyone who disagreed with him was being negative to the point people 
figured it would be a career killer to point out problems in achieving it.”
Navistar is paying dearly for this misplaced bet, although the company 
is slowly recovering under its new CEO. Financially the company has 
experienced declines in heavy-­duty truck sales and higher costs due to 
engines that do not meet EPA standards.17 What started as a way to gain 
competitive advantage almost destroyed an American icon. And how is 
the CEO doing that was behind this failure? He retired in August 2012 
after receiving a $7.9 million payout, stock options, and other payments 
and benefits. Not a bad return for betting the farm—and losing.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Without question strategic risk is the risk category that aligns historically 
with enterprise risk. To some it represents the ultimate risk category—one 
that has the potential to bring an entire company to its knees. Unfortunately, 
supply chain risks are increasingly becoming part of the domain known 
as strategic risk. And that is a level of recognition that should not be that 
welcome. When supply chain risks become strategic risks, the life of sup­
ply chain managers is only going to become more difficult.

Strategic Risk  •  85
Summary of Key Points
•	 Whatever definition of the word strategic is used, all tie into the 
notion that something is strategic if it has the ability or potential to 
affect the integrated whole, which means affecting an entire business 
or its continuity.
•	 Strategic risks are those risks that are most consequential to an orga­
nization’s ability to execute its strategy, achieve its business objec­
tives, and build and protect value.
•	 Supply chain risks are increasingly making the list of enterprise 
risks, something that makes supply chain risk management a grow­
ing concern to executive management.
•	 The biggest improvements in product development are the result of 
a well-­defined set of practices including concurrency, early involve­
ment, the use of information technology, linking R&D to product 
development, target pricing, subtle control, and Design for X.
•	 While integrated product and process development is well under­
stood, the integration of supply chain risk management and new 
product development is not. The convergence of product develop­
ment and risk management is an evolving practice that aligns well 
with the quality principles of prevention and quality at the source.
•	 External intelligence consists of the data, information, and knowl­
edge that come from outside a company, including macroeconomic 
changes, legal and regulatory changes, industry trends and changes, 
supplier and competitor actions, social and labor force trends, cus­
tomer expectations, technology innovations, and risk factors. A lack 
of external intelligence clearly increases strategic risk.
•	 A concept related to external intelligence is EIQ, or external intel­
ligence quotient. EIQ represents how well a firm collects, assesses, 
and acts upon relevant external data, information, and knowledge.
•	 International supply chains present a new set of risks compared with 
domestic supply chains. One area where this is of particular concern 
is the protection of intellectual property. Intellectual property falls 
into two main areas—industrial property and copyright.
•	 The search for new markets and lower costs, particularly in emerg­
ing countries, forces supply chain managers to put more effort into 
protecting their firm’s intellectual property.

Hazard Risk
In July 2011, a tsunami off the coast of Japan caused human tragedy on an 
almost unimaginable scale, killing thousands and rendering almost a mil­
lion people homeless. Also in July, flooding in Thailand forced the closure 
of 9,800 factories and left more than 660,000 people unemployed. An 
untold number of people around the globe were impacted by this natural 
disaster, both personally and economically. In the automotive industry, 
approximately 6,600 autos were not built per day. In the camera indus­
try, Nikon’s net loss of sales equaled $786 million, while Canon experi­
enced over $600 million in losses. With over 45% of all computer hard 
drives produced in the affected area, many computer manufacturers had 
to delay product launches, which resulted in lost sales and a doubling of 
hard drive prices.1 Unfortunately, examples of hazard risks are not hard 
to come by.
Hazard risk pertains to random disruptions, some of which involve acts 
of God. Additionally, hazard risk has traditionally involved liability torts, 
property damage, and natural disasters. In this chapter, we will address how 
corporations mitigate hazard risk, whether it’s a natural disaster, fire, mali­
cious behavior, product tampering, theft, or acts of terrorism. The chapter 
will cover definitions, options, and variants of traditional and emerging 
global disruption insurance products. Later chapters will present other tools 
and approaches that support the effective management of hazard risk.
THE TRADITIONAL WORLD OF HAZARD RISK 
AND INSURANCE
With global supply chains expanding to support growth initiatives, 
many companies are entering into indemnity and other types of partner 

88  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
agreements in an effort to mitigate risk through risk pooling, sharing risk, 
and disruption insurance. Insurance may not be the total solution to miti­
gating risk within this category, but many new and improved business and 
trade disruption insurance products and services are emerging every day.
Before we move into definitions, options, and variants of risk transfer 
packages, we’ll begin with a glimpse into the landscape of this traditional 
risk mitigation arena. We’ll use Figure 5.1 as a reference point for our 
entire chapter discussion. This figure includes three columns. From left to 
right are the risks, the types of coverage, and finally the triggers or drivers 
behind traditional hazard event mitigation insurance.
The first risk in Figure 5.1 is credit risk. The trigger event is normally 
payment default, and the coverage is normally geared toward mitigating 
for insolvency or protracted default by a partner or customer. Next are 
political risks. The trigger events here are normally sovereign debt default 
or asset loss and coverage that revolves around contract frustrations and 
expropriation. Within the insurance coverage area for political risks, 
contract frustration tends to revolve around corporate loans, the lenders’ 
interest, or project financing of equity and debt. Also within this coverage 
area, the bulk of expropriation revolves around fixed investments (equity) 
and possibly mobile assets, such as stocks.
Continuing down the left side of Figure 5.1 is property risk. The trig­
gers in this category are physical damage or loss and additional perils

or hazards that are catastrophic. Coverage works to mitigate property 
replacement, a loss of profit, expedited and continuing expenses, and a 
contingent loss. Next is trade disruption. How is trade disruption different 
from property or business interruption? It’s a bit broader in nature, such as 
the Thai floods that may prevent the delivery of key equipment or supplies. 
Thus, with trade disruption solutions in place, customers can attempt to 
recover lost profits, and potentially expedited and continuing recovery 
expenses and contingent expenses as well. And finally, we have logistic 
risks. The trigger events are straightforward, such as physical loss or dam­
age while in transit. Coverage works for goods in transit anywhere in the 
world and especially for customs delays beyond a company’s control.
As our discussion moves forward within this traditional risk industry, it 
is appropriate to provide a few additional terms and definitions:2
•	 Hazard—a game of chance; a source of danger; a chance event or accident
•	 Liability—the quality or state of being liable; pecuniary obligations
•	 Liable—obligated according to law or equity; exposed or subject to 
some adverse contingency or action
•	 Tort—a wrongful act for which a civil action will lie, except one 
involving a breach of contract
The following summarizes various kinds of supply chain insurance 
coverage.
First-­Party Commercial Property Insurance
This is by far the most common form of coverage, which includes business 
interruption coverage. It typically reimburses the insured for profits that it 
would have earned had it not suffered a business interruption. The cover­
age normally pays for lost profits resulting from some type of interruption 
in the supply chain. The insured does not necessarily have to suffer an 
actual loss within its enterprise or supply chain. This was evident dur­
ing the Thai floods. Many manufacturing buildings were not inundated 
during the flood. However, the entrance and exit for almost all the facili­
ties built in the 100-mile flood plain were not accessible, and only a small 
amount of material got into and out of the facil­ities, subsequently affect­
ing downstream contractors and original equipment manufacturers. Be 
aware that some policies only cover losses due to disruptions at the facility 

90  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
of a “direct” supplier or customer. This implies only first-­tier suppliers 
or direct customers. Coverage within this solution should be thoroughly 
evaluated by the insured and perhaps their insurer on a regular basis.
Cargo Insurance
This coverage is common considering the vast amount of goods that are 
transported. It covers damage to or theft of the goods while in transit via 
air, ground, or water. For one example, containerization has grown expo­
nentially due to global trade growth across all industries as well as the 
development of megaships that can move thousands of containers at a 
time. One of the most frequent claims involving containers involves theft, 
with an estimated $30 billion in losses being reported annually over the 
last several years. This coverage protects goods on ships, on trains, at air­
ports, and virtually anywhere goods are in transit.
Cyber Insurance
Cybercrime is increasing in frequency and is a growing concern for supply 
chain managers, CIOs, and CFOs around the globe. Why? Because when 
a company’s IT system is down, the company is not taking orders, making 
products, shipping products, or billing customers. In short, the company 
is not functioning. That constitutes a disruption. And let’s not forget the 
seemingly endless stories of cybertheft.
This form of coverage is still in its infancy but has been used already 
with high-­profile incidents with retail and consumer goods companies. 
The key to reviewing this type of risk coverage is to not only consider 
the impact on the insured organization, but also the impact on suppliers, 
customers, and their customers. These insurance packages will grow in 
stature and complexity for many years to come.
Business Interruption Insurance
According to the American Insurance Association, business interruption 
coverage is part of broader commercial insurance policies.3 This coverage 
is most commonly found in commercial property insurance policies and is 
triggered when one of more of the following conditions are met: First, physi­
cal damage to the premises is of such magnitude that the business must 
suspend its operations. Second, the physical damage to property caused by a 

Hazard Risk  •  91
loss is covered under a company’s insurance policy, and that damage totally 
or partially prevents customers or employees from gaining access to the 
business. And third, the government shuts down an area due to property 
damage caused by a peril covered by the company’s insurance policy that 
prevents customers or employees from gaining access to the premises.
Something to keep in mind is that business interruption coverage is 
limited. After a mandatory waiting period, coverage provides for lost net 
income, relocation expenses to a temporary site, and ongoing expenses 
such as payroll. Coverage is available only for as long as it is necessary to 
get a business running again, usually not longer than 12 months.
Contingent Business Interruption Insurance
According to Zurich Insurance, contingent business interruption (CBI) 
insurance “reimburses a company for lost profits and other possible trans­
ferred risks, such as necessary continuing expenses, due to an insurable loss 
suffered by one or more of its suppliers or customers.”4 Recall that traditional 
business interruption insurance compensates policyholders for losses result­
ing from damage to their own property. Contingent business interruption 
insurance allows a policyholder to transfer certain risk losses to a third party. 
This type of insurance is also commonly referred to as dependent properties 
coverage. Similar to business interruption insurance, CBI is triggered by cer­
tain events such as a direct physical loss or damage to a dependent property 
(supplier or customer), the loss or damage is caused by a covered cause of loss, 
and the loss results in a suspension of operations at a covered location.
Trade Disruption Insurance
Trade disruption insurance protects against lost profits caused by disrup­
tions in the supply chain where there is no physical loss or damage to the 
insured’s or its suppliers’ assets. It normally covers property, marine, and 
political risk. Again, physical loss is not required and the loss does not 
need to be location specific. It normally covers a loss for up to 12 months 
resulting from termination of a project or nondelivery of goods, in areas 
such as loss of profits, extra costs, and expenses. This product normally 
fills gaps in coverage left open by other solutions such as business inter­
ruption or cargo insurance. It also tends to cover losses from political and 
economic exposures such as confiscation, expropriation, or nationaliza­
tion of the insured’s assets.

92  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Also included in trade disruption insurance is a law/­order decree result­
ing in something called selective discrimination—forced abandonment 
of a provider; forced divestiture; and cancelation of licenses, operating 
permits, or concessions. And finally, it tends to cover political violence, 
including war, insurrection, strikes, riots, terrorism, and civil commotion. 
If the insured purchases or produces product overseas and if payments are 
made locally in that country, coverage can include currency inconvertibil­
ity (currency conversion and exchange transfer) that can protect against 
repatriation of profits, dividends, and other remittances.
This product has been well received. It provides many benefits in terms 
of risk mitigation, including immediate protection for emerging markets 
with a global scope of coverage.5
Global Logistics Insurance
A final coverage we’d like to address is global logistics insurance, a deriva­
tion of the cargo insurance profiled earlier. Because most supply chains 
are now global, coverage packages have expanded to insure additional 
threats or points of peril due to worldwide operations. Just as contingent 
business interruption insurance has expanded beyond the original scope 
of regular business interruption insurance, so too has insurance expanded 
to include additional elements and activities within a worldwide supply 
chain. A sample of the additional kinds of global logistic insurance that 
are available includes the following:
•	 Importers and shippers can purchase insurance for cargo and for cus­
toms bonds. A customs bond is a type of insurance that someone who 
is importing goods must have, in which they promise to pay any nec­
essary taxes and obey the rules for importing goods.6
•	 Factories can acquire property/­casualty insurance along with bailee 
liability protection. A bailee is a person or party to whom goods are 
delivered for a purpose, such as custody or repair, without transfer of 
ownership. A bailee possesses property that belongs to someone else.
•	 Freight forwarders and shipper’s interests can be covered along with 
the availability of cargo, bailee liability protection, and professional 
liability protection.
•	 Consolidators can purchase cargo liability for bills of lading and 
warehouse receipts.

Hazard Risk  •  93
•	 Foreign ports and terminal operators can secure coverage for work­
ers’ compensation, terminal operator liability, property coverage, 
and stevedore liability (a stevedore is a person employed or a con­
tractor engaged at a dock to load and unload cargo from ships).
•	 Ocean carriers can obtain hull insurance.
•	 Customs brokers can obtain customs bonds.
•	 U.S. ports and terminals can obtain coverage for stevedore liability, 
operator liability, and property protection.
•	 Trucking companies and rail lines can add motor truck liability, 
shipper’s cargo insurance, and bailee liability protection.
Before we provide additional context into how insurers evaluate and 
quantify the coverage we discussed earlier, we felt it would be beneficial to 
explore the level of underinsured nations exposed to disasters. The Center 
for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) and Lloyd’s of London col­
laborated on a research project to identify insurance coverage associated 
with countries rather than companies.7 The research methodology focused 
on the amount of money spent on insurance premiums, which was then 
subtracted from the expected loss from natural disasters. That outcome 
was then adjusted to account for differences in gross domestic product 
(GDP) levels and then benchmarked as a percentage of the country’s GDP.
This research revealed that 17 countries were “significantly underinsured” 
and that these countries had a combined average annual insurance short­
fall of more than $168 billion. Of the 17 countries on Lloyd’s underinsured 
list, 8 are in Asia. China alone is underinsured by more than $79 billion, 
making it the largest underinsured country in the study. Table 5.1 profiles 
the outcome of the research in terms of the worst underinsured countries 
to the most insured.
This research revealed additional troubling issues as it pertains to 
reviewing natural disasters and their impacts on both businesses and the 
public. The death toll from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was 220,000 
people, but the cost to the insurance industry was only $1 billion. A 
Lloyd’s of London insurance chief executive stated that he hoped this 
research would stimulate a debate on how governments, businesses, and 
the insurance industry manage the risks of a natural catastrophe, particu­
larly on the merits of risk transfer versus the use of public funds to cover 
costs. Lloyd’s made an explicit comparison between how different coun­
tries fund disaster recovery and concluded that countries have drastically 

94  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
different approaches to disaster readiness. The greatest difference is the 
amount of money paid by taxpayers toward each country’s recovery from 
catastrophic events versus funds paid by insurance carriers.

of its objectives. This can be measured in terms of both quantitative and 
qualitative dimensions. Some also refer to this concept as risk tolerance or 
risk propensity, a topic that is well grounded in the financial community. 
Finance experts view risk appetite as reflecting the type of risk that an 
institution or individual is willing to undertake in pursuit of a desired 
financial performance. Calculating a risk appetite in financial terms is 
what the insurance industry calls a risk quantification engagement. This 
engagement is a key element of the insurance industry’s approach to decid­
ing whether a client has too much or not enough insurance based on an 
assessment of that company’s risk tolerance, risk policies, and programs.
This section of the chapter discusses what a typical quantification 
engagement looks and feels like and the outcome from those types of 
assessment projects. The integrated insurance cycle includes an “as-­is” or 
risk quantification, leading to a potential new set of insurance solutions, 
possibly through stress testing, then an execution phase, and finally an 
operational mapping and risk identification phase. For purposes of illus­
tration, we’ll concentrate on the first phase, which is risk quantification.
The backdrop to this engagement normally begins with an internal dia­
logue, sometimes driven by the chief risk officer or the CFO’s office, revolv­
ing around the question of enterprise risk exposure and the review of total 
insurable values. This dialogue pits the total insurable values against the 
amount of interruption and other insurance coverage the company has in 
place. The dialogue is basically driven by whatever discipline or depart­
ment is responsible for enterprise risk management.
The initial in-­house meeting usually moves quickly into a set of ques­
tions of discovery such as, Is there a difference between our reporting 
values to our underwriters and our reporting exposures to management? 
The dialogue should cover additional points such as, What is our present 
premium expense? What are our present policy limits and sublimits? Have 
all our exposures been identified? These exposures are generally discussed 
and can address areas such as a company’s global markets, divisions, 
products and services, facilities within the supply chain, the supplier base, 
IT systems, and intellectual property. The discussion then migrates into 
additional executive questions such as, What does our business continuity 
plan (BCP) look like? Have we exercised our BCP, and if we have, how did 
it play out? Do we need to update our BCP? When these questions have 
been answered, the CFO’s office or a divisional controller might make the 
injection that an existing insurer or another third party should be brought 

96  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
in to provide a risk quantification analysis. When that decision is made, 
the as-­is portion of a risk quantification engagement commences.
The complexion of a typical risk quantification engagement often 
involves a kickoff meeting with executives from several disciplines or divi­
sions. The meeting objectives and agenda are not at all trivial. In fact, this 
process can be quite complex. This process, starting at the kickoff meet­
ing but extending into subsequent meetings and assignments, will involve 
a review of existing insurance coverage across an enterprise or division, a 
review of product sales and margins through forensic accounting of profit-­
and-­loss statements, a discussion of new products and services and for­
ward marketing strategies for the next several years, and the identification 
of products or portfolios with the highest contribution and risk.
This part of the quantification process should include what-­if scenar­
ios to stress test a company’s operational processes. Frequent meetings 
occur to report on evaluations and recommendations. Risk quantifica­
tion engagements can take anywhere from 8 to 15 weeks, based on the 
scope and scale. A divisional analysis will invariably be shorter than an 
enterprise-­wide analysis.
The focus again is normally to first establish a maximum foreseeable loss 
(MFL) for the division or enterprise. The MFL equals the worst scenario 
from the what-­if scenarios. The typical MFL includes five key components: 
the products’ contribution margin, existing mitigation plans, finished 
or work-­in-­progress inventory, tax impacts, and expected continuing 
expenses for the duration of a loss.
Upon agreement on and analysis of the MFL definitions, the next step 
in the engagement is normally the detailed examination of a plant, a divi­
sion with all its facilities, or the entire enterprise. For illustration purposes 
we’ll discuss an engagement involving a division with several facilities. 
We’ll use Figure 5.2 as a reference to describe the basic elements of a risk 
quantification engagement.
The basic steps are exercised for every fixed asset in the project, which 
Figure 5.2 illustrates. Let’s take a more detailed walk through this figure:
	
1.	Calculation of value-­at-­risk (VAR) first takes place. This is normally 
the annual profits for the asset or division under scrutiny.
	
2.	A primary backup plan or site is usually identified if the asset is a 
plant or a contractor. This backup plan tends to reduce the over­
all VAR.

Hazard Risk  •  97
	
3.	Any additional backup facilities identified will further reduce 
the VAR.
	
4.	Any contract penalties for service delays for existing and future cus­
tomer contracts are identified and will potentially increase the VAR.
	
5.	Any continuing expenses during the recovery period are identified, 
codified, and assigned to the overall VAR.
	
6.	Any tax impacts are calculated based on the time-­to-­recovery (T-­t-R) 
metric identified in the business continuity plan or scenario plans, 
which will also increase the VAR.
	
7.	Any inventory in the pipeline and supply chain will reduce and miti­
gate the VAR during the T-­t-R period.
	
8.	Any new mitigation strategy costs to be incurred will increase the 
overall VAR.
	
9.	Finally, on the far right of Figure 5.2 is the final mitigated VAR for 
that particular asset or product or division.
As the quantification project plays out, the ultimate goal is to identify 
what the maximum foreseeable loss might be, compare that to the risk 
appetite or tolerance of the organization based on their present level of

insurance coverage, and decide if it’s prudent to increase coverage or 
reduce coverage.
The output of this engagement is illustrated in Figure  5.3. The risk 
levels are articulated on the left or Y axis, low to high, and the nodes or 
assets within the scope of the project are identified on the X axis. The 
units of measure normally used in these engagements are either annually 
demonstrated profits or planned annual budgeted profits going forward. 
There are normally two pillars for each node or asset. The first pillar, or 
the darker shaded one, is the unmitigated exposure or VAR. Unmitigated 
risk, in insurance terms, generally means that the profit plan for this par­
ticular asset has no risk response plan, as the insurance investigators see 
it, in the event of a disruption and is therefore at risk. The second pillar, 
the lighter shaded one, is the mitigated exposure or VAR. Again, in insur­
ance terms, this column represents the mitigated exposure for this asset, 
which normally means a risk response plan has been developed to ensure 
that profits continue in the event of a disruption and is supported by some 
type of insurance coverage. Both columns profile the profit exposure and 
neither eliminate risk. However, the lighter shaded, mitigated columns 
depict a reduced exposure to risk for the organization. The line passing 
horizontally across the entire graph is the present property, tort liability,

continuity business interruption, and other insurance coverage the com­
pany maintains at the time of the quantification risk engagement.
The final, difficult portion of these engagements is to discuss what prod­
ucts, services, plants, or divisions have an exposure above the coverage 
line or risk appetite line. The insurance industry regularly uses the term 
risk appetite to denote the amount of insurance coverage a company has 
paid for to recoup losses or damages, based on the risks the company sees 
and how aggressive they want to be in terms of taking risks and support­
ing those risks with mitigation plans and insurance. As seen in Figure 5.3, 
when exposure or VAR lies above the coverage of risk appetite line, that 
situation drives the dialogue between the organization and its insurer or 
consultancy in an attempt to decide on the next steps. Those next steps 
normally include spending time and funds to develop more robust miti­
gation policies, procedures, and programs or increasing coverage to miti­
gate the exposure and risk. A company can also elect to assume some risk 
through self-­insurance. And finally, scanning Figure 5.3 and viewing the 
differences in column heights, we’ll attempt to provide a brief explanation 
in the context of these quantification tools and techniques.
The difference in column heights, which is profit exposure or VAR, per 
asset, is the difference between VAR exposure identified without or with 
risk mitigation strategies in place by the company. For instance, for Plant 1, 
there is obviously a set of mitigation plans in place to be used in the event 
that the plant is disrupted, because the lighter shaded column (mitigated) 
has much less VAR or exposure than the dark or unmitigated column. 
When the insurance experts complete the engagement, they calculate the 
total company VAR or exposure versus the amount of insurance cover­
age the company maintains at the time of the engagement and use the 
horizontal line to “make a point” about what assets have more VAR or 
exposure than the amount of insurance coverage. The bottom line of a risk 
quantification engagement is to discern whether a company has too much 
or not enough insurance based on the risks identified, mitigation plans in 
place and the company’s risk appetite, which is indicative of their existing 
coverage level.
Outcomes from this type of financial risk quantification engagements 
and the benefits tend to be as follows:
•	 The calculation of maximum foreseeable losses
•	 A root cause analysis that highlights risk exposure

100  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
•	 A definitive picture of risks and a compelling reason to act to either 
mitigate those risks, temporarily or permanently, by buying more or 
less insurance, better prepare for disruptions or other risks, or con­

•	 Assistance in obtaining capital funding for building redundancy 
and resiliency within the supply chain
•	 A positive restructuring of the insurance portfolio
LOOKING AT THE THAI FLOODS THROUGH 
A RISK QUANTIFICATION PRISM
Let’s finish this chapter by revisiting the floods in Thailand that were men­
tioned at the start of the chapter, looking through the prism of risk quan­
tification of what insurers might have recommended if they were asked to 
review the supplier base by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 
First, let’s focus on the event itself. The disaster followed with precision the 
four stages of a disaster, which are denial, severity, blame, and resolution.
During the denial phase, several days after the event, the media were 
told that minor disruptions would occur due to logistical issues. Aside 
from that, business would continue thanks to inventory in the supply 
chain. Next, about a month later the media began to hear and report on 
the severity of the situation. It became evident that industries would see 
supply shortages cause by the destruction of the work-­in-­progress inven­
tory at the time of the event.
In the next phase, the media heard about blame as industries faced 
further shortages due to reduced production capacity as a result of pro­
duction assets destroyed, factories being unable to restart due to power 
supply limitations, or a lack of raw materials from their own suppliers. 
Finally, industry members were saying after six months from the initial 
event that we would see further constraints while destroyed assets and 
factories got repaired or replaced and new capacity came online. This is 
the resolution phase.
What was going on during this event behind the scenes? Firms directly 
hit by the supply disruption were frantically canceling orders and attempt­
ing to book orders from alternate suppliers. Unfortunately, manufacturing 
capacity was already scarce before the event. And, qualifying and testing 

Hazard Risk  •  101
parts from new suppliers is time and resource intensive. Many alternate 
suppliers identified after the flood were, unfortunately, also located in 
the same flood plain region of Thailand (Chapter 12 will discuss the dark 
side of these industrial clusters). Furthermore, manufacturing yield and 
quality with new suppliers proved not to be the same as with qualified, 
incumbent suppliers. The inevitable outcome from this scarcity of supply 
was a dramatic increase in prices across a range of industries.
With the benefit of hindsight, what could insurers or consultancy 
organizations have done if they were asked to exercise a risk quantifica­
tion engagement? Prior to the event, insurers or risk consultants would 
have exercised a risk identification, an as-­is analysis, and a quantification 
engagement. They would have performed a thorough evaluation of the 
supply base and would have seen the exposure in terms of capacity, asset 
liability, and especially the geography and location of the entire industry 
supplier base.
As the event unfolded, the OEMs, at the insistence of their risk experts, 
could have rapidly activated a previously tested business continuity plan, 
which would have included secondary suppliers identified through the risk 
quantification exercise. Presumably, these suppliers would be located out­
side the impact zone. These companies would have also leveraged certain 
articles inside their newly purchased contingent business interruption and 
trade disruption insurance coverage packages that emanated from the risk 
quantification exercise.
After the event the OEMs would also have performed a post-event anal­
ysis and improved their initial risk plans through lessons learned. These 
companies might also have bolstered their mitigation plans and insurance 
coverage as well.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Traditional hazard risk has been with us since the dawn of time and will 
be present until the end of time. One of the best ways, but not the only 
way, to mitigate these risks has been insurance coverage. Many existing 
and emerging packages are becoming available every day. Between the 
coverage instruments and the sophistication of insurers’ risk quantifica­
tion capabilities, it might be wise to consider these mitigation packages 

102  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
and processes on a regular basis as supply chains become more uncertain 
and complex.
Summary of Key Points
•	 Traditional hazard risk pertains to random disruptions, liability torts, 
property damage, and natural disasters that are outside of our control.
•	 Many of these traditional hazards can be mitigated through the pur­
chase of insurance coverage.
•	 Many insurance packages are in existence today that cover risk events 
such as credit, political risk, property, trade disruption, and logistics.
•	 Many of these risk transfer instruments will compensate compa­
nies for loss of profits, supplier insolvency, payment default, contract 
issues, expropriation of assets, property replacement, continuing 
expenses in the wake of a risk event, and damage to or theft of goods 
in transit.
•	 Insurers traditionally utilize a methodology called risk quantifica­
tion to rigorously evaluate a company’s as-­is state of risk exposure 
versus their present amount of insurance coverage in an effort to 
evaluate the company’s risk appetite and then provide insurance rec­
ommendations for action to mitigate those risks.

Financial Risk
If we listen to the “experts,” we might be tempted to believe that anything 
that is not strategic to a business must be outsourced. After all, relying on 
third-­party specialists to support the noncore parts of your supply chain 
is surely better than not relying on specialists. Specialists bring knowledge 
and skills that are difficult to match internally, skills that should result in 
lower costs and reduced risk. What could possibly be wrong with that logic?
That is probably what a U.S. manufacturer was thinking when it decided 
to outsource its freight payments to a third-­party payment vendor. Freight 
payment is the process of applying a set of business rules and fiscal con­
trols around the authorization and payment of invoices for transportation 
services.1 The proper use of a third-­party expert should reduce a com­
pany’s risk as the freight vendor ensures accurate and timely payments are 
made to carriers.
Unfortunately, the payment vendor in this saga began to experience 
serious financial problems that the manufacturer failed to recognize. As 
the manufacturer forwarded consolidated payments to the freight vendor 
for disbursement to transportation carriers, the payment vendor failed to 
process those payments. Instead, the freight vendor used that money to 
help meet its own cash flow obligations. It is not hard to imagine what 
ensued once the financial improprieties became known. Carriers became 
angry due to a lack of payment, and the manufacturer entered what is best 
described as a crisis state. Some carriers even started to send collections 
people after the manufacturing company! Confidence was not restored 
when representatives from the manufacturer visited the freight payment 
vendor’s office and found a For Sale sign in front of it.
Welcome to the world of financial risk management, perhaps the most 
thought about risk category since the financial meltdown of 2008. This 
chapter addresses financial risk by first discussing supplier financial via­
bility and supply market volatility. The majority of this chapter presents 

104  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
approaches for addressing supply chain financial risk, including assessing 
supplier health using financial ratios, bankruptcy predictors, and qualita­
tive risk indicators; assessing customer creditworthiness; financial hedg­
ing; and approaches for managing currency risk. While assessment of 
financial risk is admittedly not the most exciting topic in the world, it is a 
major part of the risk management process.
UNDERSTANDING FINANCIAL RISK
Virtually all supply chain risk events have financial implications. 
Everything that happens within a supply chain eventually ends up on the 
income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow statement. Our interest in 
this chapter is concerned with the kinds of events where the primary and 
immediate effect is financially related. In other words, financial impact is 
the primary rather than subsequent effect. Two major areas that comprise 
financial risk include supplier financial viability and supply market vola­
tility, which the following discusses.
Supplier and Customer Financial Viability
Some observers will attribute the growth in the awareness of supply chain 
risk management to the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. 
However, even though these catastrophic events raised awareness about 
U.S. vulnerabilities, it was not until the financial meltdown of 2008 that 
the shock came to the U.S. system, and even to the world, in terms of 
supply chain risk awareness. At no point since the Great Depression did 
the financial system of the world’s largest economy risk collapsing to the 
extent that we witnessed in 2008.
Extensive research and experience with companies has helped us reach 
several conclusions regarding supplier and customer financial risk analy­
sis. Financial risk analysis is about as far as most companies have pro­
gressed in terms of managing supply chain risk. Unfortunately, financial 
risk is not the only kind of risk present in supply chains. Second, given that 
third-­party data about suppliers and customers is increasingly available, it 
should come as no surprise that most companies begin their supply chain 
risk management journey looking at financial risk of entities within the 
supply chain. Keep in mind that assessing financial strength is necessary 

Financial Risk  •  105
but is not a sufficient enough part of supply chain risk management to be 
the only thing being assessed.
Supply Market Volatility
Another major source of financial risk is the volatility of commodity supply 
markets. The bottom line is that businesses do not like volatility. It makes 
their ability to plan difficult, if not impossible. If you believe that com­
modity price fluctuations have increased over the last decade or so, you are 
right. The size of fluctuations in commodity prices has more than tripled 
since 2005 compared with the period 1980–2005, based on International 
Monetary Fund data. Those who follow supply markets know that when 
demand exceeds supply, the results are allocation of supply, a shifting of 
power from buyers to sellers, and of course financial risk due to higher 
prices. Pricing volatility is a direct cause of increased financial risk.
Why do we have such serious commodity fluctuations today? Unlike 
previous waves of volatility, the current period of fluctuating commod­
ity prices is not driven by a fundamental crisis such as a world war or 
severe depression. The volatility appears to be a structural change in the 
way the global economy has organized itself as only eight countries pro­
duce the majority of the world’s commodities. As demand keeps rising, 
prices are prone to fluctuations—and this, rather than outright scarcity, is 
the major challenge. Other challenges facing commodity markets include 
a willingness of countries (think China here) to manipulate the supply of 
certain resources, water scarcity, climate change, and energy constraints 
that limit output. Mining projects in Chile and Mongolia, for example, 
have been delayed due to energy and water shortages, potentially affecting 
world prices. Nationalization of commodity companies and the confisca­
tion of foreign-­owned assets (such as in Venezuela) are also factors in this 
era of fluctuating prices.2 It has also become evident that industrial buyers 
are not only competing with other companies for commodities today, but 
they are competing with investors who are increasingly looking to com­
modity markets for financial returns.
We can also have volatility simply because abrupt changes or shocks 
occur in the demand or supply side of the commodity equation. We are 
all familiar with stories involving a facility that explodes and takes with 
it a disproportionate amount of the world’s supply of whatever it is that 
facility produces. Most of the time we cannot even pronounce what 
that facility makes. We quickly come to realize, however, the item that just 

106  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
disappeared is a key ingredient that many industries rely on to make their 
products. Recall from Chapter 1 the fire at a German facility that pro­
duces an item called Nylon 12. It quickly became evident after the fire that 
almost all automotive companies use Nylon 12 and that facility produced 
a major portion of the world’s output. Before that explosion, most of us 
could not even spell Nylon 12.
Abrupt shifts can also affect the supply side of commodity markets. 
When a large player or even an entire industry enters a commodity market, 
sometimes for the first time, the result is usually a dramatic shift in the 
demand curve with a lagging shift in the supply curve. The inevitable result 
of this scenario is higher commodity prices. When McDonald’s introduced 
Chicken McNuggets the poultry market became volatile as the demand for 
chickens quickly exceeded the supply of chickens. Simply put, the chickens 
needed some time to catch up with this dramatic demand shift (although 
our sources tell us the chickens put forth a valiant effort). Supply can only 
increase at a certain rate and usually becomes available in “chunks.” The 
following example illustrates what happens when an entire industry shifts 
to a commodity for the first time. The results are usually not pleasant.
A Case Study of Supply Market Volatility
Perhaps one of the best case examples of commodity volatility that creates 
financial and eventually strategic risk involves a relatively unknown ele­
ment called palladium. This is an element with the chemical symbol “Pd” 
and an atomic number of 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery white metal 
discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. More than half of the 
demand for palladium comes from automotive catalytic converters, which 
convert harmful exhaust into less-­harmful substances. It is also used in 
electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applica­
tions, groundwater treatment, and jewelry. Palladium also plays a key role 
in the technology used to develop fuel cells that combine hydrogen and 
oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.3
For years auto companies used platinum for emission control in cata­
lytic converters. In anticipation of tougher emission rules by the U.S. gov­
ernment, auto companies began to design palladium into their pollution 
control equipment. Much to the dismay of other industries that use pal­
ladium, the automotive industry suddenly comprised more than half the 
world’s palladium demand. Besides being more effective at cleaning vehicle 
exhaust, it was also less expensive, at least at the time, than platinum.4 The 

Financial Risk  •  107
end of the Cold War left a large stockpile of inexpensive palladium, par­
ticularly in Russia. (Palladium has military applications.) Unfortunately, 
when an entire industry the size of the automotive industry makes a com­
mon change to a new material, one should not be surprised at the resulting 
shock to the supply market.
As engineers replaced platinum with palladium, the worldwide price of 
palladium became very volatile. As demand accelerated, the price peaked 
at almost $1,100 an ounce in 2002, with each vehicle requiring almost 
one ounce of palladium. As a comparison, 10 years earlier palladium was 
less than $100 per ounce. At this point macroeconomics would suggest 
that high commodity prices would encourage suppliers to provide more 
output, helping to bring supply and demand closer to market equilib­
rium. Unfortunately, a move toward equilibrium did not happen. First, 
the primary supply sources of palladium are Russia and Africa, two areas 
that would not be anyone’s top choices as sourcing locations from a risk 
management perspective. The Russian government, treating the size of its 
palladium stockpile as a state secret, showed a willingness to “delay” the 
release of palladium from its stockpile, thereby creating major supply and 
price disruptions. Also, Western companies were having trouble attract­
ing skilled workers to Africa due to violence and the AIDS epidemic. This 
had a negative effect on that supply market.
Palladium is also somewhat unusual geologically compared with most 
other elements. It is mined with platinum in Russia and with nickel in 
Africa, and the amount of palladium in the ground is proportionally 
less than platinum or nickel. Some would say it is a by-­product of min­
ing other elements. Producers would have to increase their platinum and 
nickel production to increase their output of palladium, which would 
cause the prices of those two elements to plunge if demand for nickel and 
platinum remain steady. While the financial meltdown of 2008 caused the 
per ounce price to fall to almost $200, the price per ounce doubled in 2010 
from around $400 to almost $800 per ounce. Over the last several years 
the price has fluctuated between $500 and $800 per ounce.
GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT MANAGING FINANCIAL RISK
A variety of approaches exist for addressing financial risk across the sup­
ply chain. This is not surprising since corporate insurance, treasury, and 

108  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
investment groups have long thought about risk from a financial perspec­
tive. The following approaches for managing supply chain risk borrow 
heavily from the finance side of the business.
Supplier Financial Health Assessment through Ratio Analysis
A common approach for evaluating a company’s financial situation 
involves ratio analysis. Ratios, also called financial performance metrics, 
simply represent one number divided by another to provide a value that 
is then compared to an industry benchmark, internal historical perfor­
mance, or to other companies, usually in the same industry.
The reasons for calculating and then interpreting financial ratios 
are straightforward. We use supplier financial ratios to manage risk by 
providing insights that financial data simply cannot provide. The ratios 
take financial data and turn that data into value-­added information that 
allows for relatively easy interpretation. Furthermore, ratio analysis, when 
performed on a regular basis, can highlight trends that can be positive 
or negative. Ratios can also be used to determine the relative financial 
strength of a supplier compared with other suppliers in an industry. 
Perhaps most importantly, various tools use financial ratios to predict the 
potential of supplier bankruptcy. The most common bankruptcy predic­
tor, the Z-­Score, is discussed later. Bankruptcy predictors are actually part 
of something called predictive analytics, which Chapter 11 addresses.
Ratios are used at different times. Within the context of supply chain 
risk management, financial ratios are used when—
•	 Evaluating potential suppliers
•	 A purchase requirement involves a significant amount of dollars
•	 Buying items that are critical to the functioning of your business 
or product
•	 Entering into a longer-­term contractual agreement
•	 Conducting regular risk scans of your supply chain
•	 Planning to do business with a supplier where switching options are 
limited when a company starts using that supplier
Financial Ratio Categories. Literally hundreds of financial ratios exist. 
Toss some financial data into a numerator and some into a dominator, add 
a bit of pixie dust, and be prepared to be amazed as a financial ratio magi­
cally appears. The first test of a ratio should be that it tells us something 

Financial Risk  •  109
of importance rather than simply being the result of numbers thrown into 
a formula.
Even though hundreds of ratios exist, they generally fall into one of six 
major categories. It is important to note that not everyone agrees on these 
categories. Some sources present a different mix of categories, sometimes 
omitting the market and growth categories presented here and adding 
ratio categories with names such as solvency, financial efficiency, cash 
flow, and investment valuation ratios. Interestingly, a search of financial 
resources reveals that while overlap exists across some ratio categories, 
total overlap or agreement is rare, if nonexistent. Regardless of the catego­
ries used, each ratio category should answer a specific question or satisfy a 
specific objective unique to that category.
Figure 6.1 presents four ratio categories along with examples of spe­
cific ratios within each category. One major category includes liquidity 
ratios, which help identify if a supplier is capable of meeting its short-­term 
financial obligations. A second major category, activity ratios, includes 
ratios that probe how effectively a supplier is managing its assets. A third

110  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
category is leverage ratios. Ratios in this family evaluate whether the sup­
plier is capable of meeting its debt obligations. 
A popular and widely used group of ratios that almost everyone agrees 
on is profitability ratios. Ratios in this group provide insight into the rate 
of return a supplier is earning. Another category that doesn’t appear in 
Figure 6.1 is market ratios, a set of ratios that indicate how well a sup­
plier is doing compared with market indicators such as price/­earnings and 
shareholder return. A final category, growth ratios (not shown in figure), is 
somewhat different. Growth ratios provide insight into the rate of growth 
over time that is occurring at a supplier. These ratios are often compared 
from one period to another period and require data from multiple periods 
for their calculation, which is not true of the other ratio categories. Taken 
at a specific point in time, growth ratios will not provide much insight.
Obtaining Financial Data. Without question the key to successful 
financial ratio analysis is obtaining reliable data on a timely basis, which 
is easier said than done. One challenge is that many companies use sup­
pliers that are private companies. These companies are under no obliga­
tion to make available the same types of financial documents as required 
by public companies. Second, the growth in global supply chains means 
greater use of international suppliers. It is common knowledge that finan­
cial data in certain parts of the world might not be accurate or accessible. 
The method of using two sets of books, which is unthinkable (and illegal) 
in developed countries is not so unthinkable in other countries. Even data 
about public companies can be problematic. Large companies in partic­
ular will have several if not many operating units and facilities that are 
aggregated into the financial statements. Breaking out specific results can 
be challenging, if not impossible.
In practice, companies should establish a repository that contains infor­
mation from a variety of sources. Internal users should then have easy 
access to this information when they monitor supplier risk. What are 
some sources of supplier financial information? A partial listing includes 
the following:
•	 Company-­published annual reports
•	 Company-­supplied 10-K and 10-Q reports
•	 Dun & Bradstreet reports
•	 Credit reports and bank references

Financial Risk  •  111
•	 Third-­party ratings with an independent firm such as Moody’s
•	 Trade and business journals
•	 Supplier-­provided data
This last item is particularly important. One advantage of working with 
suppliers on a longer-­term basis is the opportunity to share valuable infor­
mation. Furthermore, as relationships and trust evolve, a supplier should 
be more willing to share information with a customer, including insights 
into financial issues that might otherwise not be shared for fear of what 
the customer might do with that information.
Bankruptcy Predictors
With a crisis often comes opportunity, and that is exactly what happened 
after the financial meltdown of 2008. A clear need presented itself for ways 
to assess the financial health of companies that combined sophisticated 
algorithms and financial data. As a result we are witnessing a growing 
number of more third-­party providers offering sophisticated tools for 
assessing company health.
One of the most popular and well-­established tools for assessing finan­
cial health using ratios is the Altman Z-­Score. Developed by Dr. Edward 
Altman of New York University, the Z-­Score combines a series of weighted 
ratios for public and private firms to predict financial bankruptcy. The 
Z-­Score is almost 90% accurate in predicting bankruptcy one year in 
advance and 75% accurate in predicting bankruptcy two years in advance.
The Z-­Score has two attributes that make it a valuable tool for supply 
chain managers. The first is its relative simplicity. Only four ratios are 
needed to calculate the Z-­Score for private firms and five ratios for pub­
lic firms. Furthermore, the Z-­Score can be interpreted with an easy-­to-­use 
red, yellow, and green system. The Z-­Score also provides a single score 
that can be used during the preliminary evaluation of potential suppliers. 
It provides guidance regarding which suppliers to keep or eliminate from 
the selection pool. And, it provides a basis for tracking financial changes 
over time. Supply chain risk managers should calculate supplier Z-­Scores 
at least quarterly. The following are the Z-­Score formulas for private and 
public firms. Notice that a company’s total assets appear in three out of four 
ratios for a private company and four out of five ratios for a public company.

The Z-­Score Illustrated. It is beneficial to not only present the Z-­Score 
methodology but also to illustrate its use. Table 6.1 provides data for three 
suppliers that are competing for a contract to provide a base chemical to a 
pharmaceutical company. For Z-­Score calculation purposes the required 
data for the ratios appears in either the balance sheet or income statement.

The net worth figure is also called shareholders equity in the balance sheet 
for publicly traded companies.5 From an accounting standpoint, working 
capital is defined as the difference between current assets and current 
liabilities. This figure could be negative if a company’s current liabilities 
exceed its current assets. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) could 
also be negative in the calculation. The following illustrates the Z-­Score 
for the suppliers presented in Table 6.1:

•	 Working capital/­Total assets × 1.2 = (($2,165.1 current assets – 
$1,780.6 current liabilities)/($4,938 total assets) × 1.2) = 0.093
•	 Retained earnings/­Total assets × 1.4 = (($1,613.9 retained earnings)/
($4,938 total assets) × 1.4) = 0.457
•	 EBIT/­Total assets × 3.3 = (($6,500 sales – $5,500 cost of goods sold – 
$475 SGA expenses)/($4,938 total assets) × 3.3) = 0.351
•	 Net worth/­Total liabilities × 0.6 = (($1,913.9 Shareholders’ equity)/

•	 Net sales/­Total assets × 1.0 = (($6,500 net sales)/($4,938 total assets) 
× 1.0) = 1.32
From this analysis we conclude that only one of the three suppliers 
Z-­Score is in the green zone, indicating the supplier is financially sound. The 
other two suppliers, while well above the 1.8 Z-­Score threshold value that 
indicates serious financial risk, have some area of concern. For Ninaka the 
net worth/­total assets value is relatively low, while DMV had higher cur­
rent liabilities compared with current assets and a lower EBIT compared to 
total assets. Ideally we would like to have financial data for multiple periods 
so the Z-­Score can be compared against other periods. Trend data almost 
always provides valuable insights that point-­in-­time data cannot.

Financial Risk  •  115
Keep in mind that the Z-­Score is a financial risk indicator; it does not 
tell us if the supplier has adequate capacity or can meet quality or deliv­
ery requirements. Chapter 13 will illustrate a technique for performing a 
rough-­cut supplier capacity analysis using a small set of the financial data 
presented in Table 6.1.
Other Predictive Indicators. It is not reasonable to assume that every 
company has the resources or expertise to evaluate hundreds or even 
thousands of suppliers from a financial risk perspective. It is also not safe 
to assume that financial data about these suppliers will be available or easy 
to obtain. For a variety of reasons buyers will rely on third-­party data to 
support their financial assessment efforts. Two of the more popular pre­
dictive indicators are Rapid Ratings and Dun & Bradstreet.
Rapid Ratings (www.rapidratings.com) provides a comprehensive finan­
cial health assessment of companies. The assessment is a multiple-­part 
report that provides extensive financial data and analysis. The first page of 
the output report is a detailed discussion of a company’s Financial Health 
Rating (FHR), which is a number that ranges from 0 to 100. This also 
includes multiple years of FHR trend data for comparison purposes. The 
subsequent detailed report contains six sections: Section 1 is the execu­
tive summary, Section 2 includes a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) 
analysis, Section 3 reports FHR history and performance category scores, 
Section 4 identifies areas of strength and weakness in relation to other sec­
tor participants, Section 5 is the company’s balance sheet, and Section 6 is 
the company’s income statement.
Dun & Bradstreet (www.dnb.com) offers a suite of risk management 
products offering core and add-­on modules under a broader category 
called Supplier Risk Manager. Two analytic tools are available that use 
predictive scores, including the Supplier Stability Indicator (SSI), a predic­
tor of near term (90–120 days) financial and operational stability and the 
Supplier Evaluation Risk (SER) Rating, which predicts the likelihood that 
a company will obtain legal relief from creditors or cease operations with­
out paying creditors in full over the next 12 months.
Qualitative Supplier Financial Risk Indicators
The financial analysis of suppliers should benefit from a combination of 
quantitative and qualitative assessments. While ratio analysis is a power­
ful tool, the technique still relies on data that are updated infrequently, 

116  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
difficult to obtain, or sometimes unreliable. The following presents a 
checklist that might provide clues that a supplier is struggling from a 
financial perspective6:
•	 A large portion of a supplier’s sales go to customers in depressed 
industries
•	 A supplier cannot meet agreed-­upon lead times because of late pur­
chase order placement for its materials
•	 A supplier is shipping early due to a lack of business
•	 The supplier announces facility shutdowns, closings, and/­or layoffs
•	 The supplier has reduced its investment in R&D, IT, equipment, 
or resources
•	 Unusual turnover occurs at the executive level
•	 The supplier’s payables period is lengthening
•	 Quality is deteriorating
•	 Additional discounts are offered for early payment or payments are 
required in advance
•	 The supplier is restating financial reports and projections
•	 The supplier’s product is labor intensive, requiring large payrolls
•	 The supplier has absorbed up-­front research and development and tool­
ing costs on new products that are delayed in getting to the marketplace
•	 An unusual amount of company stock is being sold by executives
•	 Rumors of problems begin to emerge
While qualitative indicators are not modeled quantitatively like ratios, 
they can still provide valuable insights that financial data and ratio analy­
sis cannot. Like forecasting, which benefits from a combination of quanti­
tative and qualitative approaches, assessments of supplier financial health 
should also benefit from a quantitative and qualitative approach.
Assessment of Customer Creditworthiness
While one end of the supply chain thinks about the financial strength of 
suppliers, the other end thinks about the financial strength of custom­
ers. Effective financial risk management considers both ends of the supply 
chain. Just as assessments of supplier financial viability should routinely 
occur, so too should assessments of customer creditworthiness.

Financial Risk  •  117
The discussion that took place regarding ratio analysis of suppliers from 
a risk perspective is much the same for customers except with different 
objectives. A company evaluates the financial integrity of suppliers with 
the objective of avoiding future supply disruptions due to financial issues 
while it evaluates the financial integrity of customers with the objective of 
ensuring its invoices are paid. The interpretation of the various ratios used 
does not change because a company is a supplier versus a customer.
Similar to supplier financial reports and bankruptcy predictors, risk 
managers can use third-­party data providers to gain insight regarding cus­
tomer creditworthiness. An example includes the Debtor Risk Assessment 
(DRA) score from the Coface Group, a 60-year old company that main­
tains a database of 50 million companies worldwide. Coface calculates a 
DRA from 0 to 10, with each score corresponding to a different category 
of trade risk. The assessment comprises primarily data points based on 
financial ratings, payment incident ratings, and company identity data, 
although the DRA can be adjusted for external shocks to the economy, 
trend behavior, or modifications by senior analyst reviews.
Another example of third-­party customer risk assessments includes a 
suite of three reports available from Dun & Bradstreet. While not specifi­
cally endorsing any particular product, these reports offer a wide range of 
customer information that highlights the kinds of data that are available:
•	 Comprehensive Insight Plus Report. The most comprehensive (and 
expensive) of the three reports, this report provides a business sum­
mary, information about corporate relationships, credit limit rec­
ommendations, public filings, financial statements, payment history, 
D&B ratings, and scores that predict the likelihood of future busi­
ness failure or late payments.
•	 Business Information Report. This report provides essentially the 
same information as the first report except it excludes the scores that 
predict the likelihood of future business failure or late payments.
•	 Credit eValuator Plus. This basic report provides customer payment his­
tory, industry payment benchmarks, and credit line recommendations.
Other applications and services are available from D&B that target cus­
tomer credit risk management. A variety of other sources provide basic 
credit rating scores that can support the development of a credit and 
accounts receivable policy for a customer.

Hedging
Hedging is a financial risk technique that has been practiced for many 
years. What exactly is hedging? Hedging is a risk management strategy 
used in limiting or offsetting the probability of loss from fluctuations in 
the prices of commodities, currencies, or securities.7 In effect, hedging 
is a transfer of risk without buying insurance policies. Hedging employs 
various techniques but basically involves taking equal and opposite posi­
tions in two different markets. One could make a strong argument that 
a longer-­term supply contract that features fixed pricing offers hedges 
against financial risk. Hedging and hedges can take a variety of forms.
Hedging is a best demonstrated practice for removing pricing risk. 
Management must be constantly reminded that hedging is a pricing tool. 
It is used to manage earnings and may result in “lost opportunities” while 
preventing terrible surprises. Let’s be clear about something important—
the motivation behind hedging is risk aversion and not monetary gain. 
If the objective is financial gain, then we are no longer engaged in hedging. 
We are engaged in speculation. Hedging (risk aversion) is not speculating 
(risk taking).
Hedging usually occurs within two broad categories—commodity 
hedging (primarily metals, petroleum, and agricultural futures) and cur­
rency hedging. Futures contracts also cover interest rate and stock index 
futures. Conceptually, hedging involves the purchase and sale of contracts 
in a marketplace where a gain in one contract is offset by a loss in another, 
thereby protecting a specific position.
There are two primary kinds of hedging contracts. The first is called 
futures exchange contracts. These are traded on commodity or currency 
spot market exchanges. They are rigid in structure and are usually settled 
on the third Friday of the contract month. Simply turn to the “Money and 
Investing” section of The Wall Street Journal and find the tables for the 
values of futures contracts looking out into a specified future date (or go 
to wsj.com/­commodities). The second type of hedging contract is called 
forward exchange contracts. These are issued by banks and traded among 
financial institutions. While similar to futures contracts, they are indi­
vidually contracted and provide more flexibility.
Why should a company engage in hedging? Consider the following 
scenario where a company decides not to engage in hedging. An apparel 
company creates a 2016 budget that considers cotton prices at $0.88 per 
pound that reflects the price in September 2015. The company expects 

Financial Risk  •  119
to buy 1 million pounds of cotton in 2016. The 2016 financial plan will 
build in an expectation of $880,000 (1 million × $0.88) for cotton. Now, 
let’s fast-­forward to 2016, when cotton has increased to $1.00 per pound. 
If $1.00 per pound is the average price over the year, this company will 
see its operating income drop by $120,000 ($1 million actual 2016 cot­
ton expenditure less $880,000 budgeted cotton expenditure) compared to 
the budget plan. This company should also expect to see a decline in all 
its financial returns measures. If this company had purchased a futures 
contract at $0.88 per pound, it could have avoided the $120,000 “loss” 
from purchasing the cotton in 2016 prices. Of course, if the price of cotton 
declined to $0.76 in 2016, the company would have foregone a $120,000 
“gain.” But, do not forget that the point of hedging is not to gain or lose. 
It is to provide stability that allows for more effective planning and the 
avoidance of major surprises.
Options. Buyers can purchase a third type of contract called futures 
options. Options allow the holder to exercise the future contract at a pre­
established price or to walk away from that contract. If a commodity mar­
ket shifts in favor of a buyer, which likely means the commodity is lower 
than the futures contract price, the buyer will take advantage of the mar­
ket shift and forego exercising the contract. If the market shifts against 
the buyer, which likely means the commodity price has moved higher 
than the futures contracted price, the buyer will exercise the option at the 
contracted futures price. As your parents probably said, if something 
sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The reality is that purchasing 
options can be quite expensive. This points out once again that in business 
there is no such thing as a free lunch.
Let’s illustrate futures options with a currency example. A buyer orders 
equipment directly from a German company that costs 10 million euros (€) 
with expected delivery in six months. The company can purchase a futures 
option to buy euros in six months at €1 = $1.28. Conversely, $1 = €0.78. The 
cost of the equipment in U.S. dollars is $12.8 million (€10 million × 1.28 or 
10 million / 0.78), which the futures contract locks in.
Now, let’s look at two scenarios and predict what would likely happen. In 
Scenario A, the exchange rate in six months changes to €1 = $1.20, which 
makes the cost of the equipment in U.S. dollars $12 million (€10 million 
× 1.2) at time of delivery. In this case the buyer will likely walk away from 
the futures contract and purchase the euro on the open market, assuming 
the currency savings are greater than the option cost. In Scenario B, the 

120  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
exchange rate changes in six months to €1 = $1.35, which makes the cost of 
the equipment in U.S. dollars $13.5 million (€10 million × 1.35) at time 
of delivery. In this case the buyer will exercise the option to pay with euros 
at the futures contract rate of €1 = $1.28 and “make” $0.07 per euro.
In closing, hedging is a well established but certainly not foolproof way 
to mitigate financial risk. The list of items that cannot be hedged is much 
longer than the list that has active futures markets. This limits where 
hedging can be applied. Furthermore, supply chain managers are strongly 
urged to work closely with finance before even thinking about hedging 
activities. This is one area where specialized finance knowledge is critical. 
Hedging, options, and commodity and currency trading are not for the 
faint of heart or the ill-­prepared.
Currency Risk Management Approaches
Whenever a company engages in international buying or selling, it raises 
the possibility of currency fluctuations that present financial risk. This 
does not always have to be the case. For example, some countries use the 
U.S. dollar as their currency. These are generally not major countries or 
trading partners of the United States. Examples of countries that use the 
dollar are Bermuda, Panama, Ecuador, and El Salvador. The technical term 
for this is dollarization, which occurs when the inhabitants of a country 
use foreign currency in parallel to or instead of the domestic currency as 
a store of value, unit of account, and/­or medium of exchange within the 
domestic economy. The term is not only applied to usage of the U.S. dollar, 
but generally to the use of any foreign currency as the national currency.8 
Currency risk involving countries that use the dollar as their currency is 
essentially nonexistent. Other countries may use the euro as their cur­
rency while others use the Australian or New Zealand dollar, Swiss franc, 
or Indian rupee.
A second scenario involves countries that freely accept a second cur­
rency for transactions in addition to their own currency. There are prob­
ably a dozen or so countries that use the U.S. dollar alongside their own 
currency. This too can have the effect of minimizing currency risk since 
the dollar is an accepted currency.
A third scenario involves countries that peg their currency against a 
specific value of a second currency. This scenario also minimizes risk 
because a country sets or “pegs” its currency to a specific value of another 
currency. These pegged values are usually stable over time. For many years 

Financial Risk  •  121
the Chinese government pegged its currency, the renminbi or yuan, to a 
specific value of the U.S. dollar. It is only fairly recently that the Chinese 
government has allowed its currency to trade a bit more freely. Its trad­
ing band, however, is still tightly controlled by the Chinese central bank. 
Currency risk with countries that peg their currency to a company’s coun­
try currency is fairly small, at least in the short term.
The final scenario, and the one that presents financial risk, occurs when 
one currency freely floats against the value of another currency. This 
means the relative value of a currency could increase or decline relative to 
another currency. While a currency shift could work in a company’s favor, 
it could go also go the other way.
What are some approaches for managing currency risk? The following 
list, while not exhaustive, shows that a variety of methods can be used 
in isolation or in combination with other methods to address currency 
risk issues.
Currency Hedging. The previous section illustrated the use of options 
and currency hedging, so there is no need to repeat that information here. 
Without question, hedging is one of the most common ways to address 
currency risk when engaging in international business.
Purchase in the Home Country Currency. It should come as no sur­
prise that many companies, especially smaller companies, manage cur­
rency risk by avoiding it. One way they do this is to write international 
purchase contracts in the company’s home currency. When this happens, 
the other party assumes the currency risk. How could there possibly be a 
downside to this approach? If you think this approach sounds too good to 
be true, you’re probably right.
The party that accepts the currency risk knows it has taken on this risk. 
And it should come as no surprise that this assumption of risk will likely 
come with a cost. We should expect the party that assumes the risk, par­
ticularly suppliers, to add some factor into their unit price to compensate 
for its risk management costs or exposure.
Offering to assume the currency risk could result in a lower unit cost, 
which has clear financial implications. Do not forget that inventory is 
treated as a current asset on the balance sheet. If the value of that asset is 
being inflated due to currency risk management costs, this will adversely 
affect a wide range of high-­level financial indicators, including return on 
assets and return on invested capital. More advanced companies try to 
take out all the “cost adders” that suppliers include so they can better man­
age these cost elements. As an aside, risk management costs are certainly 

122  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
not the only cost adder or factor that suppliers might include in a purchase 
price. Suppliers might include adders when customers fail to pay invoices 
in a reasonable time or constantly change order quantities.
Sharing Currency Risk. The parties to a contract can agree to share risk 
when currency rates fluctuate. With this approach the responsibility for 
managing currency risks does not fall to a single party. This is a reason­
able approach if the parties to a contract are confident that currency rates 
will remain relatively stable over a specified period or when dealing with 
shorter-­term contracts. The reality is that most currency rates fluctuate at 
slower rates compared with commodities.
Currency Forecasting. Currency forecasting, which should occur regu­
larly, can be performed by corporate finance groups, external third par­
ties, or a combination of the two. The results of the forecasting process 
can affect the degree to which a company engages in currency risk man­
agement. If a forecast predicts minimal shifts in the relative value of one 
currency against another, then a buyer will likely not focus too extensively 
on currency risk as an issue, at least in the short term. Currency shifts that 
are forecasted to be more dramatic or uncertain invite more aggressive 
risk management approaches.
Contract Escape Clauses. A common risk management approach, usu­
ally insisted upon by the legal group, is to have language in a purchase 
contract that allows a party to opt out of an agreement due to currency 
issues. This generally does not happen when the contract is for a piece of 
capital equipment that has a longer lead time. Rather, it is more common 
with contracts that involve repetitive purchases. A supplier would likely be 
reluctant to enter a contract to build and sell a $5 million piece of equip­
ment with the risk that a buyer can simply walk away from the contract 
because of a currency shift.
Currency Renegotiation or Adjustment Clauses. Another approach 
for addressing currency risk is to stipulate when formal currency reviews 
will occur. These reviews are generally triggered in two ways—delivery-­
triggered reviews and time-­triggered reviews. With delivery-­triggered 
reviews, a supplier delivery triggers the currency review, while time-­
triggered reviews happen at specific dates.
Most parties recognize that some normal or accepted currency risk takes 
place when using currency renegotiation or adjustment clauses. Figure 6.2 
illustrates the concept of normal currency risk in a time-­triggered adjust­
ment clause. As long as the value of the Japanese yen to the dollar stays 
within an agreed-­upon bandwidth, in this case 90–102 yen to $1, no 

Financial Risk  •  123
formal review or discussion takes place when a review is triggered. This 
bandwidth represents normal risk that the parties are willing to accept. 
If, however, the relative currency values move outside the accepted band­
width, a formal currency review is triggered. At that point various actions 
might be agreed to by the parties, including currency risk sharing or pos­
sibly even the termination of the contract.
Regardless of the approach used to manage currency risk, it is recom­
mended that supply chain professionals work with their counterparts in 
finance before engaging in any activities that take the supply chain profes­
sional out of his or her comfort zone, something that in itself could lead to 
unnecessary risk.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
While financial risk assessment may be more mature than other risk man­
agement techniques, this does not mean that challenges do not remain or 
that further improvements are not possible. The challenge with any sup­
ply chain technique, including financial assessment techniques, is moving 
beyond first-­tier suppliers. Second-­tier suppliers that suffer a disruption due 
to financial difficulties will soon affect tier-­one suppliers, which will quickly 
affect the operations of your company. If your executive leader­ship assumes 
that there is nothing to worry about because surely your tier-­one suppliers 
take the pulse of their tier-­one suppliers (your tier-­two suppliers), at least take 
comfort in knowing there are countless others who share this same delusion.
Time-Triggered Adjustment Clauses
An annual contract for electronic components is agreed to with a Japanese producer in January.
A currency clause is agreed to that stipulates currency reviews will occur quarterly. Te exchange
rate at the time of signing the contract is 96 Yen = $1.  Te parties have agreed that a band of
normal currency risks is +/– 6%.  Adjustment review dates are April 1, July 1, and October 1.

Summary of Key Points
•	 Supplier financial risk analysis is about as far as most companies 
have progressed in terms of managing supply chain risk.
•	 Given the increasing availability of financial data it should come as 
no surprise that most companies begin their supply chain risk man­
agement journey looking at supplier financial risk.
•	 The size of fluctuations in commodity prices has more than tri­
pled since 2005 compared with 1980–2005 based on International 
Monetary Fund data, making supply market volatility a major con­
tributor of financial risk.
•	 A variety of approaches exist for addressing financial risk across the 
supply chain, which is not surprising given that risk at the corporate 
level has historically been defined largely in terms of financial risk.
•	 The financial analysis of suppliers should benefit from a combination 
of quantitative and qualitative assessments.
•	 A common approach for evaluating a company’s financial situation 
involves ratio analysis. Without question the key to successful finan­
cial ratio analysis is obtaining reliable data on a timely basis.
•	 One of the most popular tools for assessing financial health using 
ratios is the Altman Z-­Score. The Z-­Score is only a financial risk 
indicator; it does not tell us if the supplier has adequate capacity or 
can meet quality or delivery requirements.
•	 A best practice for removing pricing risk is hedging. Conceptually, 
hedging involves the purchase and sale of contracts in a marketplace 
where a gain in one contract is offset by a loss in another, thereby 
protecting a specific market position.
•	 Whenever a company engages in international buying or selling, it 
raises the possibility of currency fluctuations that present financial risk.
•	 A variety of methods are available to help manage currency risk, includ­
ing currency hedging, purchasing in the home country currency, 
sharing currency risk, currency forecasting, contract escape clauses, 
and currency renegotiation or adjustment clauses in contracts.

Operational Risk
Imagine a company that sells some of the hottest products on the planet 
with just a few products representing a disproportionate share of revenues. 
Imagine further that this company has relied on a single Chinese sup­
plier and location to build these products. And imagine even further that 
this Chinese supplier is secretive, often showing an unwillingness to share 
information publicly, particularly about labor problems. If this scenario 
sounds operationally risky (and strategically risky as well), you just fig­
ured out why Apple has made a decision to diversify its supplier base by 
expanding its outsourcing to a second supplier located in Taiwan.
This chapter will discuss the many potential operational failures through 
the prism of the four pillars of supply chain risk—supply risk, demand risk, 
process risk, and environmental risk. We will profile operational risks that 
happen every day in these four areas. We’ll also discuss these risks in the 
context of two basic operation horizons and present a program that tradi­
tionally has been utilized to mitigate and manage operational risks.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
By far, a disproportionate set of supply chain risks will be categorized 
as operational since this category includes internal and external quality 
problems, late deliveries anywhere in the supply chain, service failures due 
to poorly managed inventory, problems related to poor forecasting, and a 
thousand other events related to operational performance failures. This 
section discusses the operational risks that are part of supply risk, demand 
risk, process risk, and environmental risk. The two prevalent horizons 
affecting supply chain risk management are the operational horizon, 

128  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
covering 0–45 days into the future, and the tactical horizon, which nor­
mally covers 1–18 months into the future.
Supply Risk
Referring back to the discussion in Chapter 2 regarding the four pillars 
of supply chain risk, the supply management profession is by far the most 
mature discipline within the supply chain arena when it comes to iden­
tifying, assessing, mitigating, and managing risk. Procurement profes­
sionals have been leveraging techniques to mitigate and manage risk for 
more than 50 years. Let’s briefly identify operational and tactical risks that 
reside within this risk pillar every day. In no particular order, we have sup­
plier lead times, supplier quality, supplier prices, supplier insolvency and 
bankruptcy, supplier delivery issues, fraud, corruption, counterfeit parts 
and components with subtier suppliers, and inbound logistics. To further 
focus our discussion, we’ll classify these risks into supplier, logistics, and 
fraud, corruption, and counterfeiting. Table 7.1 can be used as a reference 
throughout the supply risk discussion.
Supplier Risks. As mentioned, procurement professionals have been 
trained for many years to think about risk and contingencies, probably 
much more so than any other discipline within the supply chain commu­
nity. One of the main reasons is most manufacturers’ cost of raw material 
represents approximately 50%–70% of their total cost of goods sold. That’s 
a huge portion of the total cost of finished products and an abnormally 
large risk element to the organization.
As shown in Table  7.1, the traditional approach to handling sup­
plier risk has been to use buffer inventory or statistically derived safety 
stock to absorb volume shocks or delays or supplier delivery and quality 
issues. One of the traditional techniques many procurement professionals 
have been trained to execute to ensure better pricing and better delivery 
has been placing more and more of their raw material requirements with 
one supplier. This traditional thinking and training was driven by the 
premise that when a company’s purchase requirements become a larger 
portion of a supplier’s order board, that supplier will bend in terms of 
price and do its best to demonstrate solid delivery performance because 
of the risk of losing those orders and volume.
This procurement strategy worked well in a stable environment before 
globalization and supply market volatility. What actually took place is 
many companies got a bit complacent performing their due diligence. 

Operational Risk  •  129
Buyers assumed a bit too much in terms of continued performance and 
found out through disruptions, supplier insolvency, supplier quality issues 
and much more, that relying on one supplier for a major portion of a com­
pany’s purchase needs might not be the best strategy when it comes to 
managing risk across an entire organization.
Logistics Risks. Around the year 2000, during the Internet and e-­business 
boom came the concept of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). IBM was 
a big proponent of this concept within its own supply chain and promoted 
doing what you do best and outsourcing the rest. Why did IBM and many 
other companies embrace this approach to supply chain management?

130  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
One reason was companies found that there were many organizations 
around the globe that could do certain business functions better, faster, 
and cheaper. And at that time, as the Internet was exploding on the sup­
ply chain scene, there was renewed interest in exploiting the World Wide 
Web to collaborate with these new BPO organizations and new partners 
to drive overwhelming top-­line growth.
With that belief,a new industry called third-­party logistics, or 3PLs, was 
born. A quick story about the chemical industry in 2000 will perhaps pro­
vide some context regarding the growth of 3PLs. During this period the 
chemical industry was still vertically (i.e., functionally) aligned in terms of 
supply chain management. There were several reasons that many organi­
zations had not embraced the concept of supply chain management. First, 
many organizations had very good profit margins and did not see the need 
for change. Second, the “chemists” were still running chemical compa­
nies and lacked supply chain knowledge. And third, the chemical industry 
was still an asset-­intensive industry that believed in the benefits of verti­
cal integration.
During this time, a few leading-­edge chemical organizations began 
benchmarking their total logistics costs associated with inbound and out­
bound material delivery as a percent of total sales. The numbers were alarm­
ing. On average, the chemical industry’s transportation costs were more 
than 10% of sales. As the industry benchmarked against other industries, 
it came to the conclusion that while chemical companies were good at 
breaking down hydrocarbons, these companies were not so good at logis­
tics. As a result these companies, like so many in other industries, out­
sourced their logistics to companies that could service their needs at a 
much reduced rate.
If we scan Table 7.1 and view the logistics risks, we’re not saying the BPO 
approach has totally eliminated logistics risk. However, these outsource 
providers have developed many tools and techniques to manage risk for 
their customers. Many of the traditional remedies are still being leveraged 
but by a new industry that tends to have much more experience in global 
trade and has invested in more advanced tools and techniques.
Fraud, Corruption, and Counterfeiting Risks. The European Banking 
Board has developed a set of baseline definitions for their employees and 
their customers to follow. Fraudulent practice means any action or omis­
sion, including misrepresentation, that knowingly or recklessly misleads 
or attempts to mislead a party to obtain a financial benefit or to avoid 
an obligation. Corrupt practice means the offering, giving, receiving, or 

Operational Risk  •  131
soliciting, directly or indirectly, of anything of value to influence improp­
erly the actions of another party.1 Counterfeiting occurs when something 
is made in imitation so as to be passed off fraudulently or deceptively as 
genuine.2 This portion of supplier risk is far too large to dig deeper into at 
this time, but we will talk at length about fraud, corruption, and counter­
feiting in Chapter 8.
Demand Risk
Demand management has always been a difficult discipline by defini­
tion. Part of this is due to the tendency of forecasts that are almost always 
wrong to some degree. Demand management and forecasting techniques 
and solutions have been available to the supply chain profession for over 
80 years. There are hundreds of deterministic, statistical solution provid­
ers that provide companies with the ability to scan historical sales to arrive 
at a forecast using techniques such as least squares, time series analysis, 
and regression analysis. We’ll talk in more detail about these techniques 
in Chapter 10, but for now we’ll segment the demand risk discussion into 
customer risk, product risk, and logistics risk.
Customer Risk. As shown in Table 7.2, there are plenty of risks on the 
customer side of the equation. The demand issue tends to get the most 
focus because the purpose of demand estimation is to project what a cus­
tomer will buy, when they will buy it, and how many they will buy. With 
complex supply chains and large product portfolios, not even considering 
global markets, seasonal products and other extraneous factors, the task 
is somewhat daunting.
Forecast error is a key risk in demand management that requires atten­
tion. The reason we focus on this risk, is that it runs from 10% error of 
forecast versus actual at the aggregated product family level to more 
than 40% error at the stock-­keeping unit or item level. (Forecasts almost 
always become less reliable as the forecasts become more granular rather 
than aggregated.)
The traditional remedy to mitigate forecast error has been to statistically 
calculate safety stock and develop buffer stocks at choke points through­
out the supply chain. The supply chain profession has been working for 
more than 50 years to mitigate the risk of attempting to project what their 
customers will buy and balancing supply to ensure superior service levels 
to those customers. And industrial customers are in no way exempt from 
providing additional risk to this pillar of supply chain risk. Customers

have a nasty habit of continually arguing about changes to pricing and 
delivery dates and have a propensity to surprise suppliers with unplanned 
or poorly communicated product promotions of the supplier’s products at 
their stores.
When a customer surprises a supplier with a promotion of the supplier’s 
product, the resulting demand tends to be at least three to four times the 
forecasted level of sales, something that wreaks havoc on the supplier’s 
supply chain. The typical approach to respond to this situation is to reallo­
cate product within the supplier’s bill of material to satisfy the promotion. 
This approach tends to result in excessive overtime at the supplier, total 
disruption of the supplier’s supply chain–­planning processes, and aggra­
vation to other customers when their delivery promises are rescheduled. 
And finally, if this risk is perpetuated, or becomes chronic at a supplier, 
the outcome tends to be a reduction in customer relationships and ulti­
mately a loss of customers.
Product Risk. Poor product portfolio management is another important 
aspect of this risk pillar. By far the largest risk in this category is product 
failure and warranty issues. An example we all have witnessed over the 
last couple of years is Toyota’s issues with braking systems, accelerators, 
and massive product recalls. Automobile manufacturers run the num­
bers on their risks associated with product liability and warranty prob­
ably better than most manufacturers. Their risk appetite is usually quite 
high and they utilize many diverse liability, tort, and warranty insurance 
packages to mitigate those risks. However, continued product recalls, 
regardless of the industry, can lead to customer loss, fines, penalties, and 
potential bankruptcy. Witness what has happened at General Motors.
One of the most difficult elements in this pillar is new product introduc­
tion. Forecast error for products continually produced and sold to cus­
tomers can become as large as 40% for a given product. Forecast error and 
the impact on the company of poorly launched new products can be even 
more dramatic. We mentioned this aspect of demand management and 
supply chain management in Chapter 4. Poor assumptions for poor plan­
ning and poor communications relative to new product launches can be 
devastating. An example is the growth of Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s 
Galaxy products at the expense of Blackberry’s product portfolio.
There are traditional approaches to mitigate product-­planning risks 
including collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR) 
tools that provide a vehicle for demand collaboration between suppliers 

134  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
and customers. CPFR is utilized in the consumer packaged goods and 
retail industries. The sales & operational planning (S&OP) process acts 
as a framework to assist companies in their efforts to balance supply with 
demand to minimize surprises and maximize profits for the entire enter­
prise. We will discuss these in more detail in Chapters 9 and 12.
Logistics Risk. In this risk pillar, logistics relates to outbound mate­
rial that perhaps goes to a final assembly/­package partner, a distribution 
or warehouse, or the final customer. Most of the logistical discussion we 
engaged in within our supplier risk segment applies in this arena as well. 
Most manufacturers do not maintain their own truck, barge, rail, or ship 
fleet. As mentioned earlier, thousands of 3PL companies will haul freight 
better, faster, and cheaper than most manufacturers. One nuance is the 
approach that utilizing 3PLs to deliver finished goods to customers is a 
form of risk mitigation due to better performance, or if contract verbiage 
with that carrier includes sharing or pooling of the risk in case of an acci­
dent. In the chemical industry, contracts specify not only what we call 
service level agreements (SLAs) but also language that shares the liability 
risk of an accident with both parties. This has been a traditional remedy 
to improve service deliveries, reduce the cost of transportation, maximize 
profits, and minimize risk.
Process Risk
In this risk pillar, which a cursory glance at Table 7.3 reveals to be exten­
sive, the risks are inherently positioned within an organization. Another 
way to think about this is that the organization has better control of these 
risks because they occur within their own domain. The frequency of occur­
rence and the remedies many organizations utilize to solve these issues lie 
within their own four walls. Our categories for this risk pillar discussion 
will be known or hard risks, unknown or soft risks, and chronic risks that 
can arise within a company’s four walls.
Known Risks. These are risks that are measurable and can be planned 
for. Known risks, also called hard risks, include process breakdowns, 
poor material, poor quality control, criminal activity, poor and unreli­
able systems, and failure of a company’s facilities and assets. Known risks 
from Table 7.3 could include manufacturing yield, capacity, information 
delays, systems, receivables, payables, inventory, and planning. Most of

these risks are known, albeit not particularly popular, because they are 
indicative of a management style and attitude or a lack of investment 
of time and resources. Many of the risk remedies are reactive and many of 
the risks, without proper attention can become chronic, which we’ll dis­
cuss shortly.
The critical issue with known risks is that without addressing them with 
permanent solutions, an organization tends to be plagued with these risks 
daily to the point where they lose visibility, confidence, and commitment, 
leading to a potential major internal disruption. This breakdown within a 
company’s processes can be as impactful as a catastrophic event emanat­
ing externally.
Unknown Risks. These risks are difficult to determine and are some­
times called soft risks. Examples of soft risks might be a radically new 
product or technology that renders a company’s existing approach to the

market obsolete. Unknown risks could also be a fire that destroys a plant, 
an attack on a plant, a weather event, and from Table 7.3, areas such as time 
delays or any unforeseen disruption. An effective way to respond to these 
risks is to develop and practice response scenarios, what we call business 
continuity planning (BCP). The disconcerting aspect of soft risks is that 
most companies do not develop or practice scenario response plans or risk 
response plans. In fact, as you scan down the traditional remedies column 
for the soft risks in Table 7.3, you will notice that almost all are reactive 
rather than proactive.
Chronic Risks. The primary characteristic of chronic risks is that when 
these occur they tend to cause only minor internal disruptions. They may 
occur continually and because of the nature of their low impact, organiza­
tions tend to absorb the risk and develop work-­arounds. The disruptions 
could be persistent and the root causes may not be obvious and therefore 
become tolerated over time. Some of the risks from Table 7.3 that could 
fall into this category include manufacturing yield, capacity issues, time 
delays, human errors, and equipment failure.
Environment/­Ecosystems Risk
The fourth risk pillar is probably the most immature pillar since there are 
so many new government rules and regulations, weather events, and fraud 
and corruption possibilities emerging around the globe. Furthermore, 
most organizations are operating global supply chains in areas where 
they’ve never operated before. This is all in an effort to grow top-­line reve­
nues and penetrate new markets. Globalization strategies bring additional 
risk, which Table 7.4 profiles.
Known Risks. In this arena we could categorize risks such as currency 
rates, customs regulations, environmental regulations, industry regula­
tions, and country regulations. We may not like all the regulatory statutes 
placed upon us, but they tend to be known and developed over a wide time 
span, thus providing organizations ample time to prepare for and comply 
with these rules. Many companies do not have the skill sets to understand 
and manage all the rules and regulations and therefore rely on 3PLs and 
freight forwarders to ensure compliance. One caveat before we move to 
the unknown risks is that all companies have a distinct style and attitude 
regarding risk, and sometimes their risk appetite is not what it should be. 
Subsequently, they may or may not choose to adhere to all the rules.

138  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Unknown risks. Risks within this category could be political, weather 
and acts of God, fraud, corruption, counterfeiting, and competition. The 
bulk of these risks is mitigated and managed through the use of scenario-­
based planning approaches, be it at a specific facility level or throughout 
an entire supply chain network. Most of the unknown or soft risks in this 
category can and should be planned for using scenario-­based BCP or risk

response plans. However, a few of these risks, such as fraud, corruption, 
theft, and counterfeiting lend themselves to a more reactionary approach.
Historically, almost every soft risk is event-­driven in nature. Theft has 
traditionally been a reactionary risk, followed by countermeasures, inci­
dent follow-­ups, and bulletins to recover the loss. Counterfeiting has tra­
ditionally been much more of a sensitive subject, because based on the 
industry, when it occurs governments tend to get involved to protect citi­
zens. And fraud and corruption is a sensitive subject since no company 
wants its brand on the news or the web for the wrong reasons.
When these soft risks emerge, whether inside or outside a company, 
organizations should address the issue as quickly as possible. Many fraud 
events emanate from within the organization and are dealt with quietly 
using third-­party fraud investigative companies. When fraud, bribery, and 
corruption emerge outside the organization, in countries where a com­
pany’s products are being manufactured or sold, that’s when the brand is 
most at risk. The bottom line in this area of risk is that it will continue to 
grow in terms of scope and scale as long as companies continue to pen­
etrate new global markets. The approaches to manage these risks will also 
continue to emerge and perhaps migrate from reactive to more proactive 
in nature. We’ll share many of those new proactive approaches in subse­
quent chapters.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING
Adopting a business continuity plan (BCP) is the start of a journey that 
ensures continuous operations of critical processes within a company and 
expands to include critical suppliers as the program matures. It is a concept 
that is absolutely central to effective risk management. In reality, this topic 
could appear in one of many chapters. We simply made a decision to place 
business continuity planning in this chapter because so many supply chain 
risks are operational in nature. Before describing business continuity plan­
ning in detail, we will define some important concepts and definitions.
Business continuity is the process of planning for and implementing 
procedures that are designed to enable continuous operations of critical 
business processes and functions. Incident management is the process that 
is responsible to guide the company through an incident or disaster and 
execute the overall business continuity plan. The incident management 

140  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
team focuses on incidents that have escalated beyond emergency response 
and that could impact business operations (i.e., business continuity). The 
responsibilities of the incident management team include the following:
•	 Activate department business continuity plans and disaster recovery 
plans as appropriate
•	 Make workplace recovery decisions
•	 Activate disaster recovery decisions
•	 Allocate resources among recovering departments/­groups
•	 Coordinate efforts between recovery and response teams
•	 Approve disaster-­related purchases
•	 Develop and distribute messages to employees, customers, and vendors
•	 Provide direct updates to the executive team
•	 Carry out governance board and executive directives
Emergency response is the process that is responsible for human and life 
safety issues during an incident. The emergency response team leads the 
evacuation and assembly or shelter-­in-­place activities.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING OBJECTIVE5
The objective of a business continuity plan is to ensure the availability, 
reliability, and recoverability of business processes servicing a compa­
ny’s customers, partners, and stakeholders. In order for business conti­
nuity to be effective, it must be an integral part of the business planning 
life cycle. Whenever business changes impact a process or function, 
business continuity considerations must be evaluated and adjusted 
as necessary to understand the effect to existing recovery strategies 
and plans. We all make plans based on trade-­offs of cost and benefits. 
Business continuity formalizes a company’s overall approach to effective 
risk management and should be closely aligned to a company’s incident 
management, emergency response management, and information tech­
nology disaster recovery. Successful business continuity management 
requires a commitment from the company’s executive team in order to 
show commitment, raise awareness, and implement sound approaches 
to build resilience.

Operational Risk  •  141
The Business Continuity Life Cycle
The business continuity life cycle includes six stages:
	
1.	Governance
	
2.	Business Impact Analysis
	
3.	Risk Assessment
	
4.	Recovery Strategies
	
5.	Business Continuity/­Disaster Recovery Planning
	
6.	Test and Verification
Governance. Senior management involvement and support are critical to 
the success of a company’s business continuity program. Executive buy-­in 
enables the business continuity program to be in alignment with the com­
pany’s strategic direction and business objectives. This also ensures that 
the program is able to obtain appropriate resources and visibility. Without 
adequate senior management involvement and support, a business con­
tinuity program risks losing effectiveness and alignment with business 
strategy, misspent or unfit resources, gaps between capability and require­
ments, or in the worst case, senior management eliminating business con­
tinuity altogether because they do not see the value in the investment.
A key component for governance is the creation and enforcement of 
business continuity standards and policies. These standards and policies 
outline the what and how of business continuity. This allows for program 
consistency across the company and supports corporate audits. The gov­
ernance board has the responsibility to support and oversee the business 
continuity program.
No company can implement a robust business continuity program over­
night; it can take years for a complex global company to fully implement 
a business continuity program. Business continuity is a journey that must 
be evaluated, maintained, and aligned with an organization’s three- to 
five-­year strategy. The governance board is responsible for business conti­
nuity oversight and direction; the board is in charge of the journey.
Business Impact Analysis (BIA). A BIA is a methodology to identify 
critical business processes and functions based on operational and/­or 
financial impacts. This is accomplished by interviewing business process 
owners and asking them to describe their business processes. This inter­
view includes the identification of critical resource requirements (staff, 
equipment, etc.), vital records and data, along with internal and external 

142  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
dependencies. Analysis of the data gathered through these interviews 
paints a picture of the critical paths within a business at any given time. 
This step also identifies the business threshold for disruption loss, includ­
ing applications, systems, platforms, and infrastructure.
The business impact analysis identifies the preliminary recovery time 
objective (RTO)3 and recovery point objective (RPO).4 It is important to 
remember when designing a business continuity solution that it is not 
restoring business to normal, but it is the restoration of what is most cru­
cial at a given time. For example, if the company issued payroll the day 
previous to an “event,” restoring the payroll process would not be critical. 
But if payroll was to be released the day after the event then restoring the 
payroll process would be critical, especially to employees. The business 
process owners also describe work-­around procedures that can be imple­
mented until the process can be resumed or the staff can return to work.
Risk Assessment. The risk assessment stage identifies business conti­
nuity risks that could result in a business process disruption or hinder 
recovery. A risk assessment usually includes a facility assessment and 
an environmental analysis. A high-­level physical inspection of a facil­
ity should include a review of the electrical design, mechanical heating 
ventilation and air-­conditioning (HVAC) design, communications and 
network architecture review, physical security evaluation, emergency 
egress/­ingress, and structural design of the data center and call center 
(as applicable). The environmental risk analysis includes the analysis of 
the likelihood of natural and man-­made disasters at a specific location. 
After the risks are identified, they should be ranked and rated by criteria 
specified in the business continuity standards.
Recovery Strategies. The data gathered from the BIA and risk assessment 
portray the existing business continuity capabilities and gaps. Recovery 
strategies are developed to mitigate these potential risks. Recovery strate­
gies and the associated estimated costs for implementation are developed 
and presented to the business continuity governance board for review. It 
is up to the governance board to approve and fund the chosen recovery 
strategies. Note the governance board should also sign off on high-­ranked 
business risks with the reasoning on any decisions not to remediate a risk.
Business Continuity/­Disaster Recovery Plans. Business continuity 
planning allows for the availability of critical business processes in the event 
of an incident that renders facilities, computer systems, and/­or employees 
inoperable or inaccessible. The goal of the creation and implementation of 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans is to minimize economic 

Operational Risk  •  143
losses resulting from disruptions to business functions. These plans provide 
steps and procedures to facilitate an orderly recovery of critical business 
functions and/­or systems. Business continuity plans address the recovery 
of business functions and workspaces; disaster recovery plans address the 
recovery of the information technology environment and systems that sup­
port the business. The provisions in these types of plans are used as the 
basis for providing guidance, preparing for, and effecting recovery activi­
ties in connection with executive management’s discretion. Tactically, the 
business continuity/­disaster recovery plans address how to do the following:
•	 Minimize business losses resulting from disruptions to business 
processes
•	 Provide a plan of action to facilitate an orderly recovery of critical 
business processes and technical infrastructure
•	 Identify key individuals or teams who will manage the process of 
recovering and restoring the business and/­or technology after an 
incident or disaster
•	 Specify the critical business and technical activities that need to con­
tinue after an incident
•	 Outline the logistics of recovering critical business processes and 
technical infrastructure
Proper execution of these plans facilitates the timely recovery of critical 
business processes. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are 
effective only if they are maintained properly and the content information 
is current. A key element of business continuity/­disaster recovery plans is 
the coordination between information technology and business processes 
to align RTO and RPO with business requirements over time.
Test and Verify. The business continuity standards will guide the business 
continuity program’s roadmap to the development, testing, and maintenance 
of continuity and disaster plans and reporting to the governance board. The 
tests are used to train associates and create an awareness of the business 
continuity program model and individual roles. This is done through exer­
cising the plan. Different levels of plan testing range from tabletop “walk-­
throughs” to the actual mobilization of plans. Actual mobilization of plans 
requires increased resources but will provide more thorough results.
The key to a thriving business continuity program is that it is never stag­
nant. It is a living process, and as it matures it should evolve into being 
part of regular business operations, not viewed as simply an add-­on.

144  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
BCP Exercises
A tabletop or structured walk-­through exercise is a paper evaluation of a 
portion of a business continuity plan without the expenses or personnel 
resources associated with a full test. The exercise scope can vary from a 
review of a portion of the BCP to a review of the entire plan. The walk-­
through has many worthwhile objectives:
•	 Verify the contents of the plan
•	 Prepare for simulation testing
•	 Train new members and create employee awareness
•	 Maintain preparedness while limiting use of resources
•	 Affirm that the strategy documented in the plan is viable
•	 Educate critical personnel on their responsibilities in a disaster
•	 Confirm that the information in the plan is current and accurate
•	 Identify areas of the plan that need revision or updates
The primary benefit of a tabletop exercise, besides offering the oppor­
tunity to realize an impressive set of objectives, is that it is cost-­effective 
and noninvasive.
A second type of exercise, called a component exercise, is usually per­
formed during off-­hours and tests a particular segment of the recovery 
plan. It differs from the structured walk-­through in that it involves actual 
recovery activities. The overwhelming benefit of a component exercise is 
that it is nondisruptive and focused. Various types of component tests can 
include the following:
•	 Tests of the emergency notification system
•	 Evacuation tests
•	 Data center or application recovery test
•	 Remote or dial-­in access test
•	 Critical business function recovery test
A mobilization exercise is an integrated simulation/­full operations test 
that includes an exercise performed at the actual recovery sites and utiliz­
ing backup resources that would be used during an actual event. A struc­
tured walk-­through and/­or a component exercise test should precede the 
mobilization exercise. The primary objective of a mobilization exercise is 
to test an entire plan or a portion of the plan under emergency scenarios, 

Operational Risk  •  145
validate operational effectiveness and business unit interdependencies, 
and provide technical and administrative measurable results. Measures 
of test results should be compiled during the exercise and then compared 
against expected results.
An exercise of this proportion is normally scheduled to take place after 
hours or during a weekend. While the most costly in terms of resources, the 
major benefit of a mobilization exercise is that it requires interdepartment 
coordination and is the best true test of the business continuity program.
After the exercise type, identification of recovery priorities, objectives, 
timeline, and scenario have been determined, a company conducts the 
test, analyzes the findings, and develops corrective actions. The final step 
is to update the business continuity/­disaster plan to incorporate lessons 
learned from testing.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
The supply chain management concept has come a long way from the days 
of materials management, inventory cycle counting, expediting orders, 
and fighting fires. The concept has become a profession and many out­
side the industry, including executive managers, have come to the realiza­
tion that supply chain excellence is a critical success factor for business. 
However, many of the risks we have discussed within the arena of business 
operations are still traditionally mitigated and managed by reactionary 
metrics and methodologies. As supply chain risk management unfolds 
from a concept into a more mature discipline, many of the new tools, tech­
niques, mitigation strategies, and metrics that we present will become an 
effective way to identify, assess, mitigate, and manage operational risks.
Summary of Key Points
•	 Operational risks are by far the most frequent number of risk events, 
not only for those who manufacture products, but for service orga­
nizations as well. Operational risks are contained in each of the four 
pillars of supply chain risk that include supply risk, demand risk, 
process risk, and environmental risk.
•	 Operational risks cross several planning and execution horizons. 
The two most prevalent horizons are the tactical horizon, which 

146  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
normally covers 1–18 months into the future, and the operational 
horizon, covering 0–45 days into the future.
•	 Supply risk can be further classified into supplier risk, logistics risk, 
and fraud, corruption, and counterfeiting risk.
•	 Demand risk consists of customer risk, product risk, and logistics 
risk.
•	 The categories for the process risk pillar are known or hard risks, 
unknown or soft risks, and chronic risks that can arise within a 
company’s four walls.
•	 The fourth risk pillar, environment/­ecosystems risk, is probably 
the most immature pillar and also contains known, unknown, and 
chronic risk categories.
•	 One traditional and effective proactive approach to identifying, 
assessing, mitigating and managing operational risks, business con­
tinuity planning, has been around for many years. It is still consid­
ered a cost-­effective approach to being prepared for and responsive 
to risk events, particularly operational risk events.
•	 The business continuity life cycle includes six stages: governance, 
business impact analysis, risk assessment, recovery strategies, busi­
ness continuity/­disaster recovery planning, and test and verification.
•	 A tabletop or structured walk-­through exercise is a paper evaluation 
of a portion of a business continuity plan without the expenses or 
personnel resources associated with a full test. A second type of exer­
cise, called a component exercise, is usually performed during off-­
hours, tests a particular segment of the recovery plan, and involves 
actual recovery activities.

Supply Chain Fraud, Corruption, 
Counterfeiting, and Theft
Groeb Farms, a major U.S. honey supplier, was involved in the nation’s 
largest food fraud: an incident that eventually forced the company into 
bankruptcy. This honey laundering case involved a German company, 
ALW, that illegally imported cheap and sometimes adulterated Chinese 
honey. While the honey itself is not illegal, mislabeling the product and 
avoiding tariffs is a different story. ALW had its offices in China use inde­
pendent brokers to procure honey that eventually became honey “not 
from China.”
The motivation behind the honey fraud is that honey from China to the 
United States is subject to tariffs that can triple its cost. Fifty-­gallon drums 
of Chinese honey procured by ALW were shipped to India, Malaysia, 
Indonesia, South Korea, Russia, Mongolia, Thailand, Taiwan, and the 
Philippines, where they were relabeled and often filtered to remove traces 
of their origin. Fake documents would then be produced to move the 
honey through U.S. customs. Groeb Farms, based in Michigan, fired two 
executives who produced fake documents and lied to their board of direc­
tors about the origin of the honey the company was procuring, even when 
the company’s internal auditors raised concerns that the honey was ille­
gally imported. Groeb Farms paid a $2 million fine and was required to 
dispose of the Chinese honey it had in inventory—something that was 
very expensive considering that the replacement costs of honey were rising 
at the time. Amid the company’s financial troubles, it fell behind on pay­
ments on a bank loan. U.S. honey producers and distributors who claimed 
that they were harmed by Groeb’s actions filed several lawsuits also. This 
fraud, besides being ethically and legally wrong, clearly exposed the com­
pany to risk.

148  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
In this chapter we explore fraud, corruption, counterfeiting, and theft 
and discuss how these issues impact everyone from the supplier to the 
consumer. We’ll provide examples of companies that have been accused 
and convicted of fraud, corruption, or counterfeiting and think about the 
financial impacts emanating from these risk events. We will present some 
new terminology and address the vast amount of new rules and regula­
tions coming from many countries. And we’ll share new tools, techniques, 
tactics, solutions, and methodologies to help stamp out corrupt practices.
SOME KEY CONCEPTS
A detailed report on fraud, corruption, and counterfeiting, which surveyed 
more than 114,000 professionals in 107 countries, came up with a startling 
finding. The study concluded that one in four people had recently paid 
some form of a bribe over a 12-month period.1 While this seems shocking, 
we have to remember that not all countries or cultures view this topic the 
same way. Fraud, corruption, counterfeiting, and theft are a large part of 
supply chain risk.
The following provides a quick summary of some key concepts that are 
important parts of this chapter.
Bribery
Bribery is trying to persuade someone, typically illegally or dishonestly, 
to act in one’s favor by offering a gift of money or other attractive induce­
ment. While supply chain managers in the United States know that brib­
ery is illegal, the same is not true around the world. In some countries, 
bribery is referred to as “facilitating payments,” a term that is much more 
benign sounding. In Greek, the word fakelaki, literally meaning “little 
envelope,” is used in Greek popular culture as a term referring to the brib­
ery of public servants and private companies by Greek citizens in order to 
“expedite” service. Not that long ago the Greek parliament actually made 
this practice legal.
In many countries bribery is an accepted way of doing business. More 
than three out of four people in Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, said 
they paid a bribe over a 12-month period. Bribery rates are more than 50% 
in Cambodia, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, India, Tanzania, Kenya, Libya, 

Supply Chain Fraud, Corruption, Counterfeiting, and Theft  •  149
Mozambique, Uganda, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. Conversely, Australia, 
Belgium, Portugal, Malaysia, Finland, Denmark, and Croatia have the 
lowest bribery rates at less than 5%. In the United States and UK this fig­
ure is just over 6%.
A study from Compliance Week and Kroll concluded that, on the posi­
tive side, large corporations based in the United States take anticorruption 
programs more seriously than their counterparts based elsewhere.2 On 
the less-­positive side, almost half of all respondents report they conduct 
no anticorruption training with their third parties. Of those who do train 
their third parties, only 30% believe their efforts are effective.
A headline on a prominent website stated that Ralph Lauren admitted 
to bribery at its Argentina subsidiary.3 A Ralph Lauren subsidiary alleg­
edly bribed customs officials to improperly obtain paperwork necessary 
for goods to clear customs and to avoid inspections. Also, the company 
was accused of faking invoices to mask payoffs. The U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, in a nonprosecution agreement, fined the com­
pany $1.6 million. The fine would probably have been larger, but the 
company, according to the SEC’s enforcement director, responded appro­
priately to the violations and cooperated fully with the investigation. The 
company’s response was that bribes are inconsistent with the culture of 
compliance and integrity of the company. Still another corporate response 
was there was no evidence that the improper activity in Argentina was 
known or authorized by anyone outside of Argentina or that similar prac­
tices were occurring at other foreign operations.
Counterfeiting
A specific type of intellectual property theft involves counterfeiting. A 
counterfeit is something made in imitation so as to be passed off fraudu­
lently or deceptively as genuine.4 The sad truth is that many supply chains 
are plagued by counterfeits. Although movies, books, records, clothing, 
and other consumer goods are regularly copied, counterfeit goods are 
increasingly making their way into industrial supply chains. This includes 
products such as pharmaceutical drugs, automobile parts, and aerospace 
replacement parts that place the health and safety of individuals at risk.
Examples of counterfeiting globally are all too common. Car owners in 
the United States who have had their air bags replaced in the last several 
years, for example, run a high risk that the replacement bags are counter­
feit. The U.S. Department of Defense says defense supply chains are 

150  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
inundated with counterfeit parts, and efforts to curtail them are failing. 
The U.S. Congress estimates there could be a million counterfeit parts in 
the supply chain. Besides the risk of product failure, Chinese counterfeit 
components could offer a backdoor to cyber snoops, escalating the threat 
of cyberspying and intellectual theft.5
One of most well-­known and respected departments in the U.S. govern­
ment, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), is very concerned about 
counterfeit parts making their way into nuclear energy plants within the 
United States—so much so that the NRC is driving the issue of counter­
feiting with its Counterfeit, Fraudulent, and Suspect Items (CFSI) project. 
We’ll talk more about the NRC’s projects and their countermeasures later 
in the chapter. For now, let’s look at a few key data points on counterfeit 
parts relative to nuclear energy around the globe. Globally, a procurement 
director of a Russian supplier to the nuclear power industry was arrested 
for buying low-­quality raw materials and pocketing the difference. During 
this same period multiple South Korean nuclear plants identified numer­
ous counterfeit issues and shut down over fake control cable certification. 
The South Korean president ordered a parliamentary investigation.
Tables 8.1 and 8.2 present the estimated scope of global counterfeiting 
across various product categories and countries. As these tables reveal, 
the costs of counterfeiting to the U.S. economy, and to global industry as 
a whole, are significant.
Fraudulent, Corrupt, Coercive, and Collusive Practices
Fraudulent practices are any action or omission, including misrepresenta­
tion, that knowingly or recklessly misleads or attempts to mislead a party 
to obtain a financial benefit or to avoid an obligation.6 Corrupt practices 
means the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting, directly or indirectly,

of anything of value to influence improperly the actions of another party. 
Coercive practice means impairing or harming or threatening to impair or 
harm, directly or indirectly, any party or the property of the party to influ­
ence improperly the actions of a party. And finally, collusive practice means an 
arrangement between two or more parties designed to achieve an improper 
purpose, including influencing improperly the actions of another party.
Let’s look at some headlines coming out of China over the last sev­
eral years. These announcements from China came through several U.S. 
media outlets:
•	 GlaxoSmithKline was placed under scrutiny for bribing doctors and 
hospital officials in efforts to sell products at higher prices; several 
executives were detained.
•	 Fines are being administered to six dairy companies in China 
accused of price fixing and anticompetition practices. The fines will 
amount to a record setting $108 million!

•	 Sanofi, France’s largest pharmaceutical company, was accused of 
paying bribes totaling 1.69 million yuan to 503 doctors at 79 hospi­
tals in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou.
•	 Novartis was placed under investigation for possible bribery and 
fraud in the provision of medical drugs and services. A Novartis 
employee claimed her manager instructed her to use 50,000 yuan 
(US$8,000) to boost sales of its drugs.
The standard response to these cases is one of initial shock and then full 
cooperation with the investigating authorities of the country where the 
risk event occurred. Over the years, insurance and other risk management 
organizations have been monitoring these events and others. And with so 
many observations, we’ve developed a Four-­Stage Model of how most risk 
events play out, regardless of the event cause or country of origin, which 
Figure 8.1 illustrates.
As seen in this figure, the first stage of a risk event tends to be denial. 
Normally it means a belief the event is not that damaging and a company 
will be back in business in a few days. In 2013, the U.S. attorney general 
announced fines levied against Johnson & Johnson for false marketing of 
three drugs, Risperdal, Invega, and the heart failure drug Natrecor. The 
attorney general stated the company marketed the drugs for unapproved 
use and paid “kickbacks” to doctors and nursing homes. The company’s 
response was typical in terms of damage control and our Four-­Stage 
Model—J&J continued to stand by Risperdal as safe and effective for its 
approved use.

During that time a
solution is being worked
on. Is a lesson learned?
FIGURE 8.1
The four stages of a fraud, corruption, or supply chain disaster.

Supply Chain Fraud, Corruption, Counterfeiting, and Theft  •  153
The second of the four stages, severity, talks about the real scope and 
scale and normally includes realization that the event is actually worse 
than first thought. The third stage, blame, is the stark reality that the event 
is a total mess and follows this line, “We can’t understand how this hap­
pened and are working diligently to solve the problem.” All the while, 
executives are asking questions such as, “How did this happen and who’s 
responsible?” Finally, the fourth stage, resolution, should be a teaching 
moment in terms of supply chain risk management.
What we’ve witnessed, along with other research organizations, aca­
demia, and consulting firms, is that supply chain risk management and to 
some extent general risk management is still an ad hoc activity. And when 
the event has been resolved and the company is still in business, those who 
handled the event go back to their normal job responsibilities. Most com­
pany executives assume that their direct reports are prepared to handle 
risk events. This assumption, however, is flawed. If you fail to prepare and 
train for risk events, do not be surprised that the probability of a good 
outcome from a risk event is suspect.
RULES AND REGULATIONS
We would like to present the growing array of rules and regulations 
already in place and in the works that attempt to diminish, but not neces­
sarily eliminate, illicit and fraudulent activity. Whatever your opinion is 
regarding rules and regulations, the demand to be in compliance is at its 
highest level ever and probably will not subside for the foreseeable future. 
Table 8.3 presents a sample of some of the newest and farthest-­reaching 
rules and regulations impacting global supply chains. As you can see, 
there is no shortage of rules and regulations.
We’ve identified a few new rules, regulations, and organizations to drill 
down a bit deeper in an effort to provide additional perspective.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
The CFPB is a relatively new organization in the U.S. government enacted 
to ensure that products are not mislabeled or maliciously marketed to U.S. 
consumers and to protect consumers from fraud and price gouging.

Customs Trade Partnership against Terrorism (C-­TPAT)
This program is the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP’s) pre­
mier trade security program. The purpose of C-­TPAT is to partner with 
the trade community for the purpose of ensuring the U.S. and interna­
tional supply chains are not subject to intrusion by terrorist organi­zations. 
C-­TPAT requires the trade company participants to document and vali­
date their supply chain security procedures in relation to existing CBP 
criteria or guidelines. CBP requires that C-­TPAT companies develop an 
internal validation process to ensure the existence of security measures 
documented in their Supply Chain Security Profile and in any supple­
mental information provided to CBP. The purpose of the validation is to 
ensure that the C-­TPAT participant’s international supply chain security 
measures contained in the C-­TPAT participant’s security profile have

been implemented and are being followed in accordance with established 
C-­TPAT criteria and guidelines.
Dodd-­Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-­Frank legislation was a direct result of the 2008–2009 finan­
cial meltdown. This act also includes subjecting banks to stress testing to 
evaluate their financial resiliency. It is a far-­reaching and somewhat con­
troversial law. The legislation also includes Conflict Minerals Act, which 
took effect in 2014.
In 2012 the SEC approved a final rule requiring companies to disclose 
their use of conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) and 
whether those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo 
or adjoining countries.7 These regulations will require companies to trace 
various materials to their source to ensure they did not originate in con­
flict regions. The compliance disclosure is required by the U.S. govern­
ment. Companies are required to disclose that they verified the suppliers’ 
address, audited those suppliers, and required those suppliers to certify 
that the materials incorporated into the manufacturers products comply 
with the laws. Customers will be asking manufacturers to certify their 
products through the global supply chain. We wish them luck.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) it is unlawful for a U.S. 
firm, as well as any officer, director, employee, or agent of the company, 
to offer, pay, or promise to pay money or offer anything of value to any 
foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. It is also 
unlawful to make payments to any person while knowing that all or a por­
tion of the payment will be offered, given, or promised directly or indirectly 
to any foreign official for the purpose of assisting the firm in obtaining 
or retaining business. Firms are subject to fines of up to $2 million, while 
officers, directors, employees, agents, and stockholders are subject to fines 
up to $100,000. Under federal criminal laws other than FCPA, individuals 
can be fined up to $250,000 or up to twice the amount of the gross gain 
or loss of a transaction. And finally, a person or firm found in violation of 
FCPA may be barred from doing business with the federal government.

TOOLS, BEST-­IN-­CLASS PRACTICES, 
AND COUNTERMEASURES
Our focus in this section is to provide some insights on emerging tools that 
are providing capabilities to manage critical aspects of supply chain risk. 
This section explains the four quadrants presented in Figures 8.2 and 8.3.
Fraud, Corruption, and Theft Tools
The left portion of Figure 8.2 relates to a solution called Decision Point 
from Navigant. This tool is Navigant’s antibribery onboarding portal. It 
is designed for the investigation of distribution and supply chain third 
parties. The tool addresses the challenges inherent in utilizing interme­
diaries and suppliers, such as onboarding, regulatory compliance and 
education, information gathering, approvals, and investigative processes 
as they relate to antibribery and other compliance regulations. The tool 
facilitates the third-­party onboarding process, assesses and risk scores 
third party corruption risk, and enables due diligence investigations 
when appropriate in an effort to support the U.S. FCPA, Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act.
The right portion of Figure  8.2 provides a workflow of a supplier 
onboarding process, which Navigant and other antibribery and cor­
ruption tools maintain for clients. As you can see, the tactical tasks are 
interwoven into a company’s overall supplier management process. These 
tasks inside Navigant’s Decision Point and other tools are co-­managed 
processes rather than fully outsourced. For example, supplier onboard­
ing may be initiated and managed by a commodity manager or buyer in 
the procurement group, who then sends the invitation, interacts with the 
supplier, and monitors progress. These tasks could then trigger key tasks 
at each step done by a third party, such as launching a survey, requesting 
certificates, validating responses, and more.
Moving to the left side of Figure 8.3 we profile another emerging solution 
tool from IHS that captures significant data for manufacturers across the 
globe in terms of where a supplier is located, its market share, inventory 
metrics, financial disposition, and financial risk. Looking at IHS’s tool kit, 
you might consider it a supply chain “temperature check.”

and alerts companies around the globe in an effort to provide coordi­
nated theft incident communications, recovery support, and deterrence 
measures integrated with law enforcement organizations worldwide. 
Through the use of the platform called CargoNet, which is connected to 
more than 120,000 officers and agents spanning the globe and more than 
9,000 agencies in the United States, shippers can mitigate the risk of cargo 
theft by receiving near-­real-­time theft alerts that are automatically sent to 
law enforcement, thus strengthening security around sensitive and high-­
value freight.
Supplier Co-­Management
We know that managing supplier risk is a trade-­off between cost of dili­
gence and the cost and likelihood of damages caused by suppliers, directly 
or indirectly. Normally, more time and money spent on due diligence 
results in lower actual damages. However, over time this reaches a point 
of diminishing returns. And therein lies the key to the co-­managing sup­
plier concept. Disciplines, process improvements, and systems that reduce 
the cost of diligence while simultaneously reducing the risks of supplier-­
induced damages are far more efficient and effective than throwing more 
resources at the problem. What are some of the benefits of using third 
parties to manage supplier risks?
FIGURE 8.3
Emerging fraud and corruption tools.

Supply Chain Fraud, Corruption, Counterfeiting, and Theft  •  159
•	 Economies of Scale—Third parties that serve hundreds of compa­
nies can realize efficiencies not possible by individual companies, 
and therefore data can be collected once and used many times.
•	 Economies of Specialization—These tasks are core competencies 
for third parties and therefore they become efficient and effective 
over time at performing them.
•	 Investment in Technology—Again, because these are core compe­
tencies, third parties continue to invest heavily in platforms and sys­
tems to streamline the processes and provide overwhelming value.
•	 Accumulated Expertise—Experienced providers have learned what 
works and have created templates and libraries that can lead, guide, 
direct, and coach their clients.
•	 Regulatory Currency—Often providers maintain a cadre of experts 
to keep up with regulatory changes, denied party lists, and legisla­
tion to ensure their clients stay in compliance.
•	 Improved Initial Risk Awareness/­Identification—More risks are 
exposed in the due diligence processes, and therefore action can be 
taken quickly to avoid risk.
•	 Increased Number of Suppliers Managed—The disciplines, pro­
cesses, and systems brought by an experienced third party can 
generate huge improvements in the number and percentage of sup­
pliers for which the proper due diligence is performed in depth, thus 
reducing incidents and damages.
•	 Enhanced Early-­Warning Risk Alerts—Finally, with well-­developed 
monitoring tools, emergent risks can be discovered sooner, giving 
the client more time to deal with an event and execute an optimal 
response.
Addressing Corruption with Best Practices
The U.S. Conference Board and the Center for Responsible Enterprise 
and Trade executed an exhaustive global survey involving Fortune 500 
companies such as DuPont, Microsoft, ARAMARK, Emerson, Caterpillar 
and more.8 This study found that 70% of respondents felt there was an 
extensive risk of corrupt activities when working with agents and busi­
ness partners in emerging countries. Furthermore, an agreed-­upon effec­
tive compliance program should consist of seven pillars: risk assessment, 
due diligence, contract provisions, audit and monitoring, governance and 

160  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
management, codes and policies, and training and communications. The 
study also found that training of company employees is a key ingredient 
for compliance success. More than 60% of respondents felt their company 
would benefit greatly from third-­party, independent rating of their anti­
corruption programs.
This report also found that the emerging market where companies uti­
lize suppliers and agents the most is China. Other top markets for sup­
pliers and agents are India, Southeast Asia, Mexico/­South America, and 
Eastern Europe. If your supplier base is scattered across these top five 
countries/­regions, which is probably the case, we know there’s enough risk 
to go around for everyone. How do companies address corrupt practices 
with suppliers?
•	 Perform Due Diligence—The methods utilized the most by respon­
dents include examining legal and financial aspects, reviewing of 
government relations, criminal investigations as a risk assessment 
technique, reviewing policies of third parties, and third-­party eth­
ics reviews.
•	 Contract Provisioning—Verbiage and actions most often placed in 
contracts include complying with laws and regulations, right to ter­
minate by the company, right to terminate if third party violates laws, 
third-­party financial liabilities, right to access supplier records, com­
plying with anticorruption policies, and the right to audit the supplier.
•	 Audit/­Monitor—Methodologies and processes most often in effect 
are searches for criminal activity, review of payments with high-­risk 
suppliers, reviewing policies of third parties, periodic supplier and 
third-­party recertification, and periodic audits and visits.
•	 Rely on Policies—Policies most often in effect are anticorruption 
information for employees, training of employees, reporting for 
employees, ongoing compliance programs, and reports on and for 
third-­party employees.
•	 Rely on Procedures—Procedures most often in effect are constant 
communication about corruption, written policies for third parties, 
multiple approvals for third parties, company employment agree­
ments, bids reviewed by company teams, and anticorruption infor­
mation for third-­party companies.

Supply Chain Fraud, Corruption, Counterfeiting, and Theft  •  161
•	 Governance and Responsibilities—In this arena, the internal audit, 
compliance, finance, and legal departments are extensively involved 
in anticorruption efforts. Often, responsibility for anticorruption 
efforts with suppliers and third parties will reside with the procure­
ment group.
Counterfeit Countermeasures
Counterfeiting, as mentioned earlier, is a topic of interest across some 
important industries. It’s a major issue, especially to the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC is one of the biggest proponents 
of supply chain risk management inside the U.S. government. When the 
NRC speaks, everyone listens, including other countries. Below are some 
key methodologies the NRC advocates as well as tools, techniques, and 
countermeasures to support its ongoing battle against counterfeit parts.
The NRC advocates the diligent use of procurement policies and proce­
dures, as we witnessed in the Conference Board’s report. It also stresses 
the issue of parts, manufacturers, and distribution facilities having audits 
and assessments. The NRC has developed for its nuclear clients an obso­
lescence product life cycle protocol covering components from cradle to 
grave. The commission has also developed several measures for counterfeit 
part risk detection and new traceability verification methods using serial­
ization and tags. And finally, the NRC has worked to bolster law enforce­
ment resources and penalties.
The NRC has developed countermeasures to detect counterfeit items. 
It has introduced new techniques such as Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR), thermo-­mechanical analysis, and X-­ray fluores­
cence spectroscopy (XFR). Something that is particularly leading-­edge is 
SigNature DNA.
SigNature DNA is something completely different in terms of counter­
feit countermeasures. It is a plant-­based electronic signature marking that 
is invisible to the naked eye. The markings show up only under ultraviolet 
light. Each supplier marks its product with its own customized sequence of 
which the combinations and permutations are infinite. Thus, the Pentagon 
is paying extra for these suppliers to mark all electronic components dur­
ing a trial period. Also, the SigNature DNA technique is now expanding 
into new industries such as wine and high-­end apparel.

162  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Another new approach to mitigate the risk of counterfeit electronic 
components is growing rapidly. According to a report by the U.S. Senate 
Armed Services Committee, titled “Inquiry into Counterfeit Electronic 
Parts in the Department of Defense Supply Chain,” an overwhelming 
majority of more than a million counterfeit parts identified in the investi­
gation were sourced from a party other than the original manufacturer or 
an authorized distributor.
In the electronics industry, and now others as well, after a major risk 
event or a problem with a key supplier within an industry, buyers often 
have no choice other than to begin sourcing in what is called the gray mar­
ket. A gray market is an unauthorized channel of distribution. However, 
turning to the gray market and purchasing a part from a source other than 
the original manufacturer or authorized distributors exposes the buyer 
to not only substandard components but also increases their risk of pur­
chasing counterfeit components. As a result we have seen the birth of the 
excess and obsolete (E&O) industry. Franchised E&O distributors with 
guaranteed product traceability are filling a gap in supply chains result­
ing from just-­in-­time manufacturing and supply disruptions. By holding 
excess and unsold factory stock and guaranteeing product traceability 
back to the manufacturer, these distributors offer buyers a credible and 
reliable source of product to mitigate counterfeit risk.
While the approaches presented here are not the only ways to coun­
ter the counterfeiters, they illustrate some of the creative thinking that 
is occurring to try to stay one step ahead in an area that is a continu­
ous concern.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
This chapter highlights the darker side of human nature. When we think 
about natural disasters, we think about things called “acts of God.” These 
acts are not caused directly by humans, although climate change propo­
nents will argue that this is not necessarily the case today. Something we 
do know for certain is that every time an act of fraud, corruption, coun­
terfeiting, or theft occurs, it is a man-­made event. And man-­made events 
are preventable.
The problem with fraud, corruption, counterfeiting, and theft, particu­
larly at a national level, is that these behaviors, particularly corruption, 

Supply Chain Fraud, Corruption, Counterfeiting, and Theft  •  163
correlate highly with poorer and less-­successful countries. As a predictor 
of failure, at one level corruption may have the most devastating effect of 
any risk presented in this book. As the Austrian journalist Karl Krause 
once commented, “Corruption is worse than prostitution. The latter might 
endanger the morals of an individual. The former invariably endangers 
the morals of the entire country.”9
Summary of Key Points
•	 Bribery is trying to persuade someone, typically illegally or dishon­
estly, to act in one’s favor by offering a gift of money or other attrac­
tive inducement.
•	 A counterfeit is something made in imitation so as to be passed off 
fraudulently or deceptively as genuine.
•	 The first stage of a risk event tends to be denial. The second of the four 
stages is severity (scope and scale). The third stage is blame (reality 
sets in). The final stage is resolution (where the lesson is learned).
•	 New organizations enacted to cut down on fraudulent activities 
include Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Customs Trade 
Partnership against Terrorism. New regulations with this same 
goal include the Dodd-­Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
•	 Tools against fraud and corruption include Navigant’s antibribery 
onboarding portal called Decision Point, IHS’s “temperature check,” 
and Verisk Crime Analytics’ CargoNet.
•	 An effective compliance program should consist of seven pillars: risk 
assessment, due diligence, contract provisions, audit and monitor­
ing, governance and management, codes and policies, and training 
and communications.

Emerging Risk Management 
Frameworks for Success
Our focus in this chapter will be on emerging frameworks that are being 
leveraged to drive successful supply chain risk management (SCRM) 
initiatives. We will become grounded with basic definitions and explore 
some of the new frameworks, standards, and rules and regulations that 
frame the supply chain risk management landscape. We’ll then profile the 
frameworks from several research organizations’ perspectives and present 
several leading companies who are utilizing these frameworks to imple­
ment risk initiatives within their organizations. We’ll conclude by high­
lighting several benefits to be derived from utilizing these frameworks.
WHAT IS A FRAMEWORK?
A framework is a skeletal, openwork, or structural frame. This term also 
describes a frame of reference, which includes an arbitrary set of axes with 
reference to which the position or motion of something is described or 
physical laws are formulated.1 One professional organization profiles the 
term framework in several perspectives. One perspective provides a con­
cept revolving around organizational design by viewing a framework as 
an organizational structure to support the strategic business plans and 
goals of an enterprise (e.g., for-­profit and not-­for-­profit companies). Given 
the mission and business strategy, the organizational structure design 
provides the framework within which operational and management 
activities will be performed. A second perspective revolves around the 
operating environment and views a framework as the global, domestic, 

166  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
environmental, and stakeholder influences that affect the key competi­
tive factors, customer needs, culture, and philosophy of each individual 
company. This environment becomes the framework in which business 
strategy is developed and implemented.2
FRAMEWORKS SUPPORTING THE NEW SUPPLY 
CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINE
Whether you are in operations, finance, distribution, banking, or aca­
demia, several frameworks are critical for supply chain risk management. 
Recall that Chapter 1 defined SCRM, which is expanded here to refer to 
the implementation of strategies to manage everyday and exceptional risks 
within the supply chain through continuous risk identification, assess­
ment, mitigation, and management with the objective of reducing vulner­
ability and ensuring sustainability. We view SCRM as the intersection of 
supply chain management and risk management. Let’s discuss several of 
the critical frameworks.
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework
As mentioned in Chapter 1, the general ERM framework has been around 
for many years, emanating from the finance and classical risk insurance 
disciplines. We’ll take a high-­level view at ERM first, and then dig deeper 
with profiles from CAS, the Casualty Actuarial Society. Recall that 
Chapter 1 provided one perspective of ERM. A second perspective is from 
CAS, which has defined ERM as the discipline by which an organization 
in any industry assesses, controls, exploits, finances, and monitors risks 
from all sources for the purpose of increasing the organization’s short- 
and long-­term value to its shareholders.
ERM can also be described as a risk-­based approach to managing an 
enterprise, integrating concepts of strategic planning, operations man­
agement, and internal control. ERM is still evolving to address the needs 
of various stakeholders who want to understand the broad spectrum of 
risks facing complex organizations and their supply chains to ensure they 
are appropriately managed. Government regulators and debt-­rating agen­
cies have increased their scrutiny of the risk management processes of 
many companies.

Emerging Risk Management Frameworks for Success  •  167
COSO ERM Framework
An important perspective about risk is put forth by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), a well-­
known group formed to help businesses develop their internal control 
systems. Thousands of organizations have incorporated COSO’s Internal 
Control Integrated Framework to help manage their activities. In 2001, in 
response to a heightened awareness of global risk, COSO partnered with 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers to develop a framework that would enable orga­
nizations to evaluate and improve enterprise risk management. COSO 
defines ERM as follows:
A process, effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and other 
personnel, applied in a strategy setting and across the enterprise, designed 
to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to 
be within its risk appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
achievement of entity objectives.3
Eight interrelated components comprise COSO’s ERM framework. 
These components are derived from the way management runs an enter­
prise and are integrated within the management process. These eight com­
ponents, which are also relevant to our discussion of SCRM, comprise a 
fully developed ERM system:
•	 Internal Environment. The internal environment sets an organiza­
tion’s tone, including how risk is viewed and addressed by an orga­
nization’s people, including its risk management philosophy, risk 
appetite, integrity, and ethical values.
•	 Objective Setting. Enterprise risk management ensures that 
management has a process to set objectives and that the chosen 
objectives support the entity’s mission and are consistent with its 
risk appetite.
•	 Event Identification. Internal and external events affecting the 
achievement of objectives must be identified, distinguishing between 
risks and opportunities. Opportunities are channeled back to man­
agement’s strategy or objective-­setting processes.
•	 Risk Assessment. Risks are analyzed in terms of their likelihood and 
impact. This is used as a basis for determining how to manage risks.
•	 Risk Response. Management selects various risk responses, includ­
ing avoiding, accepting, reducing, preventing, or sharing risk. A set 

168  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
of actions are developed that align risks with the entity’s risk toler­
ances and risk appetite.
•	 Control Activities. Policies and procedures are established to help 
ensure risk responses are carried out.
•	 Information and Communication. Relevant information is identi­
fied and communicated in a form and time frame that enable people 
to carry out their responsibilities. Effective communication flows 
down, across, and up the organization.
•	 Monitoring. The entirety of enterprise risk management is moni­
tored and modifications are made as necessary. Enterprise risk man­
agement monitoring is accomplished through ongoing management 
activities, separate evaluations, or both. Management makes modifi­
cations to the ERM plan as required.
ISO Standards
Most of us probably know something about the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) standard organization, but for those of you who 
are not familiar with this standards body, we’ll start with some basic foun­
dational elements of this worldwide organization. Founded in 1947 in 
Geneva, Switzerland, ISO is an international standard-­setting body com­
posed of representatives from various national standards organizations to 
promote worldwide proprietary, industrial, and commercial standards. 
The official languages of the ISO are English, French, and Russian. The 
organization adopted the abbreviation ISO based on the Greek work isos 
(meaning equal) as its universal short form name of their organization.
The organization known today as ISO began in 1926 as the International 
Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA), whose focus 
was mainly on mechanical engineering. It was disbanded in 1942 during 
World War II but was reorganized under its current name in 1947. ISO is 
a voluntary organization comprising 163 member countries, whose mem­
bers are recognized authorities on standards, each one representing one 
country. The bulk of the work of ISO is done by 2,700 technical commit­
tees, subcommittees, and working groups. Each committee and subcom­
mittee is headed by a secretariat from one of the member countries. ISO is 
funded by a combination of (1) organizations that manage specific projects 
or loan experts who participate in technical work, (2) subscriptions from 

Emerging Risk Management Frameworks for Success  •  169
member bodies, which are in proportion to each country’s gross national 
product, and (3) the sale of the standards’ work products. With that as our 
backdrop regarding the organization, let’s talk about what this standards-­
setting body has developed relative to our SCRM discipline.
ISO 31000. The purpose of this standard, introduced in 2009, is to pro­
vide principles and generic guidelines on risk management. It seeks to pro­
vide a universally recognized paradigm for practitioners and companies 
employing risk management processes to replace the myriad of existing 
standards, methodologies, and paradigms that differed between industries, 
subject matters, and regions. The scope and intent of this standard is to pro­
vide generic guidelines for the design, implementation, and maintenance 
of a risk management process throughout any organization, regardless of 
industry. The standard is designed to enable all strategic, management, and 
operational tasks of an organization, through projects, functions, and pro­
cesses, to be aligned to a common set of risk management objectives.
The implementation of this standard is to be applied within existing man­
agement systems to formalize and improve risk management processes as 
opposed to wholesale substitution of legacy management practices. When 
implementing ISO 31000, attention should be given to integrating existing 
risk management processes into the new paradigm addressed in the stan­
dard. The focus should be centered around the following:
•	 Transferring accountability gaps in ERM
•	 Aligning objectives of the governance frameworks with ISO 31000
•	 Embedding management system reporting mechanisms
•	 Creating uniform risk criteria and evaluation metrics
Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the likelihood of 
achieving their objectives, improve the identification of opportunities and 
threats, and effectively allocate and use resources for risk management. 
ISO 31000 cannot be used for certification purposes but does provide 
guidance for internal or external audit programs. Organizations can com­
pare their risk management practices against internationally recognized 
benchmarks for effective management and corporate governance.
A Risk Insurance and Management Society (RIMS) survey of risk pro­
fessionals found that 22% of firms use the COSO standard as their ERM 
framework, while 23% follow the international ISO 31000 standard. 

170  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Twenty-­six percent of firms say they do not follow a particular standard 
or framework.4 A large percentage is not sure or has nothing significant 
in place.
ISO 73. This new Risk Management Vocabulary standard, updated in 
2009, provides a wide breadth of terms. This standards body has been 
updating the vocabulary recently to take into account the growing need 
for additional terms and taxonomy within global supply chains. Some 
commonly used risk terms in this standard are risk management, risk 
assessment, risk analysis, risk, risk source, risk evaluation, risk criteria, 
risk avoidance, risk transfer, risk reduction, risk mitigation, risk reten­
tion, risk optimization, risk acceptance, risk financing, risk control, risk 
communication, risk perception, stakeholder, and interested party, just to 
name few. Many of these terms have been defined in our earlier chapters 
and will be discussed in subsequent chapters as well.
Besides the ISO standard, the new Supply Chain Council supply chain 
risk model, residing in the new SCOR 11.0, is available. The SCOR com­
munity has performed a comprehensive update to its supply chain models, 
metrics, and terminologies, including an updated view of supply chain 
risk.5 APICS has also aggressively developed a body of knowledge cover­
ing SCRM for members and customers.
ISO 28000. This standard is also new. It was developed in 2010 and 
is actually a series of standards, all under the umbrella of 28000, which 
broadly covers the requirements for a security management system within 
the supply chain. The standards inside 28000 are 28001, 28002, 28003, 
28004, and 28005. You may not have stumbled into this standard as of 
yet because it’s actually listed under “Ships and Marine Technology” 
on the ISO website. This is not surprising to us, because most of today’s 
global trade is done by cargo ships circling the globe in a complex pattern. 
Nonetheless, the ISO 28000 series of standards are applicable to all modes 
of transport, air cargo included, considering all the threats within that 
industry and others. We’ll briefly introduce you to all the standards in this 
series and then profile 28002 individually.
•	 28001—Best practices for implementing supply chain security, 
assessments and plans, and requirements and guidance
•	 28002—Development of resilience in the supply chain
•	 28003—Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of 
supply chain security management systems

Emerging Risk Management Frameworks for Success  •  171
•	 28004—Guidelines for the implementation of ISO 28000
•	 28005—Electronic Port Clearance (EPC) part 1 and part 2
Published in September 2010, ISO 28002 covers security management 
systems for the supply chain and the development of resilience in the 
supply chain. Resilience is the adaptive capacity of an organization in a 
complex and changing environment. It also describes the capability of an 
organization to prevent or resist being affected by an event or the ability 
to return to an acceptable level of performance in an acceptable period 
of time after being affected by an event. This newly published standard 
attempts to provide insights into how an organization can engage in a 
comprehensive and systematic process of prevention, protection, pre­
paredness, mitigation, response, continuity, and recovery.
Jan Husdal, an early and prolific SCRM blogger, has done follow-­up 
work on these ISO standards and has provided various process maps, 
which provide us a perspective on how the standards group is looking at 
both internal and external supply chain security.6 Figure 9.1 is an illustra­
tion of one such map for ISO 28002. Husdal notes that the process maps 
are similar to the SCOR model approach.

Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
The GRC framework has been around for some time. Through discovery, 
this framework has been continuously scrutinized and criticized as some­
what ill-­defined. However, much more rigor has been spent recently review­
ing and solidly codifying this framework. The next segment attempts to 
provide some context on this subject, which we feel supports the founda­
tion for successful SCRM. The following describes the three basic tenets of 
this framework: governance, risk management, and compliance.
Governance. Governance describes the overall management approach 
through which senior executives direct and control the entire organiza­
tion, using a combination of management information and hierarchical 
management control structures. Governance activities ensure that criti­
cal management information reaching the executive team is sufficiently 
complete, accurate, and timely to enable appropriate management deci­
sion making and provide the control mechanism to ensure that strategies, 
directives, and instructions from management are carried out systemati­
cally and effectively.7 Aberdeen Group has synthesized this definition by 
saying that governance includes the frameworks and tools, policies, pro­
cedures, controls, and decision-­making hierarchy employed to manage 
the business.8
Risk Management. Risk management is a set of processes through which 
management identifies, analyzes, and where necessary responds appropri­
ately to risks that might adversely affect realization of the organization’s 
business objectives. The response to risks typically depends on their per­
ceived gravity and involves controlling, avoiding, accepting, or transfer­
ring those risks to a third party. Whereas organizations routinely manage 
a wide range of risks, commercial/­financial, information security, external 
legal, and regulatory compliance risks are arguably the key issues in GRC.
Compliance. Compliance means conforming to stated requirements. At 
an organizational level, it is achieved through management processes that 
identify the applicable requirements, defined by laws, regulations, contracts, 
polices, etc.; assess the state of compliance; assess the risks and potential 
costs of noncompliance against the projected expenses to achieve com­
pliance; and hence prioritize, fund, and initiate any corrective actions 
deemed necessary. Aberdeen Group views compliance as meeting the 
required or mandated regulations that are governmental, industry spe­
cific, or internally imposed.9

Emerging Risk Management Frameworks for Success  •  173
With much more focus on risk, many research organizations, such as 
Aberdeen Group, AMR (now Gartner), and others have revisited the GRC 
framework. It seems apparent to some that executives are viewing effective 
compliance and risk management as opportunities for corporate growth, 
keeping in mind that customers and partners will always choose to do 
business with a company possessing fewer liabilities. Furthermore, being 
aggressive in building a business is about taking risks, so by having an 
effective risk management structure in place, a company can essentially 
be bolder in addressing new market opportunities. And finally, compli­
ance is crucial in establishing new grounds for business, such as global 
or regional expansion, which requires companies to meet a strict set of 
guidelines in order for the company to conduct successful business. The 
following quote sums up well the importance of the GRC framework:
The challenges with risk management are in embedding an understanding 
of the risk management process, ownership of risks within the business, 
and the cultural change required for a truly risk-­aware decision-­making 
culture rather than being seen as a compliance obligation. To overcome 
these challenges we have been conducting risk management training for 
all staff, increasing engagement and constantly iterating in all communica­
tions that risk management is to assist the business in achieving objectives.

A set of primary objectives underlie those companies that are best-­in-­class 
in terms of utilizing the GRC framework. These companies:
•	 Drive the organizational alignment of executive and staff agendas 
through effective governance
•	 Understand risks in terms of dollar-­value impact and corporate 
brand equity
•	 Prioritize organizational initiatives based on risk type and risk level 
of severity
•	 Create additional revenue opportunities by meeting compliance 
requirements for selling into new markets/­regions
A set of strategic capabilities needed to achieve bottom-­line results from a 
GRC framework include promoting accountability within the organization

through effective communications, providing visibility and access to 
dynamic regulatory requirements, standardizing work flow for risk identi­
fication and mitigation, systematically monitoring key risk indicators, and 
centralizing risk information and data. Figure 9.2 illustrates Aberdeen’s 
profile of a best-­in-­class GRC framework. Table 9.1 provides some new

Emerging Risk Management Frameworks for Success  •  175
We will end our GRC conversation with some comments from a senior 
risk manager at McKesson, the nation’s oldest and largest health care ser­
vices company. The senior manager of IT governance, risk, and compli­
ance at McKesson provides his view about the GRC framework when he 
says that GRC is about organizational collaboration including internal 
audit, technology risk management, compliance groups, legal, and more. 
He further argues that most companies are faced with organizational 
and functional silos, poor integration, lack of visibility, wasted resources, 
unnecessary complexity, and wasted information.
Over the past few years, McKesson has acquired a number of com­
panies. Each acquisition has required McKesson to take on a new set of 
challenges in terms of developing an integrated platform. McKesson’s risk 
manager maintains it is difficult to reduce cost if you don’t have an inte­
grated view of the activities within your organization, something the GRC 
framework demands. This means sometimes you have to step away from 
the tactical tools and process controls. If your leaders are not visionary 
and don’t understand what they don’t know, this risk manager argues you 
have serious challenges ahead. The visionary leader­ship at McKesson has 
enabled the risk management team to make great strides toward an inte­
grated GRC platform. This senior risk manager argues a company must 
have visionary leader­ship, communications, an enterprise-­wide perspec­
tive, fact-­driven analytics, and stakeholder engagement to be successful. 
If a company maintains these basic GRC elements, the end result will be 
unprecedented transparency and visibility, the ability to make risk-­based 
decisions, accountability, and alignment across the business.10
RISK TAXONOMIES—AN OPERATIONAL 
FRAMEWORK FOR SCRM
We’ve mentioned several strategic frameworks that are critical success 
factors to an effective supply chain risk management discipline. To make 
managing an enterprise-­wide risk management process simple and practi­
cal, we need to take complex material, break it down, and make it acces­
sible to everyone in an organization. What is needed is the ability to build 
a more operationally oriented methodology, something we will refer to as 
a risk taxonomy. Taxonomy is the practice and science of naming, clas­
sifying, and defining relationships between resources, risks, goals, and 

176  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
business processes across an enterprise. Without risk taxonomies or a way 
to structure and classify risk events, it is difficult to understand different 
types of risks across the enterprise. And without taxonomies there is no 
common set of standards or way to manage relationships between dif­
ferent data types. If each area of the business uses its own terms to clas­
sify risk, then the aggregated information will be subjective, incomplete, 
redundant, or at best, flawed. Each silo in an organization and level within 
each silo will speak a different dialect.
The basic approach when creating a risk taxonomy is to develop a com­
mon framework for all risks, their readiness standards, and a balanced 
scorecard of objectives. To handle the complexity of a large-­scale sup­
ply chain, this approach obviously requires a tool to effectively manage 
built-­in libraries for use across the enterprise and highlight how one risk 
event in one functional area affects other functions. These tools enable 
the organization to create structured, centralized repositories of all risk 
elements within the organization. Some of these elements are risks, goals, 
requirements, relationships (vendors, customers, third parties), software 
applications, physical assets (buildings, servers, data centers, plants, equip­
ments, and tools), data repositories, people, policies, and user-­defined 
applications (models and spreadsheets). For each of these elements, tax­
onomy tools and techniques allow for flexibility and customization to 
manage cross-­functional cause-­and-­effect relationships. Some basic capa­
bilities of these taxonomy tools include the following:
•	 Creating and Maintaining a Central Repository of Information—
This could include the use of predefined fields or completely custom­
ized data elements needed by the organization.
•	 Full Document Management—This should provide the ability to 
upload documents, link them to shared applications, with a version 
control aspect and permission rights so that all information related 
to these areas can be centrally stored.
•	 Enterprise-­wide Task Management—From a more tactical per­
spective, this could provide for creating automatic reminder e-­mail 
triggers for due dates, contract renewal dates, monitoring dates, 
approvals, and change notifications.
•	 Risk Assessment Scoring—In this area, tools can provide best-­practice 
assessment factors or allow organizations to develop their own risk 
factors. With this capability, organizations can rate these elements to 

Emerging Risk Management Frameworks for Success  •  177
determine priorities and criticality. They normally allow the company 
to also enter explanations for each of the assessments, thereby codify­
ing the point-­in-­time assessment for future analysis and trends.
A risk taxonomy manages all the risk elements and links them to other 
elements within the organization to create a network of terms, defini­
tions, and resource relationships. It codifies all the things that an organ­
ization should worry about before surprises occur, manages those things 
in one place with connections to provide assurance that these elements 
are actually being done effectively to mitigate risk. And in some cases, 
taxonomy tools provide the content to alert the organization to important 
changes within an industry and to be in a position to identify who and 
what resources are connected to or impacted by an industry or compli­
ance issue.
LEVERAGING ERM, GRC, AND RISK TAXONOMIES
The importance of SCRM can’t be stressed enough, as Ericsson found 
out in March of 2000. During this period, Ericsson, a leading mobile 
phone manufacturer, experienced a disruption in supply from Phillips 
Electronics. A lightning strike caused a fire at a Phillips facility in Arizona, 
resulting in the loss of millions of microchips and rendering this supplier 
dormant. Ericsson’s production was totally disrupted because Phillips was 
the buyer’s sole supplier of microchips. This disruption resulted in $400 
million of lost sales and eventually caused Ericsson to exit the phone busi­
ness. Conversely, Nokia, Ericsson’s main competitor, had a multisource 
supplier strategy and quickly ramped up the production of microchips 
from another supplier. Nokia managed the supply chain risk and actually 
turned this risk event into an opportunity. After this risk event Ericsson 
implemented a risk management process that includes the identification, 
assessment, treatment, and monitoring of risks across its supply chain. 
The company created a corporate function called corporate risk manage­
ment that consists of a council of members in supply and sourcing as well 
as members from each business area. Ericsson also created a risk manage­
ment evaluation tool, which appears in Figure 9.3. This process looks at 
all areas of the supply chain, both internally and externally, along with 

178  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
contingency planning to analyze risk exposure. Ericsson and Nokia are 
now two of the most ardent advocates of SCRM and actually don’t talk 
much about their integrated SCRM approaches because they both con­
sider these tools, techniques, and methodologies a strategic advantage.11
Leggett & Platt, Inc., a 125-year-­old manufacturer of sleep technol­
ogy that introduced the first bedspring and now designs and produces a 
diverse array of products for homes, offices, and vehicles, took a risk more 
than 10 years ago and introduced an ERM project across its entire orga­
nization.12 In the mid-1990s, a company vice-­president attended several 
ERM classes facilitated by the RIMS organization and felt the ERM pro­
cess would benefit Leggett & Platt. However, the concept languished until 
the CFO raised the topic of implementing an ERM program. The company 
quickly formed a committee to launch the program.
The ERM committee consists of the functional heads at the corporate 
level, including the CFO, treasurer, and vice-­presidents of IT, tax, legal, 
audit, and accounting. Each functional head identified internal and exter­
nal risks in their own disciplines. They then assessed those risks in terms 
of severity and frequency. The committee continuously categorizes these 
risks, tracks them, plots them, and reports on them at every committee 
meeting. The committee now rates all risks and correlates them against 
other risks and operational key performance indicators (KPIs). Some

lessons learned include (1) risk is a big part of business and if you don’t 
take risks, you limit your potential for success; (2) taking on too much 
risk threatens a company’s survival; (3) categorize risks in terms of sever­
ity, develop treatments for those different risk issues, and overtly man­
age those risks; and (4) without an ERM framework, a company does not 
have a process that is predictable and sustainable to identify, assess, miti­
gate, and manage risk.
From a GRC perspective, one company that stands out is Bayer Crop 
Science. Led by the director of forecasting and Sales and Operations 
Planning (S&OP), the company has developed a comprehensive approach 
for managing risk throughout its global supply chain. The forum used by 
Bayer Crop Science is its S&OP process. The framework they use is the 
classic GRC framework supported by the SCOR model.13 According to 
the director of forecasting, risk management plays an integral part in the 
execution of Bayer’s S&OP process. This approach allows the business to 
get a better feel for potential dangers and the impact they may have on the 
business. Bayer Crop Science is also an advocate of the GRC framework 
presented earlier in the chapter.
Another company focusing on SCRM and exercising diligence in terms 
of developing and maintaining a risk taxonomy is Coca-­Cola. The formal 
SCRM group at Coca-­Cola is driven by three directors of supply chain 
risk. Having an actual corporate group structured to drive supply chain risk 
and led by SCRM directors is still novel. The SCRM group utilizes many 
of the SCOR model elements, which include many of the Supply Chain 
Council’s risk protocols, process maps, and metrics. The key aspect of 
Coca-­Cola’s approach to SCRM is its dedication to classifying and cat­
egorizing all risks within the company’s global supply chain. Coca-­Cola 
classifies and categorizes risks based on severity, treating risks differently, 
and maintaining a strict methodology to classify its risks. How do they do 
this? The company has built what it calls “risk registers.” Every business 
unit maintains its own risk register, every region maintains a rolled-­up or 
aggregated risk register, and every risk register is rated and compared with 
a corporate risk tolerance table before action is taken. The risk registers are 
updated and reviewed quarterly by the SCRM group. From a 50,000-foot 
level, Coca-­Cola classifies risks primarily into strategic and operational 
risks, which Figure 9.4 illustrates.
The actual risk register identification and assessment process operates as 
follows. When a risk event occurs, employees access the online, worldwide 

180  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
risk register system to first evaluate if their business unit or region has ever 
dealt with this type of risk before. If so, they immediately review all the 
pertinent information stored in the system in terms of how the business 
unit or region “treated” that risk and how long it took to mitigate the risk. 
If the unit or region has never encountered the risk, they search the world­
wide risk register system to see if another unit has encountered this risk. 
If the corporation has never encountered the risk, a call to the SCRM cor­
porate group is made, and collectively the teams begin the mitigation and 
management process. Without a diligent approach to risk taxonomy, the 
organization would not be able to quickly and effectively mitigate risks 
across the enterprise and around the globe.

Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Using annual finan­
cial results and Bloomberg market data for 361 publicly traded compa­
nies, these researchers found a statistical link between higher levels of risk 
maturity and higher relative stock price returns along with lower levels of 
stock price volatility and higher relative levels of return on equity perfor­
mance.14 The companies rated highest in maturity exhibited +18% stock 
return performance as opposed to the lowest rated companies, who dem­
onstrated a negative stock return of –10%. A second performance indica­
tor was return on equity.
Companies with the highest risk rating exhibited a return on equity 
of +37%, while organizations with the lowest rating produced a negative 
return of –11%. This differential between best and worst is the most dra­
matic metric in the study. And the researchers didn’t stop there. They took 
the financial data and subjected that data to “stress resting” by simulating 
how securities would respond in the immediate aftermath of significant 
risk events to the financial markets based on historical data.
The researchers essentially conducted “shock therapy” on the data for 
companies in the study by modeling the Japanese earthquake and tsu­
nami in 2011. Organizations with the highest maturity rating exhibited 
a stock price return of –0.3% over a certain period compared with orga­
nizations with the lowest rating exhibiting a return of –3.4%. We feel this 
speaks volumes for why companies should spend time and resources on 
ERM and other risk management frameworks. Although risk manage­
ment can be a hard sell, these numbers are convincing when it comes to a 
solid SCRM ROI.
An additional study published by RIMS asked 564 organizations to 
participate in an in-­depth assessment of ERM. The participants com­
pared their ERM activities against a comprehensive set of best practices 
and readiness indicators inside a risk maturity model. The premise of the 
study was the belief that better-­managed companies tend to have higher 
credit ratings and higher ERM competency. Credit ratings for participat­
ing companies were compared using statistical analysis to measure the 
relationship between credit rating scores and risk maturity model scores. 
The correlation coefficient was calculated for each model factor and found 
to be positive. The researchers also conducted statistical analyses that 
compared the model scores of two groups, those using ERM and those not 
using ERM. The researchers found statistical differences between the two 

182  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
groups that supported the value of ERM. Overall, the researchers’ report 
concluded the following:
•	 Organizations with formalized ERM programs have higher risk 
maturity model scores (as we would expect).
•	 Organizations with higher risk model scores have higher credit 
ratings.
•	 Organizations without formalized ERM programs have lower risk 
maturity model scores.
•	 Organizations without formalized ERM programs have lower 
credit ratings.
Additional benefits from utilizing ERM as a risk framework from the 
RIMS study include the following:
•	 Companies can avoid potential future rating agency downgrades 
and increased cost of capital since Standard & Poor’s and many other 
rating agencies have incorporated ERM into their business models.
•	 Companies can minimize the personal liability of board mem­
bers and risk of criminal charges against executives for failure to 
act responsibly in making Sarbanes–­Oxley quarterly certifications 
against fraud.
•	 Companies can meet regulators’ expectations leveraging ERM and 
in turn minimize incremental compliance costs that can negatively 
impact the bottom line.
Finally, we’d like to share some relevant statistics on benefits derived 
from utilizing GRC as a risk framework from the Aberdeen study refer­
enced earlier in the chapter.15 This study reveals that top-­performing com­
panies that leverage the GRC framework experienced a 34% reduction in 
risk value and a 23% reduction in compliance-­related costs over a two-­year 
period. Those who lag in the use of GRC are much more likely than best-­
in-­class companies to lose money on compliance investment, while best-­in-­
class GRC companies are much more likely to obtain a positive ROI from 
their compliance initiatives. And best-­in-­class GRC companies are 54% 
more likely than their competitors to systematically evaluate business pro­
cesses for compliance and 29% more likely than their competitors to con­
duct quantified risk assessments. These are compelling statistics.

Emerging Risk Management Frameworks for Success  •  183
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Part of the reason for discussing risk frameworks and taxonomies is to 
illustrate the evolving nature of SCRM into a bona fide business discipline. 
How else can we tell that SCRM is evolving into a legitimate discipline? 
Research organizations are developing supply chain risk frameworks and 
taxonomies and supporting these with research and metrics of success; 
academic organizations are starting to teach the concepts and providing 
additional research; and standards organizations are codifying standards 
around terms, definitions, processes, protocols, and measures of success. 
Furthermore, large consulting firms are writing white papers on supply 
chain risk management as Fortune 500 companies are executing those 
concepts to mitigate and even prevent supply chain risk. When this all 
occurs each and every day, it is safe to conclude that this thing called sup­
ply chain risk management just might be the real deal.
Summary of Key Points
•	 Frameworks provide a frame of reference for disciplines to operate 
successfully, whether in operations, finance, distribution, banking, 
or academia.
•	 ERM is a management framework that is critical to the success of 
SCRM. It can be leveraged to support the identification, assessment, 
mitigation, and management of strategic, tactical, and operational risks.
•	 GRC is another framework being embraced by many organizations 
to support SCRM initiatives. This framework should be considered 
an overarching approach to managing enterprise risk.
•	 The ISO organization and standards have been around since the 
1940s. It’s encouraging when a standards organization, made up of 
professionals from around the globe, begins to embrace a concept 
such as SCRM with new standards for terminology, best practices, 
security, and resiliency.
•	 A risk taxonomy is the practice and science of naming, classifying, 
and defining relationships between resources, risks, goals, and busi­
ness processes within an enterprise. Without risk taxonomies or a 
risk breakdown structure or operational risk event classification, it is 
difficult to compare different types of risks across the enterprise. This 
critical, yet sometimes neglected, success factor to SCRM provides a 

184  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
common set of standards or a methodology to manage relationships 
between different types of data and risks.
•	 Bottom-­line benefits, including hard and soft ROIs demonstrate dra­
matically why organizations embrace risk frameworks to ensure a 
successful risk management journey.

Using Probabilistic Models 
to Understand Risk
AMR research, now part of Gartner, has been speaking about the com­
plexion of the 21st century supply chain for some time, and during that 
dialogue the topic of probabilistic planning continuously arises. This 
planning process is supported by stochastic demand management and 
dynamic inventory planning.
In this chapter, we will discuss models that have been around for some 
time, such as stochastic/­probabilistic models, deterministic methods, 
discrete-­event simulation, and digital modeling. We’ll also explore how 
these methods are being leveraged to map out complex supply chains and 
how leaders are appending risk assessments to scenarios supported by 
these techniques. Next, we’ll introduce risk response planning, the logical 
outcome of stress testing complex supply chains and modeling “what-­if” 
scenarios in an effort to develop a plan to manage risk scenarios. We con­
clude with several examples that demonstrate how leading companies are 
leveraging these powerful and dynamic techniques to identify, assess, mit­
igate, and manage supply chain risks.
DEFINING THE MODELS
Stochastic/­probabilistic models are models where uncertainty is explicitly 
considered in the analysis. Furthermore, stochastic/­probabilistic models 
are procedures that represent the uncertainty of demand by a set of pos­
sible outcomes (i.e., a probability distribution) and that suggest inven­
tory management strategies under probabilistic demands.1 Stochastic 

186  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
optimization (SO) methods are optimization algorithms that incorporate 
probabilistic (random) elements, either in the problem data (the objective 
function, the constraints, etc.) or in the algorithm itself (through random 
parameter values, random choices, etc.), or in both. This concept contrasts 
dramatically with the deterministic optimization methods, such as time 
series analysis, linear programming, integer programming, the simplex 
method, and regression models where the values of the objective function 
are assumed to be exact and the computation is completely determined by 
the values developed in the equations. (Table 10.1 provides basic defini­
tions of some of the key terms used in this chapter.)
The most critical difference between probabilistic and deterministic 
models is that there is not an ounce of uncertainty explained or handled 
in deterministic tools. Therefore, the responsibility of handling any uncer­
tainty, complexity, and risk has been the responsibility of supply chain

professionals. At this point in the growth of supply chain management as a 
discipline and because of the expanded nature of uncertainty, complexity, 
and risk, it is important to use these “new” techniques to manage global 
risk. These methodologies are not new. Academia, pharmaceuticals, medi­
cal, finance, insurance, and the banking industry have been using these 
methods to evaluate and mitigate risk for more than 50 years. They are, 
however, new to the supply chain world.
With the framework established for stochastic/­probabilistic methods, 
let’s spend a brief moment describing our supply chain comfort zone in 
terms of tools.2 Supply chain professionals have been leveraging determin­
istic methods to solve supply chain problems for more than 35 years. We 
utilize time series tools to forecast sales, basically using the least squares 
method to fit a line through a set of sales or order observations and project 
anywhere from 1 to 18 or more months of future sales. We regularly track 
forecast error by comparing actual demand versus projected demand and 
handle that demand variability (i.e., risk) with inventory safety stock, buf­
fer stock, and simple brute force. We also utilize linear programming and 
the simplex method to optimize supply chain network designs by model­
ing existing and future network configurations and then optimizing an 
objective function to either maximize sales, profits or service levels, or 
minimize costs, subject to a series of constraints.
We also utilize, albeit sparingly, regression analyses to build models of 
our markets and attempt to predict sales for new product introductions, 
which are the dependent Y variables subject to independent X variables. 
And we’ve leveraged these tools to optimize revenues or minimize the 
costs associated with logistics, truck and rail scheduling, and airline oper­
ations management. While these approaches have merit, none handles 
uncertainty and risk. And in today’s volatile world, that in itself is a com­
pelling reason to act.
PROBABILISTIC VERSUS DETERMINISTIC 
MODELING TOOLS
This is a good point in our discussion to illustrate the differences between 
the two statistical methodologies and then follow up with some actual 
cases showing how probabilistic methods support the effort to man­
age risk within complex global supply chains. Think of this in terms of

weather forecasters on TV. When hurricane forecasters talk about a new 
storm, they present something they call the “cone of uncertainty,” which 
Figure 10. 1 depicts.
This cone represents a set of outcomes from probabilistic models that 
attempt to predict where a storm will travel based on probabilities of 
occurrences. Compare this approach to the traditional deterministic 
methods where there is no uncertainty within the model. The bottom of 
Figure  10.1 depicts the extremely V-­shaped solution that deterministic 
methods attempt to achieve, without uncertainty, in order to present an

optimal solution. The probabilistic method, used by weather forecasters, 
provides an approach to gain an optimal solution across a much broader set 
of solution variables within the model, explicitly addressing uncertainty.
We are beginning to witness this probabilistic methodology support­
ing scenario planning in the context of supply chain risk management 
(SCRM). What does this process look like? First, it starts by digitizing 
the entire supply chain and building a flow model of the enterprise, as 
illustrated in Figure 10.2. Supply chains are nothing more than a network 
with speeds and feeds, inputs, outputs, and processing times that can be 
digitized as dynamic flow models. Next, companies populate the model 
of the enterprise with base case data from their enterprise resource plan­
ning (ERP) system and by identifying the historical behavior and uncer­
tainty of all relevant factors. These factors include elements such as lead 
times, capacities, demand, production, inventory, quality, yields, policies, 
and more.
Companies next develop “what-­if” scenarios, or what we call hypotheses, 
that need to be reinforced or refuted, looking at scenarios such as demand 
increasing by 30%, demand decreasing by 30%, lead times increasing or 
decreasing, market share to be gained, supplier disruptions, plant dis­
ruptions, complex competitive pricing changes, geopolitical changes, oil 
price fluctuations, and more. Most probabilistic tools maintain a library 
of probability tables that indicate the probability distributions utilized 
within the scenarios. If the tools can’t capture historical data for certain 
variables, users can posit probabilities of occurrence for certain changes.
With these assumptions codified and historical data in hand, users begin 
to run discrete-­event simulations across the entire enterprise for every sce­
nario in an effort to review the cause-­and-­effect outcomes and their statistical 
strengths. The outcomes normally take the shape of histograms, sensitivity 
curves with confidence intervals and probabilities of occurrence along 
with risk assessments for each scenario, depicted on the bottom of 
Figure 10.2. This continuous running of the model, requiring several hun­
dred iterations, can continue until the outcomes, per scenario, are consid­
ered statistically significant. This task is accomplished through the use of 
sensitivity analysis, optimized response curves, and design of experiments 
(i.e., a structured and systematic Six Sigma–­oriented testing methodology 
of the process model).
The outcomes of the scenarios are next prioritized based on their 
probabilities of occurrence and their associated risk index. This novel 
approach is accelerating SCRM. By combining powerful tools, such as

probabilistic methods, digital modeling, and discrete-­event simulation, 
coupled with risk assessments for every scenario, these techniques are 
providing professionals the ability to better manage risk. The final step 
in this powerful new process is to eventually develop a risk response plan 
for the scenarios deemed critical to the enterprise covering the strategic, 
tactical, or operational horizons. This approach represents SCRM at its 
sophisticated best.
RISK RESPONSE PLANS
Industries such as oil and gas, chemicals, airlines, and pharmaceuticals and 
organizations such as the U.S. Department of Defense have been exercising 
scenario planning and supporting those scenarios with risk response plans 
for years. Formally, a risk response plan is a document defining the known 
risks including the description, cause, likelihood, costs, and proposed 
responses to risk events. It also identifies the current status of each risk.3 
Risk response plans tend to be the outcome of scenario planning exercises. 
As organizations develop scenarios to either stress test their supply chains 
in terms of exploring what-­if cause-­and-­effect relationships or go through 
exhaustive scenarios to prepare for possible risk events, risk response plans 
are the value-­added outcome of most of these risk management exercises. 
Risk response plans, as noted in Chapter 9, are one of the eight elements of 
the enterprise risk management (ERM) framework.
Some might argue that business continuity plans and risk response 
plans are similar. One key difference is that risk response plans tend to be 
outcomes of scenario planning exercises. Risk response plans are docu­
ments that profile basically what will be done if a certain risk event occurs, 
be it operational, tactical, or strategic. These plans normally consist of 
four areas:
•	 Identification of Known Risks. This involves a description about the 
nature of risks (refer to the ERM framework), the risk causes, the like­
lihood of risk occurrence as defined by the probability distribution 
and discrete-­event simulation, and the estimated cost of each risk.
•	 Identification of Risk Owners. This involves identifying what disci­
plines and who from those disciplines, including existing roles and 
responsibilities, will assume leader­ship as risk owners.

192  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
•	 Articulation of Risk Responses. This part includes the response 
plans, what everyone will do in the event of a risk event, and what 
tactics to deploy. This might also include cost/­benefit relationships.
•	 Articulation of the Measure of Successful Risk Mitigation. This 
includes the key performance indicators that reveal how well an 
organization is succeeding in mitigating a risk.
As discussed earlier, organizations that exercise scenario planning tend 
to force rank these scenarios using risk assessment techniques, which 
Chapters 12 and 13 will touch upon. They then determine the scenarios 
for which they will develop risk response plans. These risk response plans 
are then distributed, either in printed form or digitized, for distribution 
throughout a facility, division, or enterprise. This allows widespread access 
if a risk event occurs, something that should accelerate a recovery.
COMPANY EXAMPLES OF PROBABILISTIC MODELING
The following examples highlight the efforts of three leading companies to 
model risk probabilities into their risk management plans.
Scenario Planning at DuPont
DuPont, founded in 1802, has repeatedly transformed itself over its 200+ 
year history due to a culture of innovation and renewal. Today, DuPont is 
at the forefront of supply and demand chain management as it develops 
a comprehensive approach to sales and operations planning (S&OP). 
As mentioned in Chapter 3, S&OP is an essential process for balancing 
supply and demand. DuPont has been pursuing S&OP across many divi­
sions starting after 2000. With that demand/­supply balancing approach 
the company has been
•	 Relating improved demand management outcomes to business per­
formance as the driver for improved supply chains
•	 Breaking down complexity into actionable parts
•	 Addressing uncertainty with consensus planning
•	 Clearly defining and developing standard practices, knowledge, 
and resources

Using Probabilistic Models to Understand Risk  •  193
•	 Developing a global deployment methodology including diagnostics 
and a current-­to-­future-­state improvement path
•	 Measuring for results and enabling the process with systems and tools
Even with its risk management and planning capabilities, the financial 
meltdown of 2008 caught DuPont off guard. One of the reasons the com­
pany was negatively impacted, even though it operated a comprehensive, 
although somewhat traditional, S&OP process, was the company’s inward- 
rather than outward-­looking focus when engaging in supply chain plan­
ning. This inside-­out approach proved to be inadequate for responding to 
the dramatic market shifts that took place during the financial crisis. This 
experience has made DuPont one of the biggest proponents of something 
called scenario planning within the S&OP process.
Scenario planning uses probabilistic methods to evaluate and plan for 
demand events over various time horizons. DuPont is actively develop­
ing demand management scenarios with best, conservative, and most 
likely outcomes, all supported with probabilities of occurrence. To say 
that DuPont has elevated the sophistication of its risk planning game 
would be a tremendous understatement. Figure  10.3 summarizes the 
DuPont approach.
Within its S&OP process, DuPont models demand projections with 
probabilities and develops risk response plans for these demand scenarios. 
Compared with an earlier era, many of these scenarios are “outside-­in,” 
meaning they actively incorporate external events and factors that may 
impact DuPont’s supply chains. To the risk purists, this is called stress 
testing the supply chain. This approach is similar to the apparel industry, 
which uses probabilistic demand planning because of the nature of its sea­
sonal demand requirements.
DuPont routinely uses the scenario planning approach and an outside-­in 
view of its supply chains to mitigate risk within its mature S&OP process. 
A scenario planning approach to demand management is now embedded 
across many of the company’s supply chains and has fostered a concerted 
effort to elevate the importance of SCRM. Developing a functioning 
S&OP process is a good thing. Developing an S&OP process that includes 
demand projections with probabilities and risk response plans is even bet­
ter. According to a DuPont executive, “The value of this type of approach 
to demand and supply balancing and risk management, especially when 
linked to automation and facilitation, is that it helps create planning sce­
narios that are actionable and executable, not just academic exercises.”4

polymer materials and the development of innovative product solutions 
for its customers. BMS maintains more than 30 production sites around 
the globe.
BMS was encountering unacceptable levels of aged and slow-­moving 
inventory across many of its business lines, and its compounding busi­
ness wanted to significantly reduce its response times to customers in 
order to gain market share in regions they had never sold to in the past. 
Several hypotheses were established to better understand how the com­
pany’s supply chains would react if these strategies were implemented. 
BMS established a Six Sigma team of black belts and operational analysts 
to quantify these hypotheses. The team developed a project to test these 
hypotheses under the DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve and 
control) umbrella. The DMAIC methodology is the most frequently used 
framework for evaluating and improving existing processes.
The BMS team realized early on that the company’s complex manu­
facturing facilities would make it highly unlikely that the team would be 
able to test its hypotheses in live operations. Thus, attempting to execute 
trial production runs in live operations would be prohibitively expen­
sive, time-­consuming, and pose unacceptable risks to the organization. 
With that reality, the BMS team reached out to a third party to leverage 
its probabilistic/­predictive modeling capabilities to test more than 40 
hypotheses. Probabilistic/­predictive digital models supported by discrete-­
event simulation and Six Sigma frameworks such as DMAIC, design of 
experiments, and failure modes effect analysis (FMEA) create a robust 
set of approaches for qualifying and quantifying the impacts of changing 
production points, policies, and procedures inside complex manufactur­
ing environments.
The BMS team and the third-­party consultants developed a digital 
model of the company’s supply chain. The bulk of the data came from the 
company’s ERP and supply chain systems. The company did a thorough 
job of developing its hypotheses and defining the existing environment. 
This was accomplished through the use of the Six Sigma methodology 
FMEA. The Bayer team also exercised lean/­Six Sigma methods such as 
kaizen brainstorming events and value-­stream mapping.
When utilizing FMEA the team developed a comprehensive tableau 
of rows and columns depicting more than 100 independent variables 
that the team felt were impacting customer service and aging inven­
tory levels. These independent variables included elements such as the 

196  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
planning and scheduling process, sales forecasting process, partial orders, 
customer order errors, customer cancellations, overproduction, and 
missed commitments.
Each row of the FMEA tableau depicted a cause-­and-­effect relationship 
between an independent variable and the primary dependent variable, 
aged inventory. The team then established a prioritized activity impact 
profile of all variables based on three years of experience. The initial data 
were then entered into a probabilistic model in conjunction with histori­
cal orders, production, inventory, shipments, quality yields, and more. A 
digital model of the supply chain was tested for completeness through the 
use of postanalysis. This statistical validation method involves running 
hundreds of daily production schedules from actual data and comparing 
what the model predicted would happen with what actually happened. 
This resulted in a baseline that confirmed that the digital model was indic­
ative of how Bayer operated its plants over a fixed period of time.
With the define and measure stages of the DMAIC process complete, 
the teams entered the analyze phase. In this phase the team captured the 
company’s physical process, operating policies, and decision rules and 
incorporated them into the model. The team correlated operating per­
formance with historical records, evaluated and compared alternative 
process improvement scenarios, and leveraged the probabilistic model 
to evaluate more than 40 scenarios. The team also incorporated the Six 
Sigma technique design of experiments, which they wrapped around the 
digital model to ensure statistically significant cause-­and-­effect relation­
ships between the variables driving the outcomes of each scenario.
Many of the outcomes of the modeling runs were revealing, compelling, 
and at times even counterintuitive. The outcomes of the scenarios revealed 
that BMS could reduce lead times by a substantial amount to capture new 
market share; capture a significant amount of new market share without 
requiring new production capacity; increase their service levels; improve 
capacity throughput without new capital expenditures; and reduce aged 
inventory substantially while reducing working inventory as well.
Stress testing a complex supply chain before a company commits tre­
mendous resources is a testimonial to the new tools coming online to 
support increased uncertainty, complexity, and risk in global supply chains. 
Leveraging digital modeling, probabilistic tools, discrete-­event simulation, 
and risk assessment is a powerful environment to evaluate operational 
alternatives without experimenting on customers.5

Next-­Generation S&OP at Huntsman
A final example involves Huntsman and its inability to react to sources of 
uncertainty that were impacting its S&OP process. So, what did the com­
pany do? Huntsman recruited two external consultants to help identify, 
assess, mitigate, and manage the sources of uncertainty that were nega­
tively impacting the company’s supply chain.6
Huntsman is a global manufacturer of differentiated chemicals. The 
company maintains an extensive array of production sites in Europe and 
the United States. With a complex supply chain and a product portfolio 
that runs the gamut of commodity chemicals with almost no margins 
to specialty chemicals with strong margins, its S&OP process to bal­
ance demand and supply was problematic and always involved managing 
difficult trade-­offs. With a challenging operating environment to con­
tend with, Huntsman came to the conclusion that something had to be 
done to manage the overwhelming number of sources of uncertainty in 
its supply chain if the company planned to compete effectively from a 
global perspective.
Let’s get grounded a bit and talk about the company’s supply chain and 
S&OP process. At one point Huntsman had just about every deterministic 
software enabler a company could imagine to plan, source, make, deliver, 
and return goods within a complex global supply chain.7 Huntsman also 
maintained a sophisticated ERP system to take orders, make orders, ship 
orders, and bill orders. Within this IT environment, the company also 
managed a state-­of-­the-­art demand management/­forecasting tool with 
all the bells and whistles, including single, double, and triple exponential 
smoothing forecasting tools. Even today who wouldn’t want these sys­
tems? These tools and systems acted as an enabler for a large-­scale S&OP 
process covering a good portion of Huntsman’s vast product portfolio.
Huntsman was also an avid user of lean/­Six Sigma tools such as value-­
stream mapping, DMAIC, FMEA, and statistical process control charting. 
And the company maintained several new advanced planning systems 
(APSs) that took demand signals from the S&OP process and input them 
directly into the APS tools to create work plans across their worldwide 
manufacturing and distribution sites. They also maintained a huge data 
warehouse that enabled the company to slice and dice supply chain 
data into an almost infinite number of ways to support improved decision-­
making capabilities.

198  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Most observers would agree the company was operating at a sophisti­
cated supply chain level. Unfortunately, these deterministic approaches 
did not represent the next generation of risk management methodologies. 
Most of us are comfortable with what we know, and that has included 
the continued use of deterministic tools and techniques, none of which 
addresses risk. And therein was the dilemma for this large and sophisti­
cated manufacturer. The deterministic models can only take us so far.
Huntsman was clearly looking to think outside the supply chain box 
as it recruited outside experts to help the company take a risk-­oriented 
view of the supply chain and its processes in an effort to manage risk and 
improve bottom-­line results. Let’s look at how this change project began.
First, the two consultants developed several hypotheses, gathered data, 
and tested hypotheses. They attempted to identify the possible sources of 
uncertainty that were impacting Huntsman’s S&OP process. Huntsman, 
as a lean/­Six Sigma house, was already codifying many of the sources of 
uncertainties through the use of FMEA. The company was capturing all 
the known sources and then preparing frequency charts to profile these 
risks and provide insight into their cause-­and-­effect relationships. The 
consultants identified 13 sources of uncertainty impacting Huntsman’s 
supply chain and its S&OP process.
A value-­added activity from this project was taking the sources of 
uncertainty and classifying them into categories of low, medium, and 
high risk and then applying these sources of uncertainty across the three 
supply chain planning horizons. These time horizons include operational 
(0–45 days), tactical (1–18 months), and strategic (1–5 years). Figure 10.4 
reveals what risks line up where and which time horizon maintains the 
highest number of risks. Figure 10.4 reveals that a large number of risks 
reside with the S&OP horizon (1–18 months). One external assessment 
has revealed that more than 70% of companies that practice S&OP remain 
in Stage I (reacting) and Stage II (anticipating) within an S&OP matu­
rity model. Only 17% achieve Stage III (collaboration) status and a lesser 
amount achieve Stage IV (orchestrating). Clearly, there are opportunities 
for advancement here.
So, what did Huntsman do with this new-­found insight on supply chain 
risks? Essentially, Huntsman and the project team relied upon many of 
the tools and techniques discussed earlier in the chapter, particularly 
probabilistic planning, digital modeling, discrete-­event simulation, 
and risk assessment. The company tested hypotheses to determine the 

Using Probabilistic Models to Understand Risk  •  199
cause-­and-­effect relationships of many of the codified sources of uncer­
tainty and applied risk assessments to each scenario. With the outcomes 
of the modeling exercises resulting in graphical images, the Huntsman 
team was able to visualize the outcome of each scenario and discuss those 
outcomes in terms of operational improvements and risk mitigation. This 
was a powerful set of analyses.
What benefits were derived from this approach? First, Huntsman finally 
had hard data points established in terms of impacts to its supply chain 
and S&OP process through the identification of the 13 sources of uncer­
tainty. Second, the company identified several operational and tactical 
approaches they could take with minimal risk to the supply chain. This 
included moving inventory upstream for more flexibility, postponement, 
and then developing a form of risk pooling for raw materials with suppliers.
By leveraging these powerful new tools and techniques, the company 
was also able to reduce its planning cycle times by almost half and elimi­
nate the “panic-­reactive” efforts they relied on. The company also began to 
institutionalize a contingency planning approach, using the tools and tech­
niques discussed above, into the monthly S&OP process. This allowed more

scenario planning and what-­if discussions to take place inside the S&OP 
process. The end result was better mitigation of supply chain risks. Over 
time, inventory was reduced by almost half and service levels improved 
dramatically through scenario planning and subsequent risk response 
plans to mitigate risks, if and when they appeared.
Combining probabilistic tools and techniques with formal risk assess­
ment methodologies can, as demonstrated by Huntsman, effectively iden­
tify, assess, mitigate, and manage risk while improving the bottom line.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Most supply chain professionals reside in a comfort zone that is popu­
lated with deterministic models and approaches. As mentioned through­
out this chapter, these models have served a clear purpose over the last 
50 years or so, and they will continue to enjoy widespread use and refine­
ment. However, these tools were developed in an era where SCRM was 
not even an afterthought. Consequently they fail to consider the supply 
chain uncertainty that has become a way of life. If we can sum up the 
basic premise of this chapter in one phrase, it is that deterministic think­
ing must give way to probabilistic thinking. This will lead to the develop­
ment of new approaches that emphasize uncertainty. It will also lead to the 
extension of existing tools and techniques where uncertainty is explicitly 
considered in the analysis.
Summary of Key Points
•	 Stochastic/­probabilistic methods and models have been around for 
more than 50 years. Yet, supply chain management professionals are 
now just understanding that these tools and techniques can be lev­
eraged to mitigate and manage risk because they overtly take into 
account uncertainty.
•	 Many of the stochastic/­probabilistic tools and techniques support 
what-­if scenario planning approaches to evaluate uncertainty, com­
plexity, and risk within global supply chains.
•	 Emerging stochastic/­probabilistic modeling tools are being com­
bined with lean/­Six Sigma techniques such as DMAIC as a data-­
driven, fact-­based framework and also design of experiments to 

Using Probabilistic Models to Understand Risk  •  201
ensure that model outcomes are statistically significant and provide 
sensitivity curves that explain the cause-­and-­effect relationships 
within model scenarios.
•	 To manage risks in complex supply chains, leading companies will 
combine risk response plans with digital modeling to provide pow­
erful risk management frameworks.
•	 Many best-­in-­class companies that practice elements of SCRM are 
also leveraging additional lean/­Six Sigma methods such as FMEA to 
identify, codify, classify, and force-­rank risks throughout their sup­
ply chains and processes.
•	 Several leading companies in SCRM are also injecting stochastic/­
probabilistic tools and techniques along with lean/­Six Sigma methods 
into their normal S&OP processes to not only assist in supply/­demand 
balancing, but also to develop a risk assessment process to make 
informed decisions about their supply chains that take into account 
uncertainty, complexity, and risk.
•	 The methodology of leveraging digital modeling, probabilistic tools, 
discrete-­event simulation, and risk assessment is a powerful envi­
ronment to evaluate operational alternatives without experimenting 
on customers.

Using Big Data and Analytics 
to Manage Risk
By now you’ve probably heard about or have had some experience with 
something called “big data.” While we may have heard of the concept, tak­
ing advantage of the treasure trove of data that resides at most companies 
remains an evolving challenge. With an estimate of more than 15 million 
gigabytes of new information collected every day (15 petabytes), which is 
eight times the information in all U.S. libraries, it’s no wonder most com­
panies are wondering how to use big data to their advantage.1
But is using big data going to be that straightforward? A report titled 
Big Data Insights and Innovations Report revealed some findings that 
relate directly to big data and its uses.2 First, many organizations are chal­
lenged by data overload and an abundance of trivial information. And 
important data are not reaching practitioners in efficient time frames. 
Current technology is also not yet at the level of providing measurable, 
reportable, and quantifiable data in areas including production sched­
uling, inventory, and customer demand across the entire supply chain. 
Furthermore, despite the sophistication of current systems, data are not 
always easily accessible to internal users. Finally, noticeable gaps are 
present in many end-­to-­end supply chain flow models. Other than these 
“minor” issues, everything is working just fine in the world of big data and 
risk management.
In this chapter we’ll advance some definitions and an overview of big 
data and predictive analytics; talk about the process for successfully lever­
aging big data; present barriers and challenges with big data; and present 
tools, techniques, and methodologies that support big data and analytics. 
The chapter concludes with examples of companies using big data and how 
these companies are leveraging their data to help manage supply chain risk.

WHAT IS BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE 
ANALYTICS, REALLY?
To some observers big data got its start around 2003 with the advent of the 
Data Center Program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).3 
Before this, most of the early research in the late 1990s used the term data 
analytics as a key descriptor. It becomes critical to define the terms big 
data and predictive analytics.
According to the Leadership Council of Information Advantage, big 
data is not a precise term. This group sees it as data sets that are grow­
ing exponentially and that are too large, too raw, or too unstructured for 
analysis using relational database techniques. So, where is this unbeliev­
able amount of unstructured data coming from? According to one source, 
the amount of data available is doubling every two years and is emanat­
ing from not only traditional sources but also industrial equipment, auto­
mobiles, electrical meters, and shipping crates, just to name a few. The 
information gathered includes parameters such as location, movement, 
vibration, temperature, humidity, and chemical changes in the air.4
Predictive analytics (PA) encompasses a variety of techniques from sta­
tistics, data mining, and game theory that analyze current and historical 
facts to make predictions about the future. In business, predictive models 
exploit patterns found in historical and transactional data to identify risks 
and opportunities. Models capture relationships among factors to allow 
assessment of risk or potential associated with a particular set of condi­
tions, guiding decision making for specific transactions.5
Predictive analytics has been traditionally used in actuarial science, 
financial services, insurance, telecommunications, retail, travel, health 
care, and pharmaceuticals. Yet it is barely mentioned in the manufacturing 
and supply chain arenas. One of the best known and early applications of 
PA is credit scoring, which is used throughout financial services. Scoring 
models process customers’ credit history, loan applications, customer data, 
and so forth, in an effort to rank-­order individuals by their likelihood of 
making future credit payments on time. A well-­known example is the 
FICO score.
IBM, a leading provider of big data systems, maintains that more than 
90% of the data that exists in the world today was created within the last 
two years. We are in an age where more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data 

Using Big Data and Analytics to Manage Risk  •  205
are created every day! We are increasingly becoming familiar with terms 
such as follows6:
•	 gigabytes (a unit of information equal to one billion (109) or, strictly, 
230 bytes)
•	 petabytes (250 bytes; 1,024 terabytes, or a million gigabytes)
•	 exabytes (a unit of information equal to one quintillion (1018) bytes, 
or one billion gigabytes)
•	 zettabytes (a unit of information equal to one sextillion (1021) or, 
strictly, 270 bytes)
•	 yottabytes (a unit of information equal to one septillion (1024) or, 
strictly, 280 bytes)
Don’t be concerned if these definitions are confusing. They confuse 
us also.
IBM has been at the forefront of articulating the concept of big data.7 In 
one of its analyses, the company concludes that big data, which admittedly 
means many things to many people, is no longer confined to the realm 
of technology. It has become a business priority given its ability to affect 
commerce in a globally integrated economy. Organizations are using big 
data to target customer-­centric outcomes, tap into internal data, and build 
a better information ecosystem. IBM has created a topology that looks 
at big data in terms of four dimensions that conveniently start with the 
letter V.
The first dimension of big data is volume, which represents the sheer 
amount of data. Perhaps the characteristic most associated with big data, 
volume refers to the mass quantities of data that organizations are try­
ing to harness to improve decision making. As mentioned, data volumes 
continue to increase at an unprecedented rate. However, what consti­
tutes truly high volume varies by industry and even geography and can 
be smaller than the petabytes and zettabytes often referenced in articles 
and statistics.
Next, variety refers to the different types of data and data sources. This 
dimension is about managing the complexity of multiple data types, includ­
ing structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. Organizations 
need to integrate and analyze data from a complex array of both traditional 
and nontraditional information sources within and outside the enterprise. 
With the proliferation of sensors, smart devices, and social collaboration 
technologies, data are being generated in countless forms such as text, web 

206  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
data, tweets, sensor data, audio, video, click streams, log files, and much 
more. The bottom line is that data come in many forms.
The third dimension, velocity, refers to data in motion. The speed with 
which data is created, processed, and analyzed continues to acceler­
ate. Contributing to this higher velocity is the real-­time nature of data 
creation, especially within global supply chains, as well as the need to 
incorporate streaming data into business processes and decision making. 
Velocity impacts latency—the lag time between when data are created or 
captured and when they are accessible and able to be acted upon. Data are 
continually being generated at a pace that is impossible for traditional sys­
tems to capture, store, and analyze, resulting in the development of new 
technologies with new capabilities.
Finally, veracity refers to the level of reliability associated with certain 
types of data. Striving for high-­quality data is an important big data 
requirement and challenge, but even the best data cleansing methods can­
not remove the inherent unpredictability of some data, like the weather, 
the global economy, or a customer’s future buying decisions. The need to 
acknowledge and plan for uncertainty is a dimension of big data that has 
been introduced to executives to better understand the uncertain world of 
risk around big data. Veracity requires the ability to manage the reliability 
and predictability of imprecise data types.
A good portion of the data within global supply chains is inherently 
uncertain. The need to acknowledge and embrace this level of uncertainty 
is the hallmark of big data and supply chain risk management. An exam­
ple is in energy production where the weather is uncertain but a utility 
company must still forecast production. In many countries, regulators 
require a percentage of production to emanate from renewable sources, 
yet neither wind nor clouds can be forecast with precision. So, what to 
do? To manage this uncertainty, analysts, either in energy or supply chain 
management, need to create context around the data.
One way to manage data uncertainty is through something called data 
fusion, where combining multiple, less-­reliable sources creates a more 
accurate and useful set of data points, such as social media comments 
appended to geospatial location maps. Another way to manage uncer­
tainty is through advanced mathematics that embrace uncertainty, such 
as probabilistic modeling, discrete-­event simulation and multivariate, 
nonlinear analyses coupled with failure mode effects analysis (FMEA).
Most observers predict a major impact of big data and predictive ana­
lytics on the global economy. In a recent Fortune article, an expert from 

Using Big Data and Analytics to Manage Risk  •  207
Gartner suggested that over a relatively short time period, more than four 
million positions worldwide will emerge for analytic talent, of which only 
about one third will be filled.8 Dice.com has identified the Top 10 techni­
cal skills big data will need over the next several years. By a large margin 
the first is Hadoop plus Java, which is not surprising since Java powers 
Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, Google, and LinkedIn. After that it is Developer, 
NoSQL, Map Reduce, BigData, Pig, Linux, Python, Hive, and Scala.
The shortage of professional skills in Hadoop and NoSQL has given rise 
to higher pay for qualified hires, topping $100K on average. The real win­
ner here could be the U.S. economy. Anticipating a multiplier effect, one 
observer predicts that for every big data–­related role in the United States, 
employment for three people outside IT will be created.9 While the rise of 
big data presents opportunities, a shortage of qualified IT professionals 
also exposes an organization to risk.
As we conclude this overview of big data and predictive analytics, it 
would be appropriate to close this section with some key findings from 
IBM’s research into big data. First, across multiple industries, the business 
case for big data is strongly focused on addressing customer-­centric objec­
tives. Second, a scalable and extensible information management founda­
tion is a prerequisite for big data advancement. Third, organizations are 
beginning their pilot and implementation programs by using existing and 
newly accessible internal sources of data. Next, advanced analytics capa­
bilities are required, yet often lacking, for organizations to get the most 
value from big data. And finally, as organizations’ awareness and involve­
ment in big data grows, four stages of adoption emerge, which the next 
section presents.
THE PROCESS OF SUCCESSFULLY LEVERAGING 
BIG DATA FOR MAXIMUM BENEFIT
Many of the cases we describe later in the chapter maintain the hallmarks 
of supply chain analytic implementations. These hallmarks include a clear 
business problem with supporting metrics; a focus on fact-­based decision 
making and on improving business key performance indicators (KPIs); and 
the establishment of an end-­to-­end, enterprise-­wide process that is champi­
oned by C-­level management. Other characteristics include forward-­looking 
scenarios and causal analysis to understand variability and performance 

208  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
drivers without getting lost in the data. Scenarios are performed iteratively 
to demonstrate value and self-­fund subsequent improvement opportunities.
Many organizations start with spreadsheets as a proof-­of-­concept 
(POC) and then migrate to some form of business intelligence tool to 
perform more rigorous analysis. Why? According to the Hackett Group, 
world-­class procurement organizations on average spend less than 30% 
of their time compiling data, compared with 60% for the bottom-­quartile 
companies. In other words, while typical companies still compile data, 
world-­class organizations spend more of their time analyzing the data and 
making informed decisions. The CIO of a leading company argues that 
75% of the effort and cost when managing data is process reengineer­
ing and data cleansing and creation, and the other 25% is the IT portion. 
He further states that when people say their systems didn’t deliver, the 
chances are they missed the 75% part they should have been working on.
An adoption process or continuum has emerged through observation of 
big data and predictive analytic projects, or what IBM calls the Four E’s: 
Educate, Explore, Engage, and Execute.” Figure 11.1 depicts this emerging 
adoption continuum. We’ll briefly touch on the key elements of each stage.
Education is the first stage in the continuum. Its primary focus is on 
awareness and knowledge development. In this stage, most organizations 
are studying the potential benefits of big data technologies and analytics 
and trying to better understand how big data can help address impor­
tant business opportunities. Also within the first stage, the potential for 
big data has often not yet been fully recognized and embraced by busi­
ness executives. Exploration, the second stage, defines the business case 
and roadmap. Almost 50% of respondents in an IBM study report formal, 
ongoing discussions within their organizations about how to use big data

to solve important business challenges. Key objectives in this stage include 
developing quantifiable business cases and creating a big data blueprint or 
roadmap. Most organizations in this stage are considering existing data, 
technology, and skills and are contemplating where to start and how to 
develop a plan aligned with their organization’s business strategy.
Engagement, the third stage, is about embracing the value of the data. 
In this stage, organizations begin to prove the business value of big 
data as well as performing assessments of their technologies and skills. 
Companies in this stage usually have one or more proof-­of-­concept proj­
ects under way. These companies are working within a defined scope to 
understand and test the technologies and skills required to capitalize on 
the new sources of big data.
Execute is the final stage of the continuum. In this stage, big data and 
analytics capabilities are more widely operational and implemented 
within the organization. Many organizations here manage at least two or 
more big data solutions at scale, which seems to be a threshold for advanc­
ing in this stage. The companies in the execute stage are leveraging big 
data to transform their businesses and thus are deriving the greatest value 
from their information assets.
Most organizations are in the early stages of big data development. 
IBM’s research concludes that 24% of companies are focused on under­
standing the concept and have not begun the journey, while 47% are 
planning big data projects and developing roadmaps. Another 28% of 
companies are developing proofs of concept or have already implemented 
full-­scale solutions.
BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES MOVING FORWARD
The challenges to utilizing big data differ as organizations move through 
each of the four stages as featured in Figure 11.2. A consistent challenge, 
regardless of stage, is the ability to articulate a compelling business case. 
At each stage big data efforts rightfully come under fiscal scrutiny. The 
current global economic climate and supply chain risk landscape has left 
businesses with little appetite for new technology investments without 
measurable benefits. After companies begin their proof of concept, the 
next biggest challenge is finding the right skill sets to operationalize big 
data, including technical, analytical, and governance skills.

210  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
As shown in Figure 11.2, different obstacles surface as companies move 
through the continuum10:
•	 Acquisition of data. Data are available from so many sources and 
end users must constantly decide which will be useful.
•	 Choosing the right architecture. This involves balancing cost and 
performance to obtain a platform based around programming tech­
niques far different from those of the normal desktop environment.
•	 Shaping the data to the architecture. This involves spending time 
capturing, compiling, and uploading the data to be aligned with the 
architecture. With all the new technology, transforming the data can 
be a time-­consuming process.
•	 Coding. This includes selecting a programming language, designing 
the system, deciding on an interface, and being prepared for a rap­
idly changing environment.
•	 Debugging and iteration. This is the process of looking for errors in 
code, architecture, and making modifications quickly.
TOOLS, TECHNIQUES, AND METHODOLOGIES 
SUPPORTING BIG DATA
Let’s profile the techniques that are being utilized by organizations running 
big data projects. Figure 11.3 gives us a sense of the tools and techniques 
that are being leveraged. More than 75% of companies report using core

analytics capabilities, such as querying and reporting and data mining to 
analyze big data, while more than 67% report using predictive modeling.
These foundational methods are a pragmatic way to start interpreting 
and analyzing big data. The need for more advanced visualization tech­
niques increases with the introduction of big data because datasets are 
often too large for business or data analysts to view. The next highest usage 
of techniques and tool sets are optimization models and advanced analyt­
ics to better understand how to transform key business processes. Many 
organizations are embracing simulation and pattern recognition to ana­
lyze the many multivariate, nonlinear relationships within big data.
As you can see from Figure  11.3, more and more organizations are 
focusing on unstructured data to analyze text in its natural state, such 
as transcripts from call center conversations. These tools and techniques 
include the ability to interpret and understand the nuances of language, 
such as sentiment, slang, and intention. And with the tools emerging to 
analyze these new and unstructured forms of data, it’s no surprise that the 
skills to manage these techniques are in short supply. It seems apparent

that there are a host of tools and techniques emerging to support the big 
data effort. Techniques such as standard reporting, ad hoc reporting, 
query drill-­down, cloud-­based analysis, classical deterministic forecasting 
techniques, predictive modeling, simulation, optimization, pattern recog­
nition, and artificial intelligence are all coming on board at an accelerat­
ing rate.
Changing gears a bit, but still remaining in the tools, techniques, and 
methodologies arena of big data, it appears that organizations that are 
embracing Software-­as-­a-Service (SaaS), or cloud-­based technology, are 
utilizing those tools much more pervasively throughout their organiza­
tions, partly because they are able to make better use of scarce IT skills.11 We 
mentioned earlier the lack of technical skills, in house, as an obstacle. Also, 
it appears that organizations that leverage outsourced IT tools and consult­
ing skills are experiencing a much richer and more complete solution when 
compared with organizations that are not using the SaaS approach.
Here is a quick-­hit definition of the SaaS concept: With SaaS or cloud-­
based business intelligence (BI), the software itself is not licensed, owned, 
or installed by the organization. Instead, the software resides in a remote 
third-­party data center and the functionality provided by the software is 
accessed over the Internet and rented. This service is typically paid for as 
a monthly subscription.
One research group has concluded that the use of SaaS to drive big data 
analytics offers advantages across many dimensions.12 More than 60% of 
organizations using a SaaS solution were satisfied or very satisfied with ease-­
of-­use of this approach as opposed to only 41% of companies not using SaaS. 
Just over 80% of SaaS BI users have access to drill-­down to detail capability 
as opposed to 58% for non-­SaaS users. And just over 60% of SaaS BI users 
are able to tailor their solution quickly as opposed to only 41% of non-­SaaS 
users. Companies that utilize SaaS BI tools say that they can find informa­
tion they need in time to support their decisions within one hour of raw data 
being captured, or what is called time-­to-­decision and time-­to-­value, 84% of 
the time as opposed to only 70% of the time with organizations not using 
SaaS BI. Finally, organizations that use the SaaS approach are 40% more 
likely than others to exchange data openly and easily across business units. 
Other findings not mentioned here also reveal the value of Saas.
The idea of augmenting what you already have in house with third-­party 
companies is gaining traction, especially with analytics. Many companies 

Using Big Data and Analytics to Manage Risk  •  213
have packaged and outsourced supply market intelligence while others have 
developed hosted analytics tools and bundled professional services and 
analysis across the entire supply chain spectrum.
We’d like to close this section with some comments on analytics in 
manufacturing from the vice-­president of Invensys Solutions. He talks 
about big data for manufacturing by comparing big data for consumers 
and the use of Google. He says we start Google maps on our phone and it 
immediately knows where we are. We click a box and it shows the traffic 
from here to the airport. If we’re hungry, it can pull down restaurants and 
menus. Now, take this into the supply chain arena. All that information is 
available, but instead of restaurants, we’re looking for the best batch, opti­
mal production run, and more. A good analytics manufacturing system 
has to show what is out there, display the information that is available, 
interpret what it means, how to react to it, and then help predict what is 
coming next.
HOW EARLY ADOPTER COMPANIES LEVERAGE BIG DATA
With a broad definition of big data now established, we want to provide 
examples of industries that are leveraging big data for competitive advan­
tage. In this section we’ll touch on several industries and dig a bit deeper 
into a few name-­brand companies that are leveraging this approach for a 
competitive advantage.
During our initial evaluation of the big data landscape, we speculated 
that there might be an industry that is far and away the leader in leveraging 
big data for competitive advantage. With that hypothesis, we attempted to 
gather data and profile the use of big data by industry. The hypothesis that 
one industry might dominate the landscape is far from reality. The top 
four industries within our sample that use big data are consumer pack­
aged goods (CPG)/grocery (16% of firms), electronics (10%), automotive 
assembly (10%), and energy (10%). All other industries were 7% or less. 
It’s evident that these industries are leading the way toward leveraging 
predictive analytics to solve operational problems, followed by additional 
industries beginning their use of big data. Overall, we have a long way to 
go before the use of big data becomes routinized.

214  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Consumer Packaged Goods
A large multibillion dollar CPG company with razor-­thin margins was 
facing highly volatile commodity prices on the supply side of its business 
and unforgiving, price-­sensitive retailers on the demand side. The compa­
ny’s approach was to develop an integrated Sales & Operations Planning 
process and link it to the supply market by integrating supply market 
intelligence and purchase price forecasts. The company used this forward-­
looking supply intelligence to create robust scenarios, perform additional 
analyses, and then optimize all options associated with each scenario. 
It attempted to mitigate risk by finding substitute materials, modifying 
specifications, reconfiguring its product mix, changing its supply chain 
network and delivery methods where possible, hedging on the financial 
side, as well as modifying strategies throughout the planning horizons. 
This effort resulted in minimizing millions of dollars of product/­customer 
profit erosion and more robust, predictable strategies.
Dell Computers
Most of us know that Dell is a company in transition. After dominating 
the enterprise PC market for decades, the Texas-­based configure-­to-­order 
manufacturer is making a definitive move away from the product side of 
the business and toward services and solutions. Unfortunately, over the 
past decade, Dell’s strategy, options, and variants in models, software con­
figurations, memory, screens, and other customizable features has resulted 
in over seven septillion possible configurations of Dell’s products! A sep­
tillion is equivalent to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Obviously, product 
portfolio complexity had become a major risk for the company.
To trim its product portfolio Dell began to utilize its abundance of big 
data. A Dell team created a new system called optimized configuration. 
Dell’s analytics team clustered high-­selling configurations from histori­
cal data to create technology roadmaps. The team also created automated 
algorithms to identify what configurations Dell should build to order and 
what Dell should produce for inventory. The analysis leveraged historical 
data and ran cluster analysis to identify the most common configurations 
sought by customers.
Clustering around commonality of product ordering allowed Dell 
to trim the seven septillion options to several million and provided 
the company’s marketing and supply chain teams with agreement on 

Using Big Data and Analytics to Manage Risk  •  215
preconfigured products built for inventory and ready to ship. This new 
supply chain strategy, driven by data analysis, also supports the company’s 
make-­to-­order strategy.
Still another use of big data at Dell has been inside the company’s online 
ordering system. Dell’s business intelligence team ran analytics on click 
stream data, tracing every move and path taken by customers. The out­
come showed that customers navigate through more than 40 clicks to 
place an order. The team used that information to optimize the site and 
reduce the number of clicks to five.
Western Digital
Western Digital, a global manufacturer of disc drives, is obsessed with 
quality. To serve that obsession the company has transformed its manu­
facturing process to allow scanning, recording, testing, and tracking of 
every disc drive produced while still on the production line. By running 
real-­time shop-­floor analytics, the company can locate and remove non­
conforming discs before they reach the customer. Even if a disc passes 
an initial analytical review, if further analysis reveals a problem, the disc 
can be located and pulled from inventory bins. This capability, supported 
by big data, has resulted in the lowest warranty return rate in the entire 
industry. It has also helped make Western Digital the supplier of choice for 
many computer manufacturers.
Harley Davidson
Harley Davidson, the king of the hogs, introduced software that tracks 
even the minutest details on the assembly floor, such as the speed of fans 
in the painting booths. When the software detects that the fan speed, 
temperature, or humidity has deviated from the optimal settings, it auto­
matically adjusts the operations. This allows a consistency on the shop 
floor by staying within preestablished parameters. The software has also 
been used to identify bottlenecks on the assembly floor. One of Harley’s 
goals is to complete a motorcycle every 86 seconds. A recent study using 
shop floor data revealed that the rear fender assembly time was taking 
longer than planned. The company changed the factory configuration 
so the fenders would flow directly to the assembly line rather than being 
placed on carts and moved across the floor. This is but one example of how 

216  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Harley Davidson is using big data to streamline its operations and avoid 
operational risk.
Raytheon
Raytheon, a household name in the aerospace/­defense manufacturing 
arena, is betting on big data to reduce the risk of quality and operational 
problems. In its Huntsville, Alabama, missile plant, if a screw is sup­
posed to be turned 13 times after it is inserted but instead is turned only 
12 times, an error message flashes and production of the missile or com­
ponent stops. “Manufacture of a missile is either right or it’s not; there’s no 
in between,” says a Raytheon executive. Many manufacturers are install­
ing sophisticated automated systems to gather and analyze shop floor 
data, known as manufacturing execution systems (MES). Manufacturers 
are looking harder at data partly because of increasing pressure from cus­
tomers to eliminate defects and from shareholders to squeeze out addi­
tional cost and mitigate risk to the brand. These new capabilities mean 
Raytheon is catching more flaws as they occur. Raytheon also keeps data 
for each missile, including the names of all the machine operators who 
worked on any part of it, as well as the humidity, temperature, and more 
at each workstation.
The system is designed to prevent any operator from performing a task 
for which he or she is not certified. According to Raytheon, leveraging 
big data systems is a form of risk mitigation and management. Millions 
of dollars have been spent in the past to rework items that did not meet 
specifications. If Raytheon’s experience is any indicator, cost containment, 
real-­time event monitoring, and process optimization are but a few of the 
key drivers supported by big data. Tracking physical items and people 
throughout the supply chain, capturing and acting on streaming data, and 
enabling faster reaction to specific problems before they escalate in major 
situations is becoming the norm rather than the exception.
European Electrical Utility
A major European electric utility company sought to improve the man­
agement of budgeted versus actual spend for nonfeedstock and indirect 
spending. It wanted a single system that separated consumption varia­
tion, within a contract and across contracts, external market pricing 
variation, and procurement-­led pricing impacts. The company used a 

Using Big Data and Analytics to Manage Risk  •  217
third-­party tool for spend analysis and procurement performance analysis. 
These data were cross-­referenced against an external database with thou­
sands of price indexes. This approach of combining internal and external 
data and benchmark indexes allowed for fact-­based discussions and deci­
sion making for continuous improvement in its cash flow management.
This approach confirmed that analytics works best when integrated 
with external information. The utility company concluded that integrat­
ing internal and external data through the use of big data analytics is 
an enabler for managing supply risk, supplier risk, regulatory risk, com­
petitive risk, and intellectual property risk. Managing these risks should 
include analytical approaches such as scenario planning, Monte Carlo/­
probabilistic modeling to quantify the probability of occurrence and 
impact, segmenting and visualizing risk using heat maps, and predictive 
analytics to manage risk.
Schneider
Schneider National, a $3 billion transportation and logistics company, has 
developed a computer model that mimics human decision making, help­
ing the company to assign trucks and drivers in the most cost-­effective 
way possible. At any given time, Schneider has 10,000 trucks on the road 
with over 30,000 trailers waiting to be picked up or delivered. Drivers work 
alone or in pairs, and Schneider must get them back home by a certain 
date and time. Drivers also need to conform to the government’s hours-­
of-­service regulations regarding rest periods and breaks.
With the help from several Princeton University researchers, Schneider 
developed a simulator utilizing dynamic programming, which takes into 
account the presence of uncertainty. The simulator, which took two years 
to develop, runs forward in time for three weeks to approximate the value 
of having a truck and driver at a certain location at a certain time. The out­
put from the report is a called a first-­pass cost estimate. The tool then runs 
backward in time, something called postanalysis, to reconcile the past 
results with those that were determined in the future estimate. The simu­
lator then runs forward again for three weeks and then backward as it 
seeks to improve the total cost estimates. This forward–­backward process 
encompasses hundreds of thousands of iterations.
Schneider estimates its big data tool has saved the company tens of 
millions of dollars as well as increased revenue by justifying price hikes 
to customers with specific service-­level constraints. The simulator also 

218  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
provides a quantifiable methodology to exercise what-­if analyses, such as 
determining the marginal value of hiring new drivers in a certain region 
to handle growing volume. Moving forward, Schneider expects to use the 
simulation tool to help identify new businesses to pursue. As an opera­
tions research analyst at Schneider says, “The tool is so powerful that when 
someone presses us on the impact of different customer policy changes, 
we have the facts and we have the data. The value of this big data tool is 
to be able to take these complex business issues and opportunities and 
give them a good, solid analysis.”13 Schneider understands clearly the link 
between data management and strategic risk management.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Few should disagree with the notion that big data and predictive analyt­
ics are here to stay. Big data, predictive analytics, and many of the tools 
and techniques discussed in this chapter and in Chapter 10 are provid­
ing approaches for codifying, classifying, analyzing, and acting on vast 
amounts of data, most of which is the size many of us have never dealt 
with in our professional careers. We’ve witnessed an increasing number 
of companies that have leveraged their data and predictive analytics to 
solve complex supply chain, manufacturing, and customer-­centric issues 
to enhance revenue, reduce cost, improve asset utilization, and reduce 
supply chain risk.
A study by the Aberdeen Group reinforces the finding that top per­
formers are making advanced analytics activities a priority to take con­
trol of manufacturing complexity and supply chain risk. This is a good 
thing since uncertainty, complexity, and risk continue to grow globally. 
Research reveals that the companies that are best at leveraging big data 
average a 19% year-­over-­year increase in operating profit as opposed to 
only a 9% increase for all other companies. And 80% of companies that are 
the best at leveraging big data have witnessed improvement in the cycle 
times of their key business processes over a one-­year period, as opposed to 
47% for average companies and 39% for laggard companies.14 Increasingly, 
the ability to compete successfully as well as manage supply chain risk will 
rest upon a company’s ability to leverage big data and predictive analytics.

Summary of Key Points
•	 The Leadership Council of Information Advantage sees big data as 
data sets that are growing exponentially and that are too large, too raw, 
or too unstructured for analysis using relational database techniques.
•	 Predictive analytics (PA) encompasses a variety of techniques from 
statistics, data mining, and game theory that analyze current and 
historical facts to make predictions about the future.
•	 IBM has created a topology that looks at big data in terms of four 
dimensions: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity.
•	 One way to manage data uncertainty is through data fusion, where 
combining multiple, less-­reliable sources creates a more accurate and 
useful set of data points. A second way is through advanced math­
ematics that embrace uncertainty.
•	 World-­class procurement organizations on average spend less 
than 30% of their time compiling data, compared with 60% for the 
bottom-­quartile companies. World-­class organizations spend more 
of their time analyzing the data and making informed decisions.
•	 An adoption process or continuum has emerged through observa­
tion of big data and predictive analytic projects, or what IBM calls 
the 4-Es: Educate, Explore, Engage, and Execute.
•	 Foundational methods are a pragmatic way to start interpreting and 
analyzing big data, but the need for more advanced visualization 
techniques increases with the introduction of big data because data­
sets are often too large for business or data analysts to view.
•	 Consumer packaged goods (CPG)/grocery, electronics, automotive 
assembly, and energy are the four industries leading the way toward 
leveraging predictive analytics to solve operational problems.

Emerging Risk Management Tools, 
Techniques, and Approaches
This chapter presents a variety of emerging tools, techniques, and 
approaches to address and manage supply chain risk. They appear here 
because they are not fully developed or implemented at most firms. The 
approaches we present include becoming a preferred customer, creating 
supply chain heat maps, mapping the supply chain, declustering clusters, 
creating a flexible supply chain, creating a risk war room, and managing 
operational working capital. Other emerging approaches, including total 
cost measurement, estimating available supplier capacity, and calculating 
risk scores, appear elsewhere in the book.
BECOME A PREFERRED CUSTOMER
Supply chain leaders understand that the link between positive relation­
ships with suppliers and improved corporate performance is a strength­
ening rather than weakening one. Companies that fail to develop positive 
relationships may find their suppliers allocating limited capacity to other 
firms, sharing their most innovative ideas with other customers, or exiting 
an industry segment altogether, all of which will lead to increased risk. As 
our research clearly shows, becoming the preferred customer to suppli­
ers offers advantages that are not as readily available to other customers, 
advantages that could lead to future competitive advantage and reduced 
risk.1 As one executive summed up clearly during a research interview, 
“Becoming a preferred customer is going to be one of the best ways we 
have to manage supply chain risk in the future.”

222  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
A research project involving hundreds of suppliers revealed a clear link 
between a customer’s (i.e., the buyer) behavior, the satisfaction level a sup­
plier has with a customer, and a supplier’s willingness to provide preferen­
tial treatment that less-­satisfied suppliers are not willing to provide. The 
following summarizes three important findings from that research.
Supplier satisfaction relates directly to a customer’s performance and 
behavior rather than demographic or other attributes.
Supplier satisfaction correlates significantly with factors that relate to a 
customer’s behavior toward the supplier (i.e., pay on time, share relevant 
information, treat suppliers ethically, etc.) rather than demographic or 
other factors such as supplier size or the size of a contract. Interestingly, 
a slight negative correlation exists between the total years a supplier has 
worked with the customer and lower satisfaction with that customer, 
which presents clear risk implications.
No statistical relationship exists between the size of a supplier in terms of 
sales and supplier satisfaction with the buying customer. Furthermore, no 
relationship exists between the size of the contract relative to the supplier’s 
total sales and supplier satisfaction with the buying customer. Supplier 
satisfaction relates directly to customer performance and behavior rather 
than the volume of sales that the customer represents. This is welcome 
news because it suggests customers can change their behavior to improve 
supplier satisfaction, thereby leading to preferred customer benefits.
The relationship between supplier satisfaction and viewing a customer 
as preferred is extremely strong.
The correlation between supplier satisfaction and viewing a customer as 
preferred is unusually strong. This strong indicator reveals a clear link 
between satisfaction and preferred customer status. An important conclu­
sion is that becoming a preferred customer will likely not occur if a sup­
plier is dissatisfied with a buying customer.
Satisfied suppliers are more willing to provide valuable kinds of pref­
erential treatment to their preferred customers compared with less-­
satisfied suppliers.
A clear statistical relationship exists between supplier satisfaction with 
a customer and the willingness of that supplier to provide certain (and 
valuable) kinds of preferential treatment. What is surprising is that in 

Emerging Risk Management Tools, Techniques, and Approaches  •  223
many cases the preferential treatment that satisfied suppliers are most 
willing to provide to their preferred customers are the kinds of treatment 
that suppliers overall are least willing to provide. Preferred customer sta­
tus brings with it preferential treatment that is not available to a typical 
customer, benefits that can contribute to a hard-­to-­duplicate competi­
tive advantage and reduced supply chain risk. Figure 12.1 identifies the 
supplier-­provided outcomes that suppliers may potentially provide to 
their most-­preferred customers.
Gaining Preferred Customer Status
We know that gaining preferred customer status can bring with it some 
hard-­to-­duplicate advantages that have clear risk management benefits. 
The question becomes how a buying company can become a preferred cus­
tomer to suppliers. The following provides some guidance about how to 
achieve preferred customer status.
Understand How Suppliers Perceive Your Company as a Customer. 
How can a buying company improve its relationships and receive pref­
erential treatment from suppliers if it does not know in what areas it is 
doing well and where it is falling short? Gaining this insight requires a 
• Capacity dedicated to the
customer
• Personnel to work directly at the
customer’s facilities
• Engineers to support the
customer’s product design needs 
• Investment in new equipment
that beneﬁts only the customer
• Exclusive use of new technology
developed by the supplier
• Hold inventory to support the
customer’s needs
• Provide direct ﬁnancial support
if needed
• Create information technology
systems unique to business with
the customer
• Product innovation
• Production process
innovation
• Process and supply chain
innovation other than
production processes
• Shorter quoted lead times
• Preferential scheduling of orders
• Early insight into the supplier’s
future product technology plans
• More favorable payment terms
• Performance improvement ideas
• More frequent deliveries
• Access to the supplier’s executive
level personnel
• Access to supply market
information the supplier
may possess
• Better pricing
• First allocation of output if
supplier capacity is constrained
• Early warning to potential supply
problems

commitment from the highest levels of the supply organization to solicit 
supplier-­provided feedback. Companies often use third parties to collect 
information from suppliers to ensure the integrity of the process.
Pursue Trust-­Based Relationships with Suppliers. Few would ques­
tion the importance of trust within a buyer–­seller relationship. Industrial 
customers can demonstrate their trustworthiness through open com­
munication with suppliers, following through on promises and commit­
ments, sharing relevant supply chain information, and acting legally and 
ethically in all business dealings. The importance of ethics and protecting 
proprietary information within a trust-­based relationship is also critical. 
One outcome from a customer’s relationship efforts should be the pur­
suit of activities that promote frequent contact, particularly since com­
munication frequency and the level of trust within a relationship are 
highly correlated.
Recognize the Importance of Knowledgeable Personnel and a Stable 
Workforce. Our research with suppliers reveals that more than 90% of 
suppliers agree it is “very important” that the personnel they deal with at 
their customer are knowledgeable. Maintaining supply knowledge will be 
a challenge, for example, as the baby boomer generation exits the work­
force. This exodus will require a set of talent management strategies that 
focus on acquiring and then retaining personnel with the right set of capa­
bilities, including knowledge about how to manage supply chain relation­
ships and risk.
Avoid the Seven-­Year Itch. Various research studies have concluded that 
the satisfaction that suppliers have with their industrial customer tends to 
decline the longer the supplier has worked with that customer. The inflec­
tion point for this downward shift often occurs around the seven-­year 
point of the relationship. The challenge becomes one of recognizing that 
this downward shift is a real possibility and then developing an action 
plan to ensure this shift does not occur. If a downward shift has occurred, 
the challenge becomes one of reenergizing the buyer-­seller relationship.
Request Preferential Treatment. We know that satisfied suppliers are 
willing to provide preferential treatment to their most favored customers. 
The task becomes one of understanding how to obtain that treatment. One 
time to address this subject is during contract negotiations, particularly 
when crafting a supplier’s statement of work. Another time is during 
annual supplier review meetings, meetings that suppliers recognize as 
extremely valuable. Suppliers also indicate a strong willingness to engage 
in various forms of executive-­to-­executive interaction and participate in 

Emerging Risk Management Tools, Techniques, and Approaches  •  225
buyer–­supplier councils that feature executive-­level engagement between 
the customer and key suppliers.
Tap into Supplier Innovation. A variety of ways exist to tap into sup­
plier innovation. These include early supplier involvement during prod­
uct and technology development, technology demonstration days where 
suppliers are encouraged to showcase their new ideas, and supplier par­
ticipation on customer improvement teams. If innovation is the lifeblood 
of growth, then it becomes a competitive necessity to tap into sources of 
innovation wherever they exist.
Never discount the important relationship between being a preferred 
customer to suppliers and reduced supply chain risk exposure. The sta­
tistical linkages between supplier satisfaction, preferred customer status, 
and preferential treatment are unambiguous.
CONSTRUCT SUPPLY CHAIN HEAT MAPS
As the concept of supply chain risk management (SCRM) began to solid­
ify into a body of knowledge and then courseware, several major beliefs 
evolved into a set of questions-­of-­discovery regarding the maturity of the 
supply chain. As these tenets began to solidify, a mechanism to review, 
evaluate, and position a company’s maturity in supply chain excellence 
and design took shape in terms of a spider diagram. This diagram profiles 
a company’s supply chain maturity, which then relates to the risk associated 
with that maturity. This has evolved into a supply chain risk awareness 
heat map. The heat map involves a set of about 100 questions-­of-­discovery 
across 10 areas in an end-­to-­end supply chain. The answers provide a 
glimpse into a company’s exposure to supply chain risk. The spider dia­
gram provides a relative profile of red (high), yellow (medium), and green 
(low) levels of risk.
Heat map users can download a cloud-­based tool and answer a set of 
self-­assessment questions. The resulting heat map provides, potentially for 
the first time ever, a view into a company’s risk across its entire supply 
chain. Some of the areas evaluated within the map include leader­ship, bal­
ance scorecards, information technology, sales and operations planning 
(S&OP) processes, supply chain techniques, supply base, and logistics. The 
heat map is an awareness technique that starts a dialogue about supply 
chain risk. Part of its value is that many companies do not maintain an 

226  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
integrated approach to supply chain management. These companies still 
have a tremendous amount of suboptimization within silos of the orga­
nization and a lack of supply chain visibility. This tool is used to establish 
an enterprise-­wide picture of a company’s supply chain and risks through 
questions-­of-­discovery answered by representatives from multiple disci­
plines. The appendix of this book provides more detailed insight into this 
powerful and emerging approach to SCRM.
MAP THE SUPPLY CHAIN
A supply chain map is a graphical representation of a firm’s tier-­one and 
subtier suppliers for any purchased item, whether it is a finished prod­
uct, system or assembly, or component. Better maps will also include the 
downstream portion of the supply chain. Intuitively, supply chain mapping 
makes sense from a number of perspectives. Unfortunately, just because 
something makes sense does not mean it will be performed. Mapping is 
still an emerging risk management technique at most firms. And those 
that do map their supply chain usually map only a portion of it.
No standard nomenclature specifies what a supply chain map should con­
tain or look like. This is in contrast to project management or lean manage­
ment, where the tools and techniques are well established. Different kinds 
of maps exist, many of which are best described as the homegrown variety. 
Because SCRM is an evolving discipline, it will take time to converge on 
a set of tools and approaches, something that is characteristic of mature 
disciplines, or for third parties to enter the market with mapping products.
A mapping technique that is probably the most frequently used is the links 
and nodes approach. Links and nodes is a fairly common approach when 
designing or modeling a supply chain network. Some companies simply apply 
this technique to their mapping efforts. Nodes are the entities within a sup­
ply chain, such as suppliers, distributors, customers, other channel members, 
and the focal company. Links represent flows and are represented by solid or 
dotted lines. Flows include material, services, funds, and information.
Challenges When Mapping a Supply Chain
The growth of supply chain mapping as a risk management technique faces 
various challenges. For companies with a large supply base or complex 

Emerging Risk Management Tools, Techniques, and Approaches  •  227
product structures, the maps become intricate very quickly. A supply base 
with hundreds of tier-­one suppliers will have thousands of tier-­two and 
tier-­three suppliers as part of the chain. The same holds true for the down­
stream supply chain entities as we move toward the final customer.
Another challenge is that many companies are not that concerned with 
what transpires past their first-­tier suppliers. This is due partly to benign 
neglect and the fact that supply chain mapping is an intensive work pro­
cess. A third challenge is that some suppliers are not willing to release 
their bill of material data to customers or reveal their supply sources, mak­
ing it difficult to identify subtier suppliers.
A fourth challenge involves determining the right kind of maps to 
develop. Some maps are so high level, such as industry-­level maps, that they 
lack the insight required to use them for effective risk management. At the 
other extreme, a supply chain map may contain so many connections and 
nodes and so much information that they become difficult to understand. 
The map may look like something an energetic 3-­year-old created using a 
box of crayons. A final challenge is that supply chains constantly evolve. 
Like total cost models, a topic addressed in Chapter 13, supply chain maps 
must be kept up-­to-­date. This requires a disciplined work effort.
Supply Chain Mapping Guidelines
The point of this discussion is not to show how to create detailed sup­
ply chain maps. Whatever specific technique we feature could always be 
replaced with another technique. Rather, our objective is to present a set 
of guidelines, in no particular order of importance, that will help when 
developing supply chain maps.
•	 Don’t forget the demand chain. Most supply chain maps focus on 
suppliers because the procurement group tends to be responsible for 
developing supply chain maps. Why not use the map to support sup­
ply chain integration efforts between the supply and demand sides of 
the supply chain? It is difficult to come up with a logical reason why 
companies should ignore the demand side of the supply chain when 
developing maps.
•	 Include geographic locations. Similar to the argument presented in 
the previous paragraph, it is difficult to come up with a logical reason 
why companies should not include the geographic locations of sup­
ply chain entities. These are, after all, called maps. The next emerging 

228  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
approach presented in this chapter, cluster analysis, will benefit 
greatly from the availability of supply chain maps that include geo­
graphic locations.
•	 Suppliers and sites should be different entities in supply chain 
maps. Supplier corporate locations and shipping locations may be 
different entities. In fact, a single supplier may use numerous sites to 
support a buyer’s operations. When this is the case, special designa­
tions should treat sites as a separate entity from the corporate entity. 
Also, logistical providers and their sites should be part of the map.
•	 Insert hyperlinks in the map to connect to additional information 
and data. A major debate with maps centers on their complexity and 
detail. Hyperlinks will help simplify maps while providing access 
to detailed data and information about supply chain entities. These 
links may take a user to Dun & Bradstreet reports, commodity or 
supplier databases, alerts, supplier performance history and score­
cards, and third-­party reports, to name a few possibilities.
•	 Use a product’s bill of material (BOM) as a guide when develop­
ing supply chain maps. A bill of material is essentially a map of a 
product’s structure and “recipe.” BOMs provide an excellent plat­
form from which to extend that information into a supply chain 
map. In a perfect world, internal users would be able to click an 
item on a product’s bill of material and see a fully developed supply 
chain map.
•	 Include more than material flows in the map. Supply chain maps 
should also consider information and financial flows. This can be 
accomplished by different designations that represent linkages 
within the supply chain. For example, the flow of funds may be rep­
resented by a dotted rather than solid arrow.
•	 Use college interns when developing maps. Given the workload 
required to develop supply chain maps, it makes sense to remove the 
day-­to-­day work effort from the main flow of an organization’s work.
•	 Don’t ignore interrelationships among firms in supply chain 
maps. A supply chain entity may be part of a supply chain map for 
another product or business unit within your company, which the 
map should consider. Or, your customer’s customer may also be a 
critical supplier. These interrelationships are what turn supply chains 
into supply networks.

Emerging Risk Management Tools, Techniques, and Approaches  •  229
•	 Gain visibility to subtier supply chain entities. Insisting on visibil­
ity to a tier-­one supplier’s suppliers should be a contracting require­
ment, assuming the buyer has some semblance of power over the 
supplier. Almost by definition, world-­class companies would never 
relinquish their understanding of the origin of components or other 
items that make up their final product. Apple, for example, main­
tains clear visibility and control of its extended, multitier supply 
chain without owning any of it.2
•	 Share the work burden. Part of the evaluation process of tier-­one 
suppliers can be an assessment of how well these suppliers map their 
supply chain. And if your tier-­one suppliers insist that their tier-­
one suppliers (your tier-­two suppliers) map their supply chain, you will 
gain visibility well into your supply chain downstream. In reality, this 
level of supply chain integration rarely happens this way. That is why 
major parts of the supply chain mapping process are still emerging.
DECLUSTER THE CLUSTERS
Anyone who follows the work of Harvard’s Michael Porter appreci­
ates the connection between business or industry clusters and competi­
tive advantage. Porter defines a cluster as geographic concentrations of 
linked businesses that enjoy unusual competitive success in their field. 
Compared with market transactions among dispersed buyers and sellers, 
the repeated exchanges between firms in a cluster promote trust, inter­
dependence, coordination, innovation, and communication.3 Clusters 
affect competition by increasing the productivity of companies in the 
area, driving the direction and pace of innovation, and stimulating the 
formation of new businesses, which expands and strengthens the cluster.4 
In the supply chain space we also have logistics clusters, which are defined 
as communities that bring together a broad range of supply chain services 
and deep expertise.5
Many examples of clusters exist—movie production in Hollywood, high-­
technology companies in Silicon Valley, the domestic U.S. automotive 
industry in Detroit, business process service providers in India, and finan­
cial services in New York City. And for those of us who might need a little 
touch-­up, hundreds of plastic surgery clinics have clustered around the 

230  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
“beauty belt” in an upscale Seoul, South Korea, neighborhood. Service pro­
viders around this cluster also provide special services for visitors, includ­
ing hotel accommodations, airport pickups, and multilingual websites.6
From a risk management perspective it makes sense to think about 
declustering the clusters. What does declustering mean? Perhaps fore­
most, declustering requires having a solid knowledge of the location of the 
most important entities in your supply chain, including critical subtier 
suppliers. One approach is to color code the different nodes in a supply 
chain. Subtier supplier, first-­tier suppliers, internal manufacturing sites, 
contract manufacturers, ports and other logistical centers, and distribu­
tors will each have a color assigned. Next, create a color-­coded global map. 
Are your imported items arriving through a single port? Do all of your 
exports move through the same logistical network? Are a large number 
of your suppliers clustered together geographically? Are you relying on a 
single distributor location? Are your clusters located near areas known for 
hazard risk, including earthquake fault lines, tornadoes, flood plains, and 
hurricanes? A buying company may have its own supplier cluster simply 
because it relies on suppliers that are located in the same general vicinity.
The next step in the declustering process is to develop risk management 
plans that address any cluster-­related risks. This can involve creating flex­
ible supply chains (a concept that is discussed shortly), requiring suppliers 
to have multiple production locations that are not located near each other, 
qualifying multiple suppliers, and relying on more than a single logistical 
center for processing imports and exports. A well-­known U.S. electronics 
company conducted a cluster analysis and realized it was using a single 
port in China to process all of its Chinese imports and a single port in 
the United States to receive those imports. This company now relies on 
more than one Chinese and one U.S. port.
Clustering Gone Wild
A prime example of the downside of clusters involves the massive flood­
ing that occurred in Thailand, a region that featured 45% the world’s hard 
drive production. While clusters certainly have redeeming qualities, less 
mentioned is their potential dark side. One only has to look at Thailand 
and the flooding that essentially wiped out a large portion of the elec­
tronics hard-­drive industry. Chapter 5 examined this catastrophe from a 
hazard perspective.

Emerging Risk Management Tools, Techniques, and Approaches  •  231
Before profiling the financial impacts of the flood, let’s talk about the 
back story. At some point multinational companies concluded, after tak­
ing into account labor, taxes, freight, logistics, and government incentives, 
that costs in Thailand’s made it an appealing location. If someone had 
taken the time to develop a complete supply chain map with a 100-mile 
radius, he or she might have noticed that many suppliers, particularly in 
the computer hard drive industry, were located in a 100-year flood plain. 
Actually, some must have recognized this minor detail since some sup­
plier facilities were built 6–10 feet above the flood plain. Although those 
plants did not get flooded directly, it became impossible to move material 
in and out of these facilities.
The impact from this flood was, unfortunately, impressive in its scale. 
More than 660,000 people were forced out of work and 9,859 factories 
were shut down. In the auto industry, 6,000 automobiles per day were 
not built. In the camera industry, Nikon eventually lost $786 million in 
sales; Canon had $604 million in lost sales; and Sony had recovery costs of 
$107 million in a single quarter. And in the computer hard drive industry, 
iMac launches were delayed and hard drive prices skyrocketed by 100%.
Many foreign companies, having witnessed firsthand the risk of locat­
ing too much of their production and supply chain in one location, have 
shifted production to countries other than Thailand. Western Digital 
Corporation, a U.S. company that is one of Thailand’s largest employ­
ers, moved some hard-­disk drive component manufacturing to Malaysia. 
The company also asked some of its suppliers to take similar steps. Nidec, 
a company based in Japan, shifted part of its production of hard-­disk drive 
motors to China and the Philippines.7 These are not isolated examples.
CREATE A FLEXIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN
We may not realize it yet but a concept called flexibility may become our 
new best friend when managing risk. It is certainly a concept that is receiv­
ing attention in the popular press as well as from supply chain managers. 
A Global Supply Chain survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(PwC) concluded that 64% of respondents plan to implement greater flex­
ibility to better respond to supply chain challenges, making flexibility a 
top supply chain priority.8

232  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Even though flexibility has been discussed for some time, it is still an 
evolving idea across the entire supply chain. Most perspectives of flex­
ibility view this concept in terms of adjusting volumes in a manufacturing 
environment. Consider a definition of flexibility from an online business 
dictionary: flexibility is the ability of a system, such as a manufacturing 
process, to cost-­effectively vary its output within a certain range and given 
time frame.9 Supply chain flexibility involves much more than what this 
limited perspective conveys.
What is flexibility and why is it valuable? To be flexible means to be 
adaptable and responsive to change, including changes brought about by 
risk events. The opposite of being flexible means to be rigid and unable 
or resistant to change or modify a course of action. Consider the follow­
ing example of inflexibility. In 2013 a derailment of an eastbound pas­
senger train in Connecticut and subsequent collision with a westbound 
train severely affected the busiest passenger rail corridor in the United 
States.10 Part of the reason the impact was so severe was that construction 
in the area of the accident reduced the number of active tracks from four 
to two over a seven-­mile stretch. The result was a complete lack of routing 
flexibility that prohibited the diversion of trains to other tracks. Hundreds 
of thousands of commuters were forced to shift from the rails back to the 
roads, a part of the country that already experiences traffic gridlock.
Flexibility provides choices, and choices directly support greater sup­
ply chain resiliency. Flexible supply chains are able to adapt quickly to 
changes or risk events, including disruptions to supply and changes in 
demand, while maintaining customer service levels.11 The key point here 
is to be able to respond quickly, sometimes within minutes of an event.
Examples of Flexibility
No single type of flexibility exists or applies to all situations. Table 12.1 
describes various kinds of flexibility with ways to promote that flexibility. 
While this talk about flexibility sounds good, where do we see it in the 
real world? Following are examples of the value of supply chain flexibility.
Energy Flexibility. An increasing number of utilities operate power-­
generating facilities that use coal or natural gas as their energy source. As 
market prices shift between coal and gas, some utilities take advantage 
of these price changes by shifting their fuel source. One observer notes 
that “natural gas prices can’t really shoot much more above a certain level 
because then utilities will pile back into coal.”12 Of course, the inverse is true.

Coal prices cannot rise too high because utilities will shift to gas. Utilities 
are such large consumers of both raw materials that industry observers 
expect coal and natural gas prices to move inversely rather than in unison 
as utilities adjust their usage in response to market prices. Energy flexibil­
ity provides a natural hedge against the financial risk of rising energy costs. 
We expect shifts in market share between coal and natural gas to continue 
as utilities adjust their raw material usage based on prices.
Capacity Flexibility. Companies are increasingly pursuing longer-­term 
contracts with suppliers that feature reserved capacity that is not commit­
ted to any particular product. As demand becomes better known, these 
capacity slots are replaced with actual orders. This approach provides 
greater flexibility, shorter lead times, assurance of supply, and of course 
reduced supply chain risk. The medium to longer-­term forecasts that are 
used to reserve capacity slots usually involve an aggregate number rather 
than specific products.
Physical Flexibility. When a leading medical technology company that 
designs and manufactures orthopedic products planned its Mahwah, New 
Jersey, facility, it did so with flexibility as a primary objective. The facility

includes work cells that can easily be reconfigured from one product line 
to another, a capability that allows the company to better match demand 
and supply across its many products. Furthermore, the building was con­
structed so it could be physically expanded if more square footage was 
required. This compares with facilities that are fixed due to proximity to 
other structures, roads, railroad tracks, etc.
Design Flexibility. Common wisdom would say that it is not feasi­
ble to build servers in the United States. Someone should have told that 
to SeaMicro (now part of AMD), a company located in Santa Clara, 
California. The company uses a contract manufacturer located one mile 
away to build a radically different kind of server. SeaMicro says that man­
ufacturing locally has helped it compete successfully against much larger 
rivals. The company’s engineers are constantly experimenting with new 
components in a bid to reduce energy consumption and quicken the per­
formance of their servers. Engineers take their changes a mile down the 
road to the contract manufacturer and test them in new systems almost 
immediately. Design flexibility, which SeaMicro calls “lean engineering,” 
saves weeks and even months compared with using contract manufactur­
ers located in China or Taiwan. 13
Product Configuration Flexibility. Over the last decade John Deere has 
been tearing up more than dirt. The company has also been tearing up 
sales as growth continues from overseas operations. While a number of 
factors contribute to this growth, something we cannot ignore is the com­
pany’s ability to offer an unbelievable variety of product combinations. 
Farm equipment is not a product like aircraft, that is generally standard­
ized country to country. In a recent year, Deere built almost 8,000 varia­
tions of its popular 8R tractor line. Product design flexibility allows Deere 
to serve the needs of diverse farm markets using a single product platform.
Lead Time Flexibility. An example of a company that owes a large part 
of its success to flexibility is the Spanish retailer Zara, a company that is 
synonymous with fast fashion. Since its inception, the company’s founder 
has insisted the retailer always follow two basic rules—store inventory 
must be replenished twice a week and stores must receive their orders 
within 48 hours.14 This allows Zara to be responsive flexibly to demand 
shifts and customer preferences, particularly as the retailer expands glob­
ally. We are also seeing a resurgence of small apparel manufacturers in 
the United States as customers place orders (usually smaller orders) with 
suppliers that can respond in days or weeks rather than months.15 And, 

236  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
these customers do not have to worry about the risk that comes from 
being associated with foreign apparel factories that have abhorrent work­
ing conditions.
Supply Chain Design Flexibility. Dell Computer, a company that faces 
strategic risk as customers shift from PCs and laptops to tablets and other 
devices, realized that the responsive supply chain it established to support 
make-­to-­order online sales was not necessarily the right supply chain to 
support its expansion into retail sales and other market segments. This “one 
size fits all” supply chain did not fit Dell’s needs at all. Dell has since devel­
oped four supply chains, each dedicated to a different customer segment, 
that give the company added flexibility to respond to a broader array of mar­
ket opportunities. The build-­to order supply chain supports Dell’s online 
customer segment; the build-­to-­plan supply chain supports the retail seg­
ment; the build-­to-­stock supports the online/­popular configurations seg­
ment; and the build-­to-­spec supply chain supports the corporate segment.16
Logistics Flexibility. Logistics flexibility means being able to adjust the 
route taken to move goods, funds, or information between points or pro­
vide choices across different modes of transportation. A $2 billion pipeline 
(clearly a fixed, inflexible mode of transportation) designed to take plenti­
ful crude oil from West Texas to California is failing to generate interest 
among large California refiners because of the flexibility offered by rail 
cars. Relying on rail shipments to transport oil allows refiners to source 
from different locations around the United States and route the oil to their 
California refineries, something that is not feasible with a fixed pipeline. A 
growing supply of North American crude oil is coming from various loca­
tions where prices fluctuate, allowing refiners to use different routes and 
modes of transportation (i.e., rail cars) to make opportunistic purchases 
for their crude supply.17
Material Flexibility. In the not-­too-­distant past the price of nickel 
soared, making it a cost-­prohibitive item for companies that rely on stain­
less steel 318, an industry standard item that contains nickel. One indus­
try that was hit particularly hard includes companies that manufacture 
vehicles to carry food products. Material engineers were able to shift to 
“lean duplex,” a type of stainless steel that offers material properties that 
are 30% to 200% better than traditional alloys with only a fraction of the 
nickel contained in other stainless steels. Lean duplex also offers higher 
yield strength, making it less susceptible to cracking and corrosion.18 
Material flexibility helped the producers of tank trailers avoid financial 
risk from commodity volatility.

CREATE A RISK WAR ROOM
Close your eyes and think about walking into a room where risk man­
agement information is collected, categorized, analyzed, prominently 
displayed, and widely disseminated to the right people at the right time. 
Imagine having a dedicated staff tasked with the responsibility for moni­
toring supplier health, collecting and analyzing third-­party data, spot­
ting disruptive weather patterns, tracking material movement around the 
globe, updating in real time a dashboard of risk-­related metrics, follow­
ing political and business news and trends, responding to specific risk-­
related information requests from internal customers, and sending early 
risk warnings to those who would benefit from that information. This staff 
would also help local units develop their risk management capabilities. 
This room would also allow users to flag supplier names or purchase com­
modities for alerts when noteworthy information becomes available. A 
central role of the war room is to act as a repository for storing, interpret­
ing, and disseminating as needed, risk-­related intelligence.
Several trends make the war room an attractive possibility when think­
ing about supply chain risk. Without question we are seeing a general 
movement (at least in some areas) toward greater centralization and cen­
trally led leader­ship within supply chain management. It is time for risk 
management to join the list of activities that would benefit from a central 
leader­ship focus. Secondly, widely dispersed supply chains and economic 
uncertainty are combining to make risk more rather than less critical as a 
supply chain topic. And finally, technology is available that can search and 
capture data and information in real time around the world.
Part of the war room can be outsourced to risk event specialists. One 
such specialist is NC4, a California company that provides detailed and 
real-­time threat intelligence to clients about global risks and changing 
conditions that can affect operations and the safety of traveling employ­
ees.19 The company scans databases and news feeds around the globe 24/7 
to provide a real-­time assessment of global incidents and assigns a mag­
nitude or priority on a global situation map (along with other risk-­related 
services). This information is available graphically at the company’s com­
mand centers as well as each client’s headquarters. The combination of 
in-­depth global risk analysis, tracking of employee worldwide travels, 
and real-­time incident alerts can provide predictive intelligence to those 
responsible for the well-­being of employees and company assets.

MANAGE WORKING CAPITAL
For many companies the notion of managing working capital is evolving. 
From an accounting perspective, working capital is simply the difference 
between current assets and current liabilities, information that is readily 
available on a company’s balance sheet. Unfortunately, this is not the best 
way to look at working capital from a supply chain risk perspective. A dif­
ferent way to think about working capital is from an operational or supply 
chain perspective, which Figure 12.2 illustrates.
Extending payment terms to suppliers is an enticing option for man­
aging working capital, particularly to the finance group. Unfortunately, 
stretching supplier payment terms directly affects, and not in a good way, 
relationships with suppliers. The CEO of Federal-­Mogul Corporation, a 
tier-­one automotive supplier, announced his company no longer planned 
on extending longer payment terms to customers after it saw a large cash 
outflow due to extended terms. According to the CEO, “If we need to lose 
market share because of our terms, I’m willing to concede business if we 
cannot continue to operate on the margins or the terms that are reason­
able for our organization.”20 What are some of the potential risks associ­
ated with extending payments to suppliers? Stretching payment terms can

Dozens of ways exist besides extending payment terms to better manage 
working capital, particularly the inventory portion of the equation. Do not 
forget that inventory is a complex topic that can be managed through three 
separate approaches—the volume, the velocity, and the value of inventory.
If your company could only select two approaches to focus its working 
capital improvement efforts, controlling inventory through perfect record 
integrity and effective demand estimation and management should be at 
the top of the list.
Controlling Inventory through Perfect Record Integrity
It is difficult to manage something from a risk perspective when you can­
not control it. This includes the amount of capital tied up in supply chain 
inventory. A key objective across every part of the supply chain is to have 
record integrity that is as close to perfect as possible. Inventory control 
means that we know exactly what we have, how much we have, and pre­
cisely where it is located. Whether we have the right quantity and type 
of inventory and if it is positioned correctly are not answered by effective 
inventory control. Those topics are part of inventory management.
Record integrity or accuracy exists when the physical inventory on hand 
equals the computerized or electronic record on hand (POH = ROH), 
regardless of the quantity of inventory. Any difference between POH and 
ROH represents error that increases supply chain risk. This error can be 
the result of operationally mismanaging inventory, which affects the phys­
ical (POH) side of record integrity, or from systems-­related discrepancies, 
which affect the computerized (ROH) side of record integrity.
When record integrity is lacking, steps must be taken to identify the 
sources of error with corrective action taken. In many ways the pursuit of 
perfect record integrity is similar to the pursuit of perfect product quality. 
When a nonconformance occurs, in this case a mismatch between physical 

240  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
inventory and its corresponding inventory record, the search for root 
causes should commence. This search will require asking and answering 
some important questions that address both the physical and informa­
tional side of inventory control, including the following:
•	 Are record errors displaying a random or systematic pattern 
across stock-keeping units (SKUs)?
•	 How severe are the differences between physical stock quantities and 
electronic quantities?
•	 Are proper receiving, stock-­keeping, and withdrawal procedures 
and systems in place?
•	 Are suppliers shipping quantities that match their documentation?
•	 Are effective and timely cycle-­counting procedures used?
•	 Is inventory scrap and obsolescence accounted for correctly?
•	 Is inventory theft a problem?
•	 Are employees trained to properly move, handle, and disburse material?
Perfect or near-­perfect record integrity is never an accident. It is the 
result of various activities and procedures designed to ensure the amount 
of physical inventory equals the computerized record of inventory on 
hand. Poor record integrity contributes directly to greater operational and 
financial risk. Pursuing perfect record integrity directly reduces exposure 
to those risk categories.
Effective Demand Estimation and Management
Perhaps the most important information that flows across a supply chain 
is all the claims on a company’s output for a particular period, includ­
ing forecasted demand, actual orders for which commitments are already 
made, spare parts requirements to support aftermarket needs, and adjust­
ments resulting from changes in inventory policies. These combined 
claims represent a company’s demand estimate. It is startling how many 
systems use demand estimates as their primary data input. One could 
argue persuasively that demand planning is a company’s most important 
process, particularly when managing supply chain risk.
The counterpart to demand planning is supply planning, which involves 
the steps taken to ensure that materials, components, and services are 
available to support the demand plan. Unfortunately, the coordination 
and hand-­off of information between the demand and supply sides of the 

Emerging Risk Management Tools, Techniques, and Approaches  •  241
value chain, not to mention the trust between these two sides, has histori­
cally been less than stellar. While most companies engage in some form of 
demand planning, the link to the supply side is often incomplete.
Best-­practice companies demonstrate certain characteristics related to 
effective demand and supply planning. The first characteristic involves the 
use of systems and practices that help balance demand and supply across a 
supply chain. Recall from an earlier chapter that two of the more advanced 
systems to collaboratively align supply and demand are S&OP and collab­
orative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR). Chapter 3 dis­
cussed S&OP and CPFR. A second characteristic is the relentless pursuit 
of improved forecasts and forecasting techniques. While many practices 
are associated with companies that excel at forecasting, the following are 
usually part of their portfolio.
Perhaps first and foremost, best-­practice companies assign clear 
accountability of forecasting success to an executive or executive steering 
committee. This includes accountability for forecast accuracy as well as for 
continuously improving the forecasting system. Forecast leaders also reg­
ularly measure forecast accuracy across their different products. Forecast 
accuracy, which is an important supply chain metric, should be computed 
regularly and compared against preestablished benchmarks. Forecasting 
leaders also rely on quantitative systems to identify the forecasting algo­
rithm and model that best fits their historical demand pattern, and these 
forecasts are updated frequently as new information becomes available.
A major part of continuous improvement involves regular reviews to 
identify the root causes of forecast error, similar to the discussion of inven­
tory record errors. Review teams should determine if errors are randomly 
distributed, if forecasts are consistently too high or low, or if other tech­
niques might produce better forecasts. Best practice companies apply Six 
Sigma and other quality improvement techniques when studying forecast 
error. Instead of improving the quality of a tangible product, they improve 
the quality of information.
Astute supply chain planners also recognize that different forecasting 
models fit different needs. A “one size fits all” approach is usually not the 
best way to forecast demand.
A final characteristic of demand estimation leaders is they do not sim­
ply react to changes in demand patterns—they try to influence these pat­
terns by managing demand. From a risk perspective this means a shift 
from reacting to orders to influencing when orders occur or when they 
will be scheduled.

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
This chapter presented an array of emerging risk management approaches. 
One thing we know for certain: There will always be a growing set of risk 
management tools, techniques, and approaches to either replace or enhance 
the existing set. We are confident about this for a variety of reasons—
creative thinking and innovation is a never-­ending process, continuous 
improvement has become a way of life, supply chain risk management is 
still an immature discipline, and supply chain risk is not going away any­
time soon. Someone will always come out with the next great idea.
Summary of Key Chapter Points
•	 Because the link between positive relationships with suppliers and 
improved corporate performance is a strengthening rather than 
weakening one, becoming a preferred customer to suppliers offers 
advantages that could lead to future competitive advantage and 
reduced risk.
•	 A clear link exists between a customer’s (i.e., the buyer) behavior, 
the satisfaction level a supplier has with a particular customer, and a 
supplier’s willingness to provide preferential treatment.
•	 The use of an enterprise-­wide, end-­to-­end high-­level supply chain 
risk awareness heat map may be a good starting point for a dialogue 
on risk within a company’s supply chain.
•	 No standard nomenclature specifies what a supply chain map 
should contain or look like. This is in contrast to project manage­
ment or lean management, where the tools and usage protocols are 
well established.
•	 The growth of supply chain mapping as a risk management tech­
nique faces various challenges, particularly when a company has a 
large supply base or complex product structures.
•	 While industry and economic clusters have many redeeming quali­
ties, less mentioned is their potential dark side. From a risk man­
agement perspective it may make sense to analyze and decluster a 
company’s clusters.
•	 Even though flexibility, which is a powerful way to address supply 
chain risk, has been discussed for some time, most perspectives view 

Emerging Risk Management Tools, Techniques, and Approaches  •  243
this concept in terms of adjusting volumes in a manufacturing envi­
ronment. Supply chain flexibility involves much more than this lim­
ited perspective.
•	 Several trends make the risk war room an attractive possibility 
when thinking about supply chain risk, including greater centrally 
led leader­ship within supply chain management, widely dispersed 
supply chains and economic uncertainty that combine to make risk 
more critical, and technology that can search and capture data and 
information in real time from around the world.
•	 Dozens of ways exist to better manage working capital, including 
combining purchase volumes for per unit price discounts (lower 
the value of inventory), more frequent deliveries from suppliers 
(lower the average volume of inventory), and redesigning physical 
processes for faster throughput of material (increase the velocity of 
the inventory). Working capital management is becoming a primary 
part of financial risk management.

Risk Measurement
Imagine a measurement system that, when working effectively, offers the 
opportunity to reduce supply chain risk. Next, imagine the possible out­
comes when such a system fails to work as intended. A number of years ago 
a consumer products company with $100 million in annual sales developed a 
scorecard system to measure supplier performance. Besides creating a sys­
tem that was not validated and was less than professional in appearance, 
many larger suppliers challenged their scores, particularly when the scores 
were lower than what they received from their more sophisticated custom­
ers. The measurement system was such a nonstarter that it deterred the 
company from moving forward with its supplier measurement objectives. 
It also affected, and not in a good way, the company’s relationships with its 
suppliers. Not much in the way of risk reduction occurred here.
Welcome to the world of measurement, a topic that can enhance or 
impede a company’s risk management efforts. This chapter examines risk 
measurement from a variety of perspectives. We first discuss measure­
ment validity and reliability, something that is critical as companies create 
new ways to evaluate risk. This is followed by a presentation of best-­in-­
class supplier performance measurement systems, quantified risk indexes, 
and a system for measuring risk at the country level. Next, we present the 
increasingly talked about subject of total cost measurement. The chapter 
concludes with a set of emerging risk metrics.
RISK MEASUREMENT VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY
As supply chain risk management (SCRM) evolves as a discipline, it 
almost goes without saying that measurement will play an integral part. 

246  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Recall that measurement is one of the key risk enablers we introduced in 
Chapter 3. As we work with companies, we are seeing all kinds of new 
measures, measurement models, and risk indexes emerging that are part 
of the risk management process. A basic concept whenever measurement 
plays a central role is to ask a simple question: Is the measure or model 
valid and reliable?
Valid means that an indicator or model measures what it is supposed to 
measure. If we had to replace the word valid with another word, that word 
would be accurate. If a social scientist develops a scale to measure indi­
vidual happiness, for example, does that scale actually measure happiness? 
In the risk arena, if a measure is supposed to measure the probability of 
a supplier failing financially, does the measure actually measure financial 
distress? Or, an index might translate risk scores into a system that assigns 
red, yellow, or green risk indicators. Is the cutoff value defining red versus 
yellow actually where the cutoff should be? If a supplier measure indicates a 
supplier is high risk, is it really a higher risk compared with other suppliers?
We do not want to give the impression that validating a measure or 
model is easy to do. Our concern is that far too often risk measures and 
indicators are developed but not sufficiently tested, usually because valida­
tion can be a time-­consuming process. In the social sciences, and many 
observers consider business to be a social science, researchers have to 
address many kinds of measurement validity or risk having their work 
rejected by external reviewers. Different kinds of validity can include 
construct, convergent, face, internal, predictive, statistical conclusion, 
content, criterion, and concurrent validity. Validity has many dimensions, 
enough to give a person a serious headache.
A second important dimension of a risk measure is reliability. Reliability 
is the extent to which a measure provides results that are consistent from 
use to use. A watch could measure time (it has validity), but it could be 
inaccurate as its battery wears down. Or, the same piece of equipment used 
to measure blood pressure is not reliable if it gives different readings when 
no real change in a person’s blood pressure occurred. Something that is 
reliable means that we have confidence in its use time and time again.
Possible problems with risk measures and indexes are similar to Type I 
and Type II measurement errors in quality management. A risk measure 
or index may be so sensitive that it raises a red flag when no unusual prob­
lem or risk exists (i.e., a false positive, or Type I error). After receiving 
enough false warnings, trust in the system erodes as users become desen­
sitized to what the measure conveys. Another possible outcome is similar 

Risk Measurement  •  247
to Type II quality errors—the measure says there is no problem when in 
fact there is a risk event pending or likely. Unfortunately, when this is the 
case we are lulled into a false sense of security when the system should be 
picking up various signals. Perhaps the model supporting the risk mea­
sure is not sensitive enough. Or, perhaps the right factors are not part of 
the model, causing the model to miss some important clues.
If measurement validity is so important, how do companies ensure their 
risk measures are valid? Perhaps the best way to validate a risk measure 
or measurement approach is through simulation testing using historical 
data, similar to what occurs when validating forecasting models. After all, 
any measure that is forward looking, and most risk measures should be 
forward looking, is essentially a forecasting tool.
Validity and Bridge Safety Measures
Here is an example of model validity that fell out of nowhere. When an 
oversize truck traveling in Washington State hit a bridge girder, causing 
an entire section of Interstate 5 to fall into the Skagit River, it was not 
long before the system that calculates sufficiency ratings for bridges came 
under scrutiny.1 And the verdict of this scrutiny was that the sufficiency 
rating system to assess bridge safety has some serious shortcomings.
Part of the problem is the complexity of the sufficiency rating system 
developed in the 1970s. About 20 factors, almost half of which have noth­
ing to do with a bridge’s actual condition, are put into a magic formula 
that generates a single sufficiency bridge rating. Mathematically, it is pos­
sible that a bridge that is more vulnerable to collapse has a higher suffi­
ciency rating than a bridge that is less vulnerable. A sufficiency rating less 
than 80 is necessary to qualify for federal funding for bridge modifica­
tions, while a rating under 50 qualifies a bridge for replacement. In other 
words, serious decisions are made because of the sufficiency rating. And it 
appears that the rating system may not be doing what it is supposed to do.
Compiling so many factors into one rating increases the probabil­
ity that serious deficiencies are overshadowed by other factors, such as 
average daily traffic and detour length if a bridge is taken out of service. 
Shortcomings in the current rating system are causing engineers to look at 
new ways to measure bridge risk, including using software to predict how 
bridges will change and possibly fail over time, along with cost-­benefit 
analysis to optimize spending on maintenance and repair. However the 
measurement of bridge hazard risk eventually turns out, the one thing 

248  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
that is becoming increasingly clear is that bridge sufficiency ratings are 
not all that sufficient.
SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT—
DOING IT RIGHT
Most firms, particularly larger ones, will say they have some sort of sup­
plier performance measurement system in place. Many companies call the 
output from these measurement systems supplier scorecards. Our discus­
sion here is not a how-­to on supplier performance measurement; other 
sources have covered this topic quite well. Rather, we address the issues 
that tend to affect supplier measurement systems at most companies. Let’s 
highlight these shortcomings through a case example.
The Case of the Deceptive Scorecards
During a review of a supplier scorecard system at a global logistics company, 
a training instructor asked a buyer to name one of his best-­performing sup­
pliers in terms of its performance score. Without hesitation the buyer pro­
vided a supplier’s name. Another participant in the room responded quickly 
by saying that in the operations facility this is one of the worst suppliers his 
group deals with on a day-­to-­day basis. How can one person say this is a 
supplier worthy of a preferred status while another person would like to see 
this supplier go away? And, perhaps most importantly, what are the risks of 
a measurement system that awards high scores (and likely future business) 
to what may be poorly performing suppliers? The irony here is that a system 
that is designed to reduce supply chain risk could actually be increasing risk.
These differences of opinion resulted in a spirited discussion among the 
participants in the room. During this discussion the group reached con­
sensus about a number of important points. First, the group agreed that 
although the measurement system is supported by an extensive database 
that allows all kinds of on-­demand analyses, the data to support that system 
are largely collected and input manually. Furthermore, many performance 
items require subjective judgments. Second, most buyers had responsibility 
for inputting data quarterly for about 25 suppliers, a heavy burden that is in 
addition to their normal workload. Many in attendance also agreed that the 
data are input just before, and sometimes after, the quarterly cutoff. Third, 
attendees acknowledged that supplier scores are used as one indicator of a 
buyer’s job performance, potentially creating a conflict of interest.
The group also agreed that all suppliers are essentially held to the same 
criteria with the same assigned weights, even though no one believes that 
suppliers are equally important or similar. Participants further agreed 

Risk Measurement  •  249
that internal customers have no way to provide input into the measurement 
process, even though this group has the best perspective regarding a suppli­
er’s day-­to-­day performance. Some participants were even confused about 
how to rate a supplier since some suppliers provide material from more than 
one site. Finally, no clear agreement emerged that the measurement process 
was contributing to better supplier performance. It was taken as an article of 
faith that measurement is a worthwhile pursuit. 
Table 13.1 provides a set of guidelines for assessing whether a supplier 
performance measurement system is likely to satisfy its intended use. 
Evaluating a measurement system against these criteria will help ensure 
the system is leading-­edge. In fact, the items that appear in this table essen­
tially define the characteristics of a world-­class supplier performance mea­
surement system. If supplier measurement is an important objective, then 
let’s at least do it right. Measuring performance incorrectly is an invitation 
to trouble, and we all know that trouble and risk are best friends.
TABLE 13.1
Characteristics of an Effective Supplier Measurement System
•	 The measurement system allows scoring flexibility so all performance categories and 
suppliers are not measured the same way.
•	 Internal customers evaluate supplier performance through an online portal that 
feeds information directly to the measurement system.
•	 Performance reports are forwarded electronically to suppliers with review and 
acknowledgment required by executive supplier management.
•	 Each location at a supplier receives an operational performance report while the 
supplier’s corporate office receives a “relationship” performance report.
•	 Supplier performance reports include total cost measures wherever possible instead 
of price measures.
•	 Supplier performance, particularly cost, quality, and delivery, is updated in real time 
as transactions occur.
•	 The measurement system separates critical suppliers from marginally important 
suppliers.
•	 The supplier measurement database allows user flexibility when retrieving and 
displaying data.
•	 The measurement system provides early-­warning performance alerts such as 
predicted late deliveries from suppliers.
•	 Suppliers have the ability to view their performance online with comparisons against 
other suppliers.
•	 The measurement system is regularly compared against best-­practice companies.
•	 Real performance improvement can be demonstrated as a result of the measurement 
system.

250  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
QUANTIFIED RISK INDEXES
This approach scores risk events or suppliers using algorithms that model 
risk. Risk indexes are quantitative models that consider multiple factors 
to arrive at a single risk indicator score, similar to the bridge sufficiency 
rating discussed earlier. These indexes consider more than simply a sup­
plier’s financial status when arriving at a risk score. To date most risk 
indexes or indicators have been internally developed since third parties 
have been slow to respond with new tools and approaches, something that 
will likely change.
It is no surprise that risk indexes range from basic to complex. On the 
basic side, some companies use a variety of simple algorithms to arrive 
at a single risk score or index. A company might consider the probability 
of a potential risk event occurring using a 1–10 scale. That figure is then 
multiplied by the effect a risk event would have on a 1–10 scale. Other fac­
tors can be introduced, such as the ability to detect the risk on a scale of 
1–10 (a higher score means less ability to detect the risk). The three scores 
would be multiplied together to arrive at an overall risk index, with higher 
scores representing higher risk exposure. A later example will further 
highlight this approach. A concern about the validity of these simple risk 
indexes measures is particularly relevant here.
It is not unusual to translate risk index figures into a red/­yellow/­green 
visual system (recall from Chapter 6 this method is used with the Z-­Score). 
This should also happen during new product development as specific risks 
are identified, something that Chapter 4 addressed. Product development 
teams will work to address red and even yellow items prior to product 
launch. The goal should be to launch new products with as few red risks as 
possible. Why wait until after the fact?
Interestingly, a body of research is emerging that counters the notion 
that complex algorithms and models are automatically more effective than 
simple rules of thumb or guidelines when making organizational deci­
sions. This is something to keep in mind when developing risk indexes. A 
hypothesis put forward is that complex situations create so many possible 
courses of action and become so complex to use that individuals become 
confounded, often to the point where they delay decisions, default to 
the safest option, or avoid making choices altogether.
Research suggests that simple rules can equal, and at times exceed, the 
effectiveness of more complicated analyses across a range of decision areas.2 

Risk Measurement  •  251
While the analysis and data that lead to the rules may be sophisticated, and 
at times will even be complex, the rules that result should be elegant in their 
simplicity as they provide guidance to users. When the up-­front work to 
develop the risk index is rigorous, the chances are good the risk index will 
have validity. This is something to keep in mind when the temptation exists 
to develop overly complex algorithms, models, and risk indexes.
A Risk Index Example
Consider the following example, which is a technique used by a food man­
ufacturer to develop risk indexes to support its risk management efforts.3 
This company examines specific risks from three dimensions: severity of 
the risk, the probability of the risk occurring, and the probability of early 
risk detection. This approach is consistent with the FMEA (failure modes 
and effects analysis) approach, a widely used quality management tech­
nique that considers these three factors. Let’s look at an example:
Risk: Poor Product Freshness
Severity (1 low–10 high)
    7
Probability of Occurrence (1 low–10 high)
    5
Probability of Early Detection(1 high–10 low)
    3
Risk Index (7×5×3)
105
Companies that use this approach identify, evaluate, and then rate all 
possible risks, which are then addressed in terms of priority. As men­
tioned, with any risk index we must be concerned about its validity. Here, 
what defines the incremental values in each scale (i.e., low to high is a 
broad range with a great deal in between)? Is the incremental difference 
between a score of 3 and 4 in a scale the same as between 5 and 6 or 8 and 9? 
Should the three categories be equally weighted, which is the case here? 
Would three people looking independently at the same risk arrive at the 
same or similar score using this tool? (This is called inter-rater reliability). 
Too many companies use tools such as the one presented here without 
fully performing the up-­front work necessary to validate the tool. The vir­
tue of this approach is its simplicity. It is easy to understand and use.
Country Risk Indexes
A variety of risk indexes are available that evaluate country risk. One of 
the more comprehensive of these indexes, and one that will be featured 

252  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
here, is the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) composite risk rat­
ing produced by the Political Risk Services (PRS) Group.4 This composite 
risk rating by country, which is updated monthly, includes 22 variables 
across three subcategories of country risk—political, financial, and eco­
nomic. A separate detailed scoring and weighting methodology is created 
for each of the 22 subcategories.
The composite risk rating by country is based on 100 total points with 
the political risk rating comprising 50% and the financial and economic 
risk ratings contributing 25% each. The composite scores, ranging from 
zero to 100, are then broken into categories from very low risk (80 to 
100 points) to very high risk (0 to 49.9 points).
At the enterprise risk management (ERM) level, country risk index rat­
ings are valuable when a company is thinking about making foreign direct 
investments. At the SCRM level, this information can influence logistics, 
sourcing, and selling activities. Our advice is to not even bother creating 
country risk indexes. Third-­party indexes are available that are more com­
prehensive than anything a company could construct acting on its own.
USING TOTAL COST MEASURES TO MANAGE RISK
Total cost is a topic that companies cannot ignore as they search for new 
and better ways to manage supply chain risk. What exactly is total cost? 
Total cost includes the expected and unexpected elements that increase 
the unit cost of a good, service, or piece of equipment. The logic behind the 
development of total cost systems is that unit cost or price never equals 
total cost. And, as the gap between unit cost and total cost becomes pro­
gressively larger, so does a company’s risk exposure. Regardless of where 
a company applies total cost models, these models all attempt to capture 
data beyond unit price.
In uncertain times, the need to understand every element of cost has 
never been greater. Total cost systems help management to identify the 
impact of different cost elements, to track cost improvements in real terms 
over time, and to gain management’s attention regarding where cost reduc­
tion efforts will have their greatest payback across the supply chain. While 
there is some overlap between sources regarding which cost elements to 
include in total cost models, no agreement exists regarding exactly what 
these models should contain. This issue becomes more complex once we

understand that, like forecasting models, different types of cost models 
exist. And, like forecasting models, total cost models almost always have 
some inherent inaccuracy to them.
Types of Total Cost Models
Every total cost model is part of a family of measurement systems called 
cost-­based systems. Like any measurement system, cost-­based systems offer 
advantages and disadvantages. These systems can be extremely challenging 
to develop and use (if they were not challenging then everyone would rou­
tinely use them).5 Some of the challenges include (1) relying on data that are 
derived across global supply chains, (2) maintaining the discipline across 
the supply chain to use the models routinely, and (3) using data that are not 
known with certainty or are estimates of what might happen. A mean time 
between failures (MTBF) estimate, for example, is often used when evalu­
ating the total expected cost of capital equipment. How close is the estimate 
to what actually happens in terms of equipment reliability?
Across a supply chain we generally see three kinds of total cost models 
in use, regardless of whether this involves a domestic or international sup­
ply chain. These include total landed cost models, supplier performance 
index models, and life-­cycle cost models.
Total Landed Cost Model. A total landed cost model is used when 
evaluating suppliers prior to making purchase decisions, although that is 
not the only time when a landed cost model should be used. Total landed 
cost is the sum of all costs associated with obtaining a product, including 
acquisition planning; unit price; inbound cost of freight, duty, and taxes; 
inspection; and material handling for storage and retrieval.6 Each of these 
cost categories will also contain numerous subcategories. Best-­practice 
companies require their commodity teams or buyers to attach spread­
sheets that show the total landed cost of a purchase requirement whenever 
they propose a supply strategy or make a supplier selection decision.
Total landed cost models should also be used when doing business with 
suppliers on an ongoing basis. The factors that affect the sourcing decision 
in the first place are dynamic and subject to change (think transportation 
and exchange rates here). Furthermore, actual costs should replace any 
estimated or forecasted costs in the model as they become available. This 
helps to validate the assumptions in the model.
When developing total landed cost models it is best to start with the 
unit price and then build up the total cost as goods move from origin to 

254  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
destination. Ideally every cost element is presented in the same unit of 
measure. If a product is priced by the pound, then every corresponding 
cost element in the model should appear as a cost per pound. The cost ele­
ments in landed cost models should be divided into categories that reflect 
a logical progression through the supply chain:
•	 Unit price—unit price usually appears on the first line of the cost model
•	 Within country of manufacture costs—includes materials, storage, 
labor, quality, overhead, obsolescence, packaging, risk or disruption, 
exchange rates, inventory carrying charges
•	 In-­transit to country of sale costs—includes transportation charges, 
fuel surcharges, insurance, port charges, handling, security, bank­
ing fees, broker fees, potential detention charges, duties, handling 
agency charges, inventory carrying charges
•	 Within country of sale costs—includes local transportation and han­
dling, storage fees, taxes, safety stock, inventory carrying charges, 
yield, productivity implications, maintenance, quality, overhead 
allocation, payment terms
Supplier Performance Index (SPI) Model. Various models attempt to 
capture the true cost of doing business with a supplier on a continuous 
basis. Perhaps the best known of these models is something called the 
Supplier Performance Index (SPI). SPI calculations, which focus largely 
on supplier nonconformance costs, are helpful when tracking supplier 
improvement over time, quantifying the severity of performance prob­
lems, deciding which suppliers to eliminate from a supply base, and when 
establishing minimum acceptable levels of supplier performance.
The SPI is a total cost model that presents its output in the form of an 
index or ratio. It assumes that any quality or other infraction committed 
by a supplier during the course of business increases the total cost (and 
hence the total cost performance ratio) of doing business with that sup­
plier. This approach is more applicable after supplier selection because it 
is populated with cost occurrences that have happened rather than are 
expected to happen. The SPI calculation for a specific period is a straight­
forward formula:
	
SPI = (Cost of material + Nonconformance costs)/(Cost of material)

Risk Measurement  •  255
Assume a supplier delivers $1 million worth of parts to a company in the 
third quarter of a year. The supplier also commits three infractions that quar­
ter—a late delivery, missing documentation, and a parts shortage. Further 
assume the buyer assigns $30,000 in total nonconformance charges to these 
infractions. The supplier’s SPI for the third quarter is 1.03, or (($1,000,000 + 
$30,000)/$1,000,000). The SPI of 1.03 means the total cost of doing business 
with this supplier is 3% higher than the unit price. If the unit price of a sup­
plier’s good is $127, then the estimated total cost of that item is really $130.81 
($127 × 1.03). Because the SPI is a standardized metric, it allows compari­
sons between suppliers. A supplier with a higher SPI has a higher total cost 
than one with a lower SPI. It is important to compare suppliers within the 
same commodity to ensure “apples to apples” comparisons.
SPI Drawbacks. Although the SPI can be an effective tool, it is by no 
means perfect. In fact, it has some potential drawbacks that users must 
understand. First, because it is an index, the actual unit cost of an item 
from a supplier is not considered directly in the SPI calculation—only the 
value of the total shipments and infractions are considered. A higher sup­
plier unit cost inflates the value of the shipments compared with a supplier 
that has a lower unit cost, making any infractions look smaller given the 
shipment value. Mathematically, this makes the SPI value lower, all else 
equal, for the higher-­price supplier. Let’s illustrate this with two suppliers 
that ship the same number of units with the same infraction charges but 
with different unit costs:
Supplier A
Supplier B
50,000 units @ $9.00 per unit
50,000 units @ $10.50 per unit
$27,500 non­conformance charges
$27,500 nonconformance charges
SPI = ((50,000 × $9) + $27,500)/$450,000
SPI = ((50,000 × $10.50) + $27,500)/$525,000
= 1.06
= 1.05
The difference here is a mathematical artifact of the different unit costs. 
Ideally, the buying company would employ a total landed cost model dur­
ing supplier selection so any issues regarding differences in unit costs 
would have already been considered.
The SPI calculation also has a built-­in bias against small volume sup­
pliers. Assume three suppliers within a commodity group commit 
the same infraction that resulted in a $3,000 nonconformance charge. 
The first supplier provided $15,000 worth of goods during a quarter, the 

256  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
second supplier provided $10,000 worth of goods, and a third sup­
plier provided $30,000 worth of goods. The SPI for the first supplier is 
1.20 (($15,000 + $3000)/$15,000), the SPI for the second supplier is 1.30 
(($10,000 + $3,000)/$10,000), and the SPI for the third supplier is 1.10 
(($30,000 + $3,000)/$30,000). Even though each supplier committed the 
same infraction, the smaller supplier appears worse from an SPI perspec­
tive, particularly compared with the larger supplier.
This bias requires the calculation of a Q adjustment factor, which is 
essentially a weight applied to the nonconformance costs. The adjustment 
factor allows valid SPI comparisons by removing the bias against suppliers 
with a lower total value of deliveries. It makes sense to calculate an adjust­
ment factor that removes this bias if suppliers within a commodity provide 
widely differing volumes. If we want to make total cost models as accurate 
as possible, then we have to think about the Q adjustment factor. Figure 13.1 
illustrates the step-­by-­step calculation of the Q adjustment factor.
A final drawback to the SPI approach is that it requires a great deal of 
discipline and cross-­functional support to stay on top of the required data 
collection. Supplier infractions can occur or be discovered at different 
points along a supply chain. Inconsistency in collecting and allocating 
supplier charges will quickly undermine the validity of this model.

Life-­Cycle Cost Models. Life-­cycle cost models may be what comes most 
to mind when thinking about total costs analysis. This type of model is 
most often used when evaluating capital decisions that cover an extended 
time period, such as equipment and facilities. Life-­cycle models are very 
similar to net present value models used in finance. Life-­cycle cost models 
are used when evaluating capital decisions, such as plant and equipment, 
rather than the purchase of everyday components and services. The other 
cost models described here are more applicable for repetitively purchased 
goods or services. Life-­cycle costs apply whether equipment is sourced 
domestically or internationally.
Developers of life-­cycle cost models often allocate their cost elements 
across four broad categories that reflect usage over time. The life-­cycle is 
essentially one of buying, shipping, installing, using, maintaining, and 
disposing:
•	 Unit Price—Includes the price paid along with purchase terms
•	 Acquisition Costs—Includes all costs associated with delivering equip­
ment, such as buying, ordering, and freight charges to the customer
•	 Usage Costs—Includes all the costs to operate the equipment, includ­
ing installation, energy consumption, maintenance, reliability, spare 
parts, and yield and efficiency during production
•	 End-­of-­Life Costs—Includes all costs incurred when removing 
equipment from service, less any proceeds received for resale, scrap, 
or salvage
Companies should compare the assumptions made during the devel­
opment of life-­cycle estimates with actual data as they become available, 
particularly since life-­cycle models often look years into the future. This 
will provide insights regarding how to improve the life-­cycle models.
A popular misconception is that having a total cost model inherently 
provides better information than not having a total cost model. We like 
to think this is true, but the reality is that total cost models, like fore­
casting models, almost always have some degree of inaccuracy. This is 
especially true if a model is populated with data that are based largely on 
estimates or averages rather than actual data. Or, the model may fail to 
take into account some important cost elements. Do not underestimate 
the value, however, of a well-­specified total cost model when managing 
supply chain risk. Total cost measurement is one of the best risk manage­
ment approaches that we can put in place today.

SUPPLIER CAPACITY ESTIMATE MEASURES
Most of us have heard stories about a buyer placing an order with a sup­
plier only to find that the supplier’s assurances about available capacity 
simply are not true. Or, how about when total demand in a marketplace 
increases and a buying company finds it has been placed on the short end 
of a supplier’s allocation schedule. Either of these conditions creates oper­
ational risk as supply is not readily available to satisfy demand.
A risk management approach that will provide some clues into available 
capacity is something we call rough cut supplier capacity analysis. It is called 
rough cut because it is not meant to be a precise estimate of available supplier 
capacity. We are simply trying to get a feel regarding what might be avail­
able and comparing that to a specific requirement. And when we get a better 
feel for the amount of available capacity, we can engage in some worthwhile 
discussions with suppliers. Let’s illustrate how this technique works.
Table 13.2 presents data for the three suppliers that appeared in Chapter 6 
when calculating Z–­Scores. We are now introducing two new additional 
pieces of data—the estimate of the average capacity utilization rate at each 
supplier and a quoted price per unit for the item of interest. This table 
presents a methodology for estimating the capacity available at each sup­
plier. This analysis reveals that only one supplier appears to have adequate 
capacity available. According to these numbers the buying company could 
face major operational risk if it decided on a single-­source contract with 
FASE Chemicals. The risk could be so severe that it affects the success of 
a product, which then leads to strategic risk. And placing a single-­source 
contract with DMS will require some serious discussions to verify these 
estimates and, if verified, to work out a plan to meet demand requirements.
The point of this exercise is to provide a broad understanding of where a 
supplier stands in terms of capacity. One risk here is that a supplier could 
also be speaking to other buyers that are interested in the available capac­
ity. It is also possible some contracts at the supplier are expiring, which 
could make additional capacity available. One thing we are confident 
about is these suppliers are not likely to drop existing customers simply 
to fulfill a new contract, at least in the short term, making the capacity 
discussion a key part of the risk assessment process.

capacity that is currently utilized for the production of chemicals. For example, if 
current installed capacity is 98%, then this supplier is utilizing 98% of its production 
capacity and therefore has 2% of its capacity available for new business. This does not 
indicate how many available pounds this represents.

EMERGING SUPPLY CHAIN RISK METRICS
We are witnessing a combination of existing measures as well as the devel­
opment of entirely new measures being applied to the risk management 
arena. The following describes some of these risk-­related measures.
Value at Risk
A metric that will increasingly have corporate-­level visibility as a risk met­
ric is value at risk (VaR), a metric that is used extensively by the financial 
community to evaluate financial investments. From a financial perspec­
tive, VaR represents the largest loss likely to be suffered on a portfolio 
position over a holding period (usually 1–10  days) with a given prob­
ability (confidence level). VaR is a measure of market risk and includes 
three components—a time period, a confidence level or percentage, and a 
loss amount or percentage attached to a risk.7 This concept is now being 
applied to supply chain scenarios. Chapter 5 provided a detailed illustra­
tion of this metric and its use in supply chain risk management.
Time-­to-­Recovery
The time-­to-­recovery (T-­t-R) from adverse events, a risk resiliency mea­
sure used extensively in the information technology arena, is generating 
significant interest as an evolving supply chain risk measure. An example 
of a T-­t-R measure involves the time to recover from a natural disaster, 
such as a flood. Virtually any supply chain disruption can have a T-­t-R 
measure attached to it.
T-­t-R measures, like most measures, have an objective attached to them. 
Some sources refer to this objective as the recovery time objective (RTO), 
which is the time in which a system, a facility, or equipment must be 
restored after a disruption to avoid an unacceptable break in business con­
tinuity and the incurrence of significant losses. T-­t-R measures how long 
it takes an entity in a supply chain to reach full volume or full operating 
status after a major disruption. This does not have to mean full recovery 
at a specific facility. If the full volume for a part from a supplier can be 
provided within two weeks by working overtime at another facility, then 
two weeks is the T-­t-R, even if the affected facility takes longer to recover.

Risk Measurement  •  261
Risk Exposure Index
An extension of the T-­t-R index is the Risk Exposure Index, developed by 
David Simchi-­Levi at MIT. This index attempts to provide a better way for 
companies to quantify their supply chain risks compared with the tradi­
tional 2 × 2 matrix that places the likelihood of an event occurring (high 
or low) against its financial impact (low or high). With this traditional 
approach, potential risk events are plotted into one of four quadrants with 
those with the highest likelihood of occurring and the largest impact 
receiving priority for attention. While this approach serves a worthwhile 
purpose, it is does not represent cutting-­edge risk measurement.
The Risk Exposure Index assigns a cost that would occur from a poten­
tial disruption across each level and node in a given supply chain, based 
on the T-­t-R for each level/­node and the resulting financial impact (FI), 
including market share losses. Those individual risk components are then 
totaled to produce a full FI for the entire supply chain.8
This methodology also addresses unpredictable risks, including natu­
ral disasters and fires at critical suppliers. While these types of risks are 
nearly impossible to predict, the chances that such a disruption will occur 
over a period of time is quite likely, which is built into the model. The key 
to this analysis is the calculation of the financial damage that such a dis­
ruption would likely cause.
Supply Chain Key Performance Indicators
We expect to see various key performance indicators (KPIs) emerge that 
are viewed by executive management as supporting a company’s risk man­
agement efforts. The following presents six measures, some of which have 
been in existence for a while but not necessarily visible at higher executive 
levels. These are not predictive measures—they do not provide warning 
about pending or specific risk events. Rather, they provide insight into 
how well some important business processes are operating. We will prob­
ably all agree that when important processes are operating well, a business 
faces lower risk exposure.
Forecast Accuracy. As mentioned in Chapter  12, best-­practice com­
panies track and assign clear accountability for forecasting success to 
an executive or executive steering committee. Best-­practice companies 
also regularly measure forecast accuracy across their different products. 

262  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
One survey revealed that fully two-­thirds of respondents reported fore­
cast accuracy between 50% and 80%, a range that indicates room for 
improvement. Forecast accuracy should be computed regularly and com­
pared against preestablished benchmarks. Many techniques are available 
for assessing forecast accuracy, including mean forecast error, bias, mean 
absolute deviation, mean absolute percent error and tracking signals. All 
of these techniques compare, in some manner, actual demand against 
forecasted demand with the difference between these two figures consid­
ered error.
Concept-­to-­Customer Cycle Time. Product development leaders rely 
on an important time-­based metric called concept-­to-­customer (C-­to-­C) 
cycle time. This metric reflects the importance of being aware of the time 
it takes to develop new products as well as acting as a target that no sin­
gle functional group can unilaterally attain. Surprisingly, in our experi­
ence most companies do not measure an overall cycle time, making the 
development of a C-­to-­C cycle time measure especially attractive. Holding 
functional groups mutually accountable for this measure sends a powerful 
message about the importance of collaborating during product develop­
ment efforts. And as Chapter 4 pointed out, the linkage between strategic 
risk exposure and new product development success (or failure) is strong.
Inventory Accuracy. Recall from Chapter 12 that measuring inventory 
accuracy is essential for managing various kinds of supply chain risk. 
Inventory accuracy exists when the physical inventory on hand for an 
item equals the computerized or electronic record on hand (POH = ROH), 
regardless of the quantity of inventory. Supply chain managers should 
become almost evangelical in their quest for perfect record integrity, 
including the integrity of records and data at suppliers and distributors.
Order-­to-­Cash Cycle Time. An important part of any supply chain is 
the customer order fulfillment process. The order-­to-­cash cycle involves 
the steps from acquisition of a customer’s order to receiving payment from 
a customer. When viewed narrowly, order fulfillment focuses mainly on 
the acts of distribution and logistics. When viewed broadly, order fulfill­
ment includes all the steps and activities from the sales inquiry to delivery, 
and perhaps even the return of the final product or service. This involves 
order preparation, transmission, entry, order filling (which may include 
production and purchasing), billing, shipping, tracking, and returns.
Companies that take a broader view of order fulfillment extend their 
perspective to include the management of accounts receivable, making 

Risk Measurement  •  263
order-­to-­cash cycle time a key performance indicator. This stresses the 
financial aspects of the fulfillment process by not viewing the process as 
complete until customer payment is received. Ineffective management of 
the order-­to-­cash cycle time has clear financial risk implications.
Perfect Order Rate. The perfect order metric is a mathematic composite 
of multiple factors. The perfect order is one that is delivered on time, com­
plete (all ordered items are in the shipment), damage free, accurate (correct 
items and quantities), with proper documentation. Perfect orders not only 
drive customer loyalty for the product and producer, but they also lead to 
greater supply chain efficiency and reduced investments in inventory.9
To date the primary users of the perfect order metric have been con­
sumer packaged goods companies. Virtually any company, however, can 
use a perfect order measure if they can overcome the humbling nature of 
this metric. As variables with a less-­than-­perfect value are combined, the 
resulting metric becomes lower and lower. This is clear from Figure 13.2. To 
some, it simply looks better to report each line item separately and forego 
the cumulative measure. Let’s not mess up some good numbers with facts.
Return on Assets. If there is one higher-­level measure that tells how 
well a supply chain is performing, return on assets is that measure. While 
multiple versions of this metric exist, they all include a numerator that 
includes income and a denominator that looks at assets. Regardless of the 
specific formula used, one thing we know for certain is that any supply 
chain problems, including the consequences of any risk events, will show 
up in the numerator and/­or denominator of this metric. Chapter 3 illus­
trated how a company uses return on assets as its primary way to measure 
the performance of its business units.
• “Perfect orders”:
• Orders delivered on time
• Orders delivered complete
• Orders delivered damage free
• Orders ﬁlled accurately
• Orders billed accurately

A perfect order is an order that is delivered complete, on time, in perfect
condition, and with accurate and complete documentation.

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Supply chain managers must take an unbiased view of their performance 
measurement systems. The objective here should be to take poor measure­
ment systems and make them better while transforming good systems 
into excellent ones. One course of action is to assemble internally a team to 
compare the current state of supply chain risk measurement areas against 
an ideal future state. Any gaps that exist between the current and future 
state require a clear plan to get to a preferred state.
While measuring various dimensions of supply chain risk is a worthy 
pursuit, the reality is that risk measurement is simply an activity. Activity 
means nothing unless it leads to lower supply chain risk compared with 
what would likely occur without the measurement system in place. 
Measurement activity must lead to accomplishment.
Summary of Key Points
•	 A central question when thinking about supply chain risk measure­
ment is whether a measure, model, or index is valid and reliable.
•	 Most firms have some sort of supplier performance measurement 
system in place. Fortunately, a set of best-­practice guidelines exists 
for assessing whether a supplier performance measurement system is 
likely to satisfy its intended use.
•	 One type of measure scores risk events or suppliers using derived 
algorithms that model risk. Risk indexes are quantitative models that 
consider multiple factors to arrive at a single risk indicator or score.
•	 A body of research is emerging that counters the notion that complex 
algorithms and models are automatically more effective than simple 
rules of thumb or guidelines when making organizational decisions.
•	 At the ERM level, country risk index ratings are particularly valu­
able when thinking about making foreign direct investments. At the 
SCRM level, this information can influence logistics, sourcing, and 
selling behavior.
•	 Total cost of ownership is a topic companies cannot ignore as they 
search for new and better ways to manage supply chain risk. We 
expect to see at least three major supply chain cost models in use: 
total landed cost models, supplier performance cost models, and life-­
cycle cost models.

Risk Measurement  •  265
•	 A variety of existing and new measures are emerging to help manage 
supply chain risk, including value-­at-­risk, time-­to-­recovery, and risk 
exposure indexes.
•	 Various KPIs will emerge that support a company’s risk management 
efforts, including forecast accuracy, inventory accuracy, the perfect 
order, concept-­to-­customer cycle time, order-­to-­cash cycle time, and 
return on assets. An underlying commonality linking these mea­
sures is that they are superordinate, which means they are higher in 
class, rank, or status compared with other measures.

Learning from Risk 
Management Leaders
Although most companies have a way to go before they can brag about 
their risk management prowess, some companies have achieved distinc­
tion, at least in some aspect of risk management. This chapter highlights a 
variety of companies that have demonstrated their commitment and skills 
when pursuing supply chain risk management (SCRM): Boston Scientific, 
Boeing, IBM, Cisco, Delphi, and a major defense contractor. The pur­
pose of this chapter is to appreciate what leading companies are doing to 
become risk management leaders. We also highlight a company that offers 
risk-­related lessons learned the hard way.
MAKING RISK MANAGEMENT A PRIORITY 
AT BOSTON SCIENTIFIC
A company that is widely recognized at being at the top of its risk man­
agement game is Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC), a company started 
in 1979 with 38 employees and $2 million in sales.1 Today, with a world­
wide workforce of 24,000 employees, more than $7 billion in sales from 
more than 100 countries, and a product portfolio containing 15,000 
products, it is not surprising that a company this complex continuously 
faces uncertainty.
Even before the 2008 economic downturn BSC had taken a heightened 
interest in the impact of supplier risk on the company’s operations. In this 
regard the company is an early risk management adopter. The company 
created a detailed Supplier Risk Management program to help prepare for 

268  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
any anticipated and unanticipated risks they may face. BSC defines supplier 
risk management as a proactive and systematic process for cost-­effectively 
identifying and reducing the frequency and severity of unwanted events in 
the supply chain that have an adverse effect on the business.
The primary goal of BSC’s program is to move from being a reactive 
risk taker to being proactive toward risk, thereby allowing the company 
to reduce its overall risk exposure. The company divides this goal into 
four specific objectives—gain visibility to high-­risk suppliers that require 
attention, identify and understand the specific drivers that increase sup­
plier risk, proactively manage and mitigate supply chain risk, and measure 
risk mitigation and its impact.
BSC followed a three-­step process when designing its risk management 
program. The first step, information acquisition, required BSC to gather 
and access information from the external environment, suppliers, and the 
analysis of different parts and components. The second step involved com­
piling this information using basic risk management systems and tools. The 
final step involved communicating this information to different Boston 
Scientific business units and plants as well as to suppliers.
Having the Right Tools
After its initial analysis, Boston Scientific designed a formalized process 
to manage supplier risk. This process includes (1) identifying risk areas, 
(2) analyzing and prioritizing these risks, (3) developing risk mitigation 
plans to address high-­risk areas, and (4) tracking high-­risk areas.
To support this process the company has developed a primary risk tool 
it calls the Supplier Risk Wheel. Each supplier has its own wheel. The pur­
pose of this tool is to identify high-­risk events and risk categories that 
require action. The Supplier Risk Wheel starts with data and survey inputs 
to identify specific risk events, which create the outer ring of the wheel. 
Risk categories that contain these identified risk events comprise the 
middle circle of the wheel. Each risk item (outer ring) and risk category 
(middle ring) is assigned a color based on the level of risk it involves (red = 
very high risk, light red = high risk, yellow = medium risk, light green = low 
risk, dark green = very low risk), and each level affects the next. Finally, the 
risk categories are used to calculate the overall supplier Risk Probability 
Index (RPI), which is the center circle of the wheel.
BSC has developed other tools, including a Risk Distribution Matrix and 
a Supplier Comparison Report, to provide further risk insight. The Risk 

Learning from Risk Management Leaders  •  269
Distribution Matrix is a mapping tool with an x- and y-­axis. The x-­axis 
represents the supplier’s Risk Probability Index from the Risk Wheel and 
the y-­axis represents the potential revenue impact presented by the sup­
plier. The matrix uses red, yellow, and green zone designations.
A Supplier Comparison Report allows the comparison of the highest 
and lowest indicators or ratings in various areas between suppliers. This 
approach also relies on a color-­coded scheme and considers factors such as 
the supplier’s percentage of revenue from medical devices, quality, align­
ment with BSC, accreditation, delivery, capacity utilization, plant size, and 
service support. Another tool is a comprehensive risk template that details 
the kinds of actions taken to prevent or mitigate risk in the case of a risk 
event. Boston Scientific uses all of this information to determine the best 
ways to eliminate or manage supplier risk.
Boston Scientific has also created a Risk Alert and Communications 
System. This system relies on a variety of data sources in four catego­
ries (financial, governmental, disasters, and market dynamics) to gain 
insight into potential risk events. Examples of data sources supporting the 
alert system include Dun & Bradstreet information, U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) e-­newsletter, regulatory updates, U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) updates, weather updates, commodity analy­
ses, supplier communications, foreign travel warnings, and state depart­
ment fact sheets. Finally, the company actively benchmarks and compares 
its risk management capabilities against other best-­in-­class companies.
Is all this work worth it to Boston Scientific? The company has developed 
three sophisticated metrics for evaluating its risk standing—cross prod­
uct, which is a measure of overall BSC supply risk in dollars; the standard 
deviation of revenue at risk; and the average supplier RPI by quarter. All 
three indicators reveal the company is trending in the right direction.
Boston Scientific understands that being a supply chain risk manage­
ment leader requires the development of the right kinds of tools and tech­
niques to support their journey.
NAVIGATING THREATS AT BOEING
Global companies know that at any moment unpredictable events can 
happen anywhere in the world. These events become worse when a com­
pany is unable to determine its risk exposure. And probably no company 

270  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
appreciates this more than Boeing, a company with 170,000 employees in 
50 U.S. states and 70 countries, and with thousands of suppliers, partners, 
and customers located in 150 countries. With people and operations in 
this many locations being affected by tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, 
pandemics, civil unrest or terrorism, or catastrophic product failures that 
are major news events is not only a possibility, it is a certainty. The ques­
tion becomes how severe a risk event will be and its effect on the company 
and its stakeholders.
Boeing created a system called ThreatNavigator to monitor diverse loca­
tions and potential risks. This system, the brainchild of several Boeing 
emergency management professionals, allows managers to quickly com­
prehend a complex situation and monitor it in real time. These personnel 
also envisioned a system that could track and contact Boeing employees, 
including those who are traveling.
An in-­house team created ThreatNavigator using web technology. This 
tool combines internal and external information and displays it visually in 
a Google Maps format. External data feeds come from sources such as NC4 
(a commercial information service described in Chapter 12) as well as the 
National Weather Service. Icons show the type of incident and use color 
codes to indicate the elapsed time since an incident occurred. Alerts are 
also sent to system users via e-­mail so they can be kept up-­to-­date on a situ­
ation. Before the development of ThreatNavigator, alerts and information 
from many sources were sent to emergency responders, something that 
took hours to accumulate and analyze. And it doesn’t take a Boeing rocket 
scientist to figure out that hours in an emergency represent an eternity.
ThreatNavigator, which came online in 2012, has already been used 
numerous times. It was first used to monitor a NATO summit hosted 
in Chicago to follow the actions of protestors who vowed to shut Boeing 
down due to the company’s military support of NATO. It was also used to 
monitor areas affected by Hurricane Sandy during October 2012. The sys­
tem also helped determine if evacuations were necessary during Colorado 
wildfires as well as during civil unrest in Cairo. And risk managers used 
ThreatNavigator to monitor the Oklahoma City area after a massive tor­
nado hit the area as well as the aftermath of bombings at the 2013 Boston 
Marathon. This system also tracks medical emergencies or events at com­
pany sites daily, something that shows the system’s versatility.
Other systems support ThreatNavigator. These include the DENS 
(Desktop Emergency Notification System), which delivers computer alerts to 

Learning from Risk Management Leaders  •  271
employees about emergencies; the DAN (Dialogic Automated Notification) 
system, which sends messages globally through an automated phone noti­
fication system; the BEACON (Boeing Employee Accountability Network) 
system, which accounts for the location and well-­being of employees if a 
site evacuation is required; the TRIS (Travel Risk Intelligence Service) sys­
tem, which monitors Boeing employees when they travel and what health 
and safety threats might be nearby; and other systems including an emer­
gency 800 number and an emergency website.
These systems help keep the company and its vast network of employ­
ees safe in an unsafe world. They allow critical business operations to be 
maintained wherever possible during a crisis or event. By being able to 
react quickly to events, Boeing is at the forefront of risk mitigation, creat­
ing a confidence within the company that it will be able to deal with risk 
events better than ever before.
SUPPLIER RISK ASSESSMENT AT IBM
It should come as no surprise that a company known for developing inno­
vative products and solutions for its customers would develop an innova­
tive approach for managing supply chain risk. To grasp the importance 
of the supply chain to IBM, consider that the company has more than 
1,800 first-­tier suppliers, contractors, and manufacturing sites and more 
than 25,000 professionals working in its Integrated Supply Chain group. 
The hardware group alone at IBM buys $12 billion of production materials 
per year from suppliers. And the company is increasingly relying on sup­
pliers in India, China, other Southeast Asian countries, Eastern Europe, 
and South American countries. As its electronics supply chain becomes 
increasingly complex, so too have the risks the company faces. Needless to 
say, the IBM of today faces more risks than the IBM of just a few years ago. 
Several years ago IBM began a review of its approach to supplier risk 
assessment. An initiative to improve IBM’s risk assessment ability started 
as part of an overall corporate strategy built around enterprise risk man­
agement (ERM). As part of that effort, IBM looked more closely at its risk 
management approaches in its supply management group. And not sur­
prisingly, given the global nature of IBM’s business, the company found 
opportunities for improvement.

272  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
An assessment of IBM’s current state revealed that while some risks 
guidelines and processes were in place, risk assessment was largely a man­
ual, and at times overly subjective, process. What constituted high risk to 
one individual or team might really be construed as medium risk to another. 
Furthermore, the approach to collecting data to support risk assessments 
was not especially rigorous.
The company searched the marketplace to identify commercially avail­
able solutions to evaluate suppliers in terms of financial risk, operational 
excellence, and product integrity. After six months the IBM team con­
cluded that no comprehensive tool was available to satisfy its requirements. 
While many tools considered some aspect of what IBM was looking for, 
none brought everything together in a comprehensive way.
What do you do after searching the market and finding that no com­
mercially viable approach is available to fit your needs? IBM determined 
it would be better off developing a tool internally supported by existing 
IBM products, including its Cognos analytics tool and ILOG event man­
agement capabilities. The resulting Total Risk Assessment (TRA) software 
tool provides automated alerts to commodity managers, purchasers, and 
others at IBM about potential risks in the supply chain. It also includes 
complex algorithms to quantitatively evaluate risk.
IBM’s Risk Management Tool
IBM’s primary goal when developing the TRA software was to have the 
ability to assess risk systematically to become more predictive and less 
reactive. This tool incorporates data from an existing IBM database that 
tracks supplier financial data and status, uses a third-­party data source 
that provides information on worldwide news and events, and receives 
inputs from IBM procurement managers and others as they provide 
responses to a set of structured questions. It is also driven by periodic 
assessments of all suppliers and leverages many of IBM’s in-­house predic­
tive analytic engines to calculate probabilities of risk occurrences, deter­
mine the likelihoods of events, and develop alert dashboards.
The risk management tool provides a comprehensive risk assessment 
and ongoing mitigation approach to protect against loss of revenue and 
profits by minimizing the likelihood and severity of supply chain dis­
ruptions. The tool manages and updates 13 categories of risk across five 
elements: country, hub, supplier, supplier site, and commodity. All new 
suppliers are assessed through this tool prior to awarding business with 

Learning from Risk Management Leaders  •  273
higher-­risk suppliers encouraged to develop risk mitigation plans before 
receiving material approval.
The proprietary algorithms used to calculate risk scores from the inputs 
coming into the system are critical to this tool’s success. The TRA tool pro­
vides a numeric score and graphically represents different risk categories 
as being low, medium, or high risk, thereby providing guidance to supply 
managers who must develop contingency or risk management strategies 
appropriate to those ratings. The tool provides a wide range of functionality:
•	 Catalogs full supplier risk exposure across multiple commodities
•	 Performs probability-­based risk assessments
•	 Develops roadmap guides for risk mitigation strategies for execu­
tive approval
•	 Establishes control limits for each risk element
•	 Highlights new business processes and risk escalation pathways
•	 Monitors global risks against specified “risk appetite” corporate 
thresholds
•	 Updates and provides feedback to executives as risk exposures elevate
•	 Supports the Supply Commodity Councils as crisis situations occur
Constructing the databases to support this tool had an early benefit. 
When an earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan, IBM was able 
to identify within hours the supplier sites that might be at risk from among 
hundreds of its Asian suppliers. Other companies required days and even 
weeks to arrive at a complete picture of their risk exposure. Linking the 
TRA system to another system that tracks on-­hand inventory allowed 
IBM to secure supply from affected areas faster than competitors, provid­
ing IBM with uninterrupted supply to customers.
IBM has noted several initial benefits from its homegrown solution. 
Some of these benefits include the tool’s ability to uncover multiple risks, 
assess the likelihood and impact of those risks, and address those risks with 
formal mitigation plans. The tools also provides a consistent risk man­
agement approach across all brands and commodities and provides the 
executive team with trends and patterns that have been revealed through 
systematic risk analysis.
A decade from now there will be an impressive number of risk man­
agement tools commercially available. Today, however, is a different story. 
Progressive companies like IBM realize they can’t wait for the day when 
commercially available tools arrive. The time to act is now.

USING SUPPLY CHAIN MAPPING 
TO MANAGE RISK AT CISCO
An emerging risk management technique focuses on mapping the nodes 
within a company’s supply chains (refer to Chapter 12 for a discussion of 
supply chain mapping). These nodes include production sites, warehouses 
and distribution centers, contract manufacturers, suppliers, and custom­
ers. Frankly, there is no shortage of nodes and entities across a complex 
supply chain. One leading-­edge approach connects these nodes within a 
map with lines that indicate product volume and total price or margin, and 
then superimposes these with a risk index on every connection. Various 
tools support the calculation of the risk index, including failure modes 
and effects analysis (FMEA), Time-­to-­Recovery (T-­t-R) metrics, and a 
Resiliency Index. Some approaches use red, yellow, or green symbols to 
indicate high, medium, or low risk. The resulting map, when constructed 
properly, produces a compelling picture.
The next step in this process involves a detailed look at the high-­risk 
connections with the development of risk mitigation plans. However, 
leading companies don’t stop there. Cisco, a leading producer of network­
ing equipment, has taken its mapping process to an entirely new level. This 
next level integrates worldwide threats (weather, political, hazards, etc.) 
and superimposes any threats continuously on the map using data from 
companies such as NC4. Many risk management leaders, including Cisco, 
Bayer Crop Science, and Flextronics utilize supply chain maps and these 
24/7 threat events to drive their tactical and operational risk discussions.
Here is an example of how Cisco utilizes this approach. In May 2008, 
Chengdu, China, experienced a magnitude 7.9 earthquake. Cisco con­
ducted a full impact analysis that evaluated supplier sites, parts, and prod­
ucts in the Cisco supply chain. Within a day of the event, assessments 
revealed that Cisco had 20 suppliers in the affected area. Within two days 
of the quake, Cisco’s SCRM Group initiated a crisis survey forwarded to 
the supplier’s emergency contacts.
As a result of these efforts, two suppliers were identified as at-­risk. The 
first supplier, a single-­source supplier, represented a significant revenue 
risk to Cisco. This supplier was already flagged for review due to the risks 
associated with using a single source. In fact, Cisco had already qualified a 
second source. The second supplier was smaller in revenue risk but expe­
rienced significant damage to its facility. Cisco sent its Crisis Management 

Learning from Risk Management Leaders  •  275
Team to help the supplier recover from the physical damage. The result 
was a faster Time-­to-­Recovery (T-­t-R) compared with competitors. When 
each day means millions of dollars in lost revenues, taking risk manage­
ment to a higher level means being faster and better than competitors. 
And at Cisco, that means taking an approach such as supply chain map­
ping and extending its functionality to support real-­time threat visibility 
and risk response.
SURVIVING A NEAR-­DEATH EXPERIENCE AT DELPHI
A company that can see its own demise coming tends to view the need 
for change a bit differently than a company that is looking at a secure 
future. Even before the 2008 financial meltdown, Delphi, a major first-­tier 
supplier to the automotive industry, knew it was in trouble as it filed for 
bankruptcy protection in 2005. This company became familiar with just 
about every category of risk.
Delphi is a different company today after roaring back from bankruptcy. 
At a corporate level, Delphi’s return on invested capital (ROIC) is now 
34% compared with an 18% industry average. Profits are stronger and are 
now the expectation rather than the exception. As Delphi’s CEO explains, 
“There is no commodity here. We physically monitor every piece of busi­
ness we book to make sure it is equal to or better that what we have today. 
If the order doesn’t raise the return on invested capital, then we probably 
aren’t going to do it.”4 The company now enjoys the luxury of evaluating 
the effect of new orders on its ROIC measure to determine whether an 
order is worth accepting. You know things are better when you can pick 
and choose what business you want to pursue.
As part of its restructuring effort, Delphi reduced its product lines from 
119 to 33, reduced its technical centers from 33 to 15 worldwide, and cut 
its workforce from 185,200 to 118,000. And the company now focuses on 
higher-­margin, innovative products, particularly in a product segment it 
calls “active safety.” It has also reduced its dependence on General Motors, 
which made up 54% of Delphi’s sales in 2004 compared with 23% currently.
As part of its broad approach to reinventing itself, Delphi has become 
a leader in total cost modeling.5 (Recall from Chapter 13 the importance 
of total cost analysis when managing risk.) The need to accurately under­
stand the total cost of doing business with suppliers that are located all 

276  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
over the world is probably on every manager’s wish list. Delphi’s Cost 
Management group (a function within Supply Management) took the ini­
tiative to develop a desktop tool that is user friendly, requires few manual 
inputs, and has reduced the time required to estimate the total cost of buy­
ing a part from five days to several minutes. And perhaps best of all, the 
training required to use the tool takes only 40 minutes. This is important 
because there is a clear relationship between the complexity of a system 
and internal acceptance of that system.
The Cost Management group worked with logistics, manufactur­
ing, engineering, and R&D when developing the model. Development 
required collecting information about transportation and logistics costs, 
capital costs, and currency and risk issues. An important part of any total 
cost model is the identification of the relevant costs that will populate 
the model. Perhaps most importantly, the development team took almost 
18 months to validate the model’s accuracy, primarily by subjecting it to 
real-­life sourcing scenarios. (Recall from Chapter  13 our discussion of 
the importance of measurement validity.) The tool is accepted internally 
because it replaced a much more cumbersome system and has demon­
strated itself to be accurate and reliable.
The risk of a near-­death experience resulted in dramatic changes at 
Delphi. These changes clearly affected how the company looks at and 
responds to risk. Like many companies, Delphi realizes that a proactive 
approach to risk management means not having to wait for someone else 
to develop the tools and techniques required to be an industry leader.
MANAGING STRATEGIC RISK THROUGH 
COLLABORATIVE COST MANAGEMENT
Few would argue that the future of defense contractors is a bit bleak. With 
budget constraints affecting every Western country, this segment of the 
economy clearly faces strategic risks. This case highlights one defense con­
tractor’s efforts at developing a collaborative approach to managing costs.6 
The cost management process featured here moves beyond anything pre­
viously developed at this company and combines elements of value analy­
sis, value stream mapping, project management, total cost management, 
Six Sigma, innovation management, early supplier involvement, and risk 
management into a coherent cost management process.

Learning from Risk Management Leaders  •  277
Over the years this company has developed various approaches, some 
of which are quite sophisticated, to analyze its products. While provid­
ing a solid foundation upon which to carry out detailed analyses, these 
approaches did not necessarily provide the insight required for altering 
product cost structures and winning new orders. This case describes 
the development of a collaborative cost management approach that was 
applied to a complex product that is no longer needed by the U.S. military, 
the company’s primary customer. This pending loss of sales clearly repre­
sented a strategic risk to the company. A new, more competitive approach 
was needed to compete for sales from international customers.
This company decided to target an international customer to replace the 
expected loss of sales from its primary customer. The defense contractor 
believed this opportunity presented an ideal opportunity to develop a new 
and collaborative approach to cost management. This opportunity became 
the pilot program for a new process that identifies and then manages every 
cost element and driver within a complex product. International custom­
ers do not have pockets that are as deep as the Pentagon, making cost 
reduction an absolute necessity when competing for foreign contracts.
A Collaborative Approach to Cost Management
An internal cross-­functional team undertook the task of documenting 
the current state of the product, including an extensive analysis of every 
cost element and driver. The company needed a complete cost picture so 
it could identify where opportunities to reduce costs existed. The result 
of this initiative was the most detailed “as is” analysis ever performed 
by this company. The primary objective of this exercise was to identify 
where design flexibility, and therefore potential cost reduction opportuni­
ties, might exist. The team examined areas as basic as quality, delivery, 
and operations to identify cost reduction opportunities. It also analyzed 
every cost component all the way to its manufacturing line cost, including 
machine times, labor rate and times, material costs, and costs of goods 
sold. Extensive cost models were developed, much more so than what could 
have been developed with existing methodologies. The analysis revealed 
that materials made up 50% of total product costs, a finding that made it 
clear that suppliers were going to be an integral part of this process.
After completing its current state analysis, the company conducted a 
two-­day workshop with company engineers and designers. The first part 
of the workshop featured the creative generation of cost reduction ideas 

278  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
while the second part involved identifying potential savings. The partici­
pants also identified the cost of implementing an idea, including the cost 
to document an idea and verify its feasibility, as well as the cost to put an 
idea in place. While some ideas related to internal control and manufac­
turing, supplier-­provided materials, as mentioned, comprised the major­
ity of costs. This should come as no surprise as companies increasingly 
outsource greater amounts of value-­add to suppliers, particularly in com­
plex products like the one featured here.
At this point a decision was made to involve suppliers to generate addi­
tional cost ideas. Twenty current suppliers participated in a workshop that 
lasted one-­and-­a-half days. The company also invited potential suppliers 
to broaden the domain of innovation. Participants were divided into six 
smaller groups according to specific tracks or topics. During these work­
shops suppliers identified more than 150 cost-­reduction ideas.
After the workshop the defense contractor evaluated the feasibility of 
each idea and verified whether suppliers could follow through on what 
they said they could do. The accepted ideas from suppliers were expected 
to result in more than 20% lower product costs. Moving forward, the cost 
management team met every week to update the supply chain’s progress 
on these ideas.
A risk when using revised cost figures is actually achieving those figures 
during production. To mitigate this risk the defense contractor’s spread­
sheets included a risk factor column that adjusted the savings expected for 
items due to any uncertainty. This adjustment percentage was agreed to 
by a team that was familiar with the relative magnitude of potential risks 
across the various ideas.
Even after all this effort to lower product costs, the defense contractor 
did not win the new foreign contract. So, was all this worth it? The answer 
is a resounding yes. Perhaps most importantly, this company became 
familiar with a collaborative process that will help it better understand 
and manage costs across its current and future programs. And this com­
pany’s primary customer enjoyed cost benefits through lower pricing for 
its remaining orders. This experience revealed in no uncertain terms the 
important role that suppliers play when managing supply chain costs. 
Looking ahead, collaborative cost management will allow this company 
to become increasingly competitive as it applies its newfound cost man­
agement prowess to other products and opportunities.

LEARNING ABOUT RISK THE HARD WAY AT J. C. PENNEY
Few would argue that hiring a new CEO is not a strategic decision. 
Dissatisfied with J. C. Penney’s lackluster performance, the company’s 
board of directors took a bold step and hired Ron Johnson, the chief exec­
utive who reinvented retailing at Apple. All the new CEO had to do was 
arrive at Penney’s corporate headquarters in Texas on the corporate jet 
(which he reportedly did weekly from his home in California as he lived 
during the week in a high-­end hotel in Dallas), spread some Apple pixie 
dust, sit back, and watch good things happen. What could possibly go 
wrong? Apparently, a lot could go wrong. After only 17  months, J. C. 
Penney’s board ousted the CEO. This case is featured here because of its 
abundant risk-­related lessons.
If anyone ever doubts that pricing is a strategic variable, look no fur­
ther than what happened at J. C. Penney. Shortly after arriving, Johnson 
decided that the company’s reliance on coupons and deep price discounts 
were simply not right for the retailer. Apparently, he also was not too fond 
of fixed checkout stations and cash registers. He allowed employees to wear 
whatever they wanted, similar to the approach at Apple where employ­
ees walk around with mobile checkout devices. Unfortunately, customers 
could not always figure out who was an employee or where to pay for their 
purchases.7 Customer confusion soon reigned.
With minimal testing Johnson moved quickly to change Penney’s busi­
ness model, an act of hubris that the company may never fully recover 
from. He pursued an “everyday low prices” model with prices that were not 
necessarily the lowest. And, at least to Johnson, it was obvious that Penney’s 
customers wanted new high-­end brands. Bring on the new brands!
While Johnson eventually scrapped his new pricing approach, the dam­
age was already done as customers headed for the exits. Unfortunately, 
new customers did not arrive to replace those who left. Repositioning a 
lower-­end department store as one with high-­end styles requires careful 
planning, positioning, and execution, something that did not take place 
as Johnson rushed to change almost everything quickly.8 And a total mis­
reading of the customer is usually not a good thing. As one marketing pro­
fessor noted, “Ron Johnson was clueless about what makes shopping fun 
for women. It’s the thrill of the hunt, not the buying. Women love to shop 

280  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
and deals are what make the game worth playing. It took billions of dollars 
of lost sales, lost market cap, and over a year of embarrassing performance 
for Johnson to realize this truth.”9 The company has since announced the 
closing of dozens of stores. Its very survival is even in question. The unfor­
tunate reality is that strategic risk is the ultimate risk.
What lessons should we take from the J. C. Penney saga? First, pilot test­
ing is a legitimate risk management approach when changing something 
as strategic as a company’s business model. And while testing takes time, it 
is usually time well spent. The author of a Harvard Business Review article 
on data analytics posed an interesting question. In his article he stated, 
“Imagine if Ron Johnson’s tenure at J. C. Penney had involved small-­scale, 
data-­driven experiments rather than wholesale changes.”10 Second, truly 
understanding the customer and what motivates her is invaluable. This 
may be Johnson’s biggest mistake throughout this ordeal. Third, just 
because an idea worked in one industry does not make it an automatic 
winner in another. Apple and J. C. Penney have very different retail out­
lets, products, and customers.
It is also a good thing to learn from the experience of others. When 
Macy’s acquired May department stores in 2006, a chain that relied heav­
ily on coupons to attract customers, it decided to wean May’s customers 
off those dreaded coupons. A year later Macy’s abandoned that strategy, 
acknowledging publicly that pulling back on coupons was the company’s 
biggest mistake in the acquisition. Another lesson is that when recruit­
ing leaders, it is a good idea to make sure they believe in the organiza­
tion and what it stands for. Some critics concluded there wasn’t anything 
about Penney’s that Ron Johnson actually liked. Finally, be careful that 
changes don’t confuse the customer. J. C. Penney told customers to expect 
low prices, just not the lowest. Were customers really getting a deal? 
They weren’t sure, and that did nothing to help Ron Johnson’s cause. 
Unfortunately, some lessons are learned the hard way.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
A major take-­away from this chapter should be the recognition that many 
different and creative ways are available for managing supply chain risk. 
Just as there is an abundance of supply chain risks, so too there is an 
abundance of approaches for addressing these risks. No “cookie cutter” 

Learning from Risk Management Leaders  •  281
approach is available that will be everything to everyone. The domain of 
risk management tools, techniques, and approaches is broad.
Excluding the J. C. Penney example, certain commonalities characterize 
the companies featured here. First and foremost, these companies could 
not wait for others to develop solutions that satisfy their specific needs. 
While we expect an abundance of risk management tools and systems to 
become commercially available over the next 5 to 10 years, and of course 
there are tools available now, the companies featured here feel, at least for 
now, they are best served by their own internal development capabilities. 
Second, these companies know they have not completed their risk man­
agement journey. In fact, these companies would likely admit they have 
merely taken a series of steps in what will be a continuous journey. Few 
expect supply chain risk to magically disappear anytime soon.
Something else these companies have in common is they are develop­
ing a corporate culture that understands the importance of supply chain 
risk management. They understand that supply chain risk management 
represents that place within our thought process where supply chain man­
agement and risk management intersect. And this intersection is becom­
ing an embedded part of how each company operates. Finally, a detailed 
analysis at each company would surely reveal a risk champion or group 
that is not at all satisfied with the status quo regarding risk management. 
They understand that supply chain risk management is becoming a criti­
cal business process that affects a company’s strategic success. They will 
stay at the forefront of risk management leader­ship.

Future Directions in Supply 
Chain Risk Management
The future of supply chain risk management (SCRM) promises to be excit­
ing, challenging, and surely a bit frightening. Something that we should 
have concluded by now is that the world will not suddenly become a 
kinder and gentler place. If we believe that to be true, and most observers 
are willing to bet that the world is going to become more rather than less 
susceptible to risk, then supply chain leaders cannot afford to lower their 
guard. The future will belong to those companies that not only embrace 
risk but also understand how to anticipate and prepare for risk.
This last chapter of the book provides a forward-­looking view of supply 
chain risk. The first section presents a set of predictions that we believe 
have a high probability of occurring. The second section depicts a risk 
management maturity model that will help position our thinking regard­
ing the evolution of SCRM. The chapter concludes with some managerial 
guidance about moving forward in terms of risk management capabilities.
SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PREDICTIONS
Let’s dust off our crystal ball and take a peek into the future. While we 
could make dozens of risk predictions, the following are based on exten­
sive experience and research and have a strong, although not guaranteed, 
likelihood of becoming a reality.
Prediction 1: Company attitudes toward risk will start to shift.
A common view among supply chain managers is that risk is something 
most closely associated with loss. As a result, it is something to avoid. As 

284  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
companies become more confident in the economy (and that remains a bit 
of a wild card) as well as in their risk management capabilities, we expect 
risk attitudes to shift. The phrase we like to use is that companies will show 
a greater willingness to engage in “thoughtful” risk taking. Most of us 
realize that uncertainty and risk are part of a new normal. Without ques­
tion many companies will become more comfortable operating with risk 
as they learn to compete in this new normal. Companies should become 
less anxious about risk, although not to the point of complacency.
Something that affects executive perception toward risk is a belief that 
a strong commitment to innovation, particularly radical or “blue sky” 
innovation is incompatible with a culture of risk management. Some will 
perceive that innovation leads to excessive risk, a belief that can affect 
new product development, strategic planning, capital allocation, and sup­
ply chain management decisions. A study by Accenture, however, found 
that the beta of Forbes’s most innovative companies averaged just a frac­
tion more than less-­innovative peers. (A beta value is the measure of a 
company’s share price volatility relative to the market’s overall volatility.) 
Statistically, no meaningful relationship exists in the Accenture study 
between innovation and risk, at least in terms of stock volatility.
Prediction 2: Risk management will become an embedded part of sup­
ply chain management.
To date, SCRM initiatives have largely been handled separately from 
the normal job responsibilities of supply chain managers. As companies 
become better qualified in their understanding and planning for risk, we 
expect that risk management initiatives will become a more routine part 
of the supply chain management process, much as supplier audits, supplier 
development, supplier relationship management, and supply measure­
ment have become a routine part of supply management.
Embedding risk management directly into chain supply management 
does not mean that the importance of risk management will somehow 
diminish. In fact, the opposite is likely to be the case. As risk manage­
ment becomes a recognized part of an organization’s operating culture, 
risk issues will increasingly be considered early on when making sup­
ply chain decisions. Supplier selection teams, for example, will not only 
consider a supplier’s operating capabilities, but they will also routinely 
assess a potential supplier’s financial condition as well as its risk plans 
and capabilities. Selection teams will also consider geographic location to 
ensure that a supplier is not too clustered with other suppliers or located 

Future Directions in Supply Chain Risk Management  •  285
near known hazards. The bottom line is that supply chain managers will 
become risk managers.
Prediction 3: Companies will emphasize risk management efforts past 
tier-­one suppliers.
A common risk management model is to take it as an article of faith that 
first-­tier suppliers will monitor their suppliers (which are your second-­tier 
suppliers), and for second-­tier suppliers to monitor the next tier of suppliers. 
Assuming this will happen regularly is a fool’s proposition, to say the least.
A typical refrain when speaking with supply chain executives is that 
most risk management initiatives stress, and usually stop at, first-­tier sup­
pliers. A CAPS Research survey revealed that while 75% of participants 
report they have good risk management visibility to critical tier-­one sup­
pliers, just over 30% report having visibility to critical tier-­two suppli­
ers.1 The need to focus on what is happening at the subtier levels of supply 
chains has never been greater. As one original equipment manufacturer 
(OEM) aerospace executive commented, “There is always some small shop 
out there in the sub-­tiers that we just don’t know about that will disrupt 
us.” Without question the need to pursue risk management initiatives at 
the subtier supplier level has become a necessity.
The question becomes how to manage sub-tier suppliers from a risk 
perspective.
One way is to evaluate a potential supplier’s risk management capabili­
ties during supplier selection visits. To date, few companies truly evaluate 
how well a potential supplier manages risks in its part of a supply chain, 
although these companies are not shy about evaluating suppliers across 
many other performance dimensions. While you are assessing a supplier, 
why not assess how well that tier-­one supplier manages its suppliers (which 
are your tier-­two suppliers)? Another approach that will gain in popularity 
is mapping supply chains past the tier-­one level. Graphical presentations 
of supply chains can provide a wealth of insight. There is simply no excuse 
today for not knowing what life looks like past your tier-­one suppliers.
The aerospace industry provides a good case study regarding why sub­
tier risk management will increasingly be on the radar screen. Figure 15.1 
depicts the aerospace manufacturing supply chain structure. While each 
tier presents its own unique challenges, the tier-­four level has started to 
cause concerns among industry participants. The industry has witnessed 
some major supplier consolidation at the tier-­four level, which involves 
metal fabricators and casting suppliers. This consolidation is a growing 

286  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
source of concern for customers as it creates stronger pricing power and 
market leverage for new, larger suppliers. One expert notes that in many 
cases only one or two qualified suppliers now exist for an item.2 This is 
particularly troublesome as Boeing and Airbus face not only new com­
petitors but each also has a record aircraft order backlog.
Another example of the need to understand the supply chain past tier-­
one suppliers involves Aston Martin, a company known for supplying the 
cars that James Bond drives. The company was forced to respond to com­
plaints of the throttle pedal arm breaking. A root cause analysis revealed 
that a tier-­three supplier in China used counterfeit material that made its 
way into the pedal.3 Reports indicate that MI5 was not amused. Aston 
Martin announced it is planning to re-­source the manufacture of pedal 
arms from China to the United Kingdom as soon as possible.
Prediction 4: Supply chain risk metrics will stress real-­time predictive 
indicators.
Far too often risk management relies on historical data or a “batch” 
approach with periodic updating of data and information. This creates 
data lags that, at times, can be problematic. A performance fix may be

implemented with a supplier relatively quickly, for example, but because a 
measurement system refreshes data only monthly, it may still show a sup­
plier as being high risk, at least until the next update.
Many companies are searching for a better “crystal ball” for predicting 
risk. Rather than knowing what has happened, tools featuring predictive 
analytic capabilities that anticipate risk events before they occur or before 
an event results in more a serious loss will be highly sought after. We 
expect to see the increased development of supply chain operational indi­
cators that are applied within algorithms that have predictive capabilities.
This shift toward real-­time indicators will diminish the value of supplier 
scorecards, which are almost always backward looking. We could commit 
a fair amount of space here to the reasons why supplier scorecards will 
likely not be at the forefront of future risk management efforts. Scorecards 
will remain in place at most companies simply because of a reluctance 
to eliminate a system that enjoys a level of comfort internally and with 
external suppliers.
Automation and real-­time updates and monitoring, including those that 
fill in the gaps between regular risk assessments, are a direction most com­
panies will move toward, particularly with critical suppliers and logistics 
providers. Furthermore, automated data collection tools will help provide 
a view of risk without having to conduct formal assessments. Companies 
will continually search for opportunities to update the timeliness of their 
supply chain data and information. We expect a continued move toward 
real-­time data and data transparency.
Prediction 5: A “pockets of excellence” risk management model will 
move toward an enterprise-­wide risk management excellence model.
An interesting phenomenon occurs as ideas such as quality management, 
lean, and risk management evolve from concept to maturity. During 
the concept phase, internal units usually cannot wait for companywide 
or third-­party-­supported solutions, so they develop their own tools and 
approaches, resulting in varying levels of competency across a com­
pany. We often see internal sites or units displaying a capability that is 
not shared across the enterprise. The challenge becomes one of extending 
these “pockets of excellence” across an entire enterprise and supply chain.
Eventually, as a concept gains widespread attention, these pockets of 
excellence become more widespread before a company can expect to cap­
ture a sustainable advantage. This cross-­enterprise standardization will be 

288  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
a clear indicator that risk management is maturing and growing as a disci­
pline. In this sense, the evolution of risk management processes and capa­
bilities will be no different from any other important process or approach 
that we have seen over time.
The “pockets” model also extends to the kinds of risks that a company 
must manage. A supply chain organization may be skilled at assessing the 
financial integrity of its current and potential suppliers (financial risks). 
However, this same organization may be less effective at detecting day-­to-­
day issues that affect supply chain performance (operational risks). The 
scope of a risk management approach and the kinds of risks that a company 
can manage effectively will expand across an enterprise and supply chain.
Prediction 6: Total cost of ownership (TCO) modeling will become a 
routine part of the risk management process.
Several factors will ensure that total cost models will increasingly become 
a more routine part of the risk management process. First, the need to 
replace unit cost data with total cost data is becoming well accepted. 
Making important supply chain decisions with limited data simply pres­
ents too much risk. Second, a global strategy based on sourcing in emerg­
ing markets demands better data upon which to base decisions. What is 
the true cost of sourcing in China as exchange rates shift and the Chinese 
government provides incentives for suppliers to move inland in search of 
available labor and lower wages? What is the cost of additional complexity 
as supply chains become longer?
Similar to forecasting models (and some TCO models should be looked 
at as cost-­forecasting models), risk managers will increasingly validate 
their data, information, and assumptions as actual inputs become avail­
able. Depending on the model, total cost models are often populated with 
data that are future estimates (such as estimates of a supplier’s expected 
quality performance) or averages (such as the average nonconformance 
cost of a late supplier delivery). We fully expect a movement away from 
making sourcing decisions based on price and toward decisions based on 
total cost. To not do so exposes a company to excessive risk.
Prediction 7: Home-­grown risk management tools will increasingly be 
replaced by third-­party solutions.
Feel free to take this prediction to the bank. At most companies risk man­
agement tools and approaches are still in their infancy. As with many 

Future Directions in Supply Chain Risk Management  •  289
evolving concepts, early risk assessment tools are developed internally 
simply because external tools and applications are not yet available. Or the 
tools that are available don’t quite fit our requirements. It is not unusual 
for companies to have a need, scan the marketplace, and conclude that the 
marketplace is lacking in its offerings. We expect third-­party risk manage­
ment tools and applications to proliferate as providers, particularly soft­
ware providers, develop sophisticated risk management tools that respond 
to marketplace needs.
Thirty years ago one of the authors of this book helped to internally develop 
a warehouse management system (WMS) to help manage distribution cen­
ters. Why was the system developed internally? It was developed internally 
because no third-­party tools were available that even remotely satisfied this 
company’s requirements. How the times have changed. Inbound Logistics 
magazine regularly presents its listing of the top 100 WMS systems provid­
ers, a list that is narrowed from a pool of 300 providers!
Most companies, even those with well-­recognized supply chain man­
agement capabilities, are still progressing along a risk management matu­
rity curve. As they become more sophisticated, so too will the tools they 
require to manage risk. As demand increases for these tools, the market­
place will respond with an abundance of applications that will be much 
more powerful than what is available today. This is inevitable.
Prediction 8: Risk categories and specific risks will evolve and change, 
and these categories and risks will differ from industry to industry and 
company to company.
The risks that companies face are dynamic rather than static, particularly 
since many companies expect to expand geographically away from their 
home borders. Worldwide expansion creates greater supply chain com­
plexity, which correlates directly with increased risk.
Evolving risks will often differ across companies and industries. A 
financial services firm will perceive a different set of risks to be critical 
five years from now, such as the integrity of its data from emerging mar­
kets, compared to companies that are heavily dependent on raw materi­
als. Companies that rely on raw materials are increasingly concerned, 
for example, about the impact of rules addressing conflict minerals 
from Africa as well as commodity market manipulation. Other compa­
nies are concerned about evolving supplier risks regarding greenhouse 
gases, workplace conditions, labor issues, and the use of toxic materials. 

290  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Everyone sees risk through a slightly different prism, and that prism will 
continuously evolve and change.
Prediction 9: Risk management approaches will rely increasingly on 
anticipation and less on reaction.
Most companies recognize their proficiency, perhaps even their heroics, 
at responding to risk events. Unfortunately, this is not what most com­
panies want to be known for. Most supply chain organizations would 
rather be recognized for their proficiency at sensing and preventing risk 
events rather than reacting to and mitigating risk events. Risk reaction 
or responsiveness, when it occurs, should be because it is the appropriate 
risk response rather than the default option.
Risk prevention will receive greater attention during product develop­
ment and supplier selection, both of which are logical times to think about 
preventive activities. A word of caution is in order here. (How many times 
could we have used that phrase in this book?) Preventive actions taken 
during product design can lead to a new set of risks that must be managed. 
One company that is working to simplify its product designs now relies on 
suppliers to the point that suppliers are design partners. This arrangement, 
however, invites a new set of risks, particularly concerns about intellectual 
property (IP) ownership and becoming overly dependent on suppliers. 
Conversely, some suppliers are concerned about turning over their intel­
lectual property to customers during the design process or being asked to 
provide customers exclusive use of new technologies or innovations.
Prediction 10: Risk management awareness will increasingly affect cor­
porate culture, sometimes positively, sometimes negatively.
The effect that risk management has on a company’s culture can be a posi­
tive or negative force as we look toward the future. On the positive side, 
as the language and practice of risk management becomes an embedded 
part of an organization’s culture, personnel at all organizational levels and 
within all functional groups will consider risk implications when making 
decisions and formulating strategies. From the highest to lowest organiza­
tional levels, a continued emphasis on risk will create a healthy awareness 
of decision factors that may have previously been minimized or ignored. 
On the negative side, risk awareness can lead to risk obsession, resulting 
in a culture that is excessively risk averse. At that point, risk paralysis pre­
vents a company from pursuing the kinds of activities and initiatives that 
support future growth.

Future Directions in Supply Chain Risk Management  •  291
Prediction 11: Supply chain risk will increase as companies pursue 
sourcing and selling opportunities in emerging markets.
For those who are dreaming about a future that features far less supply 
chain risk than what we see today, do not lose sight of your dream. It will 
likely not come true, but never lose sight of the dream. Part of the rea­
son we think that supply chain risk will increase is that we do not expect 
companies to stop their incessant search for low-­cost suppliers or for sell­
ing their products in emerging countries. This means that companies will 
be doing business in regions that are not quite as familiar or friendly as 
what they are accustomed to. The result of pursuing buying and selling 
opportunities in emerging markets is that supply chains will continue to 
become longer, more complex, and inevitably more risky. Within supply 
chain management, this will raise the need to obtain market intelligence 
and manage risk.
Prediction 12: Enterprise risk management and supply chain risk man­
agement will increasingly overlap.
Enterprise risk management (ERM), which most companies have prac­
ticed in some form for decades, and SCRM, which is relatively new, will 
increasingly be viewed as interdependent rather than independent disci­
plines. Part of this is due to the strategic implications associated with sup­
ply chain risks, particularly supply disruptions. And as these disruptions 
and supply chain events become more severe, so do their strategic implica­
tions, which is what qualifies a risk to become part of a company’s strategic 
risk profile. As public companies fulfill their reporting requirements (refer 
back to the mandated reporting of corporate risk presented in Chapter 1), 
supply chain participants are increasingly part of this corporate reporting 
process. And supply chain executives are increasingly part of executive risk 
committees. Supply chain risk and enterprise risk will increasingly overlap.
AN EVOLVING RISK MANAGEMENT MATURITY MODEL
As we conclude our discussion of SCRM, we are convinced that as SCRM 
becomes a discipline, many frameworks, protocols, models, tools, tech­
niques, and methodologies will emerge. In fact, an Internet search reveals 
that dozens of risk maturity models are already available across various 

292  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
industries and professional groups. It seems that anyone who has engaged 
in some aspect of risk management has created a risk maturity model. Each 
of these models has steps that evolve from phases such as unaware, reac­
tive, or very basic to optimized, integrated, or advanced in terms of risk 
management maturity and capabilities. No shortage of models exists today.
Supply Chain Risk Maturity Model
A key roadmap and critical success factor for the SCRM journey is some­
thing we call the Supply Chain Risk Maturity Model. This new discipline 
is a journey, more so than a set of point-­in-­time solutions. Even though 
new solutions are emerging every day, many of which have been profiled 
in this book, the real key to the success will be the ability to effectively 
move through an SCRM Maturity Model and build expertise and knowl­
edge that allows a company to differentiate itself from the competition. 
Figure 15.2 illustrates the SCRM Maturity Model. The following provides 
a few relevant attributes that we feel will support supply chain excellence 
in each stage of the risk management journey.
Visibility
Visibility and awareness of risk across the supply chain is an important 
first step within the risk management journey. This also relates to know­
ing, preferably in real time, the location of materials and assets, such as

transportation vehicles. During this phase most companies begin their 
risk assessment using emerging tools such as third-­party supplier assess­
ment tools and web-­based heat maps that evaluate risk across the entire 
supply chain. Readers of this book have free access to a web-­based Supply 
Chain Risk Heat Map Assessment tool that is featured in the appendix. 
Companies are also beginning to develop Business Continuity Plans 
(BCPs) for every node in their supply chains.
Supply chain leaders are starting to map their supply chains in an effort 
to better prepare for and respond to both demand and supply disrup­
tions faster than their competitors. Let’s not forget that SCRM is a relative 
game. The ability to be alerted before your competition regarding a risk 
event and being able to respond faster will become a critical success factor 
defining global excellence.
Predictability
As companies progress in their journey, we expect to see them leverage 
their visibility capabilities to stress test their supply chains in terms of 
what-­if scenario planning. These exercises, utilizing network optimization 
and probabilistic modeling and mapping tools, provide a view into how 
supply chains might react to demand and supply disruptions. This insight 
will help companies build risk response plans.
Within this stage, companies are also leveraging third-­party tools that 
include fraud and corruption methodologies and alerts along with new 
techniques, protocols, and supply chain dashboards. One result of this 
will be the development of supply chain risk war rooms. These war rooms, 
supported by new tools and techniques, will support the ability to be more 
proactive, relative to risk events, by identifying the risk through alerts, 
assessing the risk utilizing probabilistic tools, mitigating the risk through 
new risk protocols, managing the risk and, at times, even turning the risk 
into an opportunity.
Resiliency
Companies at this stage are shoring up their organizational infrastruc­
tures through corporate frameworks such as ERM; governance, risk, and 
compliance (GRC), and ISO risk standards culminating in Risk Centers of 
Excellence (COEs). Risk management leaders are also instituting new key 
risk indicators such as Time-­to-­Recovery, Value-­at-­Risk, and Resiliency 

294  •  Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline﻿
Indexes. These frameworks, protocols, metrics, and organizational struc­
tures provide a foundation for operational excellence in risk reduction and 
competitive opportunity management.
Sustainability
Companies in this stage are leveraging predictive analytics to develop 
“what-­if” scenarios, maintaining a corporate-­wide risk management 
framework, and building and maintaining a risk-­adjusted culture sup­
ported by risk performance measures. All of this becomes a sustained 
part of the corporate culture. The leaders in this stage also continually 
assess their risk profile, evaluate their risk appetite regularly, and leverage 
their risk-­adjusted knowledge base in order to update their supply chain 
risk insurance portfolio. They also achieve real-­time risk event informa­
tion from third-­party providers and embed those alerts and information 
within their supply chain risk infrastructure and SCRM war rooms.
The SCRM journey is one of small steps. Each stage builds additional 
knowledge and expertise that needs to be codified, institutionalized, and 
reinforced. Supply chain leaders that are further along in this maturity 
mode understand that each stage in the journey corresponds to two to 
three years of continuous effort.
A CALL TO ACTION
A premise throughout this book is that future supply chain stability and 
success will be linked closely to a company’s risk management capabili­
ties. The following builds on this important premise by presenting a set of 
actions that provide managerial guidance.
Establish the Risk Leadership Team
It almost goes without saying that becoming a leading risk management 
organization will not happen without individuals who are capable of 
making risk management investments while demonstrating risk manage­
ment leader­ship. Given the magnitude of change a typical company faces 
as it works to elevate its risk management capabilities, it should come as 
no surprise that supply chain managers must become risk management 

Future Directions in Supply Chain Risk Management  •  295
leaders. A continuous challenge facing organizations concerns how to 
develop a generation of leaders who understand how to make risk man­
agement a critical organizational competency.
One way to link leader­ship and risk management is to make risk man­
agement responsibility an important part of executive leader­ship steer­
ing committees. Leading companies, for example, have in place executive 
steering committees that are responsible for setting the strategic direction 
for their sourcing groups. Figure 15.3 illustrates the actual responsibilities 
of a steering committee at a leading company. (For our purposes we have 
added an additional responsibility related to risk management.) Wherever 
leader­ship teams exist in the corporate hierarchy, the opportunity pres­
ents itself to embed risk management responsibilities. And it is equally 
important to establish the risk communication hierarchy.
As an aside, leader­ship is not the exclusive domain of executive leaders. 
Whether an individual is a buyer-­planner, commodity team leader, supply 
chain manager, or vice-­president, each will have an important role to play 
in the evolution of supply chain risk management. Each must demonstrate 
leader­ship at the appropriate level.
Establish Risk Crisis Teams
Seasoned supply chain professionals know that “stuff” is going to happen. 
The question is not if something will happen, but when and how severe

the consequences might be. In a crisis every second matters, making the 
establishment of risk management crisis teams something that should be 
on the agenda of any organization. These teams, staffed with the right 
professionals who have access to real-­time data and information, are an 
indispensable part of the risk management process. Chapter 14 featured 
Boeing’s approach for managing threats and crises through the use of 
dedicated teams.
Focus on the Risk-­Management Enablers
Chapter 3 presented the idea of organizational enablers, four distinct areas 
that support more advanced supply chain and risk management initia­
tives. These enablers include a supportive organizational design; informa­
tion technology systems that provide real-­time or near-­real-­time visibility 
to data and information; risk-­related measures and measurement systems 
that provide insight into potential risks as well as the effectiveness of risk 
management efforts; and the availability of capable human resources. 
Various dimensions of risk should be quantified and reported regularly to 
senior leader­ship.
The development and use of risk management tools, approaches, and 
strategies must become more commonplace, and that demands building a 
foundation of people, systems, measures, and organization that supports 
risk management excellence.
Assess the Current State of Risk Management Preparedness
Recall from our earlier discussion that as the concept of SCRM began to 
evolve, a mechanism to evaluate a company’s maturity in supply chain 
excellence and design took shape in terms of a “spider diagram.” This dia­
gram, which profiles a company’s supply chain maturity, has evolved into 
a supply chain risk awareness heat map. The heat map provides insight 
into a company’s exposure to supply chain risk and the state of its risk 
management preparedness. It is an awareness technique that starts a dia­
logue about supply chain risk.
The heat map tool is used to establish an enterprise-­wide picture of 
a company’s supply chain and risks through questions-­of-­discovery 
answered by representatives from multiple disciplines. The assessment is 
critical for understanding a company’s “as is” risk management state. The 

Future Directions in Supply Chain Risk Management  •  297
appendix of this book provides more detailed insight into this powerful 
and emerging approach to supply chain risk management.
Perform Risk Assessments and Develop Risk Management 
and Business Continuity Plans
Recall from Chapter 1 that a risk analysis or risk assessment is the process 
of qualitatively and quantitatively assessing potential risks within a supply 
chain. The objective here is to identify and categorize risks without focus­
ing strictly on obvious risks. The risk assessment should be expansive in 
its scope.
After performing risk assessments, it is time to articulate risk manage­
ment strategies and business continuity plans. Remember from Chapter 1 
that a risk plan is a document that considers known risks and includes 
descriptions, causes, probabilities or likelihood of risk occurrence, costs, 
and proposed risk management responses. The risk plan should be widely 
communicated with regular updates and progress reports. And recall from 
Chapter 7 that business continuity planning is the process of planning for 
and implementing proactive, preventive procedures that are designed to 
enable continuous operations of critical business processes and functions.
Gain Visibility across the Supply Chain
As we refer back to the Supply Chain Risk Maturity Model, the impor­
tance of supply chain visibility is clear. It is hard to envision becoming a 
risk management leader without a strong awareness of what is occurring 
across the supply chain. And visibility starts our risk management pro­
gression toward the more advanced phases of SCRM. A question logically 
becomes where we need supply chain visibility. A partial visibility listing 
includes the following:
•	 Location and performance of subtier suppliers
•	 Current and predicted operational performance of key tier-­one suppliers
•	 Updates of supplier financial health
•	 Real-­time location of materials and transportation assets
•	 Employee movements worldwide
•	 Hazard risks such as conflicts and weather
•	 Changes to supply and customer markets

The importance of the information technology enabler cannot be over­
estimated when striving for supply chain visibility.
Benchmark Risk Management Practices against Industry Leaders
Benchmarking is the continuous process of measuring products, services, 
processes, and practices of a firm against world-­class competitors or those 
companies recognized as industry or functional leaders. Why benchmark 
risk management practices? In short, benchmarking helps accelerate the 
development of best practices from any industry, stimulate and motivate 
those who must implement benchmarking findings, break down ingrained 
resistance to change, identify technological breakthroughs from other 
industries, and provide valuable professional contacts. Benchmarking is 
also a way to create a corporate culture that understands risk.
Organizations that fail to benchmark demonstrate certain undesirable 
characteristics. They tend to be reactive to change while pursuing internal, 
evolutionary change based on historical performance. They also tend to 
demonstrate a “not invented here” syndrome. On the other side, organiza­
tions that actively benchmark display a different and more desirable set 
of characteristics. These organizations tend to be forward thinking, pro­
active, and receptive to new ideas that accelerate the rate of change. And, 
they continuously search for industry best practices. As you might be able 
to tell, we are proponents of performance benchmarking.
Develop or Obtain the Tools, Techniques, and Risk Protocols
Algorithms using sophisticated predictive analytics and big data will 
increasingly become the norm rather than the exception in risk manage­
ment. We expect an abundance of new tools and techniques to become 
available. As with any tool, the key will involve understanding how to use 
it properly.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
While this book’s risk management journey is coming to an end (we are, 
after all, in the conclusion section of the last chapter), it is probably safe 

Future Directions in Supply Chain Risk Management  •  299
to say your risk management journey is evolving or even just beginning. 
We would like to close by reiterating some important observations made 
in the preface to this book (especially since many readers skip the preface):
•	 The financial impact of supply chain disruptions can be devastating 
but is often not understood until it is too late.
•	 The supply chain management profession has become too comfort­
able with the deterministic models and tools developed over the last 
35 years.
•	 Supply chain risk management is an evolving discipline and will 
remain so for the foreseeable future.
•	 Supply chain strategies driven primarily by cost management and 
delivery improvements are no longer comprehensive enough.
•	 Hard return on investiment for risk management initiatives is a 
hard sell.
•	 Social media is the new risk wild card.
•	 The risk ledger has two sides—negative consequences and poten­
tial opportunities.
•	 Supply chain risk is making it to the big leagues in terms of corporate 
visibility and reporting.
•	 Risk heroics must give way to risk prevention wherever possible.
•	 We need to take a broader rather than narrower view of supply chain 
risk management.
•	 Global supply chain risk is increasing, not decreasing.
In the end, supply chain risk management starts with an enlightened 
leader­ship that understands how to manage this thing called supply 
chain risk.

Appendix: The Supply Chain 
Risk Assessment Tool
As we mentioned in Chapter 12, as the concept of supply chain risk man­
agement began to solidify into a body of knowledge and then courseware, 
within the framework of an enterprise-­wide risk management approach 
(ERM), several major tenets developed into a set of questions-­of-­discovery 
regarding the maturity of the supply chain. As these supply chain tenets 
began to solidify, a mechanism to review, evaluate, and position a compa­
ny’s maturity in supply chain excellence and design took shape in terms of 
a “spider diagram” or heat map profiling a company’s supply chain matu­
rity, which then relates implicitly to the risk associated with that maturity. 
The heat map is a set of about 100 questions-­of-­discovery across 10 tenets 
of an end-­to-­end supply chain environment. A graphical illustration of 
the heat map appeared in Chapter 2. The answers to these questions-­of-­
discovery provide a first-­of-­a-kind glimpse into a company’s supply chain 
risk. The spider diagram, featured in Figure A.1, profiles color-­coded lev­
els of risk that correspond to high, medium, and low risk.
HOW YOU MIGHT UTILIZE THE TOOL
The heat map provides, perhaps for the first time, a glimpse into a com­
pany’s risk within their entire supply chain. As shown in Figure A.1, the 
tenets are leader­ship, balance scorecards, sales and operations planning 
(S&OP) processes, IT systems, supply chain techniques, demand man­
agement, industry practices, manufacturing, supply base, and logistics. 
The tool is an awareness technique to begin the dialogue covering supply 
chain risk. This figure has an outer ring (a red ring when using color-­
coded systems), which means any answer outside the red ring equates to 
a very high risk. Any answer between the red ring and the yellow ring 
(again, in color-­coded systems) equates to a moderate risk. And any result 
inside the yellow ring implies a lower risk. We placed an actual set of

scores from an oil and gas company headquartered in Asia. The reason 
the tool resonates is that many companies still have a tremendous amount 
of suboptimization within organizational silos and a lack of supply 
chain visibility.
The heat map tool is also utilized during supply chain risk assessment 
engagements with companies. The tool is used at the beginning of an 
engagement to establish an agreed-­upon enterprise picture of the com­
pany’s supply chain and risks through questions-­of-­discovery answered 
by leaders from various disciplines. Next, a detailed risk assessment for 
each node within the supply chain is exercised with the culmination of a 
final review of the supply chain risks using the heat map tool.
WALKING THROUGH THE QUESTIONS-­OF-­DISCOVERY
As mentioned, there are about 100 questions inside the tool. The ques­
tions are indicative of supply chain best-­in-­class practices from more than 
25 years of operational executive experience and 15 years of executive sup­
ply chain consulting around the globe. Our basic premise, reinforced by 
many research organizations and top-­tier consulting companies, is that as 
the supply chain becomes more mature, risk to the organization is dimin­
ished. Remember, risk is not eliminated, but rather reduced.
As you answer the questions, the tool will calculate a rating within the 
spider diagram at the bottom right end tab of the spreadsheet. When com­
pleted, the user will have a full-­picture image of inherent risks throughout 
an entire supply chain. The risk spider diagram can be used to begin or 
continue the supply chain risk dialogue.
HOW TO ACCESS THE TOOL
As a book owner and professional interested in SCRM, you will have access 
to the supply chain risk assessment tool, at no cost, for 45 days after your 
initial download. To access the tool follow the instructions in Figure A.2.

—Jim de Vries; enterprise master black belt, corporate initiatives; Air Products 
… this book will give you valuable perspectives on supply chain vulnerabilities and 
how to deal with them.
—Cliff Reese, management consultant and former global business leader
You don’t have to outrun the bear … you just have to outrun the other guy. 
Often in business we only have to run a bit faster than our competitors to be 
successful. The same is true in risk management. While we would always like 
to anticipate and prevent risk from happening, when risk events do occur, being 
faster, flexible, and more responsive than others can make a world of difference. 
Supply Chain Risk Management: An Emerging Discipline gives you the tools 
and expertise to do just that.
