Introduction
Introduction
Here we present a collection of examples of applications of the theory of Fourier series. The reader is
also referred to Calculus 4b as well as to Calculus 3c-2.
It should no longer be necessary rigourously to use the ADIC-model, described in Calculus 1c and
Calculus 2c, because we now assume that the reader can do this himself.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

Sum function of Fourier series
A general remark.
In some textbooks the formulation of the main theorem also includes the
unnecessary assumption that the graph of the function does not have vertical half tangents. It should
be replaced by the claim that f ∈L2 over the given interval of period. However, since most people
only know the old version, I have checked in all examples that the graph of the function does not have
half tangents. Just in case . . .

Example 1.1 Prove that cos nπ = (−1)n, n ∈N0.
Find and prove an analogous expression for
cos n π
2 and for sin n π

(Hint: check the expressions for n = 2p, p ∈N0, and for n = 2p −1, p ∈N).

One may interpret (cos t, sin t) as a point on the unit circle.
The unit circle has the length 2π, so by winding an axis round the unit circle we see that nπ always
lies in (−1, 0) [rectangular coordinates] for n odd, and in (1, 0) for n even.
It follows immediately from the geometric interpretation that
cos nπ = (−1)n.
We get in the same way that at
cos n π
2 =

0
for n ulige,
(−1)n/2
for n lige,
and
sin n π
2 =

(−1)(n−1)/2
for n ulige,
0
for n lige.

Obviously, f(t) is piecewise C1 without vertical half tangents, so f ∈K∗
2π. Then the adjusted function
f ∗(t) is deﬁned by
f ∗(t) =
 f(t)
for t ̸= pπ,
p ∈Z,
1/2
for t = pπ,
p ∈Z.
The Fourier series is pointwise convergent everywhere with the sum function f ∗(t). In particular, the
sum of the Fourier series at t = 0 is
f ∗(0) = 1
2,
(the last question).

It is obviously piecewise C1 and without vertical half tangents, hence F ∈K∗

It is no contradiction that f(t) = t, t ∈]0, 2[, can be given two diﬀerent expressions of the same sum.
Note that the cosine series is uniformly convergent, while the sine series is not uniformly convergent.

In the applications in the engineering sciences the sine series are usually the most natural ones.
Example 1.8 A periodic function f : R 	→R of period 2π is given in the interval ]π, π] by
f(t) = t sin2 t,
t ∈]−π, π].
1) Find the Fourier series of the function. Explain why the series is pointwise convergent and ﬁnd
its sum function.
2) Prove that the Fourier series for f is uniformly convergent on R.

1) Clearly, f is piecewise C1 without vertical half tangents (it is in fact of class C1; but to prove
this will require a fairly long investigation), so f ∈K∗
2π. Then by the main theorem the Fourier
series is pointwise convergent with the sum function f ∗(t) = f(t), because f(t) is continuous.
Now, f(t) is odd, so an = 0 for every n ∈N0, and

n is divergent, it follows from the criterion of equivalence that
b) is divergent. It also follows that neither a) nor c) can be absolutely convergent. Since an →0
for n →∞, we must apply Leibniz’s criterion. Clearly, both series are alternating. If we put

er
ϕ′(x) = x2+1−2x2
(x2+1)2
=
1 −x2
(1+x2)2 < 0
for x > 1, then ϕ(x) →0 decreasingly for x →∞, x > 1. Then it follows from Leibniz’s criterion
that both a) and c) are (conditionally) convergent.
2) Since a) is alternating, the error is at most equal to the ﬁrst neglected term, hence

1) The function f(t) is continuous and piecewise C∞without vertical half tangents. It is also even
and periodic with the interval of period [−π, π[. Then by the main theorem the Fourier series
for f(t) is pointwise convergent everywhere and f(t) is its sum function. Since f(t) is even, the
Fourier series is a cosine series.
2) It follows from the above that bn = 0 and (cf. the hint)

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

No matter the formulation of the problem, it is always a good idea to start by sketching the graph of
the function over at periodic interval and slightly into the two neighbouring intervals.
Then check the assumptions of the main theorem: Clearly, f ∈C1(]−π, π[) without vertical half
tangents, hence f ∈K∗
2π.
The Fourier series is pointwise convergent everywhere, so ∼can be replaced by = when we use the
adjusted function
f ∗(t) = f(t+) + f(t−)
2
as our sum function.
It follows from the graph that f(t) is continuous everywhere, hence f ∗(t) = f(t), and we have obtained
without any calculation that we have pointwise everywhere
f(t) = 1

1) The graph is sketch on the ﬁgure. It is not easy to sketch the adjusted function f ∗(1) in MAPLE,
so we shall only give the deﬁnition,
f ∗(t) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
f(t)
for t −2nπ ∈]0, 2π[,
n ∈Z,
2π2
for t = 2nπ,
n ∈Z.
2) Since f is piecewise C1 without vertical half tangents, we have f ∈K∗
2π. Then by the main
theorem the Fourier series is pointwise convergent everywhere, and its sum function is the adjusted
function f ∗(t).
Each term of the Fourier series is continuous, while the sum function f ∗(t) is not continuous.
Hence, it follows that the Fourier series cannot be uniformly convergent in R.
3) When F ∈K2π, then F is periodic of period 2π, hence

by the main theorem the Fourier series is pointwise convergent everywhere, and its sum function is

The function f ∈C∞(]−π, π[) is without vertical half tangents, so f ∈K∗
2π. Furthermore, f is odd,
so the Fourier series is a sine series, thus an = 0. The periodic continuation is continuous, so the
adjusted function f ∗(t) = f(t) is by the main theorem the pointwise sum function for the Fourier
series, and we can replace ∼by an equality sign,

3) Find for t ∈[−π, π] the sum of the series which is obtained by termwise integration from 0 to t of

The corresponding homogeneous equation without the boundary conditions has the complete so-
lution,
y = c1 cosh x + c2 sinh x.
Then we guess a particular solution of the form
y = ax2 + bx + c.
When this is put into the left hand side of the equation we get
d2y
dx2 −y = 2a−ax2−bx−c = −ax2−bx+(2a−c).
This equal to

The complete solution of (7) is

Since
y′ = 1

it follows from the boundary conditions that
y′(0) = −π

y′(π) = π

2 + c1 sinh π + c2 cosh π = c1 sinh π + π

hence c1 = −π

We see that the solution of the boundary value problem is unique. Since g(x) is also a solution,
we have obtained two expressions for g(x), which must be equal,

uniformly convergent, then the sum function should also be continuous, which it is not.

Since f (and ˜f) is not continuous, the Fourier series for f cannot be uniformly convergent.

If this series was uniformly convergent, then f −should be continuous, and hence also f = f ++f −

However, f is not continuous, so the Fourier series for f −is not uniformly convergent.

t ∈[0, 2π[.
1) Sketch the graph of f in the interval [−2π, 2π[.

(1) and (2) It follows from the rearrangement,

4π2 {4π2 −(t −2π)2}
that the graph of f(t) in [0, 2π[ is a part of an arc of a parabola with its vertex at (2π, 1). The
normalized function f ∗(t) is equal to 1
2 for t = 2pπ, p ∈Z, and = f(t) at any other point. Since
f(t) is of class C∞in ]0, 2π[ and without vertical half tangents, the Fourier series is by the main
theorem pointwise convergent with f ∗(t) as its sum function.
(3) Since f ∗(t) is not continuous, it follows that the Fourier series cannot be uniformly convergent.

Example 2.15 We deﬁne for every ﬁxed r, 0 < r < 1, the function fr : R →R, by

5) Prove that the series which is obtained by termwise diﬀerentiation (with respect to t) of (10), is
uniformly convergent for t ∈R, and ﬁnd the sum of the diﬀerentiated series in −π ≤t ≤π.
1) Clearly, fr(t) is deﬁned and C∞in t, when 0 < r < 1, because we have
1 + r2 −2r cos t ≥1 + r2 −2r = (1 −r)2 > 0.
Since it is also periodic of period 2π, it follows that fr ∈K∗
2π. Then by the main theorem the
Fourier series for each fr(t), 0 < r < 1, is pointwise convergent with fr(t) as its sum function.
Then we prove that the Fourier series becomes
fr(t) = ln(1 + r2 −2r cos t) = −2

Then by the boundary conditions,
u(0) = 0 = c0

u′′(0) = 0 = 2c2
