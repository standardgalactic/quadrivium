File Names  
 
 
LINUX permits file names to use most characters, but avoid spaces, tabs and characters that have 
a special meaning to the shell, such as:  
 
    
& ; ( ) | ? \ ' " ` [ ] { } < > $ - ! /  
      
 
Case Sensitivity: uppercase and lowercase are not the same! These are three different files:  
 
  
NOVEMBER       November     november  
      
 
Length: can be up to 256 characters  
 
 
Extensions: may be used to identify types of files  
     libc.a       - archive, library file  
     program.c    - C language source file  
     alpha2.f     - Fortran source file  
     xwd2ps.o     - Object/executable code  
     mygames.Z    - Compressed file  
      
 
Hidden Files: have names that begin with a dot (.) For example:  
     .cshrc      .login      .mailrc     .mwmrc   
 
  
 
Uniqueness: as children in a family, no two files with the same parent directory can have the 
same name. Files located in separate directories can have identical names.  
 
 
Reserved Filenames:  
    
/   - the root directory (slash) 
     .   - current directory (period) 
     ..  - parent directory (double period) 
     ~   - your home directory (tilde)
