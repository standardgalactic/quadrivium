Introduction
We live in a wireless world! All the technologies and standards that have been released in
the past six years, along with the ones that will be released between now and 2014, mean
that almost everything we do—every aspect of our lives—has a wireless component. In fact,
wireless data communications is omnipresent today—in the cordless phones we use in our
homes and offices, in the nearly 6 billion cellular phones that roam the world, even in ware-
houses, where wireless is used to keep track of inventory. Today, we can even purchase pro-
ducts or board a flight with our cellular phones and tablets, thanks to wireless. Furthermore,
homes, businesses, even whole towns are now equipped with wireless networks that allow
residents, employees, and visitors to access the Internet from anywhere using laptop compu-
ters, mobile phones, and tablets.
Whether you are a manager who needs a better understanding of the implementation of
wireless communication devices, an IT professional looking to enhance your understanding
of the field by adding wireless data communications, or a student taking an introductory
course in this topic, Guide to Wireless Communications, Third Edition, will help you gain
a basic understanding of the technical and business aspects of wireless data communications
technologies and prepare you for more in-depth learning.
Approach
Since the introduction, in mid-1995, of infrared interfaces in laptop computers, which
allowed two computers to communicate without wires, along with the publication, in 1997,
of the first IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network standards, the field of wireless data

communications has expanded dramatically. This book takes you on a virtual tour of all the
wireless data communication technologies, covering the basics of radio frequency transmis-
sions, antennas, infrared, Bluetooth, the IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) standard for low-rate wire-
less personal area networks, the IEEE 802.15.3c standard for high-rate wireless personal
area networks, ultra wide band (UWB), WiGig, WirelessHD, Wireless Home Digital Inter-
face, IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless local area networks, IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), free-space
optics, LMDS and MMDS wireless metropolitan area networks, cellular and satellite wireless
wide area networks, and, finally, radio frequency identification (RFID). Coexistence (the abil-
ity of two or more of these technologies to work in the same physical space) is also discussed,
as are the basic implementation and security issues for each of the mentioned technologies as
well as the various business and residential applications.
Using straightforward language, this text introduces the most important technical aspects of
each technology and can be used in either classroom settings or for distance education. It fea-
tures extensive linking to Web sites, where the reader can find additional materials. Please
note, however, that although the addresses of these Web sites were accurate at the time this
book was printed, some of them may no longer be available.
This text’s pedagogical materials include Real-World Exercises, which further your learning
outside the classroom setting, and Hands-On Projects, which take you through the often step-
by-step process of performing tasks relevant to working in wireless communications. The
Hands-On Projects, which can be performed in the lab or at home, use inexpensive,
consumer-class equipment as well as freeware and demo versions of popular software. Finally,
there are Challenge Case Projects, team-based research projects that help expand the student’s
knowledge of the technologies discussed and direct him or her to additional learning resources.

Writing a textbook, especially one covering so many different technologies, is a huge under-
taking that requires the involvement of a large team of people. The folks at Cengage/Course
Technology are undoubtedly one of the very best teams I have ever worked with. Acquisitions
Editor Nick Lombardi again demonstrated his excellent vision and insight by crafting the
direction of the book to meet the needs of the readers. Product Manager Michelle Ruelos
Cannistraci was wonderful in keeping this project on track and was always helpful and sup-
portive, especially when my daytime job required that I be out of the country or when my
teaching schedule left few hours during the day for writing. Developmental Editor Kent Wil-
liams is a master at his job. If you find this book useful or perhaps even enjoyable, it is due
to Kent’s incredible language skills and his insightful comments. Kent deserves full credit for
helping to turn my random thoughts into readable text. John Freitas is an extremely thorough
Technical Editor. He caught many of my “slips” and made excellent suggestions. I hope to get
a chance to work with these two fellows again in a future book. Production Editor Allyson

We all know that wireless communications technologies have had a huge impact
around the world, especially in the last five years. Today, wireless communications affects
almost everything we do on a daily basis, from using the ever-present cellular phones to
making voice calls and accessing information, to the counting of inventory in large retail
stores, to buying public transit system tickets, to locating hotspots for Internet access
and wireless remote sensors installed in locations that are difficult to access, to using credit and
debit cards that just need to be placed near a device instead of swiped or inserted, and many,
many other uses. There should be no question in anyone’s mind that the use of wireless
devices will continue to expand into virtually every aspect of our lives.
Wireless communications has completely revolutionized the way we live, just as personal
computers forever altered how we worked in the 1980s and the Internet dramatically
changed how we obtained and accessed information in the 1990s. Lately, the Internet has
also changed how we communicate around the world. Using wireless devices to send and
receive short messages as well as to browse the Internet and access corporate applications
and databases from any location in the world is now an integral part of our daily lives. And
numerous devices—notebook computers, tablets, digital still picture and video cameras,
printers, portable digital music players, even refrigerators, washing and drying machines, and
electricity meters—are equipped with the ability to communicate without wires.
Today, we can all be in touch with the digital resources we need, no matter where we may
find ourselves. Nearly everyone has experienced dramatic changes based on wireless technol-
ogies, to the extent that we don’t even think about what we are doing, we just expect
devices to work without being connected by a cable.
Using an electronic book reader or e-reader, you can view the cover,
sample some pages, and purchase a book simply by visiting an online
bookstore. On an Amazon Kindle device, for example, all you need
is access to either a wireless network or to the cellular telephone
network (in over 100 different countries), depending on which model
you have. The book will be automatically downloaded to your reader within a couple of
minutes. See www.amazon.com/kindle.
How Wireless Technology Is Used
Before we continue, let’s define precisely what we mean by wireless communications. The
term wireless is often used to describe all types of devices and technologies not connected by
a wire. A garage door opener and a television remote control can be called “wireless devices,”
but they have little in common with the technologies discussed in this book. Because the term
wireless is sometimes used to refer to any device that has no wires, people can be puzzled
about the exact meaning of wireless communications. A cordless phone can be considered a
wireless communications device—for communicating with the human voice, that is. But for
the purposes of this book, wireless communications is defined as the transmission of digital
data without the use of wires, meaning devices that can be interconnected using some kind
of data networking technology. Digital data may include e-mail messages, spreadsheets, and
messages transmitted to or from a digital cellular phone. However, note that devices that use
a computer network to transmit voice conversations are also included here.

One example of a device that can be used to transmit voice conver-
sations over a computer network is an Apple iPod Touch. This device
is generally used to listen to music but can also be used to make
calls to telephone numbers anywhere in the world while it’s con-
nected to a wireless network, using an application such as Skype.
(Go to www.apple.com/ipodtouch. Also go to www.skype.com, place the mouse cursor over
Get Skype, then click iPhone.) When using such devices, your voice is first converted to digital
data and then transmitted first over a wireless network and then over the Internet. At the
receiving end, the stream of data that is your voice is converted back to sound. You will read
more about this in Chapter 10.
The next section talks about the various forms that wireless data communications can
take. You will learn about Bluetooth, WirelessHD, WiGig, satellite, cellular, Wi-Fi-
based wireless LANs, and fixed broadband wireless communications technologies. The
specific details of each of these technologies are covered in later chapters. Let’s take a
look at a day in the life of a typical couple, Joseph and Ann Kirkpatrick, which will
provide a quick overview of some of today’s wireless communications and how they
can be used.
A Wireless World
Joseph and Ann get ready for a typical day. Before Ann leaves for the office, she must first
print a copy of a spreadsheet that she finished working on late last night. Because there are
several computers in their house, the Kirkpatricks have set up a wireless network that uses a
specific networking standard to allow all the digital-data-enabled devices around the house to
communicate with one another. Computers and other devices that are compatible with the
standards can be as far as roughly 330 feet (100 meters) apart from each other and can
send and receive data at speeds up to 300 million bits per second (300 megabits per second
or Mbps), depending on which specific standard they are compatible with. The devices
that can be part of the network include not only computer equipment but also Voice
over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephones, which carry digitized voice over the Internet,
home entertainment and gaming equipment, and even some digital music players, such as
an Apple iPod Touch.
To get a better idea of the speed of wireless transmission of data,
consider that each alphanumeric character transmitted typically uses
16 bits of data. This means that at 300 Mbps, which is the speed of
the fastest wireless network today, a computer can transmit over
9,000 letter-sized pages per second, with approximately 2,000 letters
and spaces in each. Can you read that fast?
Ann pulls a tablet computer out of her briefcase and opens a spreadsheet. She then selects the
print command. A device called a wireless network interface card (or wireless NIC) is built
in on the tablet computer. This interface card sends the data over radio waves directly to the
wireless-enabled laser printer downstairs, which has its own wireless NIC. This wireless net-
work is ideal for the Kirkpatricks. They can have all their home computing and electronic
devices interconnected without the trouble and expense of installing cables; this network
enables all of their devices to share printers, files, and even the home Internet connection.
Figure 1-1 illustrates the home wireless network.

Ann places a call to her office to pick up her messages using her smartphone, a combination
of a mobile phone and personal digital assistant (PDA) that also provides an appointment
calendar, a to-do list, a phone book, and a notepad as well as many other useful business
and entertainment applications. Although most mobile phones today include some of these
features, smartphones can connect to other devices, such as personal computers, and syn-
chronize the data between the two devices; they can also electronically store and transmit
business cards and other types of information, even word-processing files and spreadsheets.
In addition, almost all models of smartphones today can connect directly to the same kind
of wireless network that we use to interconnect computers. Because Ann is inside the home,
the smartphone automatically connects to the wireless network to access and store data.
While they are inside the house, both Ann and Joseph’s smartphones can use software that
enables them to make calls using VoIP over their wireless network and the Internet instead
of their cellular provider. They even have separate phone numbers that people can dial to
call them from a landline phone. After Joseph and Ann leave home, their mobile phones dis-
connect when they are out of range of the wireless network; then they use the cellular net-
work to make and receive voice calls. Being able to use VoIP over the Wi-Fi network helps
them save money by cutting down on their cellular phone bills.

As early as 2004, runners in the Boston Marathon covered the
26.2-mile course with tiny wireless chips clipped to their shoelaces.
The chips transmit an identification code that is detected at several
stations along the marathon course, and the code is used to
track the runners’ times as well as to e-mail updates to the run-
ners’ friends and relatives regarding their locations and progress. For a full description
of the technology employed, search the Internet using the keywords “Boston marathon
wireless.”
Shortly after finishing their breakfast in the kitchen, Joseph hears a short beep and notices
that a shopping list has been e-mailed to his smartphone from the refrigerator. A computer
system installed in the refrigerator door automatically generates a grocery list by scanning
the radio frequency identification (RFID) tags attached to almost every product package.
RFID tags are small chips containing radio transponders that can be used to identify pro-
ducts and track inventory. At predetermined dates and times, the refrigerator computer com-
pares the remaining food items with a list of minimum quantities for those items. If the items
are running out, it adds them to a list and sends an e-mail over the Internet to both Ann and
Joseph, which they receive on their smartphones. Joseph or Ann can also use the wireless net-
work to connect to the refrigerator’s computer and find out what they need to buy. Because
the refrigerator is also connected to the Internet, the same function can be accomplished
regardless of where they are, at any time.
To watch a video demonstration of a refrigerator computer in action,
search the Internet or YouTube using the keywords “Samsung Inter-
net fridge.” The refrigerator in this video does not include RFID, but
it allows you to manage a family calendar, leave notes for family
members, send e-mails and tweets, and connect to Facebook. You
can also access recipes online, create a shopping list, etc.
Bluetooth and Other Short-Range Wireless Technologies
Bluetooth is a wireless standard designed to transmit data at very short ranges—typically,
from a few inches to 33 feet (10 meters). The main purpose of short-range technologies such
as Bluetooth is to eliminate cables between devices such as smartphones and computers,
which allows data to be transmitted wirelessly between, say, a computer and a printer or a
mobile telephone and a music player or a computer and a smartphone. Figure 1-2 shows
two examples of Bluetooth headsets that are typically used with mobile phones or digital
music players like the iPod Touch but that can also be used with computers. Bluetooth com-
municates using small, low-power transceivers called radio modules, which are built into tiny
circuit boards and contain very small microprocessors. Bluetooth devices use a link manager,
which is software that helps it identify other Bluetooth devices, create a link between them,
and send and receive music and voice in the form of digital data; it can also send other
types of data.

There are other short-range wireless technologies designed for use primarily in the home,
which are similar to Bluetooth but can handle a lot more data at much higher speeds.
For example, WirelessHD and WiGig can send CD-quality audio and DVD or Blu-ray disk
high-definition video to multiple receivers around the house at the same time. Most Bluetooth
devices can transfer a maximum of between 1 Mbps and 3 Mbps at distances of up to 33 feet
(10 meters), but the latest version covers transmission at data rates up to 24 Mbps. WirelessHD
and WiGig can transfer video and sound at speeds between 7 Gbps and 10 Gbps (gigabits or
billions of bits per second) using a radio transmission technology called Ultra Wide Band
(UWB). Bluetooth can send data through physical barriers like walls. These wireless devices
don’t even have to be aimed at each other the way a TV remote control usually has to be
aimed at the TV set when changing channels or adjusting the sound. UWB WirelessHD and
WiGig generally have a range of up to 10 meters, but only within a room with few or no obsta-
cles between devices. In addition, the greater the distance, the slower the transmission. The
gigabit per second speeds above can only be achieved at distances of up to 6 feet (approxi-
mately 1.8 meters). Plus, the more obstacles, including people, that there are in a room, the
shorter the transmission range of UWB.
Nearly 14,000 different computer, telephone, and peripheral vendors create products based
on the Bluetooth standard. Both WirelessHD and WiGig also have an impressive list of well-
known member companies.

Joseph and Ann both work for Federated Package Express (FPE), a package delivery service.
To send a package, a customer telephones the local FPE call center. An FPE customer service
representative receives the call using her VoIP telephone handset, which is connected to the

WLAN and to a Bluetooth telephone headset. Ann doesn’t even have to be at her desk; her
Bluetooth device automatically establishes a connection with the wireless telephone handset
as soon as both devices are turned on. She can immediately answer a call by simply tapping
a small button on the headset, without having to pick up the receiver. In addition, the tablet
computer she carries around keeps her connected to the office network at all times, no matter
where she is in the building. For example, the address list and calendar that Ann updated last
night at home are transmitted to the office, and the information is immediately refreshed.
The automatic connection between various Bluetooth devices creates a piconet, also some-
times called a wireless personal area network (WPAN). A piconet consists of two or more
Bluetooth devices that are exchanging data with each other. Up to seven devices can belong
to a single Bluetooth WPAN.
The customer service representative at FPE answers the call while she is moving around her
cubicle, without having her movements not limited by a telephone wire. She can also enter
the package pickup information on her computer or, when she is not at her desk, on her tab-
let. Figure 1-3 illustrates a Bluetooth wireless network.
Bluetooth is named after the tenth-century Danish King Harald Blue-
tooth, who was responsible for unifying Scandinavia. You can read
more of his story on the Internet by searching for the king’s name.
Satellite Networks
FPE, the company that Joseph and Ann work for, has connectivity needs that go far
beyond the walls of its headquarters building. The company uses a combination of a
satellite-based network and the cellular wireless network to stay in touch with its delivery
vehicles while they are on the road. Where cellular networks (discussed in the next section)
are not available, the drivers can use satellite phones to connect their handheld computers
to FPE’s head office.
After the FPE customer service representative has entered the pickup information into the
computer, the data needs to get to the pickup driver—in this case, Joseph. FPE’s satellite
network is sometimes responsible for this data transmission. From the main head-office
computer, the pickup data is transmitted to a satellite orbiting the Earth and then back down to
the handheld satellite phone and finally to Joseph’s handheld computer. Figure 1-4 shows a
satellite retransmitting the signal between the main office and the satellite phone in Joseph’s van.

In satellite communications, a device called a repeater is located in the satellite itself.
A repeater simply “repeats” the same signal to another location down on the surface.
An Earth station transmits to the satellite at one frequency band, and the satellite regenerates
and transmits (repeats) the signal back to Earth on a different frequency. The transmission time
needed to repeat a signal from one Earth station to another can be up to 250 milliseconds.
This is illustrated in Figure 1-5.

FPE uses an outside vendor that provides international satellite communications.
The first satellite to orbit Earth successfully, called Sputnik, was
launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Today, there are more than
900 operational satellites in orbit around the planet and reportedly
over 5000 that are no longer functional. It’s only due to some truly
amazing mathematical calculations that they don’t continually crash
into one another, but on February 10, 2009, a nonoperational Russian satellite did crash into
the Iridium 33 communications satellite, which is used for satellite phones.
Cellular Networks
Cellular digital technology provides another link between the various components that make
up the FPE package pickup process. A modern cellular telephone network is built around the
concept of low-power transmitters, with each “cell” handling a number of users. With trans-
mission towers spread throughout a city, the same radio frequency channel can be used by
towers located a few miles away from each other, thereby avoiding interference. This concept
maximizes the use of a limited range of frequency channels and is made possible by low-
power digital transmission technology, which permits another transmitter to use the same
frequency a relatively short distance away, without causing interference problems. This
topic is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10. Figure 1-6 shows examples of two
smartphones.
Joseph is equipped with a handheld smart wireless terminal, and his truck is equipped
with a wireless printer. Joseph’s handheld terminal receives the pickup order via the cellu-
lar phone network and can also receive time-sensitive information, such as route alerts
warning of traffic delays or changes in pickup schedules; Joseph can also access route
maps online. The van’s engine computer, which monitors engine performance and other

vehicle systems, can perform diagnostic checks and transmit the results back to FPE over
the same cellular connection. GPS tracking technology installed in the truck allows FPE to
monitor the location of the delivery trucks, sending pickup orders to the one that is closest
to the customer.
With the pickup order transmitted through the cellular network to the handheld terminal,
Joseph swings onto the highway and reaches the address in about 15 minutes. He leaves
the van carrying his handheld terminal, and then walks into the building to retrieve the
package. The customer has already filled out a package label called a waybill that includes
the sender’s information as well as the recipient’s name, address, and other information.
A unique, 12-digit tracking number is printed on the waybill along with a barcode that
corresponds to the tracking number. Using his smart terminal, which includes a barcode
scanner and keyboard, Joseph scans the barcode on the waybill and then types in the desti-
nation of the package, the type of service delivery (such as Priority or Standard Overnight),
and the delivery deadline. If necessary, when Joseph returns to the van, the terminal
connects to the printer and can output a more detailed routing label that contains all this
information, which Joseph can then place on the package before putting it in the back of
his truck.
The information Joseph enters on his handheld terminal after picking up the package
is immediately transmitted back to the office using wireless digital cellular technology. The
data is actually transmitted to a cellular tower, which retransmits the data to the office via
the cellular carrier’s central office and eventually through the Internet. This cellular technol-
ogy is based on a standard commonly known as 4G (fourth generation) technology, which
uses 100 percent digital transmission for both voice and data. On a 4G cellular phone,
the technology allows the user to make a voice call at the same time data is being transmitted
or received.
Check out the range of RFID-equipped and barcode-scan-equipped
mobile computers at the Motorola Solutions Web site—for example,
the MC65 model at www.motorola.com or the Intermec 70 series
devices (that can be used for parcel delivery and pick-up) at www.
intermec.com. Some of these devices can also be used as a cellular
phone anywhere in the world. For portable wireless printers, check out www.maxatec-europe.
com or www.zebra.com. You can also search the Internet using the terms in this tip to find
other products.
4G sends data at rates that can theoretically reach over 150 Mbps when the devices are not
moving and located in an area with few concurrent users, over 45 Mbps for slow-moving
pedestrians, and over 20 Mbps in a fast-moving vehicle. 4G technologies are expected to
harmonize all the different digital cellular specifications used around the world into a
single standard. If Joseph happens to be located in an area outside the reach of the current
4G cellular networks, the terminal can use the interim technology known as 3G (third
generation), which has a theoretical maximum data transmission rate of up to 21 Mbps
and can realistically reach speeds between 3 to 11 Mbps. The latest cellular technology

standard that is being deployed by carriers around the world is capable of even higher
speeds and will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10. A digital cellular network is
illustrated in Figure 1-7.
Wireless Local Area Networks
Joseph pulls his van into the FPE distribution warehouse, where packages are unloaded and
sorted for delivery. His handheld terminal may still contain a large amount of important
data, including shipping receipts and electronic customer signatures for deliveries. As soon
as he pulls the van up to the loading dock, the terminal begins communicating with the com-
puter network in the warehouse through a wireless local area network (WLAN). A WLAN is
an extension of a wired LAN, connecting to it through a device called a wireless access point
(also AP or wireless AP). The AP relays data signals among all the devices on the wired net-
work, including file servers, printers, and even other access points and the wireless devices
connected to them. Each computer on the WLAN has a wireless network interface card
(NIC). This card performs the same basic functions and looks similar to a traditional NIC
except that it does not have a cable that connects it to a network jack in the wall. Instead,
the wireless NIC has an antenna built into it. The AP is fixed in one place, although it
can be moved when necessary, whereas the computing devices with wireless NICs have the
freedom to move around the office area or sometimes an entire campus complex. An access
point and wireless NIC are illustrated in Figure 1-8, but keep in mind that the wireless NIC
in Joseph’s handheld terminal is built in and is much smaller.

WLANs operate based on networking standards established by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE has published a series of standards, including the
more recent IEEE 802.11n-2009 (more commonly known as IEEE 802.11n), which provides
for data transmission speeds of up to 600 Mbps and distances much greater than those
of earlier versions of the standard. Depending on the standard used, most WLANs can trans-
mit at speeds anywhere from 1 Mbps to 300 Mbps and cover distances of up to 375 feet
(114 meters), under ideal conditions. In fact, even with some inexpensive 802.11n devices,
today’s WLANs can reach speeds of up to 450 Mbps. See Table 1-1 on page 18 of this
chapter for a breakdown of the standards and their capabilities.

Throughout this book, “IEEE 802.11,” “802.11,” and “Wi-Fi” are
used interchangeably, with or without a letter after the main standard
number, 802.11. Although this may not be the most correct way to
refer to these standards, it is the way everyone in the industry usually
refers to them.
FPE currently uses an 802.11g network and is in the process of updating its WLAN
to the higher capacity and faster 802.11n standard. The transmission of data from
the handheld smart terminal, which includes all the important information regarding
each pickup, is completed before the first package is unloaded from Joseph’s van
(see Figure 1-9).
Joseph’s wife, Ann, who also works for FPE, uses WLANs at her office, too. She does not
have a desktop computer in her cubicle. Instead, FPE provides employees with portable
notebook computers or tablet computers that they use while traveling, at home, and in the
office. None of the notebook computers and tablets in the office are connected to the local
area network by cables or wires. Instead, a WLAN provides connectivity among devices.
The WLAN renders devices portable. When Ann turns on her notebook computer at her
desk, it establishes an automatic, preconfigured connection with the access point. She can
now perform any network activity as if she were connected to the network with a cable. She
can bring her notebook to a conference room for meetings. Once there, her notebook is still
connected to the network, as are the notebooks of the other staff members in the meeting.

Fixed Broadband Wireless
FPE’s offices are spread over three locations: the main office, which is downtown; the ware-
house, which is in a small industrial park; and the call center, which is at the edge of town.
Through the years, FPE has tried a variety of connection types to link the three sites. Initially,
FPE used expensive transmission lines leased from the local telephone company. Integrated
Services Digital Networks (ISDN), which transmits at up to 256 Kbps over regular phone
lines, was soon replaced with T1 lines, which transmit at 1.544 Mbps, which was itself
replaced with optical fiber. However, both of these types of communication lines cost several
thousands of dollars per month. Technologies such as cable modems, which use a television
cable connection, are generally only available in or near residential areas. Digital subscriber
lines (DSL), which use either regular or special telephone lines, are sometimes available, but
the speed is dependent on the distance between FPE’s main office and the nearest telephone
switching office (CO, for “central office”).
The best and lowest-cost way for FPE to link its office locations was to use a wireless
metropolitan area network (WMAN). A single WMAN link can cover an area of about
25 square miles, and it can be used to carry data, voice, and video signals. WMANs
today are mostly based on the IEEE 802.16 WiMAX Fixed Broadband Wireless standard
and use radio waves for data communications instead of optical or telephone wires.
These networks use small custom antennas on the roof of each building in the WMAN.
The signal is transmitted to the antenna of the receiving building. The transmission
speed can be as high as 75 Mbps at distances of up to 4 miles (6.4 km), and 17 to 50 Mbps
(depending on link quality) at distances over 6 miles (10 km) in a straight line, which is
enough to interconnect all of FPE’s offices. Newer versions of the IEEE 802.16m standard,
which should be approved by the time this book is published, can achieve average speeds
up to 100 Mbps, and up to 1 Gbps in a point-to-point link. The use of antennas substan-
tially reduces the cost when compared to traditional wired connections, which require
an infrastructure under city roads, are more prone to damage, and are more expensive to
maintain.

Ironman triathlons, which can encompass a wide geographical area,
can now be viewed live online using an IEEE 802.16 WMAN to con-
nect cameras along the race route to the competition’s Web site.
Several channels of video are sent out, allowing enthusiasts to check
what is happening at different race checkpoints simultaneously.
FPE has antennas on each of its three buildings in the area. Once the data from Joseph’s van
is transmitted to the network in the warehouse, it is sent to the main office by fixed broad-
band wireless. This process is illustrated in Figure 1-11.
Wireless Wide Area Network
Personal computers use Web browsers to display Internet data. Based on user input, a Web
browser requests Web pages to be displayed on the user’s computer screen. The requested
page is transmitted from a file server to the user’s Web browser in Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML), the standard language for displaying content from the Internet. This
model is illustrated in Figure 1-12.

As Joseph’s van is unloaded, he takes his afternoon break. Joseph pulls out his smartphone to
surf the Internet. He can do this because his phone is a late model that includes an HTML
version 5-compatible Web browser, which displays Web content the same way a computer
does. Older cellular phones may be equipped with a microbrowser, a miniaturized version of
a Web browser program that is based on version 1 of the Wireless Application Protocol
(WAP) and cannot display graphics or pictures. Newer types of phones that are not
smartphones use the Wireless Application Protocol version 2.0 (WAP2), which provides a
standard way to transmit, format, and display Internet data for small wireless devices such
as cellular phones.
WAP2 follows the standard Internet model, allowing compatible cellular phones to display
Internet content directly. The microbrowser in a WAP2-compatible cellular phone is a tiny
program much like the browser on a PC, but the Web pages can be reformatted by the
microbrowser for cellular phone screens, which usually have much less space. WAP2 is com-
patible with HTTP, the protocol used by Web server software to format data into Web
pages, but it uses an earlier, simpler version (1.1) of HTTP rather than the version (4.1) in
use by most of today’s full-featured browsers. Most smartphones are also equipped with
WAP2 browsers, which are used when they cannot access high-speed digital cellular services
but still need to be able to access the World Wide Web.
When a Web server sends a Web page back to a PC, it is sending
HTML code and any files (such as graphics) required to assemble the
page. The Web browser application program on the receiving device
is responsible for interpreting the code and displaying the results
on the screen; in other words, the Web server does not send a fully
formatted image of the page. Rather, it sends only HTML code and text along with formatting
instructions, images and graphics, and the relative positions where they should be displayed
on the screen. It is the receiving device itself that is responsible for formatting and displaying
the Web pages.
Some newer cellular phones can even display live television and can be used to access a vari-
ety of business applications. Most cellular phones today still use a version of J2ME (Java 2
Micro Edition) and are designed and optimized to display text, graphics, and even some lim-
ited animations on the small screens, as seen in Figure 1-13. Several business applications
that support common file formats such as Microsoft Word or Excel spreadsheets can be
downloaded and displayed on some mobile devices or can be available on demand on the
Web. Using cellular phone technologies, companies can create a wireless wide area network
(WWAN) that enables employees to access corporate data and applications from virtually
anywhere—across the country, an entire continent, or, depending on the type of cellular
phone or mobile device, anywhere around the world.

Joseph uses his cellular phone to connect to a Web server. Actually, the cellular phone connects
to the nearest cell tower, which connects to the local telephone company, which in turn con-
nects to an Internet provider and completes the link to the Web server. The contents of the
Web page are then sent back and displayed on the screen of Joseph’s phone.
The previous version of Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) allowed
Web browsing from cellular phones using text only, and it required
a gateway server between the Web server and the cellular phone. In
the original version of WAP, the text information (but not the
images) contained in a Web page was extracted and translated by
the WAP gateway (or WAP proxy) server from HTTP into a WAP-specific format called Wireless
Markup Language (WML) and broken down into a series of pages called “cards.” These cards
could be displayed on the small screen of a cellular phone, one at a time.
The Wireless Landscape
Most of the Kirkpatrick’s activities, in a typical day, could not be attempted—much less
completed—without wireless technology. It’s clear that wireless communication is no longer
reserved only for high-end users. Instead, it has become a standard means of communication
for people in many occupations and circumstances, as shown in Figure 1-14. As new wireless
communications technologies are introduced, they will become even more integral to our
lifestyle and will continue to change how we live. Table 1-1 summarizes these technologies;
Figure 1-15 compares their capabilities.

The speeds of wireless networks vary greatly, depending on the number of users connected,
the amount of data traffic, the amount of interference present at the time, and many other
factors that will be discussed in later chapters.
Just as the number of wireless devices will dramatically increase, so will the number of job
opportunities to support these new technologies. Professionals such as wireless engineers,
wireless local area network managers, and wireless technical support personnel will be
needed to build wireless networks and assist wireless users. The job market for these new
careers is exploding and will continue to grow.
Worldwide expansion of wireless has surpassed all expectations. This
has made it difficult for market research companies to provide accurate
estimates of growth. In areas of central Africa, for example, where
banking systems and a communications infrastructure practically do not
exist, customers do not have a credit history, and the majority of the
population survives on less than $1.00 a day, a cellular phone operator estimated it might have
36,000 customers by the end of one year. Instead, it had 38,000 subscribers within three weeks.
A team of anthropologists recently studied wireless device usage
among people around the world. They noted several cultural differ-
ences in how wireless products were perceived. In Sweden, wireless
phone devices become an extension of users’ personalities. In France,
users are more concerned about how the phone looks than the
underlying technology or what it can do. In Great Britain, shy people find wireless devices
help them overcome their reticence and reach out to others. In Japan, wireless usage helps

citizens break through social barriers, a common obstacle in that culture. In the United States,
there’s concern about people developing information overload from being available 24 hours
a day. And in India, many business appointments and even major transactions are often
accomplished using text messaging on cellular phones.
Digital Convergence
Users are constantly demanding more functionality from their computers, and as a result,
wireless devices such as cellular phones and PDAs are being combined into single devices,
what we today call smartphones. These devices have also continued to add capabilities.
Whereas they were initially used only as appointment calendars, phonebooks, and phones,
today they can play computer games with sophisticated graphics, play both short- and full-
length movies, and play music as well as provide Web access and run business and utility
software while connecting via the cellular network or WLANs. Some carriers even provide
users with the ability to watch live television programs on their smartphones.
Digital convergence refers to the power of digital devices—such as desk and laptop compu-
ters and wireless handhelds like smartphones—to combine voice, video, and text-processing
capabilities as well as to be connected to business and home networks and to the Internet. The
same concept applies to the development of VoIP networks, which use the same protocols and
media (both wired and wireless) that once carried only data to carry two-way voice conversa-
tions. Wireless networks in general play an important part in digital convergence as users
demand to be connected to their data and voice networks at all times, wherever they may be.
Cellular providers in North America and Europe are beginning to introduce TV programming;
depending on the device, we can even have access to on-demand movies and Internet radio.
The recent and upcoming advances in wireless technology and standards discussed in this
book will enable an ever-wider range of applications for wireless devices. There are now
smartphones that incorporate all voice and data communications in addition to providing
entertainment functions and allowing the user to make payments and debits directly from a
bank or prepaid account, and many more devices with these same capacities will be intro-
duced in the near future. Today, people in Finland can purchase a ticket, pay for a bus or
streetcar ride, buy a drink from a pop machine, order movie tickets, and so forth just using
their cellular phones. They don’t need to carry a wallet.
In China and many other Asian countries, more people use cellular
phones than computers to access the Internet and e-mail, check
news reports, and watch movies.
Wireless Applications
Almost every type of business needs a computer network, but many are unable to install tradi-
tional cabled networks because of the physical limitations of such systems. Wireless networks
can go where regular wired networks couldn’t. Wireless applications—the use of wireless
communications technologies in conducting day-to-day business activities—can be found in
any industry whose employees need the mobility and freedom to conduct business without
being confined to a specific location. Industries and fields such as education, construction,
and health care are among those using wireless technologies to make a number of activities
occur more quickly and conveniently.

Education
Wireless technology is ideal for schools. An instructor can create a classroom presentation on
a notebook computer in his home or school office, then carry the computer right into the
classroom. He does not have to plug and unplug cables to attach to the campus network.
Instead, the notebook automatically connects to the classroom network as soon as the
instructor walks into the room; it can even connect to multimedia display projectors without
using wires. Teachers can also distribute handouts directly to students who have brought
their own wireless devices to class, and they can conduct pop quizzes in which students
submit their answers directly and immediately.
The wireless connection also frees students from having to go to a specific computer lab or
the library to get on the school’s computer network. They can access the school network
wirelessly from almost any location on campus. As students move to different classrooms in
different buildings, they remain connected to the network. Wireless education makes comput-
ing resources available to students and teachers from anywhere at any time.
Wireless technology translates into a cost savings for colleges. Traditional classrooms become
fully accessible computer labs without the expense of additional wiring and infrastructure.
And colleges no longer have to consider the expense of adding open computer labs for
students because everyone can access the resources from any building on campus or, in some
cases, while outdoors.
You can search YouTube for a video called “Classroom of the Future.”
This short video provides an overview of many of the wireless
advances being employed in today’s schools.
Home Entertainment
Since 2006, a number of manufacturers have introduced products designed to enhance the home
entertainment experience by enabling people to distribute all forms of digital media throughout
the home. From wireless speakers to media players, game consoles, DVD players, televisions, dig-
ital video recorders (DVR), and multimedia personal computers, several large manufacturers are
adding wireless networking capability to their products. Multimedia PCs enable movie and
audio enthusiasts to download, distribute, and control all forms of digital entertainment from
anywhere in the house. The specialized wireless networking software and hardware simplifies
processing of sound, video, and pictures. You can send music, movies, or pictures to a stereo
receiver, TV set, portable device, or PC located anywhere in the house. Begin watching a movie
in the family room, if you wish, then move to the bedroom and finish watching the show from
there. You can also download the files to your digital media portable devices, such as MP3 and
video players, which can be used while roaming throughout the house.
Although there are many such multimedia-capable devices on the
market today, three notable ones are Apple TV, WD TV Live Plus,
and Boxee. Both Apple TV and Boxee come with built-in wireless, and
WD TV Live Plus is compatible with a wide range of USB wireless NICs.
Once connected to a television and a WLAN, these devices are able
to access and play media stored in networked disk drives or computers, display Internet content
directly, and allow users to rent or purchase movies and music from a variety of sources. You
can search the Web for more information on these products.

Home Control Systems
In addition to multimedia, several manufacturers are making wireless systems that enable
us to control lights, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, drapes, alarms, door locks, and
various home appliances from locations throughout the home or even from a smartphone
or tablet anywhere in the world. These systems, several of which use the ZigBee Alliance
communications protocols and the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, enable devices like light
switches and wall sockets to communicate with one another, thereby allowing us to con-
trol the entire home environment. This can help keep the home secure by turning lights
on and off at preset times or by randomly increasing and decreasing the time by up to a
half hour, to make the home look “lived-in.” It can also make the environment more
comfortable when we get home from work. And, finally, it’s more “green,” given that
lights and devices can be automatically turned off and the temperature can be adjusted
when no one is home.
Health Care
Administering the correct medication is a major concern in the health care industry. It is esti-
mated that incorrectly administered medication results in hundreds of thousands of medical
emergencies annually. Typically, printouts of prescriptions are posted in the pharmacy area
of a health care facility. As the medications are dispensed for delivery to a patient, they are
crossed off the list. However, because the paper record cannot always be updated immedi-
ately, there is a possibility that a patient will get an extra dose of medication before an
order for a new or changed medication has been processed. This potential problem necessi-
tates duplicate documentation, with nurses first checking the printout to determine the medi-
cation and dosage to be given, then noting on paper that the medication was actually given,
then later entering the data into the hospital’s database.
Wireless point-of-care computer systems based on smartphones, tablet computers, or
wireless-equipped computers mounted on movable carts allow medical staff to access and
update patient records immediately. Many hospitals are using portable devices with barcode
scanners or RFID and a wireless connection. Without connecting and disconnecting cables,
health care professionals can immediately document a patient’s medication administration in
the computer while moving from room to room. Nurses and doctors can identify themselves
to the computer system or be automatically detected by a real-time location system. The
patient’s barcoded or RFID-enabled armband is then scanned, and all medications that
are currently due for that patient are brought up on the screen. The medications to be
administered are sealed in pouches that can be read by a device connected to the com-
puter. Nurses identify the medications before opening the package. An alert immediately
appears on the screen if the wrong medication or incorrect amount is selected. After
administration, the nurse indicates through the wireless network that the medication has
been given, electronically signing the distribution form. A hard copy can be printed out
as needed.
The system immediately verifies that medication is being administered to the correct patient
in the correct dosage, which eliminates potential errors and documentation inefficiencies.
The documentation process now takes place at the bedside, where care is delivered, which
improves accuracy. In addition, all hospital personnel have real-time access to the latest
medication and patient status information.

Select medical groups are now beginning to provide their physicians
smartphone software, a portable printer, and prescription-writing
software. This technology is intended to reduce errors associated
with illegible handwritten prescriptions and can transmit drug orders
to the pharmacy via the hospital’s WLAN or the Internet.
Even telephones are now being connected to hospital IEEE 802.11 WLANs, employing VoIP
technology. Doctors and nurses no longer have to be paged over the PA system, nor do they
have to be in an office or nursing station to access lab results. Doctors can also consult with
specialists while at a patient’s bedside, and the specialists can be more easily reached, no
matter where they are in the hospital. Cellular phones have been banned from health care
facilities due to their potential for interfering with diagnostic equipment, but handsets that
can connect to an IEEE 802.11 WLAN and use VoIP are allowed, and they are making
hospitals far more efficient.
Wireless real-time location systems are also being implemented
in hospitals around the world to track equipment, staff, patients,
and doctors, and to identify the potential spread of contagious
diseases in hospitals, a major problem that is made worse by the
advent
of
antibiotic-resistant
bacteria
(see
www.aeroscout.com,
www.sonitor.com, and www.infonaut.ca). Some of these wireless systems are also being con-
nected to hand-washing stations and hand-sanitizer stations to track whether doctors and
nurses are complying with hospital and government regulations dealing with hand hygiene.
Doctors can now monitor a patient’s vital signs remotely. A graphical application running on
a smartphone can display a patient’s heart rate and electrocardiogram and can monitor a
patient’s blood pressure and other vital signs. This can be done via Wi-Fi if the doctor is in
the hospital, or through the cellular network after she leaves the facility, or from anywhere
in the world where cellular phone service is available (see www.airstriptech.com).
Government
Many cities around the world are deploying broadband and Wi-Fi wireless networks that let
residents, city employees, contractors, and utility staff access the Internet, collect and transmit
data to central databases, and so forth. For example, building inspectors can update permit
data while at the construction site. City employees can locate and monitor municipal vehicles.
Police officers can watch live streaming video feeds to help them fight crime. And visitors to
the city can access the Internet in key areas, which promotes tourism and stimulates the local
economy. Nearly every day, there’s another news report that a city is either planning or
deploying a wireless network.
Allegany County in western Maryland has been reaping the benefits of an IEEE 802.16
network since before the 802.16 standards were ratified. The county’s $4.7 million
AllCoNet2 project uses 16 radio towers configured in a ring to deliver broadband connectiv-
ity to schools, libraries, and government buildings. To avoid conflict with Internet service
providers, the city allows them to resell the excess capacity of the county’s broadband
network at a reduced rate to commercial users, which further stimulates economic
development in the region.
Many other cities use wireless technology to provide free Internet access to residents and to
attract visitors and businesspeople. The city of Fredericton in the Canadian province of New

Brunswick deployed a system that covers the entire downtown business district and uses a
mix of technologies. IEEE 802.16 wireless broadband connects all the major points, and an
IEEE 802.11 WLAN is available in the major downtown streets as well as in restaurants,
bars, and many other retail businesses. These options provide residents with free Internet
access from notebook computers, tablets, and smartphones. In 2005, the city won a major
award for innovation as a result of this project. The city of Hamilton in Ontario, Canada
uses an IEEE 802.11 WLAN to read smart electrical meters. These meters monitor busi-
ness and residential hourly electricity consumption and report back to the city’s utilities
commission.
Military
Military forces around the world use a large variety of both commercial and dedicated
wireless communications devices. The latest devices allow military personnel in the field
to use voice and the Internet as well as receive and transmit full-motion video, maneuver
remote control survey drones, use digital battlefield maps, and so on. Most military
technology is considered part of national security, and detailed information about it
is generally available only to military personnel or to those with the proper security
clearances.
Office Environments
Thanks to wireless technologies, employees in all lines of work never have to be away
from the data they need to help them make decisions. In addition to the accessibility of
networked data, wireless technologies allow businesses to create an office where the tradi-
tional infrastructure doesn’t exist. Typically, an office space must be wired with computer
cables for network connections and telephone wires for telephones. With wireless tech-
nologies such as WLAN and Bluetooth, that expensive cabling infrastructure, which is
difficult to troubleshoot and modify, is no longer necessary. This means that an office can
be created in a very short period of time with minimum expense. For example, a hotel con-
ference room that may not have the infrastructure to support a wired network can quickly
be turned into a wireless networked office environment. During office renovations or
reorganization, employees can move to another location in the building or to a completely
different place and can be connected immediately, saving businesses the expense of rewiring
the entire office.
Event Management
Managing spectators attending a sporting event or concert can be a daunting task. Each
attendee has a ticket, and there are special passes for the press and team officials. However,
tickets can be lost, stolen, or counterfeited. Attempting to identify a stolen or counterfeit
ticket as thousands of spectators are waiting to be admitted has until now been almost
impossible. But several large arenas and stadiums are now turning to wireless systems to
facilitate this process.
Event tickets are printed with a unique barcode and have an RFID tag embedded that is then
scanned at the venue’s point of entry using handheld or integrated turnstile hardware, which
in turn is connected to a wireless network. The network instantly validates the ticket and
then sends a signal back to the turnstile that permits the patron to enter the arena. This

technology is very difficult to reproduce, can prevent the use of counterfeit tickets and can
also be used to identify stolen or duplicated tickets.
The wireless point-of-entry turnstiles can provide organizers with a real-time look at traffic
flow, thus helping a venue effectively manage its staff and determine where additional people
are needed. Advertisers can also tailor their marketing based on who is entering at which
gate on wireless display screens installed near the entry points.
In addition, wireless technologies are changing the entertainment experience itself. In several
major stadiums, wireless transmissions of in-progress game statistics are available to any fan
in the stadium with a wireless device, such as a notebook or tablet computer, or even with a
portable media player or video-enabled smartphone. Fans can also view instant replays of
the event they are attending or watch replays from other games around the country. In the
Arizona Cardinals’ football stadium, fans can use their wireless devices to play fantasy foot-
ball or order concessions and have them delivered to their seats.
Travel
Because wireless technology creates mobility, the travel industry was one of the first to
embrace it widely. Wireless global positioning systems (GPS) that tie into emergency road-
side assistance have become standard features on many automobiles sold today. Satellite
radio transmission of over 150 music and talk stations solves the problem of losing a
station outside its transmission range. Satellite radio is a subscription service, meaning
that users pay a monthly fee for the privilege of listening to the stations without any
commercial interruptions. The OnStar roadside assistance service uses GPS and cellular
technology to link the vehicle and driver to a central service center. Users can also use
the system to make phone calls using the cellular network. Although the system has been
exclusively available to GM vehicle owners for several years, electronics and auto acces-
sory retailers now sell it to the general public as OnStar FMV (For My Vehicle), with
a user interface built into the rearview mirror (see Figure 1-16).

Airport terminals are likewise turning to wireless technologies. Most large airport terminals
in North America transmit wireless signals that passengers can pick up on their wireless note-
book and tablet computers or smartphones while waiting for their flights. For a nominal fee
(or at no cost in some airports, such as Pearson International in Toronto, Canada), they can
also surf the Internet or read e-mail as well as check or change flight schedules, and so forth.
Even the airplanes themselves are being equipped with wireless data access. Several large
airlines—Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, Singapore Airlines, China Airlines, Korean Air,
and many others—are offering wireless Internet capabilities to passengers on cross-country
or long-haul flights. Like their Earth-bound counterparts, these passengers can access the
Internet or view their corporate data and e-mail from their seats while in flight. Air Canada
began a pilot project to offer wireless Internet access on short flights between Toronto,
Montreal, and New York City.
City transit systems are also “going wireless.” People in Finland can purchase bus, train, and
movie tickets (not to mention a can of soda) without ever needing to show a piece of paper.
The cost is debited automatically from their bank accounts, and in most cases they simply
present a two-dimensional barcode on their phone screens when entering the cinema or bus.
Tram tickets in Amsterdam, Holland are equipped with an RFID chip and antenna. Although
they look and feel like a regular cardboard ticket, to use them you simply wave the ticket by
a box placed near the doors when you board and exit the tram. The unit makes a sound to
indicate that your ticket is still valid (usually for one hour) or to let you know that you will
need to purchase a new one if your current one has expired.
Construction
Although at first glance the construction industry may not seem to be a prime candidate for
wireless technologies, in reality it benefits greatly. Special rugged tablet computers are being
manufactured to allow engineers and architects to review drawings and plans at the job site.
One challenge for builders is that each construction phase must be completed before the next
can begin. For example, if the concrete footings for a new building cannot be poured, then
the entire project must be put on hold. This series of events often means idle construction
employees and last-minute schedule adjustments. Information from the job site, such as a
tardy subcontractor or a problem with materials, could be relayed back to the main office
for rescheduling of workers to other sites to prevent idle time.
Because foremen are often at multiple sites during a day’s work, filing daily payroll paper-
work can be a challenge. Payroll clerks often wrestle with scrawled or illegible notes and are
unable to contact the foreman on the job for clarification. The paperwork problems can be
eliminated when foremen enter time sheet information on a tablet computer and transmit it
to the main office.
Construction equipment such as bulldozers and earth graders also participate in wireless
networks by being fitted with wireless terminals, turning them into “smart” equipment. A
GPS on a bulldozer can provide location information accurate to within a foot or, in some
cases, an inch. The exact location of the dig coordinates can be transmitted to a terminal
on the bulldozer, which displays a color-coded map to guide the operator. Smart equipment
can be connected through wireless transmissions back to the home office, which tracks engine
hours and equipment location. Wireless terminals in the engine’s diagnostic system can send
an alert when the oil needs to be changed or other maintenance operations are due.

Warehouse Management
Managing a warehouse stocked with inventory can be a nightmare. New products arrive
continually and must be inventoried and stored. When products are shipped out of the ware-
house, they must be located and then transferred to the correct loading dock so they can
be placed on the right truck. Then, employees must update the stock database to reflect the
outgoing shipment. A mistake in any one of these steps can result in a warehouse stocked
with products that it cannot locate, irate customers receiving the wrong items, or a store run-
ning out of goods to sell.
Implementing wireless technology is essential in many warehouse operations. By equipping
all of the warehouse’s machinery and personnel with wireless networking devices, managers
can use warehouse management system (WMS) software to supervise all the activities, from
receiving through shipping. And because this network is tied into the front-office computer
system, managers can have statistics that are always current.
Pallet loads arriving from locations outside the receiving warehouse come with barcoded
pallet labels. The bar coding includes product identification numbers, product code dates or
expiration dates, originating plants and lines of manufacture, and sequentially assigned serial
numbers. As pallets arrive, a forklift operator scans the barcode label with his portable wire-
less device. This device sends the data to the wireless network, where the warehouse software
immediately designates a storage location for the pallet and relays the information back to
the computer on the forklift. A warehouse employee prints out a barcode and fixes it to the
pallet. The forklift operator then transports the pallet to the designated storage location.
A barcode label suspended from the ceiling for floor locations or attached to a rack face
identifies every storage location. The operator scans that barcode to confirm that the pallets
are being put in the correct location before depositing the load.
In the front office, orders for merchandise to ship out are received and entered into the com-
puter that connects to the WLAN in the warehouse. The WMS software manages order pick-
ing, balances workloads, and selects pick sequences for forklift operators. The dock control
module of the WMS then releases orders for picking. A forklift operator locates the correct
storage location, scans the barcode of the pallet, and then ferries it to the shipping dock to
be loaded onto a truck.
In the near future, most of the barcode functions, including inventory counting, will
be replaced by RFID tags, removing the need for printing and affixing labels. Many large
retailers already have instructed their suppliers to implement RFID in all the products they
purchase. Some highly sophisticated warehouses are operating with fully automated pallet
machines and forklifts that can process the storing and retrieving of products completely
without human intervention.
Environmental Research
One of the most challenging aspects of documenting research while in the field is that it is
difficult and dangerous to extend long cables or install heavy equipment inside, say, deep
caves or on the tops of trees. Today, in places that were previously difficult to access and
monitor, scientists are using small, battery-powered or solar-cell-powered sensors that can
connect to a WLAN. For example, transmitter-equipped sensors located at the tops of tall
trees monitor the effects that ultraviolet rays are having on our forests due to the holes in
the ozone layer. The computer equipment that records the sensor readings can be installed

in a much more accessible location nearby, along with large, heavy batteries or generators,
and it can communicate with the sensors using wireless technology. This capability has
proven to be a major breakthrough in many scientific fields and has helped collect data that,
until recently, was very difficult—if not impossible—to record.
Industrial Control
Because of their size and complexity, large manufacturing facilities, such as automotive
assembly plants, find that it is often impossible to install a full-featured network using very
long cables. If machines need to be monitored, it can take hours or even days for a technician
to access every machine and record or download the status of each piece of equipment. Wire-
less networking can solve that problem. Remote sensors called motes can connect to a
WLAN, then collect data and transmit it to a central location. Manufacturing managers can
monitor their equipment from an office, detecting problems instantly. Technicians in a
control room can monitor the status of every machine or device and dispatch a technician to
perform work on the equipment when necessary.
Wireless Advantages and Disadvantages
As with any new technology, wireless communications offers both advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages of Wireless Networking
There are many advantages to using wireless technology compared to wired networks. These
include mobility, ease of installation and lower cost, increased reliability, and more rapid
disaster recovery.
Mobility The freedom to move about without being tethered by wires is certainly the
principal advantage of a wireless network. Mobility enables users to stay connected to the
network no matter where they roam within the network’s range. Many workers who can’t
stay tied to a desk—such as police officers who need to access vehicle registration and
infraction records or inventory clerks who work in large stores or warehouses—are finding
that wireless data communications has become vital to the performance of their jobs.
Wireless technology is also permitting many industries to shift toward an increasingly
mobile workforce. Many employees spend large portions of their time away from a desk—
whether they are in meetings, working on a hospital floor, or conducting research. Notebook
computers—and, more recently, tablet computers, smartphones, and other portable devices—
allow these employees to enjoy added convenience, including access to the company network
and business applications.
One characteristic of today’s business world is “flatter” organizations, meaning there are
fewer management levels between top executives and regular employees. Much of the work
is done in teams that cross both functional and organizational boundaries, requiring many
team meetings away from the employees’ desks. The need for immediate access to network
resources exists even while these meetings are taking place. WLANs are again the solution
to the problem. They give team-based workers the ability to access the network resources
they need while collaborating in a team environment.

Easier and Less Expensive Installation Installing network cabling in older build-
ings can be a difficult, slow, and costly task. Facilities constructed prior to the mid-1980s
were built without any thought given to running computer wiring in each room. Thick
masonry walls and plaster ceilings are difficult (and messy and loud) to drill holes through
and snake cabling around. Some older buildings have asbestos—a potentially cancer-causing
insulation material—that has to be completely removed before cabling can be installed. And
there are often restrictions on modifying older buildings that have historical value.
In all these instances, a WLAN is the ideal solution. Historical buildings can be preserved,
dangerous asbestos doesn’t need to be disturbed, and difficult drilling can be avoided by
using a wireless system. And, of course, eliminating the need to install cabling can result in
significant cost savings for companies.
WLANs also make it easier for any office—in either an old or a new building—to be modified
with new cubicles or furniture. No longer does the design for a remodeled office first have to
consider the location of the computer jack in the wall when relocating furniture. Instead, the
focus can be on creating the most effective work environment for the employees.
The amount of time required to install network cabling is generally significant. Although the
cable itself is not very expensive, installers must pull wires through the ceiling and then drop
cables down walls to network outlets. This can usually take days or even weeks to complete,
and in countries where labor costs are high, this can make it very expensive. And except in the
case of brand-new buildings, employees must somehow continue their work in the midst of the
construction zone, which is often difficult to do. Using a WLAN eliminates any such disruption.
Using your favorite search engine, look for “installing wireless in a
castle.” There are a couple of interesting articles by Motorola and
Aruba Networks, two of the most successful manufacturers, about
their ventures into networking old buildings.
Increased Reliability Network cable failures may be the most common source of net-
work problems. Moisture from a leak during a thunderstorm or a coffee spill can erode
metallic conductors. A user who shifts the computer on her desk may break the network
connection. When cables are installed in the ceiling or behind walls, a cable splice that is
done incorrectly can result in unexplainable errors that are very difficult to identify and
locate. Using wireless technology eliminates these types of cable failures and increases the
overall reliability of the network.
Disaster Recovery Accidents happen every day. Fires, tornados, and floods can occur
with little, if any, warning. Any organization that is not prepared to recover from such
disasters will find itself quickly out of business. A documented disaster recovery plan is
vital to every business if it is to get back to work quickly after a calamity.
Because the computer network is such a vital part of the daily operation of a business, the
ability to have the network up and working after a disaster is critical. Many businesses are
turning to WLANs as a major piece of their disaster recovery plans, in addition to using
IEEE 802.11n wireless networking as the main connectivity solution. Savvy planners keep
laptop computers with wireless NICs and access points in reserve along with backup
network servers. Then, in the event of a disaster, managers can quickly relocate the office
without needing to find a new facility with network wiring. Instead, the network servers

are installed in the building along with the access points, and the laptop computers are
distributed to the resettled employees.
Future Applications Digital wireless communications has expanded almost beyond
human imagination since the second edition of this book was published in 2006, and this
trend will continue at a very fast pace. Wireless networks have overcome most of the speed
limitations since the original standards were approved. At one time, paperless tablet devices
like the ones you may have seen in old Star Trek movies were practically unthinkable.
Today, they’re becoming commonplace in homes and offices and are being used for a very
wide range of applications. Patients can swallow tiny wireless cameras installed in capsules
that enable doctors to conduct examinations inside a person’s body without the need for
exploratory surgery. It is virtually impossible to make predictions or to cover every single
application here. Every day, a new application for wireless data transmission is thought of
or implemented.
Disadvantages of Wireless Networking
Along with the many advantages of wireless technology, there are disadvantages and con-
cerns, including radio signal interference, security issues, and possible health risks.
Radio Signal Interference Because wireless devices operate using radio signals, the
potential for two signals to interfere with each other exists. Virtually any wireless device
can be a source of interference for other devices.
Several common office devices emit signals that may interfere with the receivers in a WLAN.
These devices include microwave ovens, elevator motors, and other heavy electrical equip-
ment, such as manufacturing machines, photocopiers, certain types of outdoor lighting
systems, theft protection systems, and cordless telephones. These may cause errors to occur
in the transmission between a wireless device and an access point. In addition, Bluetooth,
WLAN 802.11b/g/n, and ZigBee devices can all operate in the same radio frequency, poten-
tially resulting in interference between such devices in spite of efforts to design these radios
to automatically avoid interference.
Interference is nothing new for a computer data network. Even when using cables to connect
network devices, interference from fluorescent light fixtures and electric motors can some-
times disrupt the transmission of data. The solution for wireless devices is the same as that
for standard cabled network devices: locate the source of the interference and eliminate it.
This can usually be resolved by moving a photocopier or microwave oven across the room
or to another room. Most wireless devices can identify that an error has occurred in the
transmission and retransmit the data as necessary.
Outside interference from AM or FM radio stations, TV broadcast
stations, or other large-scale transmitters is not an issue because
they operate on vastly different frequencies and power levels. How-
ever, GPS and satellite transmissions can sometimes affect Bluetooth
and WLAN transmissions outdoors.
Security Because a wireless device emits radio signals that can cover a wide area, security
becomes a major concern. It is possible for an intruder to be lurking outdoors with a

notebook computer and a wireless NIC with the intent of intercepting the signals from a
nearby wireless network. Because much of a business’s network traffic may contain sensitive
information, this is a real concern for many users.
However, some wireless technologies can provide added levels of security. A special coded
number can be programmed into an authorized wireless device, which must then transmit
this special number prior to gaining access to the network; otherwise, it is denied access.
Network managers can also limit access to a wireless network by programming it with a
list of approved wireless devices. Only those devices on the list will be allowed access. As
a further protection, data transmitted between the access point and the wireless device can
also be encrypted or encoded in such a way that only the recipient can decode the message.
If an unauthorized user were to intercept the radio signals being transmitted, he or she could
not read the messages being sent.
Health Risks Wireless devices contain radio transmitters and receivers that emit radio
frequency (RF) energy. Typically, these wireless devices emit low levels of RF while being
used. Scientists know that high levels of RF can produce biological damage through heating
effects (this is how a microwave oven is able to cook food). However, it is not known if
lower levels of RF can cause adverse health effects. Although some research has been done
to address these questions, no clear picture of the biological effects of this type of radiation
has been found to date.
Most wireless devices also emit very low levels of RF energy when in
stand-by mode. These levels are considered insignificant and do not
appear to have health consequences.
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Communi-
cations Commission (FCC) set policies and procedures for some wireless devices, such as
cellular telephones. However, only the World Health Organization (WHO) currently con-
ducts and sponsors research on this topic. In May 2011, the WHO indicated that these
devices can be “carcinogenic” but also included a statement that no adverse health effects
had been established yet. The announcement was related to the use of cellular handsets,
which place the transmitter antenna very close to the user’s head during a call. One of the
easiest ways to address this issue is to always use a headset when talking on a cellular
device.
The FCC and FDA, along with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), established RF
exposure safety guidelines for wireless phones back in 1996. Before a wireless phone is
available for sale to the public, it must be tested by the manufacturer and certified that it
does not exceed specific limits. One of the limits is expressed as a specific absorption rate
(SAR). SAR relates to the measurement of the rate of absorption of RF energy by a wireless
phone user. The FCC requires that the SAR of handheld wireless phones not exceed 1.6 watts
per kilogram, averaged over 1 gram of tissue.
Science today does not yet permit anyone to draw a definitive conclusion about the safety of
wireless mobile devices. Although there is no proof that using mobile wireless devices has
adverse health effects, it is wise to be aware of the possibility and monitor ongoing scientific
research.

Chapter Summary
■Wireless communications has become commonplace today and is quickly becoming
the standard in the business world. Remote wireless Internet connections and entire
wireless computer networks are making many network-based business activities faster
and more convenient.
■Wireless networks and devices are found in all circles of life today. Home users can
implement WLANs to connect different devices. Meanwhile, Bluetooth, WirelessHD
and WiGig are beginning to be implemented on consumer devices, making it possible
to connect many different types of home audio and video equipment over short
distances. The WAP2 protocol is used along with programming languages such as
J2ME to access Web sites and private networks from cellular phones, but HTML
version 5 is already being introduced in all new models. WLANs are also becoming
the standard in business networks. Fixed broadband wireless is used to transmit data
at distances up to 35 miles (56 kilometers), and satellite transmissions can send data
around the world. Digital cellular networks are used to transmit data at up to 21 Mbps.
■Wireless wide area networks will enable companies of all sizes to interconnect their
offices without the high cost charged by telephone carriers for their landline connections.
■WLAN applications are found in a wide variety of industries and organizations, includ-
ing the military, education, business, entertainment, travel, construction, warehouse
management, and health care.
■Remote sensors capable of communicating using wireless technologies are used in large
manufacturing facilities to monitor equipment and for scientific research.
■Mobility—the ability to move around without being connected to the network by
a cable—is the primary advantage of a WLAN. Other advantages include easier and
less expensive installation, increased network reliability, and support for disaster
recovery.
■There are some disadvantages to a WLAN. Radio signal interference, security issues,
and health risks may slow down the growth of these technologies for a while, but
there are so many advantages that use of wireless data will very likely continue to
grow and to be an integral part of our lives.

Project 1-3
Following the news about the wireless industry is a very good way to learn
who uses a particular technology and for what purpose. Use local news
services or the Internet to find a school, hospital, manufacturing plant, ware-
house, or other business in your area that is switching to wireless technology. If possible, try to
interview some of the people involved to determine why they are making the change. Ask what
benefits and drawbacks they considered. Write a one-page paper describing what you find out.
Project 1-4
Because a wireless device transmits radio signals over a broad area, security
becomes a major concern. What are some of the security concerns with using
a WLAN? What security options are available? Write a one-page paper that
addresses these concerns. Use the Internet and information from hardware and security
vendors as additional resources.
Project 1-5
Using the Internet, find the latest information about health concerns using
wireless technologies. What studies are currently under way? What issues are
of concern? What are the official positions of the government departments on
these issues? Write a one-page paper about your findings.
Real-World Exercises
Tenbit Wireless Inc. (TWI) is a company consisting of 50 wireless networking specialists
who assist organizations and businesses with network planning, design, implementation, and
problem solving. You have recently been hired by TWI to work with one of its new clients,
Vincent Medical Center (VMC), a large health care facility, concerning their wireless needs.
Each day, doctors and nurses throughout VMC’s facility attend to patients, update medical
records, issue prescriptions, and order medical exams. VMC has deployed a sophisticated
suite of medical software that stores all patient records, exam results, and diagnoses. The sys-
tem is also fully integrated with VMC’s pharmacy and can process purchase orders, payments,
and receipts as well as inventory and shipments, and it meets the tightest patient information
protection regulations established by the federal government.
Exercise 1-1
VMC is interested in learning about the possibilities of upgrading its infrastructure and
deploying a wireless network to allow doctors, nurses, and all staff members to access infor-
mation from anywhere within the medical facility (two buildings). VMC does not want to
spend money installing additional network cabling connections to every patient room. VMC
has asked you to make a presentation to its administrator regarding the use of a WLAN. Cre-
ate a presentation to deliver to the staff about WLANs. Be sure to cover the following points:
●
Greater mobility for doctors and nurses
●
Ease and cost of installation
38

●
Easier network modifications
●
Increased network reliability
●
Radio signal interference
●
Security
Exercise 1-2
VMC would like to know about potential interference that medical equipment such as X-ray
machines and CT and MRI scanners might cause on the WLAN, or vice versa. Prepare a
report to present to the hospital administrators addressing their concerns.
Exercise 1-3
After your presentation, the physicians and nurses seem very interested in the potential of
the WLAN. However, VMC also has an outdated telephone system that provides mobile
cordless handsets but is no longer supported by the manufacturer. Without the ability to
use voice communications from anywhere in the facility, the staff cannot see how a wireless
network alone will solve their dilemma. Create a presentation that expands on your first one
and proposes a solution based on the existing WLAN.
Exercise 1-4
Although some doctors have notebook computers already equipped with wireless NICs,
VMC is also interested in providing other staff members with portable data communication
equipment, but at a lower cost than notebooks. The devices should be able to transmit
prescriptions directly to the central system. The pharmacy would then deliver medications
to patients right away. VMC would also like to be able to check on the status of these phar-
macy orders. VMC administrators have asked your opinion regarding using smartphones on
the WLAN or tablet computers, and they have told you that their software can handle these
requirements through a Web server. Prepare to present your recommendations to VMC’s
management team.
Challenge Case Project
A syndicated magazine is writing an article about Bluetooth technology and has
asked Tenbit Wireless Inc. for information. Form a team of three or four con-
sultants and research Bluetooth technology. Focus on the current specifications

Consider the wireless cellular telephone that may now be in your pocket or sitting
on your desk. If you were to take that telephone apart, you would find an array of pieces:
chips, a microphone, a speaker, resistors, capacitors, and other parts. Yet much more than that
mobile cordless telephone is needed to complete a call. Some of the other elements involved are
the cellular towers, the equipment that manages your call as you move from one cell to another,
and all the equipment at the telephone company’s central office that directs your call to the cor-
rect recipient. Moreover, if you’re calling someone overseas, additional equipment, such as satel-
lites or underwater cables, may be used to complete the international connection.
Trying to make sense of a modern communications system is truly mind-boggling because of
the sheer number of components that are involved. How can we begin to understand how it
all works?
One approach is the bottom-up method, which looks first at the individual elements or com-
ponents that make up a system, then ties them all together to show how the system works.
This chapter uses the bottom-up approach to set the foundation for our exploration of wire-
less communications and networks. You will apply the concepts covered in this chapter to
more specific technologies discussed in later chapters. If you are studying or working in the
IT field, you already know how data is represented inside a computer or digital device. In
this chapter, you will learn how the various types of wireless signals are used to transmit
data. Finally, we’ll delve a little deeper into how data is transmitted using radio waves.
To keep things simple, we will use the American Standard Code for Information Interchange
(or ASCII code), which uses only eight bits to represent all the letters of the alphabet, all the
numerals, and several symbols. In this book’s Appendix, you will find a complete ASCII
table showing the hexadecimal value for all the characters and symbols.
Recall that all numbers—such as street-address numbers or any other numbers that are not
intended to be used by the computer in calculations—are stored as text (i.e., as character
data, without numerical value). In this case, the number is stored in ASCII code. For example,
the decimal value 47 is normally stored as its binary equivalent (00101111) in the computer
memory. When using ASCII code, the decimal number 4 is stored as hexadecimal 34 (0x34),
which uses one byte (00110100 in binary); and the number 7 is stored in another byte in the
computer memory using the ASCII code 0x37 (00110111 in binary). See Table 2-1.
One of the limitations of ASCII is that there are not enough codes
for all the symbols used by foreign languages. Another coding
scheme, called Unicode, is therefore used today. Unicode can repre-
sent 65,535 different characters because it uses 16 bits, or two
bytes, instead of eight bits, or a single byte, to represent each
character. In addition, when one bit out of every byte is used for error control (parity), the
ASCII code can only represent 128 different characters.

Wireless Signals
Wired communications uses either copper wires or fiber-optic cables to send and receive data.
Wireless transmissions, of course, do not use these or any other visible media. Instead, data
signals travel on electromagnetic waves. All forms of electromagnetic energy—gamma rays,
radio waves, even light—travel through space in the form of waves. The light from a flashlight
or the heat from a fire also moves through space as waves. These waves, known as electro-
magnetic waves, don’t require any special medium (such as air) or any type of conductor
(such as a copper wire or optical fiber). Instead, they travel freely through space at the speed
of light: 186,000 miles per second (300,000 kilometers per second).
Practically everything in the universe emits or absorbs electromagnetic radiation. Figure 2-1
illustrates the electromagnetic spectrum, which lets you compare each of the properties of elec-
tromagnetic radiation—such as the lengh of an electromagnetic wave—with the sizes of some
common objects and items. The middle portion of the figure shows the commonly used names
for these waves, and the bottom portion shows the range of frequencies—that is, how many
waves occur in one second—along with where these waves usually originate. For example, in
the visible light emitted by a light bulb, the number of waves that occur in one second is
higher than 1013, and each wave is about the size of a bacteria—that is, 0.000001 meters
(3.281  10–6 feet). In this chapter, you will learn about each of these wave properties and
the significance it has in wireless data communications.
Many people, when asked what type of medium is used to send and
receive wireless transmissions, answer “airwaves.” If this were the
case, radio signals would not propagate in space, where there is no
air. Wireless transmissions use electromagnetic (EM) waves as the
medium, not air or empty space.

Infrared Light
There are two basic types of waves by which wireless data are sent and received: infrared
light and radio waves. For centuries, flashes of light have been used to transmit information.
Bonfires set on top of hills were once used to relay messages. Ocean vessels sent signals from
ship to ship or from ship to shore using light. In 1880, Alexander Graham Bell demonstrated
an invention called the photophone, which used light waves to transmit voice information.
Transmitting modern computer or network data using light follows the same basic principle.
Because computers and data communication equipment use binary code, it is easy to transmit
information with light. Just as binary code uses only two digits (0 and 1), light has only two
properties (off and on). Sending a 1 in binary code could result in a light quickly flashing on;
sending a 0 could result in the light remaining off. For example, the letter “A” (ASCII 0x41
or 01000001) could be transmitted by light as off-on-off-off-off-off-off-on. This concept is
illustrated in Figure 2-2.
What type of light should be used to transmit these signals? Transmitting data using visible
light flashes, such as a strobe light, would be very unreliable because other lights could be
mistaken for the transmission signal or another bright light could wash out the light flashes.
In addition, visible light (and even some frequencies that are invisible to the human eye) can
be blocked by various obstacles—fog, heavy rain, etc.—and is therefore not a reliable
medium for data transmissions.
However, visible light is only one type of light. All the different types of light that travel
from the Sun to the Earth make up the light spectrum, and visible light is just a small part
of that entire spectrum. Some of the other forms of energy within the light spectrum, such
as X-rays, ultraviolet rays, and microwaves, are also invisible to the human eye. Infrared
light, some of which is invisible, has many of the characteristics that visible light has
because it is adjacent to visible light on the light spectrum. Yet, it is a much better medium
for data transmission because it is less susceptible to interference from other sources of
visible light.

Each wavelength within the spectrum of visible light represents a
particular color. This is because the differing wavelengths of light
waves bend at a different angle when passed through a prism,
which in turn produces different colors. The colors that visible light
produces are red (R), orange (O), yellow (Y), green (G), blue (B),
indigo (I), and violet (V). Visible light is sometimes referred to as ROYGBIV.
Infrared wireless systems require that each device have two components: an emitter, which
transmits a signal, and a detector, which receives the signal. (These two components are
almost always combined into one device.) An emitter is usually a laser diode or a light-
emitting diode (LED). Infrared wireless systems send data by the intensity of the light wave
instead of whether the light signal is on or off. To transmit a 1, the emitter increases the
intensity of the electrical current and, consequently, the intensity of the infrared light, which
indicates a pulse to the receiver. The detector senses the higher-intensity pulse of light and
produces a proportional electrical current (see Figure 2-3).
Infrared wireless transmission can be either directed or diffused. A directed transmission
requires that the emitter and detector be directly aimed at one another (called the line-
of-sight principle), as shown in Figure 2-4. The emitter sends a narrowly focused beam of
infrared light. The detector has a small receiving or viewing area. A television remote control,
for example, uses directed transmission, and this is the reason that most of us point the
remote at the TV or other remote-controlled devices.
Although TV remote controls generally use directed transmission,
with a fresh set of batteries you should be able to point the remote
at a white wall directly across from the TV set and use it to change
channels, increase the volume, and so on—as long as nothing else is
blocking the path of the invisible infrared light.

A diffused transmission relies on reflected light. With diffused transmissions, the emitters
have a wide-focused beam instead of a narrow beam. For example, the emitter might be
pointed at the ceiling of a room and use it as a reflection point. When the emitter transmits
an infrared signal, the signal bounces off the ceiling and fills the room with the signal. The
detectors are pointed at the same reflection point and can detect the reflected signal, as
shown in Figure 2-5.
Infrared wireless systems have several advantages. Infrared light neither interferes with other
types of communications signals (such as radio signals) nor is it affected by other signals,
except light. In addition, because infrared light does not penetrate walls, the signals are kept
inside a room. This makes it impossible for someone elsewhere to listen in on the transmitted
signal.

However, there are several serious limitations to infrared wireless systems. The first limitation
involves the lack of mobility. Directed infrared wireless systems use a line-of-sight principle,
which makes it challenging for mobile users because the alignment between the emitter and the
detector would have to be continually adjusted. The second limitation is the range of coverage.
Directed infrared systems, which require line of sight, cannot be placed in an environment where
there is the possibility that anything could get in the way of the infrared beam (think of someone
standing in front of your remote control while you are trying to change TV channels). This means
that devices using infrared transmissions must be placed close enough to one another to eliminate
the possibility of something moving between them. Due to the angle of deflection, diffused infra-
red can cover a range of only 50 feet (15 meters). And because diffused infrared requires a reflec-
tion point, it can only be used indoors. These restrictions limit the range of coverage.
Another significant limitation of an infrared system is the speed of transmission. Diffused
infrared can send data at maximum speeds of only 4 Mbps. This is because the wide angle
of the beam loses energy as it reflects. The loss of energy results in a weakening signal. The
weak signal cannot be transmitted over long distances, nor does it have sufficient energy to
maintain a high transmission speed, resulting in a lower data rate.
Because of these limitations, infrared wireless systems are generally used in specialized appli-
cations, such as data transfers between notebook computers, digital cameras, handheld data
collection devices, PDAs, electronic books, and other similar mobile devices. In the past, lap-
top computers were almost always equipped with infrared interfaces; sadly, this is no longer
true. If you still need an infrared interface today, you must purchase one that plugs into a
USB port on the computer. Figure 2-6 shows an example of such a device.
Some specialized wireless local area networks are based on the infrared method of transmit-
ting data signals. These are used in situations where radio signals would interfere with other
equipment, such as in hospital operating rooms, or when security is a concern, such as in
some government and military installations.

Like other types of electromagnetic waves (such as visible light and heat), infrared light has
limitations. Light waves, for example, cannot penetrate through most materials like wood or
concrete, and heat rays are absorbed by most objects, including human skin (we feel infrared
waves as heat). Solid objects and even dust and humidity (water molecules in the atmosphere)
can limit the distance that light and infrared waves can travel. See Figure 2-7.
Is there a wave in the electromagnetic spectrum that does not have the distance limitations of
light or infrared? The answer is yes: radio waves.
Radio Waves
The second means of transmitting a wireless signal is by using radio transmission. Radio
waves provide the most common and effective means of wireless communications today. To
understand the basic properties of radio waves, imagine that you are watering your lawn
with a garden hose. As you move your hand up and down, the water creates what look like
waves that are also moving up and down, as shown in Figure 2-8.

The waves created by the garden hose have a shape that is similar to that of electromagnetic
waves. Recall that energy travels through space or air in electromagnetic waves. Infrared
light, visible light from a flashlight, and heat from a fire also move through empty space or
through the air in the atmosphere as electromagnetic waves.
Another type of electromagnetic wave that travels in this fashion is called a radio wave
(radiotelephony). When an electric current passes through a wire, it creates a magnetic field
in the space around the wire. As this magnetic field radiates, it creates radio waves. Because
radio waves, like light and heat waves, are electromagnetic waves, they move outward, usu-
ally in all directions.
Radio waves are free from some of the limitations that affect light and heat. Unlike heat
waves, radio waves can travel great distances. Radio waves can also penetrate most solid
objects (with the exception of metallic ones), whereas light waves cannot penetrate anything
opaque or solid. Visible light waves and heat waves can be seen and felt, but radio waves
are invisible. These characteristics are illustrated in Figure 2-9. Because of these characteris-
tics, radio waves are an excellent means to transmit data without wires.
How Radio Data Is Transmitted
Radio waves can be used to transmit data over long distances without the need for wires. The
method by which these waves transport data involves several concepts. We will start by dis-
cussing the ways that analog and digital data are transmitted over radio waves.
Analog and Digital
When you create waves using a garden hose, the waves are continuous as long as the water is
turned on and you keep moving your hand up and down. These waves represent an analog

signal. An analog signal is one in which the intensity of the waves (voltage or amplitude) var-
ies and is broadcast continuously—in other words, the signal has no breaks in it. Figure 2-10
illustrates an analog signal. Audio, video, voice, and even light are all examples of analog sig-
nals. An audio signal that contains a tone or a song is continuously flowing and doesn’t start
and stop until the tone or song is over.
Now, suppose that instead of moving the hose up and down, you were to hold it steady, place
your thumb over the end of the garden hose for a second and then remove it. Water would stop
flowing while your thumb was over the hose and then start flowing again when you removed
your thumb. This on-off activity, shown in Figure 2-11, is similar to a digital signal. A digital
signal consists of discrete or separate pulses, as opposed to an analog signal, which is continu-
ous. A digital signal has numerous starts and stops throughout the signal stream—Morse code,
for example, with its series of dots and dashes. Figure 2-12 illustrates a digital signal.
Computers operate using digital signals. If analog data, such as a video image or an audio
sound, needs to be stored on the computer, it must be converted into a digital format before
it can be stored and processed or interpreted by a computer.

Various techniques are used to convert the different types of analog
data
to
digital
data.
For
CD-quality
stereophonic
music
(2-
channels), the analog signal is measured (sampled) at the rate of
44,100 times per second; each sample is then stored in a digital for-
mat, using a minimum of 16 bits per sample. Using a number of
other techniques, computers also compress digitized signals to minimize the total amount of
storage space or the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.
To transmit a digital signal over an analog medium, as when two computers communicate
over an analog telephone line or TV cable, a device known as a modem (MOdulator/
DEModulator) is used. A modem takes the distinct digital signals from a computer and
encodes them into a continuous analog signal for transmission over analog phone lines. The
process of encoding the digital signals (bits) onto an analog wave is called modulation. The
modem at the other end of the connection then reverses the process by receiving an analog
signal, decoding it, and converting it back into a digital signal.
Frequency and Wavelength
Now, think about holding a garden hose and slowly moving your hand up and down. You
will create long waves, as shown in Figure 2-13. If you rapidly move your hand up and
down, the waves become shorter, as shown in Figure 2-14. Depending on how fast you
move your hand up and down, the peaks of the waves will be closer together or farther
apart. This illustrates another property of waves, called the wavelength. The wavelength is
the distance between any point in one wave cycle and the same point in the next wave cycle.

The same variations occur with radio waves. The rate at which a radio circuit creates the
waves (like moving the garden hose up and down faster or slower) will result in a different
number of radio waves being created each second and the peaks becoming either closer or
farther apart. This rate is a radio wave’s frequency. That is, the number of times a cycle
(which is composed of one top [positive] and one bottom [negative] peak) occurs within one
second equals the frequency of a wave.
The wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency, which
means that when the frequency is high, the wavelength is short or
small, and when the frequency is low, the wavelength is long.
Radio transmitters send what is known as a carrier signal. This is a continuous wave (CW)
of constant amplitude (measured in volts) and frequency. This is essentially an up-and-down
wave called an oscillating signal or a sine wave, as illustrated in Figure 2-15. A CW carries
no useful information by itself. Only after it is modulated does it contain some kind of infor-
mation signal, such as music, voice, or data; then, it is correctly called a carrier signal or car-
rier wave. A receiver is adjusted (or tuned) to the frequency of the carrier, and it ignores all
the other frequencies.
Notice in Figure 2-15 that the wave starts at zero, moves up to the maximum voltage (þ),
then down to the minimum voltage (), and finally returns to its starting point (0) before
beginning all over again. Whenever the wave completes its trip up, then down, and returns
back to the starting point, it has finished one cycle. Recall that frequency is defined as the
number of times a wave completes a cycle in one second.
Figure 2-16 illustrates two different frequencies. Notice that both the lower frequency and the
higher frequency alternate to the same maximum and minimum voltage. A change in voltage
does not create a change in frequency. Instead, changes in frequency result from how long it
takes to reach the maximum, fall back to the minimum, and then return to neutral to com-
plete a cycle.

In electrical terms, the cycle produces what is known as an alternat-
ing current (AC) because it flows between negative (2) and positive
(1). AC is the type of current that runs to the electrical outlets in a
house, and it usually has a frequency of 60 Hz. Direct current (DC) is
found in batteries. With DC, the current flows only from one termi-
nal (2) to the other (1) and does not alternate. This lack of fluctuating movement also means
that DC cannot be directly transmitted via an analog medium and cannot carry any data.
Although frequencies are measured by counting the number of complete wave cycles that
occur in one second, the term Hertz (Hz) is used instead of cycles-per-second. A radio wave
measured as 710,000 Hz means that its frequency is 710,000 cycles per second. Because of
the high number of cycles in radio waves, metric prefixes are used when referring to frequen-
cies. A Kilohertz (KHz) is 1,000 Hertz, a Megahertz (MHz) is 1,000,000 Hertz, and a
Gigahertz (GHz) is 1,000,000,000 Hertz. The wave measured as 710,000 Hz is referred to
as 710 KHz.
Frequency is an important part of music also. The frequency of the
musical note A is 440 Hz, and middle C is 262 Hz. This means that
when middle C is played, 262 pockets of higher air pressure pound
against your eardrum each second.

Radio waves are usually transmitted and received using an antenna. An antenna is a length
of copper wire, or similar material, with one end free and the other end connected to a
receiver or transmitter. When transmitting, the radio waves created by the electronic circuit
of the transmitter are fed to this antenna wire. This sets up an electrical pressure (voltage)
along the wire, which will cause a small electrical current to flow into the antenna. Because
the current is alternating, it flows back and forth in the antenna at the same frequency as
the radio waves. When the electricity moves back and forth in the antenna at the same fre-
quency as the radio waves, it creates both a magnetic field and an electrical field around the
antenna. This continuous (analog) combination of magnetism and electrical pressure moves
away (propagates) from the antenna the same way that water waves move away from the
point of impact when you throw a rock in a pond. The result is an electromagnetic wave
(EM wave), as illustrated in Figure 2-17.
Antennas are also used to pick up transmitted radio signals. A very small amount of electricity
moves back and forth in the receiving antenna in response to the radio signal (EM wave)
reaching it. This results in a very small amount of current flowing from the antenna into the
receiver, as shown in Figure 2-18. In Chapter 3, you will learn what needs to be done to this
small current so that the receiver can demodulate it and retrieve the data that was transmitted.

Transmission Speed
Several different terms are used when referring to the transmission speed of radio waves. The
electromagnetic waves themselves always travel at the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles
per second (300,000 kilometers per second). When digital information is transmitted using
radio waves, the speed of transmission is usually shown in bits per second (bps), since the
primary concern is how efficiently the data can be moved from one place to another.
Another term used in measuring the speed of radio transmission is baud rate. Recall that
radio transmissions send out a carrier signal and that this signal can be changed or modu-
lated. A baud is a change in that signal, and every time the signal changes, as you will learn
later in this chapter, it defines the boundary of a signal unit. Baud rate, then, refers to the
number of signal units (changes) per second that are required to represent the bits transmit-
ted. The fewer signal units required, the better the system works, since the range of frequen-
cies required for transmitting the signal is smaller.
Sometimes the terms bps and baud rate are used interchangeably, although they are not syn-
onymous. This confusion originated with early computer modems. The first modems, for
example, had speeds of 300, 600, and 1200 baud. These early modems used a simple modu-
lation technique and were capable of transmitting at a maximum of one signal unit per bit
transmitted; therefore, their speed in bps was the same as the baud rate, or 300, 600, and
1200 bps. For example, to transmit the letter U (0x55 ASCII or 01010101), it would take
eight signal changes, one for each bit. Thus, the number of bits transmitted per signal unit
(baud) was 1.
However, with later modems, it became possible to have a change in signal (a baud) repre-
sent more than one bit. A signal can be changed in several different ways, as explained later
in this textbook; different changes result in different combinations of two bits (there can be
up to four), each being assigned to one of four different signal changes. This is illustrated in
Table 2-2.
The letters in Table 2-2 are simply used to differentiate four different types of signal
changes. Today’s analog modems transmit at a maximum rate of 4,800 baud, which is
the maximum number of signal changes per second that a typical phone line can support.
However, by using more complex modulation techniques, along with compression of the
data, current modems can transmit data at speeds of up to 33,600 bps and receive data at
up to 56,200 bps.

56 Kbps modems are a little different from 33.6 Kbps modems in
that one end of the connection must be a digital connection. To
achieve 56 Kbps download speed from the ISP, the signal conversion
from analog to digital or from digital to analog must only happen at
one end of the phone line. Because of this limitation, these modems
achieve a high downstream speed (from the ISP side to the modem) of 56 Kbps. The maxi-
mum speed from the modem side to the ISP side, or upstream, is 33.6 Kbps.
A signal unit—that is, the change that is made to the signal that represents two bits—is
known as a dibit. When a signal unit can represent three bits, it is called a tribit. If 16 differ-
ent signal units are used, then four bits per signal unit can be represented (known as a quad-
bit). These characteristics are summarized in Table 2-3.
Another term used when referring to transmission speed is bandwidth. Although this term
is often used to refer to the maximum data transmission capacity, this is accurate only
when referring to purely digital systems. Strictly speaking, in analog systems, bandwidth
is defined as the range of frequencies that can be transmitted by a particular system or
medium. In simple terms, bandwidth is the difference between the higher frequency and
the lower frequency. Suppose a transmission for a human voice could be sent between
300 Hz and 3,400 Hz. The difference between the two frequencies (3,400 Hz minus
300 Hz) is 3,100 Hz, which happens to be the bandwidth of a human voice that is trans-
mitted during a telephone conversation.
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) modems usually transmit at speeds rang-
ing from a few hundred Kbps to about 25 Mbps on a telephone line,
at a distance of up to 2.5 miles (4 kilometers). The usable bandwidth
of the pair of copper wires in a modern phone line is about 1 Mega-
hertz. DSL takes advantage of the higher frequencies that can be
transmitted on a phone line but that are not used for voice (above 4,000 Hz); it divides these
into a large number of separate frequencies and transmits data bits at a few bps over several
of them at the same time, resulting in the high data rates described earlier. Full coverage of
DSL technology is beyond the scope of this book, but later chapters cover technologies that
work in a very similar fashion.

Analog Modulation
Recall that the carrier signal sent in analog radio transmissions is simply a continuous electri-
cal signal. It carries no information and is more correctly referred to as a CW. Only after
information is added to it by modulation should it be called a carrier. Analog modulation is
the representation of analog information by an analog signal. There are three types of modu-
lation that can be applied to an analog signal to enable it to carry information: the height of
the signal, the frequency of the signal, and the relative starting point, or phase, of the signal.
Let’s look at each type of modulation separately.
The height, frequency, and relative starting point of a signal (phase)
are sometimes called the “three degrees of freedom.”
Amplitude Modulation (AM) The height of a wave, known as the amplitude, can be
measured in volts (electrical pressure). This is illustrated in Figure 2-19 with a typical sine
wave. In amplitude modulation (AM), the height of the wave is changed in accordance with
the height of another analog signal, called the modulating signal. In the case of an AM radio
station, the modulating signal is the voice of the announcer or the music, which is also an ana-
log signal. The carrier wave’s frequency and phase remain constant.
Amplitude modulation is used by broadcast radio stations. Because pure AM is very suscep-
tible to interference from outside sources, such as lightning, it is not generally used for data
transmissions. Figure 2-20 shows a carrier wave and a sine wave being used to modulate
the carrier. The bottom portion of the figure shows the carrier wave after it has been
modulated.

Frequency Modulation (FM) In frequency modulation (FM), the number of waves
that occur during one second undergoes change based on the amplitude of the modulating
signal while the amplitude and the phase of the carrier remain constant. Figure 2-21 illus-
trates an FM signal and a simple modulating sine wave. The bottom portion of the figure
shows the result of modulating the FM carrier in frequency. Note how the frequency
changes proportionally, based on the change in amplitude of the input signal, which effec-
tively allows the receiver to reproduce the signal with the correct amplitude (or the volume
of the sound). In addition, the rate of change of the modulated signal also follows the rate
of change of the input signal, which, in turn, allows the receiver to reproduce the frequency
(pitch or tone) at the output.

Like amplitude modulation, frequency modulation is often used by broadcast radio stations.
However, FM is not as susceptible to interference from outside sources and is most com-
monly used to broadcast music programs. In addition, an FM carrier has a wider band-
width, which allows it to carry Hi-Fi as well as stereophonic signals, with two separate
sound channels.
In most countries, FM radio stations broadcast between 88 MHz and
108 MHz, whereas AM stations transmit between 535 KHz and
1,700 KHz.
Phase Modulation (PM) In contrast to AM, which changes the height of the wave,
and FM, which increases the number of waves per cycle, phase modulation (PM) changes
the starting point of the cycle, while the amplitude and frequency of the carrier remain con-
stant. Phase modulation is not generally used to represent analog signals.

A signal composed of sine waves has a phase associated with it. This phase is measured in
degrees, and one complete wave cycle covers 360 degrees. A phase change is always mea-
sured with reference to some other signal. Because it would be very difficult to ensure that
the wave cycles of a reference signal in two separate devices—the transmitter and the
receiver—remain perfectly synchronized (in phase), PM systems almost always use the previ-
ous wave cycle as the reference signal. Figure 2-22 shows an example of four different phase
shifts with respect to a reference signal shown at the top of the figure.
Although radio broadcasts use either amplitude modulation (AM) or
frequency modulation (FM), television broadcasts actually use AM,
FM, and phase modulation (PM). A television video signal uses ampli-
tude modulation, the sound uses frequency modulation, and the
color information uses phase modulation.
Digital Modulation
How can digital data be transmitted by an analog carrier signal when the medium used for
transmission cannot be used with digital signals? The simple answer is that it can be done
by modulating the analog signal or changing it to represent a 1 bit or a 0 bit.
Most modern wireless systems use digital modulation, which is the method of encoding a
digital signal onto an analog wave for transmission over a medium that does not support

digital signals, such as the atmosphere or the vacuum of space. In an analog system, the
carrier signal is continuous, and amplitude, frequency, and phase changes also occur continu-
ously because the input or modulating signal is still analog and therefore continuous.
However, in a digital system that uses binary signals, the changes are distinct, which results
in one of two states: a 1 or a 0, a constant positive or a constant negative voltage, on or
off. For a computer to be able to understand these signals, each bit must have a fixed dura-
tion to represent a 1 or a 0 (more on digital signals later). Otherwise, the computer would
not be able to determine when one bit ends and another one begins.
There are four primary advantages of digital modulation over analog modulation:
●
It makes better use of the bandwidth available.
●
It requires less power to transmit.
●
It performs better when the signal experiences interference from other signals.
●
Its error-correcting techniques are more compatible with other digital systems.
With digital modulation, as with analog modulation, there are three basic changes that can be
made to the signal to enable it to carry information: the height, the frequency, and the relative
starting point (phase) of the signal. However, with the need for faster transmission speeds,
more binary signals (or bits) have to be crammed into the same number of wave cycles. The
result is that in wireless communications there are now dozens of different types of modula-
tion. For the most sophisticated modulations, it is practically impossible to show a graphic
example of what the signals look like. This chapter covers a few basic methods of digital mod-
ulation; these methods serve as the basis for more sophisticated modulation techniques.
Binary Signals Recall that with an analog signal the carrier wave alternates between the
positive and negative voltage in a continuous cycle—that is, it doesn’t stop. A binary signal
can alternate between positive and zero volts or between a positive and a negative voltage.
Data transmissions are typically sent in bursts of bits, meaning that some bits are transmit-
ted, then the transmission momentarily stops. When there are no bits to be transmitted, no
signal is transmitted. In analog systems, even when a radio station is not transmitting any
sound, the carrier wave continues to be transmitted; in this case, your radio receiver simply
does not detect any modulation of the carrier and therefore does not extract the original sig-
nal. Consequently, the receiver does not reproduce any sound even though the continuous
carrier signal is still being transmitted.
Three types of binary signaling methods can be used. The return-to-zero (RZ) technique
calls for the signal to rise (the voltage to increase) to represent a 1 bit. A 0 bit is represented
by the absence of voltage, or 0 volts. This is illustrated in Figure 2-23. Notice that the volt-
age is reduced to 0 before the end of the period for transmitting a 1 bit. Also notice that the
signal does not quite fill the bit period; this transition of the signal in the middle of a bit
period is used to synchronize the transmitter and receiver.

The second method is known as the non-return-to-zero (NRZ) technique. With non-
return-to-zero, the voltage signal remains positive (high) for the entire length of the bit
period. In addition, if the next bit to be transmitted is the same as the previous bit, the sig-
nal does not change, remaining high for a 1 and low (0 volts or no voltage) for a 0. This
effectively reduces the number of signal transitions (baud) required to transmit the message.
As with RZ, there is no voltage when transmitting a 0 bit (see Figure 2-24).
The final method, polar non-return-to-zero (polar NRZ), raises the signal (increases the
voltage) to represent a 1 bit and drops the signal (reduces the voltage to a negative
amount) to represent a 0 bit. This technique is more commonly referred to as non-
return-to-zero-level (NRZ-L) because the signal never returns to the 0 volts level. NRZ-L
is illustrated in Figure 2-25.

The difference between NRZ and polar NRZ is that polar uses two
voltage levels (positive and negative).
A variation of NRZ-L is non-return-to-zero, invert-on-ones (NRZ-I). This is also used to
reduce the baud rate required to transmit a digital signal. In NRZ-I, a change in voltage
level represents a 1 bit, whereas no change in voltage level indicates that the next bit is a 0.
NRZ-I is illustrated in Figure 2-26.

Why are there so many binary signaling methods? Here are two important reasons:
●
Digital electronic circuits tend to average the level of a signal that exhibits a lot of
transitions. The result is that the more transitions the signal has, the greater the chance
that the circuits will lower the maximum amplitude of the signal, thus making it
harder for the receiver to detect the transitions. Using bipolar signals helps but does
not eliminate the problem completely.
●
Transmitters and receivers have a tendency of getting out of synchronization with each
other. If the transmitter sends a long string of 1s or a long string of 0s, the lack of
transitions makes it difficult to keep both devices in sync.
Therefore, while trying to minimize the number of transitions, we must also be concerned
with having enough of them to ensure good synchronization between the transmitter and
the receiver. The methods described above are the most basic ones that are employed when
transmitting at lower speeds. Many more sophisticated and complex methods of transmit-
ting digital signals over wires and cables exist, but they are beyond the scope of this book.
You will certainly learn about them in later, more advanced courses and books.
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) Amplitude shift keying (ASK) is a binary modulation
technique similar to amplitude modulation in that the height of the carrier signal can be
changed to represent a 1 bit or a 0 bit. However, instead of both a 1 bit and a 0 bit having
a carrier signal, as with amplitude modulation, ASK usually employs NRZ coding. This
means that the presence of a carrier signal represents a 1 bit (positive voltage), whereras the
absence of a carrier signal represents a 0 bit (zero voltage). Figure 2-27 illustrates the letter
A (ASCII 0x41 or 01000001) being transmitted using ASK.
The signals for transmission using digital binary modulation are still
shown here as sine waves because wireless transmissions use a
medium (electromagnetic waves) that can only support analog
signals. Note that the direct transmission of purely digital signals
(discrete pulses) can only be done using a medium that conducts
electricity, such as copper wiring.

Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) Similar to frequency modulation, frequency shift key-
ing (FSK) is a binary modulation technique that changes the frequency of the carrier signal.
Because it is sending a binary signal, the carrier signal does start and stop as the data trans-
mission stops. As an example, when using FSK, more wave cycles are needed to represent a
1 bit and, respectively, fewer wave cycles are needed to represent a 0 bit. Figure 2-28 illus-
trates the letter A (ASCII 0x41 or 01000001) being transmitted using FSK. In this example,
the number of wave cycles used to represent a 1 bit is double that of the number of wave
cycles used to represent a 0 bit.
Phase Shift Keying (PSK) Phase shift keying (PSK) is a binary modulation technique,
similar to phase modulation, in which the transmitter varies the starting point of the wave.
The difference is that the PSK signal starts and stops because it is a binary signal. Figure 2-29
illustrates the letter A (ASCII 0x41 or 01000001) being transmitted using PSK.

Notice that whenever a bit being transmitted changes from 1 to 0 (or 0 to 1), the starting
point (i.e., the direction of the wave) changes. For example, after the first 0 bit is represented
by a “normal” carrier wave cycle, the next bit is a 1 bit. However, instead of this being indi-
cated by another normal carrier wave cycle in which the signal goes into the positive range
(goes up on the sine wave), it starts by going into the negative range. The change in starting
point (going down instead of up) represents a change in the bit being transmitted (0 to 1).
In the preceding example, the change in the starting point of the wave means that the wave
will start moving in the opposite direction—in this case, 180 degrees from the original direc-
tion. Note that phase modulation can change the starting point at various points (angles), as
shown in Figure 2-30.
In this case, there are eight possible starting points for a signal (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90
degrees, 135 degrees, 180 degrees, 225 degrees, 270 degrees, and 335 degrees), with each
dot in the figure representing a different starting point. You will recall that to transmit a
tribit (3 bits per signal change or baud), eight different signals are needed. Using phase mod-
ulation with 45-degree angles can result in eight different signals. However, in wireless com-
munications today, phase modulation is combined with amplitude modulation, which is
easier for receivers to detect than very small phase changes and can provide 16 or more
different signals.
In Figure 2-31, each dot represents a different signal, for a total of 16 different combinations
that can be used to transmit quadbits. This technique of combining amplitude and phase
modulation is called quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Due to the potential com-
plexity of the resulting signal, most graphic representations of QAM only show the starting
point of each wave with a dot. This representation is called a constellation diagram.

In the presence of background electromagnetic noise (interference), receivers can detect a
phase change much more reliably than a frequency or amplitude change. Noise may be
detected as a spike or sudden change in the amplitude of the signal and can also be detected
as a change to a higher frequency at a particular point, although the latter happens less fre-
quently. Because the phase of a signal is always referenced to the phase of the last wave
cycle that was correctly detected, it is much less likely that noise will occur at the same
time in a wave and at an amplitude level that would make the receiver detect it as a phase
change; that’s because noise is random. These benefits make PSK-based systems more attrac-
tive for high-speed wireless communications.
A variation of the PSK modulation technique previously described combines amplitude
modulation with PSK. This variation, called binary phase shift keying (BPSK), can be used
to transmit dibits (four signal changes equals 2 bits per signal change). Figure 2-32 shows
an approximate representation of the resulting waveform of this modulation technique for
sending a series of 10 bits. It would be practically impossible to visualize this signal with
any kind of electronic instrument, such as an oscilloscope, but simple modulations like
this one allow us to demonstrate graphically (as in Figure 2-32) what it would look like.

Spread Spectrum
Radio signal transmissions are, by nature, narrow-band transmissions. This means that
each signal transmits on one radio frequency or a very narrow range of frequencies. An
FM broadcast radio station, for example, might tell its listeners to “tune to 90.3 MHz”
because this is the frequency on which it broadcasts. The next-lower frequency that listen-
ers would be able to tune to would be 90.1 MHz; and 90.5 MHz would be the station
with the next-higher frequency. This ensures that the station at 90.3 MHz can broadcast
roughly between 90.2 and 90.4 MHz without interfering with other stations. The actual
bandwidth used by FM stations is less than the difference between 90.2 and 90.4 MHz,
allowing for some unused “frequency space” between the highest frequency used by the
next-lower station on the FM band, the station you are tuned to, and the next station
operating at a higher frequency.
Narrow-band transmissions are vulnerable to outside interference from another signal.
Another signal that is transmitted at or near the broadcast frequency—90.3, in this case—can
easily render the radio signal inoperable or make it difficult to detect and decode the informa-
tion contained in the signal.
Broadcast radio stations work effectively with narrow-band transmis-
sions because each station is allowed to transmit on only one
frequency in a specific area. Radio stations broadcast using high-
powered transmitters and use different frequencies, which are
licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the
United States. In contrast, most WLAN devices use the same frequency band but transmit at
very low power levels. This means that the signals have a short useful range, helping to
ensure that minimum interference occurs.
An alternative to narrow-band transmission is spread spectrum transmission. Spread spec-
trum is a technique that takes a narrow band signal and spreads it over a broader portion
of the radio frequency band, as shown in Figure 2-33. Spread spectrum transmissions are
more resistant to outside interference because any noise is likely to affect only a small por-
tion of the signal instead of the entire signal. As an analogy, although an accident in one
lane of an eight-lane freeway is inconvenient, there are still seven other lanes that traffic
can use. Likewise, spread spectrum results in less interference and fewer errors. Two com-
mon methods used in spread spectrum transmissions are frequency hopping and direct
sequence.

Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
Instead of transmitting on just one frequency, frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
uses a range of frequencies and changes the frequency of the carrier several times during the
transmission. With FHSS, a short burst of data is transmitted in one frequency, and then
another short burst is transmitted at another frequency, and so on until the transmission is
completed.
Hedy Lamarr, a well-known film actress during the 1940s, and
George Antheil, who had experience synchronizing the sounds of
music scores with motion pictures, conceived the idea of frequency
hopping spread spectrum during the early part of World War II.
Their goal was to keep the Germans from jamming the equipment
that guided U.S. torpedoes against German warships. Lamarr and Antheil received a U.S. pat-
ent in 1942 for their idea.
Figure 2-34 shows how an FHSS transmission starts by sending a burst of data at the 2.44
GHz frequency for 1 microsecond. Then the transmission switches to the 2.41 GHz fre-
quency and transmits for the next microsecond. During the third microsecond, the trans-
mission takes place at the 2.42 GHz frequency. This continual switching of frequencies
takes place until the entire transmission is complete. The sequence of changing frequencies
is called the hopping code. In the example shown in Figure 2-34, the hopping code is
2.44–2.41–2.42–2.40–2.43. The receiving station must also know the hopping code in
order to correctly receive the transmission. The hopping codes are predefined and are usu-
ally part of the standard that defines how the radio circuit will be designed and implemen-
ted. Hopping codes can change so that multiple radios can each use a different sequence of
frequencies within the same area and never interfere with one another, but the transmitter
and receiver have to agree beforehand on which sequence to use.

If interference is encountered while transmitting with FHSS on a particular frequency, only a
small part of the message is lost. Figure 2-35 shows an example in which the second trans-
mission has been affected by interference. Each block of data transmitted in FHSS is only
about 400 bytes long, and FHSS systems can detect errors at the lower protocol layers and
request retransmission before passing the data to higher protocol layers. Some technologies
make use of forward error correction (FEC), a technique that sends redundant data to mini-
mize the need for retransmission of the messages. Error handling and error detection and cor-
rection at the lower protocol layers are discussed in later chapters.

Frequency hopping can reduce the impact of interference from other radio signals. An interfer-
ing signal will affect the FHSS signal only when both are transmitting at the same frequency
and at the same time. Because FHSS transmits short bursts over a wide range of frequencies,
the extent of any interference will be very small, the error can be detected through error
checking, and the message can be easily retransmitted. In addition, FHSS signals exert mini-
mal interference on other signals. To an unintended receiver, FHSS transmissions appear to
be of a very short duration (similar to noise), and unless the receiver knows the exact hopping
sequence of frequencies, it is extremely difficult to eavesdrop on the message.
A variety of devices use FHSS. Several of these devices are consumer-oriented products,
because FHSS devices are relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Cordless phones, including
multi-handset units for small businesses, typically use FHSS. Bluetooth, which is covered in
Chapter 5, also uses FHSS.
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
The other type of spread spectrum technology is direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS).
DSSS uses an expanded redundant code to transmit each data bit and then a modulation
technique such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). This means that a DSSS signal is
effectively modulated twice. The first step before transmission is shown in Figure 2-36. At
the top of the figure are two original data bits to be transmitted: a 0 and a 1.

However, instead of simply encoding these two bits over a carrier wave for transmission, the
value of each data bit is first added to each individual 1 and 0 in a sequence of binary digits
called a Barker code. A Barker code (or chipping code) is a particular sequence of 1s and 0s
that has properties that make it ideal for modulating radio waves as well as for being
detected correctly by the receiver. These 1s and 0s are called chips- instead of bits to avoid
confusing them with the actual data bits. The chipping code is sometimes called a pseudo-
random code because it is usually derived through a number of mathematical calculations as
well as through practical experimentation.
The term Barker code is correctly used only when referring to 802.11
transmissions at 1 and 2 Mbps. When referring to most other spread-
ing codes used in DSSS-based systems—such as CDMA cellular
phones—the terms pseudo-random code, PN code, spreading code,
and chipping code may be used interchangeably.
The result of the addition is the actual set of 1s and 0s (the chips) that will be modulated
over a carrier wave and transmitted (as seen in the bottom line of Figure 2-36). Let’s take
another look at how this sequence of chips is created. If a 1 bit is to be transmitted, then a
1 is added to each bit of the chipping code:

The adding of the chipping code and the specific value to be added
are arrived at by the Boolean operation of “exclusive or” (XOR) on a
bit-by-bit basis, which is equivalent to a modulo 2 addition. In mod-
ulo 2 addition, there is no carryover, which means that 1 1 1 5 0
and a 1 is not carried over to the next digit to the left. Other than
that, a modulo 2 addition works exactly like a normal sum of two digits. See “Boolean Opera-
tions, XOR (Exclusive Or)” at www.cplusplus.com/doc/papers/boolean.html.

Instead of transmitting a single 1 or 0, a DSSS system transmits these combinations of chips.
The 11 chips are transmitted at a rate 11 times faster than the data rate; in other words, the
data rate does not change. However, the result of transmitting at a higher rate is the spread-
ing of the signal over a much wider frequency band than that of the channel. In the case of
802.11, to continue with the example given earlier, the signal is spread 11 MHz to each side
of the center frequency and ends up occupying a total bandwidth of 22 MHz. Figure 2-37
illustrates the results.
This spread signal has three important characteristics:
●
The frequency of the signal’s digital component (or chipping rate) is much higher than
that of the original data.
●
A plot of the signal’s frequency spectrum looks similar to random noise.
●
All the information contained in the original signal (a 0 bit or a 1 bit) is still there.

The most important aspect of this, however, is not the spreading of the signal but the fact
that the power level (amplitude), at any given frequency, has dropped significantly. In similar
fashion to FHSS, a DSSS signal appears to an unintended narrow-band receiver to be
low-powered noise, which is one major advantage of this method.
At the receiver, the signal is first demodulated and then de-spread. One of the techniques
the receiver uses to detect which bit was transmitted is to count the number of 0 chips. If the
pattern of chips received contains six 0s, the value of the data bit is 1. Conversely, if the pattern
contains six 1s, the value of the data bit is 0.
Another major advantage of using DSSS with a chipping code is that in conventional narrow-
band transmissions, any interference, even if it caused the loss of only one bit, would require
the entire message to be re-sent, which takes time. In DSSS, if there is any noise or other type
of narrow-band interference that may cause some of the chips to change value, the receiver
can employ embedded statistical techniques—mathematical algorithms that are used to
recover the original data bit, thus avoiding the need for retransmission.
Devices that use DSSS are typically higher-end products because they are more expensive to
manufacture than FHSS systems, but they also have many advantages over FHSS, as previ-
ously described. WLANs use DSSS along with products that interconnect networks located
in several buildings that comprise a campus setting, such as a school, a large corporation,
a manufacturing plant, or a convention center.
FHSS and DSSS are not the only transmission techniques used for spread spectrum transmis-
sion. There are other techniques that are even more resistant to interference and to different
kinds of phenomena that can cause data loss or reduce the performance of this type of wire-
less transmission. Some of the techniques are based on variations of DSSS; others are
completely different. Later chapters of this book discuss some of the more sophisticated tech-
niques as well as the types of problems that can affect wireless transmissions.
Chapter Summary
■One of the arbitrary coding schemes, which uses the numbers from 0 to 127, is called
the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). A character that
will be stored or transmitted by the computer is first converted to its ASCII equivalent,
then that number is stored as a byte in binary.
■Whereas traditional wired communications use copper wires or fiber-optic cables to
send and receive data, wireless transmissions do not use a visible medium. Instead,
they travel on electromagnetic waves. There are two basic types of waves by which
wireless signals are sent and received: infrared light and radio waves.
■Infrared light, which is next to visible light on the light spectrum, has many of the same
characteristics as visible light. Infrared wireless transmission can be either directed or
diffused. A directed transmission sends a narrowly focused beam of infrared light from
the emitter to the detector. A diffused transmission relies on reflected light.
■The second means of transmitting a wireless signal is by using radio transmission.
Radio waves provide the most common and effective means of wireless communica-
tions today. Radio waves have fewer limitations than light waves.

■Radio transmissions use a carrier signal, which is a continuous wave (CW) of constant
amplitude (voltage) and frequency. This signal is essentially an up-and-down wave
called an oscillating signal or sine wave. The carrier signal sent by analog radio trans-
missions is simply a continuous electrical signal that carries no information.
■The carrier signal can undergo three types of modulation (i.e., change) to enable it to
carry information: the height of the signal, the frequency of the signal, and the relative
starting point. Amplitude modulation (AM) changes the signal height. Frequency
modulation (FM) changes the number of wave cycles that occur in one second.
Phase modulation (PM) changes the starting point of the cycle.
■In digital modulation, there are also three types of changes that can be made to the
carrier to enable it to carry information: the height of the signal, the frequency of the
signal, and the relative starting point. Amplitude shift keying (ASK) changes the height
of the carrier to represent a 1 bit or a 0 bit. A carrier is transmitted for a 1 bit, and no
signal is transmitted for a 0 bit. Frequency shift keying (FSK) is a modulation tech-
nique that changes the frequency of the carrier signal. Phase shift keying (PSK) is a
modulation technique similar to phase modulation. The difference is that the PSK
signal starts and stops because it is a binary signal.
■Radio signals are by nature a narrow-band type of transmission, which means that
they transmit on one radio frequency or a very narrow spectrum of frequencies. An
alternative to narrow-band transmissions is spread spectrum transmission. Spread
spectrum is a technique that takes a narrow signal and spreads it over a broader
portion of the radio frequency band.
■Spreading the signal over a wide range of frequencies and reducing the amplitude has
the advantage of making the signal look like noise to an unintended narrow-band
receiver, reducing the effects of interference.
■One of the most common spread spectrum methods is frequency hopping spread spec-
trum (FHSS). Instead of sending on just one frequency, frequency hopping uses a range
of frequencies and changes frequencies during the transmission. The other method is
direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). DSSS uses an expanded redundant code to
transmit each data bit.

Hands-On Projects
Project 2-1
In this project, you will write your name in both hexadecimal and binary.
1.
Using the ASCII chart found in the Appendix of this book, look up the hexadecimal
ASCII value for each of the letters of your last name. (Note that the ASCII table con-
tains codes for both uppercase and lowercase letters.) Here is what my last name looks
like in hexadecimal, with a dash placed between successive letters, to make it easier
to read:
O–l–e–n–e–w–a ¼ 4F–6C–65–6E–65–77–61
2.
Convert each hexadecimal value to binary. The easiest way to do this is to break the
hexadecimal code for each character into two separate digits. In the case of an upper-
case O, this would be 4 and F. Each digit represents four bits out of one byte (also
called a nibble).
3.
Convert each digit to its binary equivalent in the range 0000 (0x0) to 1111 (0xF). Put
the two groups of four bits together into a byte. For the purposes of this project, the
most significant bit, which is generally used for parity, will always be a 0.
4.
Write your full last name in binary. Again, use a dash between each group of eight bits
to make it easier to read. Here is what my last name looks like:
01001111–01101100–01100101–01101110–01100101–01110111–01100001
You will use these results in the following projects.
Project 2-2
This project helps you develop an appreciation for the topic of modulation
and what it takes to transmit data—analog or digital—over the wireless
medium. As you know, this book introduces many different wireless technolo-
gies that use various modulation techniques. In this project, you perform
amplitude modulation.
1.
In Figure 2-38, an analog input signal is shown at the top of the grid. To draw a wave
that is modulated in amplitude, begin by copying the input signal to the top two rows of
the grid shown in Figure 2-38. The goal is to create an “envelope” to guide you and
make it easier to draw the carrier wave, showing what it will look like after it is modu-
lated. Use a dashed line to draw the input signal.
2.
Complete the envelope by drawing a mirror-image (vertically inverted) version of the
input signal in the bottom two rows of the grid. Again, use a dashed line.

3.
You are now ready to draw the modulated carrier. Considering a carrier with a fre-
quency of 4 Hz, so that it will be easier to draw and visualize, draw a sine wave with
four complete cycles for each second. The wave must fit inside and follow the contour
of the envelope you created in the previous two steps. The frequency of the modulated
carrier must remain constant at 4 Hz for each one-second interval on the grid. The
high and low peaks of the modulated carrier must reach all the way to the upper and
lower guides you just drew, the envelope.
4.
Check your results with your instructor, or see Figure 2-20 to make sure you got it right.
Project 2-3
As you have learned, digital modulation makes it possible to transmit a digital
signal using an analog medium such as an electromagnetic wave. In this proj-
ect, you draw a waveform to show how a digital signal can be encoded onto a
carrier using one bit per phase change (PSK).
1.
In Figure 2-39, a grid and an analog reference wave are shown without an input signal.
Input the binary ASCII code for the first letter of your last name in the spaces provided
at the top of the grid.
2.
The modulated carrier wave should have the same amplitude as the original carrier.
Begin at the 0 level indicated on the left side of the grid and draw a 4 Hz carrier to rep-
resent the first bit, a 0.
3.
At the end of the first second, continue drawing the carrier but change the phase if the
second most significant bit is a 1. If not, continue drawing the carrier at the same phase.

Keep drawing the 4 Hz carrier wave, changing phase as required to show a change from
a bit with a value of 1 or 0.
5.
After you have drawn the carrier wave for all eight bits of the ASCII code, compare
your results with Figure 2-39 to make sure it looks correct.
Real-World Exercises
The Baypoint Group (TBG), a company of 50 consultants who assist organizations and busi-
nesses with issues involving network planning and design, has hired you as a consultant. One
of their oldest clients, Woodruff Medical Group, needs your help with the following tasks.
Exercise 2-1
Woodruff Medical has been approached by a vendor who is trying to sell it an infrared
WLAN for its office. Because the equipment is proprietary, the cost is quite high, and this
is one of their main concerns. Although none of the networking equipment will be placed
around sensitive medical equipment, the office manager prefers infrared because he believes
that other types of wireless networking equipment could interfere with the medical equip-
ment in another hospital campus building that is located about 125 meters away.
Exercise 2-2
Prepare a PowerPoint presentation outlining how infrared and radio wireless transmissions
work. This will be presented to the office manager, who is not technically inclined, and the
LAN manager, who has a strong technology background. Be sure to list the advantages and
disadvantages of both. The presentation should contain at least 10 slides. You will only
have 20 minutes to explain both technologies.

Exercise 2-3
After listening to your presentation, the office manager has several questions. One of the
questions involves wireless transmission speeds. The office manager has a “good 56 Kbps
baud” dial-up data modem at home and wants to know how its transmission speed com-
pares with that of an infrared and RF WLAN. He also does not understand the difference
between baud and bps, two terms that he has been hearing a lot about lately, but none of
the explanations has satisfied him yet. For this, the office manager wants a written report
instead of a presentation. Write a one-page summary regarding different transmission
speeds. Be sure to include information about the difference between bps, baud, baud rate,
and bandwidth. Also, show how bps is not always identical to baud.
Challenge Case Project
A local community college has contacted The Baypoint Group for information
about modulation for a networking class, and TBG has passed this request on
to you. Form a team of two or three consultants and research AM, FM, PM,
ASK, FSK, and PSK. Specifically, pay attention to how they are used, as well
as their strengths and weaknesses. Provide your conclusions regarding which of
these methods, or combination of methods, is now the dominant player in wireless data trans-
mission and why you think this is the case.

Radio frequency (RF) communications is the most common type of wireless
communications. It comprises all the types of radio communications that use radio frequency
waves, from radio broadcasting to wireless computer networks. In this book, we focus
primarily on wireless data communications. Due to the convergence of technologies—for
example, data transmission over cellular phones and satellites—we also cover these types of
RF communications.
Unlike light-based communications, which is also wireless and is briefly discussed in this
chapter, RF communications can cover long distances and is not always blocked by objects
in the path of the signal, as light-based communications can be. RF is also a mature commu-
nications technology, the first radio transmission having been sent over 100 years ago.
RF communications can be very complex, but this chapter attempts to demystify the subject.
First, we explore the basic components of RF communications. Then, we look at the issues
regarding the design and performance of an RF system. Next, we explore the national and
international organizations that create and enforce RF standards. Finally, we examine the
RF spectrum allocation.
Components of a Radio System
Several hardware components are common to all radio systems, even though the functions of
the radio systems may vary. These components include filters, mixers, amplifiers, and anten-
nas. The first three are covered in this chapter. The fourth component, antennas, is important
enough to warrant a chapter of its own (Chapter 4), especially given the accelerated growth of
the wireless data communications field.
Filters
A filter does exactly what its name indicates: It gets rid of all the RF signals that are not
wanted. The world around us is filled with RF signals that cover virtually every frequency in
the electromagnetic spectrum (refer back to Figure 2-1). Most of these signals are generated by
transmission equipment, such as cellular phones, communications satellites, and radio and tele-
vision station transmitters; some reach us from outer space. After radio receivers have picked
up these RF waves that are “flying” around us, a filter sifts out the frequencies that we do not
want to receive. Think of a home-based water filter that removes particles and other impurities,
or an automotive oil filter that prevents large contaminants from reaching the engine while
allowing the oil itself to pass through. An RF filter either passes or rejects a signal based on
the signal’s frequency. The block diagram symbol for a filter is shown in Figure 3-1.
The block diagram symbols are universal and are commonly used to
illustrate radio frequency as well as microwave components.

There are three types of RF filters: low-pass, bandpass, and high-pass. With a low-pass filter,
a maximum frequency threshold is set and all signals below that value are allowed to pass
through, as shown in Figure 3-2.
A high-pass filter, instead of setting a maximum frequency threshold level, as a low-pass
filter does, sets a minimum frequency threshold. All signals above the minimum threshold
are allowed to pass through, whereas those below the minimum threshold are blocked.
In addition, the process of modulating a signal with data to be transmitted creates “stray”
signals called harmonics, which fall outside the range of frequencies we wish to transmit;
these must also be filtered out. A high-pass filter is shown in Figure 3-3.
A bandpass filter, instead of setting either a minimum or maximum frequency threshold, sets
a range called a passband, which includes both a minimum and a maximum threshold.
Signals that fall within the passband are allowed through the bandpass filter. This is shown
in Figure 3-4.
Some of the figures depicting filters show multiple inputs. This is for
the purpose of clarity only. A filter usually has a single input.
Filters are also found in transmitters, where they are used to eliminate unwanted frequencies
called harmonic oscillations, which result from the process of modulating the signal before
transmission. The way a filter functions in a transmitter is shown in Figure 3-5, which is a
partial block diagram. The input is the information that needs to be sent; it can take the
form of audio, video, or data. The transmitter takes the input data and modulates the signal

(through analog or digital modulation) by changing the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the
sine wave (see Chapter 2 to refresh your memory of RF signal modulation). The output from
the modulation process is known as the intermediate frequency (IF) signal; it includes the
frequencies between 8 MHz and 112 MHz. The IF signal is then filtered through a bandpass
filter to remove any undesired high-frequency or low-frequency signals and produce an
output with a frequency range of between 10 MHz and 100 MHz.
Mixers
The purpose of a mixer is to combine two inputs to create a single output. The mixer symbol
is shown in Figure 3-6. The single output of a mixer is in the range of the highest sum and
the lowest difference of the two frequencies. In Figure 3-7, the input signal—the information
to be transmitted—is between 300 Hz and 3400 Hz, and the carrier frequency is 20,000 Hz.
The mixer adds the input frequencies to the mixed-in frequency to produce the sums:
20,000 Hz

þ 300 Hz
þ3,400 Hz
_________
_________
20,300 Hz

In this example, 23,400 Hz is the highest sum. The mixer also determines the lowest differ-
ence between the input frequencies and the mixed-in frequency, for example:

In this example, the lowest difference frequency would be 16,600 Hz. Therefore, the output
from the mixer would be a frequency from 16,600 Hz to 23,400 Hz. The sum and the differ-
ence are known as the sidebands of the frequency carrier because they fall above and below
the center frequency of the carrier signal.
One way to think about sidebands is by considering AM radio signals. AM broadcast radio
is confined to a frequency range of 535 KHz to 1605 KHz. In an AM broadcast radio signal,
the sidebands are typically 7.5 KHz wide, so a radio station on the AM dial uses a total of
about 15 KHz of bandwidth to transmit a single audio channel or voice. An example of side-
bands is shown in Figure 3-8.
Mixers are used to convert an input frequency to a specific desired output frequency. For
example, let’s say that you wish to transmit data using an 800 MHz carrier. Figure 3-9 illus-
trates how a mixer functions in a radio transmitter. The transmitter takes the input data and
modulates the signal to produce an IF signal. In this example, the output from the modulator
is a range of frequencies from 8 MHz to 112 MHz, which also includes some undesirable
harmonic frequencies. This signal is then put through a bandpass filter to produce the desired
IF signal range of 10 MHz to 100 MHz. This IF signal then becomes the input to the mixer
along with the desired carrier frequency of 800 MHz. The output of the mixer is a signal
with a frequency range between 698 MHz and 903 MHz, which is finally run through
another bandpass filter to remove any frequencies outside the transmission range—in other
words, those that fall outside the intended sideband limits.

Amplifiers
An amplifier increases the amplitude of an RF signal. Figure 3-10 shows the symbol for an
amplifier. In Figure 3-9, the amplifier is the last stage in a radio circuit and its function is to
boost the power of the signal received from the last filter stage before it is transmitted.
Amplifiers are critical components in a radio system because RF signals tend to lose intensity
(amplitude) when they move through circuits or through air or space. Filters and mixers are
passive devices, meaning that they do not add power to a signal; instead, they take power
away from the signal. Likewise, when an electromagnetic wave carrying a modulated signal
leaves the antenna and travels from the transmitter to the receiver antenna, a large portion
of its power is lost or attenuated (reduced in amplitude) when it is absorbed by water parti-
cles in the air, walls, trees, and so on.
The amplifier is an active device. To work, though, it must be supplied with electricity.
Amplifiers use this electricity to increase the input signal’s intensity or strength and then out-
put an exact copy of the input signal with a higher amplitude.
Antennas
For an RF signal to be transmitted or received, the transmitter or receiver must be connected
to an antenna, the symbol for which is shown in Figure 3-11. Table 3-1 shows the list of
radio system components along with their functions and block diagram symbols. Antennas
will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4.

Design of a Radio System
Filters, mixers, amplifiers, and antennas are necessary components of all radio systems, but
designers need to consider how the systems will be used. In radio signal broadcasting, this
may be as straightforward as determining the size and location of the antenna as well as a
signal that will be strong enough to cover a very large area. However, in a radio system that
incorporates two-way communications—for example, cellular phones connected via a wireless
network—there are other considerations, including multiple user access, transmission direc-
tion, switching, and signal strength.
Multiple Access
Because the number of frequencies available for radio transmission is limited, conserving the use
of frequencies is important. One way to do this is by sharing a particular frequency among mul-
tiple users, which reduces the number of frequencies needed. In Figure 3-12, a group of people
is using walkie-talkies, all the users participating on the same channel. If the three people on the
left transmit at the same time, the three on the right will not be able to understand the messages.
The only way for all the users to share a channel is if they take turns transmitting.
Another example of multiple access is when employees of a company send multiple envelopes
or packages from one office to another office. All the envelopes and packages are shipped at
the same time and share space in the same courier truck on the same trip (multiple access).
But when the truck arrives at the other office, the envelopes and packages are sorted and
delivered to their respective recipients.
Several methods allow multiple access. The most significant, in terms of wireless communica-
tions, are Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access
(TDMA), and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).

Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) Frequency Division Multiple Access
(FDMA) divides the bandwidth of a channel (a range of frequencies) into several smaller
frequency bands (narrower ranges of frequencies, or channels). For example, a transmission
band with a 50,000 Hz bandwidth can be divided into 1,000 channels, each with a band-
width of 50 Hz. Each channel can then be dedicated to one specific user. This concept is
illustrated in Figure 3-13. FDMA is most often used with analog transmissions.
Cable television is transmitted using FDMA over coaxial cable. Each
analog television signal uses 6 MHz of the 500 MHz bandwidth of
the cable.
Think back to the example in Figure 3-12. If each of the three people on the left uses a
different portion of the same frequency band by selecting a different channel on the walkie-
talkie and if each of the three people on the right select one of the three transmitting
channels, the people on the left can transmit simultaneously and each of the people on the
right will receive the different transmissions.
One of the drawbacks of FDMA is that when signals are sent at frequencies that are
grouped closely together, an errant signal from one frequency may encroach on its neigh-
bor’s frequency. This phenomenon, known as crosstalk, causes interference on the other
frequency and may disrupt the transmission.
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) To overcome the problem of crosstalk,
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) was developed. Whereas FDMA divides the band-
width into several frequencies, TDMA divides the transmission time into several slots. Each
user is assigned the entire frequency for a fraction of time on a fixed, rotating basis. Because
the duration of each time slot is short, the delays that occur while others are using the

frequency are not noticeable. Figure 3-14 illustrates TDMA for six users. TDMA is most
often used with digital transmissions.
In traditional TDMA, if a user has no data to transmit during his or
her assigned time slot with TDMA, the frequency remains idle—in
other words, no one else uses that frequency. In more modern
systems, the unused time slots can be assigned to users that are
currently communicating.
Some types of cellular phones based on GSM technology, which
until recently were the most common cellular technology used in
Europe, transmit and receive using the TDMA method.
TDMA has two significant advantages over FDMA. First, it uses the bandwidth more effi-
ciently. Studies indicate that when using a 25 MHz bandwidth, TDMA can achieve over
20 times the capacity of FDMA, meaning it can handle a much larger number of transmitters
sharing the same frequency band. Second, TDMA allows data and voice transmissions to
be mixed using the same frequency.
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
is another transmission method used in cellular telephone communications. Rather than
separate RF frequencies or channels, CDMA uses direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
technology with a unique digital spreading code (called a PN code) to differentiate the mul-
tiple transmissions in the same frequency range. Before transmission occurs, the high-rate

PN code is combined with the data to be sent; this step spreads the signal over a wide
frequency band.
CDMA is very similar to the spread spectrum transmission technique described in Chapter 2.
What’s different about CDMA is that, to implement multiple access, the transmission to each
user begins on a subsequent chip of the PN code. Recall that, in DSSS, the 1s and 0s of
the spreading code are referred to as “chips” to avoid confusing them with the data bits;
this imprints a unique address on the data. Each “address” is then used only by one of the
receivers sharing a frequency. Figure 3-15 illustrates the concept of the spreading code.
The unique-address concept works this way:
Channel 1:
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
Channel 2:
0 0 1 1 0 1 1
Channel 3:
0 1 1 0 1 1 0
and so on, until the sequence of chips wraps around.
Note that each of these codes starts on a different chip of the same sequence of 1s and 0s.
The code for channel 2 begins on the second chip of channel 1. The code for channel 3
begins on the second chip of channel 2, and so on, until there are no more unique codes
available and the sequence of chips wraps around. The longer the code is, the larger the
number of users who will be able to share a channel. In the previous unique-address exam-
ple, there are seven chips per code, which allows for seven unique codes.
The number of chips in the code determines the amount of spreading or bandwidth that the
transmitted signal will occupy. Because the amount of spreading is limited by the band-
width allocated to the system, the length of the spreading code also determines the number
of unique code sequences and, consequently, the number of users that can share that
frequency band.

In CDMA technology, the spreading code is called a pseudo-random code (PN code),
because the code appears to be a random sequence of 1s and 0s, but it actually repeats itself
over and over.
The spreading process is reversed at the receiver, and the code is de-spread to extract the
original data bit transmitted. Because all receivers are on the same frequency, they all receive
the same transmission. The PN code is designed so that when a receiver picks up a signal
that was spread with the PN code that’s being used by another receiver and then attempts
to recover the original data, the decoded signal still looks like a high-frequency signal
instead of data, so it is ignored. Figure 3-16 illustrates the decoding of the data in CDMA,
and Figure 3-17 shows an example of what happens when a receiver attempts to de-spread
another receiver’s signal and recover the data bits.

To understand CDMA, imagine a room with 20 people in it who are having 10 simulta-
neous one-on-one conversations. Now suppose that all the pairs are talking at the same
time but in different languages. Ignoring the issue of the noise level in the room, because
none of the listeners understands any language other than that of the individual with whom
they are speaking, the other nine conversations don’t bother them.
There are several advantages to CDMA:
●
It can carry up to three times the amount of data as TDMA.
●
Transmissions are much harder to eavesdrop on, because a listener would have
difficulty picking out a single conversation spread across the entire spectrum.
●
A would-be eavesdropper must know the exact chip in which a particular transmission
starts, and the PN code changes if the user is moving when his cellular phone connects
to a different tower, thus making eavesdropping extremely difficult.
CDMA-based cellular technology is extremely complex. Because this book is not specifically
focused on CDMA technology, the preceding description is included merely to provide an
overview of this multiple access method.
Transmission Direction
In most wireless communications systems, data must flow in both directions, and the flow
must be controlled so that the sending and receiving devices know when data will arrive or
when it needs to be transmitted. There are three types of data flow: simplex, half-duplex, and
full-duplex.
Simplex transmission occurs in only one direction, from device 1 to device 2, as shown in
Figure 3-18. A broadcast radio station is an example of simplex transmission: The signal goes
from the radio transmitter to the listener’s radio, but the listener has no way of communicating
with the station using the same radio signal. Except for broadcast radio and television, simplex
is rarely used in wireless data communications today. That’s because the receiver is unable
to give the sender any feedback regarding the transmission, such as whether it was received
correctly or if it needs to be resent. Such reliability is essential for successful data exchange.

Half-duplex transmission occurs in both directions, but only one way at a time, as shown in
Figure 3-19. This type of communications is typically used in consumer devices such as citi-
zens band (CB) radios or walkie-talkies. In order for User A to transmit a message to User B,
he must hold down the “talk” button while speaking. While the button is being pressed,
User B can only listen and not talk. User A must release the “talk” button before User B
can press her “talk” button. Both parties can send and receive information, but only one at
a time.
Full-duplex transmission occurs in both directions simultaneously, as shown in Figure 3-20.
A telephone system is a type of full-duplex transmission. Both parties to a telephone call
can speak at the same time, and they are able to hear each other throughout the call. Most
modern wireless systems, such as cellular telephones, use full-duplex transmission.
If the same antenna is used for wireless transmission and reception, a filter can be used to
handle full-duplex transmissions. Most RF communications equipment that works in full-
duplex mode sends and receives on different frequencies. A transmission picked up by the

antenna on the receiving frequency passes through a filter and is sent to the receiver, while
the transmission signal on the sending frequency is passed on to the same antenna. This is
shown in Figure 3-21.
Switching
The concept of switching is essential to all types of telecommunications, wireless as well as
wired. Switching involves moving the signal from one wire or frequency to another. Consider
for a moment the telephone in your home. You can use that one telephone to call a friend
across the street, a classmate in another town, a store in a distant state, or anyone else who
also has a phone. How can one single telephone be used to call any other telephone in the
world? This is accomplished through a switch at the telephone company’s central office. The
signal from your phone goes out your telephone’s wire all the way to a telephone company’s
switching office and is then switched or moved to the wire of the telephone that belongs to
your friend across the street. This process is shown in Figure 3-22.

The first telephone switches were not automatic. Human operators
connected (switched) each two lines manually. Today, the telephone
system is known as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN),
and the collection of equipment used in this network, including the
home telephone sets, is commonly referred to in the data communi-
cations field as the Plain Old Telephone System (POTS).
To better understand why switches are necessary, imagine a telephone network in which each
telephone must be wired to every other telephone without using switches. If this network had
500 telephones, each telephone would require 499 cables to connect to all the others, and a
total of 124,750 cables would be needed to connect all the telephones to one another. If you
draw a simple network of five telephones on a piece of paper, you’ll notice that you need
10 cables to interconnect all of them. This type of connection is called a “mesh network.”
You can quickly calculate how many cables would be required to
interconnect several telephones or computers in a mesh network by
using the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the total number of devices
you want to connect. Of course, this is not a very practical solution.
To connect all the telephone sets in a city with 100,000 telephones
would require that each be connected to an enormously large number of wires.

The type of switching used by telephone systems today is known as circuit switching. When
a telephone call is placed, a direct physical connection is made, through the switch, between
the caller and the recipient of the call. While the telephone call is taking place, the connection
is “dedicated” and remains open only to these two users. Ignoring, for the moment, some of
the advanced features available in today’s telephone networks, such as call waiting and con-
ference calling, no other calls can be made from or received by the two connected phones
while this conversation is taking place, and anyone who calls that phone will receive a busy
signal. This direct connection lasts until the end of the call, at which time the switch drops
the connection and makes the two telephone lines available once more to receive or
make calls.
Circuit switching is used for both wired telephone systems and
second-generation wireless cellular telephone systems.
Circuit switching is ideal for voice communications. However, it is not efficient at transmit-
ting data, because data transmission occurs in “bursts,” with periods of delay in between.
The delay would result in wasted time while nothing is transmitted. Instead of using circuit
switching, data networks use packet switching. Packet switching requires that the data trans-
mission be broken into small units called packets. Each packet is then sent independently
through the network to reach the destination, as shown in Figure 3-23.
Packet switching has a couple of important advantages for data transmissions. One advan-
tage is that it allows better utilization of the network. In Figure 3-23, if PC-A does not have
any data to send, PC-B and PC-C can use the available bandwidth on the network to send
more data. Circuit switching ties up the communications line until the transmission is

complete, whereas packet switching allows multiple computers to share the same line or fre-
quency. That’s because packets from several different computers can be intermingled while
being sent. Another advantage has to do with error correction. If a transmission error occurs,
it usually affects only one or a few packets. Only those packets affected must be resent, not
the entire message.
Signal Strength
In a radio system, a signal’s strength must be sufficient for the signal to reach its destination
with enough amplitude for it to be picked up by the antenna and for the information to be
extracted from it. Managing signal strength is much more complicated in a wireless system
than in a wired network. Because the signal is not confined to a pair of wires, many types
of electromagnetic interference can wreak havoc with the transmission. In addition, many
types of objects, both stationary and moving, can impact the signal by blocking it or causing
it to reflect. Examples of electromagnetic interference include high-voltage power lines, vari-
ous types of radiation emitted by the sun, and lightning (see Figure 3-24).

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is also called noise. Consider a room with 20 people in it
who are having 10 one-on-one conversations. If everyone talks freely, there is a great deal of
“racket” or background noise, which interferes with all conversations. With radio waves,
background electromagnetic “noise” of various types can impede a signal.
A measurement called signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compares the signal strength with the
background noise (see Figure 3-25). When signal strength falls close to or below the level of
noise, interference can take place. However, when the strength of the signal is well above the
noise, interference can be easily filtered out. Consider again the example of the room with
20 people having 10 conversations. Someone who moves closer to her partner so she can be
heard above the background noise is trying to achieve a higher SNR.
There are various ways to reduce the interference caused by noise, thereby creating an acceptable
SNR. You can use more powerful amplifiers to boost the signal strength, you can filter the signal
on the receiving end, or you can use techniques such as frequency hopping spread spectrum.
With a highly complex and expensive device, such as an extremely
sensitive radio telescope receiver, the temperature of the circuits is
lowered to −459 degrees Fahrenheit to maximize the performance
and minimize the noise and attenuation generated by the circuits
themselves. Recall that filters and mixers are passive devices that
tend to reduce the amplitude or strength of the signal. Cooling these circuits down to –459
degrees Fahrenheit virtually eliminates the attenuation and dramatically reduces the noise.
However, it is not practical to do this in a handheld transmitting device.
Loss of signal strength, or attenuation, is caused by various factors, but objects in the path of
the signal, including man-made objects such as walls, are what cause the most attenuation.

transmissions. Amplifying a signal both before it is transmitted (to increase the power level)
and after it is received helps to minimize attenuation.
At certain frequencies, attenuation can also be caused by precipita-
tion, such as rain or snow. Consequently, attenuation decreases as
the altitude increases because of the decrease in air and water
vapor density at higher altitudes.
As a radio signal is transmitted, the electromagnetic waves spread out. Some of these waves
may reflect off distant surfaces and continue toward the receiver. This results in the same signal
being received not only from several different directions but also at different times, since it takes
longer for the wave that bounced off a distant surface to reach the receiver (see Figure 3-26).

This phenomenon, known as multipath distortion, can cause interference problems that
affect the strength of the signal. This can prevent the receiver from picking up a signal strong
enough for reliable reception (see Figure 3-27).
Multipath distortion gets its name from the fact that some of the waves get reflected, travel
different paths between the transmitter and the receiver, and arrive at the receiver antenna at
different times and out of phase with a signal that travels a more direct path. The resulting
signal at the input of the receiver gets distorted because the peaks of the waves of both
signals—one positive and one negative, for example—get added to each other. The result
can be a reduction or an increase in the amplitude of the signal at the receiver’s antenna,
both of which can cause problems. Multipath distortion is a very complex topic, and a full
discussion of it is beyond the scope of this book. However, some new standards—such as
802.11n—actually take advantage of multiple signals arriving at the receiver at different
times to improve reception.

There are various ways to minimize multipath distortion, including using a directional
antenna, or multiple receiver radios and antennas, where possible, or changing the height of
the transmitter antenna to provide a stronger signal with a clear line of sight to the receiver’s
antenna. Directional antennas radiate the electromagnetic waves in one direction only and
can help reduce or eliminate the effect of multipath distortion if there is a clear line of sight
between the receiver and transmitter antennas. Other methods include using a more powerful
amplifier in front of the receiver circuit to help increase the SNR, or transmitting the same
signal on separate frequencies (see the discussion about OFDM in Chapter 8). Multipath dis-
tortion is particularly problematic in cities with large buildings and structures where the
receiver is in constant motion, such as in cellular telephony.
Multipath distortion affects FM reception as well, particularly in the
downtown districts of metropolitan areas. FM stations are usually
free from noise; however, if you have ever been riding in an automo-
bile in the downtown area of a large city you may have noticed
occasional static-like noise while listening to an FM station. This
noise is caused by the signal reflecting off large buildings and reaching the receiver out of
phase, sometimes canceling the signal for very brief moments.
Multipath distortion in RF communications works very similarly to the
way an echo affects sound. A good way to simulate multipath distor-
tion is to use an audio editor such as Audacity (on a computer run-
ning Windows) or Garageband (on an Apple Macintosh running OS X)
to record a sentence like “This is what happens when multipath
affects a wireless transmission,” then add an echo effect to the recording. Experiment with
different degrees of echo. When you play the recording with a lot of echo, try to pick out the
individual words in the middle of the sentence.
Understanding Standards
In place almost from the beginning of the telecommunications industry, standards have played
an important role in its rapid growth. Today, a knowledge of which standards apply (and
how they apply) to the wireless communications systems you are working on will enhance
your ability to read and understand industry news, technical articles, and system specifications
as well as design and deploy multi-vendor systems that offer excellent compatibility and
scalability.
Need for Standards
Some IT people believe that the standards set for computer technologies stifle growth in this
fast-paced field—that waiting for standards to catch up slows everything down. Nevertheless,
standards do ultimately benefit both manufacturers and consumers. The very nature of the
telecommunications industry, in which pieces of equipment from one manufacturer interact
with equipment from other manufacturers, requires that standards exist for the design, imple-
mentation, test, and operation of the equipment. For example, using your laptop computer
on virtually any network worldwide would be next to impossible without standards.

The world’s first telecommunications standard was published by the
International Telegraph Union (ITU) in 1885. The standard originated
from a desire by the governments of many countries to have a com-
patible telegraph operation. It took 20 years for the first telegraph
standard to be created and published.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Standards
There are pros and cons to developing and applying standards in the telecommunications
industry. The advantages have to do with interoperability and corporate competition,
whereas the disadvantages are primarily political in nature.
Advantages of Standards One advantage of telecommunications standards is the
guarantee that devices from one vendor will interoperate with those from other vendors.
Devices that are not based on standards may not be able to connect and communicate with
similar devices from other vendors. Standards ensure that a transmitter purchased from Ven-
dor A can be seamlessly integrated into a communications network that contains a receiver
from Vendor B.
A second advantage of standards is that they create competition. Standards are open to
everyone; any vendor who wants to enter a marketplace can do so. Thus, standards can
result in competition between vendors; and competition has several benefits. It results in
lower costs for consumers and better-developed products. A vendor who has created a pro-
prietary device gains no benefit from reducing his prices because he has no competition.
Instead, with a captive market, he may raise prices at will. However, vendors making pro-
ducts based on the same standards may reduce their prices in order to compete in the mar-
ketplace. The competition usually results in lower costs to consumers.
Competition also results in lower costs for manufacturers. Because standards have already
been established, manufacturers do not have to invest large amounts of capital in research
and development. Instead, they can use the standards as a blueprint for their manufacturing.
This reduces startup costs as well as the amount of time needed to bring a product to the
market. Also, because standards increase the market for products that follow those stan-
dards, manufacturers tend to employ mass production techniques and gain economies of
scale in manufacturing and engineering. As a result, production costs stay low, and these
savings are passed on to the consumer.
A third advantage of standards is that they help consumers protect their investments in
equipment. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of a proprietary device to phase out a
product line of equipment. Businesses that purchased that line are left with two choices.
They can continue to support this now-obsolete legacy system, although the costs will dra-
matically escalate as replacement parts (and support specialists) become more difficult to
locate. Or they can throw everything away and buy an up-to-date system. Both choices are
very expensive.
Standards can help create a migration path. The organization that creates the initial
standards continues to incorporate new technologies by regularly revising its standards.
Generally, these revisions are backward-compatible, which reduces the risk of obsolete
“orphan” systems that are incompatible with newer technologies.

Disadvantages of Standards International standards can be perceived as a threat to
large countries such as the United States because their domestic markets become subjected to
overseas competition. Manufacturers in smaller countries may have lower overhead costs,
allowing them to produce a device more cheaply than larger manufacturers. Standards
allow those manufacturers to produce and sell their products abroad, often threatening a
domestic manufacturer’s market share. Another way to look at this, of course, is that stan-
dards can benefit industries in smaller countries.
Another disadvantage of standards is that although they are intended to create unity, they
can have the opposite effect. Periodically, a country will create a standard and offer it to
other countries as a global standard. However, another country, for political reasons having
nothing to do with technology, may reject the standard and attempt to create its own. Tele-
vision broadcasting standards provide an example of this. Countries around the world have
created various standards as a way of protecting their internal markets as well as their cul-
tural heritages. With the advent of the Internet and global commerce, this type of protec-
tionism appears to be on the way out, but multiple TV standards continue to be in effect,
forcing many manufacturers to design and produce television sets and video recorders that
support multiple standards. The consumer ultimately has to pay the cost of maintaining
these more complex devices.
Most experts agree that the advantages of standards far outweigh the disadvantages and
that standards are vital in industries such as telecommunications.
Types of Standards
There are two major types of standards in the telecommunications industry: de facto stan-
dards and de jure standards. A third type, consortia standards, is increasingly influencing
how standards are set.
De Facto Standards De facto standards are not official standards. They are simply
common practices that the industry follows for various reasons—because they’re easy to
use, perhaps, or because they’ve traditionally been used or they’re what the majority of
users have adopted. For the most part, de facto standards are established by their success in
the marketplace. For example, most industry experts would agree that Microsoft Windows
has become the de facto standard for personal-computer operating systems. By one estimate,
approximately 85 percent of computer users worldwide run Windows on their computers
(as of November 2011). No organization proclaimed Windows the standard; its widespread
use has created what amounts to a standard.
The term “de facto” comes from Latin and means “from the fact.”
As it applies to computer and communications technologies, those
technologies that are adopted by the market voluntarily become
known as de facto standards.
De Jure Standards De jure standards, also called official standards, are those that are
controlled by an organization or body that has been entrusted with that task. Each stan-
dards group has its own rules regarding membership. You will read about some of these
groups in the next section.

The process for creating standards can be very involved. Generally, the organization devel-
ops subcommittees responsible for specific technologies. Each subcommittee is composed of
different working groups, which are teams of industry experts given the task of creating the
initial draft of a standard’s documentation. The draft is then published to the members, both
individuals and companies, and requests for comments (RFCs) are solicited. These members
are developers, potential users, and other people with an interest in the field. The original
committee reviews the comments and revises the draft. This final draft is then reviewed by
the entire organization and is usually put to a vote before the final standards are officially
published and made available to the public.
De facto standards sometimes become de jure standards by being
approved by a committee. The TCP/IP network communications proto-
col that is so widely used today is an example of a de facto standard
that later became an official standard, when the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) became an official standards body.
Consortia One of the major complaints against de jure standards is the amount of time it
takes for a standard to be completed. For example, the initial standard for wireless local
area networks took seven years to complete. In the telecommunications and IT industries,
this represents an extremely long period of time before products can be brought to the mar-
ketplace; and, in some cases, manufacturers release products long before the standards are
approved, as was the case with the latest high-speed WLAN standard.
Responding to this criticism, consortia are often used today to create standards. Consortia
are industry-sponsored organizations with the goal of promoting a specific technology.
Unlike with de jure standards bodies, membership in consortia is not open to everyone.
Instead, specific high-profile companies create and serve on consortia. The goal of consortia
is to develop a standard that promotes their specific technology in a shorter period of time
than what official standards organizations take.
One of the most well-known consortia is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is
composed of industry giants such as Microsoft, Netscape, Sun, and IBM. The W3C is
responsible for creating the standards that are widely used on the Internet today, including
hypertext markup language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS), and the Document
Object Model (DOM).
Telecommunications Standards Organizations
In the telecommunications field, standards organizations exist at the national, multinational,
and international levels. The following sections discuss each of these levels.
National Standards Organizations In the United States, there are several standards
organizations, each of which plays a role in setting telecommunications standards. The Amer-
ican National Standards Institute (ANSI) functions largely as a clearinghouse for all kinds of
standards development in the United States. Most ANSI standards are developed by one of its
over 270 affiliated organizations, which include diverse groups such as the Water Quality
Association and the Telecommunications Industry Association, as well as the group that origi-
nally created the ASCII code for use in computers and data communications. As of 2011,
ANSI represents the interests of over 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals.

One of the ANSI-affiliated organizations is the Telecommunications Industries Association
(TIA). It is made up of industry vendors from telecommunications, electronic components,
consumer electronics, and electronic information. Working with vendors, the TIA publishes
Recommended Standards (RS) for the industry to follow. For example, the TIA developed
and published a standard that defines how a computer’s serial port, connector pin-outs,
and electrical signaling should function. This standard is generally known as TIA RS-232.
More information on the TIA can be found at www.tiaonline.org.
The TIA represents more than 600 companies that manufacture or supply the products and
services used in global communications. The function of the TIA is to advocate policies to
legislative bodies and to establish standards in five areas: user-premises equipment, network
equipment, wireless communications, fiber optics, and satellite communications.
Two other organizations play roles in establishing national standards for telecommunica-
tions technology. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a large, open (to anyone
interested
in
joining)
community
of
network
designers,
operators,
vendors,
and
researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet’s architecture and the smooth
operation of the Internet. Although it is a United States organization, it accepts members
from any country in the world and focuses on the upper layers of telecommunications
protocols; it is the organization that designs and develops practically all of the proto-
cols used on the Internet. The IETF existed informally for many years, and it was not
an official standards body until 1986, when it was formalized by the Internet Architec-
ture Board (IAB).
The IAB is responsible for defining the overall architecture of the Internet; it also serves as
the technology advisory group for the Internet Society (ISOC), a professional-membership
organization of Internet experts that comments on policies and practices and oversees a
number of other boards and task forces dealing with network policy issues. You can find
out more about the IETF and its parent organizations at www.ietf.org.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), like the IETF, establishes stan-
dards for telecommunications. However, it also establishes a wide range of other IT stan-
dards. The IEEE’s most well-known standards include IEEE 802.3, which covers local area
network Ethernet transmissions, and IEEE 802.11, which covers the lower protocol layers
of wireless local area network transmissions.
You can learn more about the IEEE at www.ieee.org. You can also
obtain a no-cost copy of the IEEE 802 standards that relate to net-
working and wireless networking, provided that these have been
published for longer than six months, at the following Web site:
standards.ieee.org/getieee802/portfolio.html.
Multinational Standards Organizations Multinational standards organizations
span more than one country; many of them are based in Europe. For example, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) develops telecommunications standards for
use throughout Europe. Its membership consists primarily of European companies and
European government agencies, but they also interface with organizations in other countries,
including the United States. You can learn more about ETSI at www.etsi.org.

International Standards Organizations Because telecommunications technology
is truly global, there are also global organizations that set industry standards. The best
known is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), an agency of the United
Nations that is responsible for telecommunications. The ITU is composed of over 200 govern-
ments and private companies that coordinate global telecommunications networks and
services. Unlike other bodies that set standards, the ITU is actually a treaty organization. The
regulations set by the ITU are legally binding on the nations that have signed the treaty.
Two of the ITU’s subsidiary organizations prepare recommendations on telecommunications
standards. The ITU-T focuses on telecommunications networks, and the ITU-R focuses on
RF-based communications, including the radio frequencies that should be used and the
radio systems that support them. Although these recommendations are not mandatory and
are not binding on the countries that have signed other treaties, almost all of the countries
elect to follow the ITU recommendations, and these essentially function as worldwide stan-
dards. You can learn more about the ITU at www.itu.int.
ITU-T replaced a standards body known as the CCITT, whose origins
date back to work on standards for telegraphs in the 1860s.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is based in Geneva, Switzerland.
(Note that it uses the acronym “ISO” instead of “IOS.” That’s because “iso” means
“equal” in Greek, and the organization wanted to use the same acronym worldwide, regard-
less of language.) Started in 1947, the ISO promotes international cooperation and stan-
dards in the areas of science, technology, and economics. Today, groups from over 100
countries belong to the ISO. You can learn more about it at www.iso.org.
Several of the groups that belong to the ISO are actually national
standards bodies. For example, the TIA interfaces with the ISO.
It might seem like there are too many standards organizations, but all these organizations,
including the ones in the United States, tend to cooperate with one another, seldom stepping
over one another’s authority or geographical jurisdiction. You will read more about this
cooperation in the upcoming chapters.
Regulatory Agencies
Although setting standards is important for telecommunications, enforcing telecommunica-
tions regulations is equally important. In a sense, the nature of national and international
commerce enforces some standards. A company that refuses to abide by standards for cellu-
lar telephone transmissions will find that nobody buys its products. Telecommunications reg-
ulations, however, must be enforced by an outside regulatory agency, whose role is to ensure
that all participants adhere to the prescribed standards. These regulations typically involve
defining who can use a specific frequency when broadcasting a signal. Almost all countries
have a national organization that functions as the regulatory agency to determine and enforce
telecommunications policies. Some small countries simply adopt the regulations used by
another country.

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) serves as the primary
regulatory agency for telecommunications. The FCC is an independent government agency
that is directly responsible to Congress. It was established by the Communications Act of
1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio,
television, wire, satellite, and cable. The FCC’s jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District
of Columbia, and U.S. territories.
In order to preserve its independence, the FCC is directed by five
commissioners who are appointed by the President and confirmed
by the Senate for five-year terms. Only three commissioners may be
members of the same political party, and none of them can have a
financial interest in any FCC-related business.
The FCC’s responsibilities are very broad. In addition to developing and implementing regu-
latory programs, it processes applications for licenses and other filings, analyzes complaints,
conducts investigations, and takes part in congressional hearings. The FCC also represents
the United States in negotiations with foreign nations about telecommunications issues.
The FCC plays an important role in wireless communications. It regulates radio and televi-
sion broadcast stations as well as cable and satellite stations. It also oversees the licensing,
compliance, implementation, and other aspects of cellular telephones, pagers, and two-way
radios. The FCC regulates the use of radio frequencies to fulfill the communications needs
of businesses, local and state governments, public safety service providers, aircraft and ship
operators, as well as individuals.
The RF spectrum is a limited resource, meaning that only a certain range of frequencies
can be used for radio transmissions. Because of this limitation, frequencies are often
licensed by regulatory agencies in the different countries around the world. In the United
States, the regulatory agency is the FCC, which has the power to allocate portions of the
spectrum. Broadcasters are required to transmit only in the frequency or frequencies for
which they obtained a license. Commercial companies such as radio and television sta-
tions must pay fees (which are sometimes quite large) for the right to use a frequency;
and, naturally, they do not want anyone else to be allowed to transmit on the same fre-
quency within their coverage area. The FCC and other countries’ agencies continually
monitor transmissions to ensure that no one is using a frequency without a license or is
transmitting with more power than their license allows.
Radio Frequency Spectrum
The radio frequency spectrum is the entire range of all radio frequencies that exist, from
10 KHz to over 30 GHz. The spectrum is divided into 450 different sections, or bands.
Table 3-3 lists the major bands, their corresponding frequencies, and some typical uses.

The United States is obligated to comply with the international spectrum allocations estab-
lished by the ITU. However, the United States’ use of its domestic spectrum may differ from
the international allocations as long as those uses do not conflict with international regula-
tions or agreements.
Until 1993, the ITU held conferences at 20-year intervals to review
the international spectrum allocations. Since then, ITU conferences
are convened every two to three years.
The U.S. Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA), serves as the principal advisor to
the President on domestic and international communications and
information issues. It also represents the views of the executive
branch before Congress, the Federal Communications Commission,
foreign governments, and international organizations.

Although a license from the FCC is required to send and receive on a specific frequency, there
is a notable exception. This is known as the license exempt spectrum, or unregulated bands.
Unregulated bands are, in effect, radio spectra that are available to any users nationwide with-
out charge and without a license. Devices that use these bands can be either fixed or mobile.
The FCC designated the unregulated bands to promote the development of a broad range of
new devices and stimulate the growth of new industries.
The FCC does impose power limits on devices using the unregulated
bands, which in effect reduces their ranges. This prevents manufac-
turers of devices such as long-range walkie-talkies from using these
frequencies instead of the regulated frequencies intended for these
products.
Table 3-4 outlines a subset of the unregulated bands used by many of the technologies
discussed in this book. The ITU-R has published recommendations for many additional unreg-
ulated bands; but as you learned earlier, not every country’s domestic market follows all of
the ITU-R’s recommendations. One unregulated band is the Industrial, Scientific and Medical
(ISM) band, which was approved by the FCC in 1985. Today, devices such as WLANs that
transmit at speeds between 1 Mbps and 300 Mbps use this band. Another unlicensed band is
the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII), approved in 1996. The U-NII
band is intended for devices that provide short-range, high-speed wireless digital communica-
tions. U-NII devices provide a means for educational institutions, libraries, and health care
providers to connect to basic and advanced telecommunications services. Wireless networks
working in unlicensed frequency bands are already helping to improve the quality and reduce
the cost of medical care by allowing medical staff to obtain on-the-spot patient data, X-rays,
and medical charts, and by giving health care workers access to telecommunications services.

Two recent developments have had an impact on the crowded radio frequency spectrum. The
first involves the direction of radio signals. Currently, when radio signals leave the sender’s
antenna, they spread or radiate out (the word “radio” comes from the term “radiated
energy”) and can be picked up by multiple recipients. A new technique known as adaptive
array processing replaces a traditional antenna with an array of antenna elements. These
elements deliver RF signals to one specific user instead of sending signals out in a scattered
pattern. This helps prevent eavesdropping by unapproved listeners and also allows more
transmissions to take place in a given range of frequencies.
The second development is known as ultra-wideband transmission (UWB). UWB does not
use a traditional radio signal carrier sending signals in the regulated frequency spectrum.
Instead, UWB uses low-power, precisely timed pulses of energy that operate in the same fre-
quency spectrum as low-end noise, such as that emitted by computer chips, TV monitors,
automobile ignitions, and fans. UWB is currently used in limited radar and position-location
devices. The IEEE has ratified standards for its use in wireless network communications. One
example is IEEE 802.15.3c, which is used in WirelessHD and WiGig.
Chapter Summary
■Several hardware components are essential for communicating using radio frequencies
(RF): filters, mixers, amplifiers, and antennas. A version of each of these components
is found on all radio systems.
■A filter is used to either accept or block a radio frequency signal. With a low-pass
filter, a maximum frequency threshold is set. All signals that are below that
maximum threshold are allowed to pass through. Instead of setting a maximum
frequency threshold, as with a low-pass filter, a high-pass filter sets a minimum frequency
threshold. All signals that are above the minimum threshold are allowed to pass through,
whereas those below the minimum threshold are turned away. A bandpass filter sets a
passband, which is both a minimum and maximum threshold.
■The purpose of a mixer is to combine two inputs to create a single output. The single
output is the highest sum and the lowest difference of the frequencies.
■An amplifier increases a signal’s intensity or strength, whereas an antenna converts
an RF signal from the transmitter into an electromagnetic wave, which carries the
information through the air or empty space.
■Although filters, mixers, amplifiers, and antennas are all necessary components for a
radio system, there are other design considerations that must be taken into account
when creating a radio system. Because there are only a limited number of frequencies
available, conserving the use of frequencies is important. One way to conserve is by
sharing a frequency among several individual users.
■Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) divides the bandwidth of the frequency
into several narrower frequencies. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) divides the
bandwidth into several time slots. Each user is assigned the entire frequency band for
his transmission but only for a small fraction of time on a fixed, rotating basis. Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) uses spread spectrum technology and unique digital
spreading codes called PN codes, rather than separate RF frequencies or channels, to
differentiate between the different transmissions.

■The direction in which data travels on a wireless network is important. There are three
types of data flow. Simplex transmission occurs in only one direction. Half-duplex
transmission sends data in both directions, but only one way at a time. And full-
duplex transmission enables data to flow in both directions simultaneously.
■Switching involves moving the signal from one wire or frequency to another. Tele-
phone systems use a type of switching known as circuit switching. When a telephone
call is made, a dedicated and direct physical connection is made between the caller and
the recipient of the call through the switch. Instead of using circuit switching, data
networks use packet switching. Packet switching requires that the data transmission be
broken into smaller units called packets, and each packet is then sent independently
through the network to reach the destination.
■Managing a signal’s strength is much more complicated in a wireless system than
in a wired system. Electromagnetic interference (EMI), sometimes called noise,
comes from a variety of man-made and natural sources. The signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) refers to the measure of signal strength relative to the background noise.
A loss of signal strength is known as attenuation. Attenuation can be caused by a
variety of factors (such as walls) that can decrease the signal’s strength. As a radio
signal is transmitted, the electromagnetic waves spread out. Some of these waves
may reflect off surfaces and slow down. This results in the same signal being
received not only from several different directions but at different times. This is
known as multipath distortion.
■Telecommunications standards have been in place almost since the beginning of the
industry and have played an important role in the rapid growth of the field. There
are several advantages of having standards, including interoperability, lower costs,
and a migration path. De facto standards are not standards per se, just common
practices that the industry follows. Official standards (also called de jure standards)
are those that are controlled by an organization or body that has been entrusted
with that task. Consortia are often used today to create standards. Consortia are
industry-sponsored organizations that have the goal of promoting a specific
technology.
■Some standards organizations span more than one country. And because telecommu-
nications is a truly global phenomenon, there are also multinational organizations that
set standards. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
serves as the primary regulatory agency for telecommunications. The FCC is an inde-
pendent government agency that is directly responsible to Congress.
■The radio frequency spectrum is the entire range of all radio frequencies that exist.
This range extends from 10 KHz to over 30 GHz and is divided into 450 different
bands. Although a license from the FCC is normally required to send and receive on
a specific frequency, unregulated bands are available for use without a license in the
United States and many other countries. Two unregulated bands are the Industrial,
Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and the Unlicensed National Information Infra-
structure (U-NII).

Project 3-4
Both natural and man-made objects located in a radio signal’s path can cause
attenuation—that is, a loss of signal strength. For this project, you will need a
notebook computer equipped with a wireless LAN interface that is connected
to an AP or wireless residential gateway. You will download, install, and configure inSSIDer
to monitor the signal strength of the network that your computer is connected to.
1. In a Web browser, enter the address www.metageek.net.
2. Click Downloads. The inSSIDer download page should open automatically. If it
doesn’t, click inSSIDer in the menu on the left side of the page.
3. Save the file in the location of your preference, then locate the file inSSIDer-Installer-
x.x.x.x.exe, in which x.x.x.x is the latest version of the program. Double-click the file
to install the utility on your computer. Accept all the default settings.
4. Once the program has finished installing, click Start, All Programs, Metageek, then
click inSSIDer.
5. inSSIDer will open and display a screen similar to the one in Figure 3-31. Maximize
the inSSIDer application window. By default, inSSIDer will detect and display a list of
all the wireless networks your computer has detected around your current location.
6. Click the box to the left of “MAC Address” (just below the menu bar in the inSSIDer
window) to remove the checkmarks in the column below. In the next project, you
will monitor only the wireless network to which your computer is connected.

7. If you don’t know it yet, ask your instructor to provide you with the SSID of the
network. Locate it in the SSID column of the inSSIDer window and click the box to
the left of the MAC Address of your network’s SSID. A checkmark should appear in
the box, with the row highlighted.
8. In the middle of the inSSIDer window, you will find a series of tabs. Click the Time
Graph tab.
You will use inSSIDer in the following projects as well as in other
chapters of this book.
Project 3-5
In this project, you will use inSSIDer to monitor the signal strength of
your AP.
1. The line in the Time Graph graph tab at the bottom of the inSSIDer window (see
Figure 3-31) displays the strength of the signal that your computer is receiving from
the AP. It will appear near the top of the graph if the signal strength is high and near
the bottom of the graph if the signal strength is low.
Don’t worry about the meaning of the numbers on either side of the
inSSIDer Time Graph window for now. You will learn what they
mean and how to use them in Chapter 4.
2. Monitor the strength of the signal while roaming away from the access point with the
computer. Try to determine how far you can move from the access point before the
signal is too weak for the connection to work reliably. To do this, you will need to
attempt to open a Web page or download a file.
You can estimate the distance between you and the AP by any
method available to you, such as counting tiles on the floor and mul-
tiplying by the size of the tiles or measuring your stride and counting
the number of paces between the notebook computer and the AP.
3. As you move away from the AP, record all the obstacles between the computer and
the AP, such as walls, doors, windows, and partitions. As you monitor the signal
strength, record which items appear to have the greatest impact on the strength of
the signal.
4. Record the distance at which the connection to the AP drops or becomes too slow or
unreliable, such as when you can no longer access Web pages or when a file down-
load appears to stop for a minute or longer.

card with the following items:
●your hand (for a short period of time)
●a piece of aluminum foil
●a sheet of paper
●a sheet of plastic (like a shopping bag)
●a purse or briefcase with some metalic objects inside
If the NIC is built into the notebook computer, try using both hands
to cover the back of the screen or the bottom of the computer until
you see a definite reduction in the strength of the signal.

Real-World Exercises
The Baypoint Group (TBG), a company of 50 consultants who work with organizations and
businesses on issues involving network planning and design, has again requested your services
as a consultant. This time, the Good Samaritan Center, which assists needy citizens in the
area, needs to modernize its office facilities. As part of its community outreach program,
TBG has asked you to donate your time to help the Good Samaritan Center.
The Good Samaritan Center wants to install a wireless network in its offices. One local ven-
dor has been trying to sell the center a proprietary system based on five-year-old technology

that does not follow any current standards. The price given for the product and its installation
is low and is therefore attractive to the center. However, managers at the center have asked
TBG for advice.
Exercise 3-1
Create a PowerPoint slide presentation that outlines the different types of standards, the
advantages and disadvantages of standards, and why they are needed. Include examples of
products that did not follow standards and have vanished from the marketplace. Because
the Good Samaritan Center is on the verge of buying the product, TBG has asked you to be
very persuasive in your presentation. You are told that presenting the facts is not enough at
this point; you must convince them why they should purchase a product that follows stan-
dards before you leave the room.
Exercise 3-2
Your presentation casts a shadow of doubt over the vendor’s proprietary product, but the
Good Samaritan Center is still not completely convinced it should go with a standard prod-
uct. TBG has just learned that the vendor’s proprietary product uses a licensed frequency
that will require the center to secure and pay for a license from the FCC. TBG has asked
you to prepare another presentation regarding the advantages and disadvantages of unregu-
lated frequency bands. Because an engineer who sits on the Board of the Good Samaritan
Center will be there, this PowerPoint presentation should be detailed and technical in its
scope. Avoid focusing on the disadvantages of the vendor’s proposal. Be prepared to answer
questions related to potential interference by other wireless network users in nearby offices
and what measures can be taken either to avoid such interference altogether or to deal with
any problems that may arise.
Challenge Case Project
A local engineering user’s group has contacted The Baypoint Group requesting
a speaker to discuss multiple access technologies (FDMA, TDMA, and
CDMA). Form a team of two or three consultants and research these technolo-
gies in detail. Specifically, pay attention to how they are used, and address their
strengths and weaknesses. Provide an opinion about which technology will
become the dominant player in the future of wireless.

So far, we have looked at the properties of radio frequency signals, most of the
components that are required to generate these signals, and how to load these signals (modu-
lation) with some kind of meaningful information, whether analog (like music or voice) or
digital data (which is what this book is about). The last component required for transmission
of these signals is an antenna, and this is such a vast topic that it deserves its own chapter.
Antennas mystify even some RF engineers and technicians, for they are responsible for the
“magic” of RF communications. The purpose of an antenna is to convert electricity into elec-
tromagnetic waves, which then radiate or move away from the antenna at the transmitting
end. At the receiving end, antennas convert the EM waves back into an electrical current.
The field of wireless communications is growing at a very fast pace, with new standards and tech-
nologies being introduced every week. Service providers are beginning to deploy wireless devices
everywhere—at airports, hotels, train stations, restaurants, cafes, shopping malls, even in public
parks. The use of cellular telephones has exploded in the last three decades. Employees in all
types of industries are being equipped with smartphones so they can stay in touch through voice
and e-mail at all times from anywhere in the world and also so they can access applications and
corporate data. Wireless networks and wireless Internet hotspots are becoming commonplace in
locations catering to businesspeople and the general public alike. Concerns about security, pri-
vacy, and interference, especially in devices that use unlicensed bands, are growing. No matter
which type of RF communications you use, some kind of antenna is required.
Antennas play a key role in the successful deployment of any kind of wireless connection.
Proper planning and installation of antennas is required to ensure good signal coverage, to
permit user mobility, minimize or eliminate interference, and in some cases to enhance secu-
rity. Cellular service providers spend a great deal of time and effort planning and analyzing
utilization and traffic patterns in order to maximize the number of customers that can use
the system in a given area and allow for continuous connectivity for both data and voice.
In the rush to get wireless networks installed today, many are being deployed with little
thought about where the signals originate or how far they reach.
This chapter takes you on an introductory technical tour of antennas—their types, sizes, and
applications as well as some of the implementation issues. First, you learn about power gain
and loss, then about the physical aspects of antennas. Mostly, this chapter discusses anten-
nas used in a limited range of wireless communications technologies. However, the basic
concepts cross over to other RF communications technologies, and the information provided
here can be easily extended to other types of antenna system implementation.
Gain and Loss
Understanding RF signal transmission involves knowing:
●
The strength or the power with which the transmitter is sending the signal
●
The amount of reduction in signal strength caused by cables, connectors, and other
components
●
The transmission medium (atmosphere or free-space)
●
The minimum strength of the signal required by the receiver to be able to properly
recover the data sent by the transmitter

These requirements mean that we need to know how much power the signal loses or gains at
various points. For example, an analysis of the signal would determine the power level that
was fed into the antenna and how much signal strength was lost in transit from the transmit-
ter to the receiver, due to obstacles and other impediments.
Consider a wireless cable/DSL router for home networking, which typically sends out a signal
with approximately 32 milliwatts (0.032 watts) of power. The router is on the lower level of
the house, and by the time the signal reaches the wireless NIC in a notebook computer in the
second floor bedroom, it may only have a strength of about 0.000000001 (109) watts, or
1 nanowatt. With received signals being sometimes several million times smaller than the sig-
nals that were transmitted, performing calculations is challenging, and it is easy to make a
mistake reading, writing, or typing these long numbers, even with a calculator. Fortunately,
engineers have had the same kind of difficulty with very large or very small numbers, which
is why Bell Labs, in the 1920s, came up with a system to simplify these calculations.
You will recall from the previous chapter that an amplifier boosts the power of a signal; when
this happens, the effect is called a gain. Conversely, cables and connectors offer a resistance to
the flow of electricity and therefore tend to decrease the power of a signal—that is, the
medium itself causes a reduction in the amount of energy that an electromagnetic signal has.
This effect is called a loss. Knowing how much gain or loss occurs in an RF system composed
of radio transmitters, receivers, cables, connectors, and antennas is necessary to assist RF engi-
neers and technicians in selecting the appropriate components and properly installing them for
reliable signal transmission and reception.
A signal’s power does not usually change in linear fashion. Instead, it changes logarithmically.
Figure 4-1 shows an example of two values: one that changes in linear fashion and one that
changes in logarithmic fashion.

Gain and loss are relative concepts, which means that you need to know the power level of the
signal at two different points, such as at the transmitting antenna and at the receiving antenna.
Relative concepts are best quantified with relative measurements, such as percentages. To cal-
culate the signal loss, using percentages, for the wireless cable/DSL router used in the home net-
work, you would still have to deal with numbers that are difficult to read, write, or type. Let’s
take a look at a much easier way to work with gain and loss, without using long numbers.
Decibel
Decibel (dB) is a ratio between two signal levels—a relative measurement (i.e., one in which a
value is dependent on another value) that makes it much simpler to express and calculate
power gain or loss. We will now discuss how it’s done.
The decibel is named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell, the
inventor of the telephone. That is why the “B” in “dB” is written as
a capital letter.
To calculate gain, all you need to remember, in practically all cases, is that:
●
A gain of 3 dB (þ3 dB) means the signal is two times bigger (twice the power).
●
A gain of 10 dB (þ10 dB) means the signal is 10 times bigger (10 times the power).
What about loss? It is the opposite of gain:
●
A loss of 3 dB (3 dB) means the signal is two times smaller (half the power).
●
A loss of 10 dB (10 dB) means the signal is 10 times smaller (1/10th the power).
To say “a loss of minus 3 dB” (3 dB) is incorrect. The correct form
is to say “a loss of 3 dB.”
These rules are known as the “tens and threes of RF mathematics.” As you will see in the
examples that follow, you can easily and quickly calculate the gain or loss with a fair amount
of accuracy, without using a calculator, just by following these simple rules.
Using dB to represent gains and losses means that the only types of calculations required are sim-
ple additions and subtractions. There is no need for multiplication, division, or any kind of com-
plex calculation to convert the values to the same unit in order to get a meaningful result. For
example, if a transmitter is connected to a cable that has a loss of 4 dB and each connector—one
on the transmitter end of the cable and one on the antenna end of the cable—has a loss of 1 dB,
you can simply add the losses together like this: (4 dB) þ (1 dB) þ (1 dB) ¼ 6 dB, for a
total loss of 6 dB.
Although dB is a relative measurement, at some point we have to make a connection between
dB and a linear, absolute measurement. One example of this is dBm, which is a relative way
to indicate an absolute power level in the linear watt scale:
1 mW ¼ 0 dBm
130
Chapter 4
How Antennas Work

You can add or subtract any value represented in dB (dBm, etc.) using the “tens and threes”
rule; you can also convert a dBm value directly to milliwatts of power. Let’s look at some
examples:
●
þ3 dB (3 dB of gain) will double the power: 10 mW þ 3 dB ¼ approximately 20 mW
●
3 dB (3 dB of loss) will halve the power: 10 mW  3 dB ¼ approximately 5 mW
●
þ10 dB will increase the power 10 times: 10 mW þ 10 dB ¼ approximately 100 mW
●
10 dB will decrease the power 10 times: 10 mW  10 dB ¼ approximately 1 mW
Converting to mW does not change the relative measurement
characteristic of decibel. It simply means that you have a reference
point for the values used in the calculations; you can still add
or subtract any dB values as if they were all represented in the
same units.
Therefore, if you want to know the absolute power level of a particular signal that is sup-
plied by a transmitter and you know from the specifications for this particular unit that the
strength of the output signal is þ36 dBm, you can calculate the absolute power by breaking
down this number like this:
36 dBm ¼ þ10 dBm þ10 dBm þ10 dBm þ3 dBm þ3 dBm
Because 0 dBm is equal to 1 mW, it follows that:
●
Adding 10 dB makes the signal power 10 mW or 1 mW multiplied by 10.
●
Adding another 10 dB multiplies the signal power by 10, making it 100 mW.
●
Adding another 10 dB multiplies the signal power by 10 again, making it 1000 mW
or 1 W.
●
Adding another 3 dB doubles the signal power, making it 2 W.
●
Adding another 3 dB doubles the signal power again, making it 4 W.
In the rare instances in which using the “tens and threes” rule
does not work, the formula for converting milliwatts (mW) to dBm
is PdBm ¼ 10logPmW. Therefore, the formula for converting dBm
to mW is: PmW ¼ log1(PdBm/10) ¼ 10 dBm. PmW is power in
milliwatts, and PdBm is the equivalent figure in dB. These formulas
are provided here for your reference only.
When assigning a dB factor to the gain of an antenna, the measurement must relate to
some absolute value. The most perfect radiator of electromagnetic waves is an isotropic
radiator, a theoretically perfect sphere that radiates energy equally in all directions. It is
not possible to build a real isotropic radiator because it would need a power or signal
cable connected to it at some point on the surface of the sphere. The cable connection
means that the sphere would no longer be perfect and would not be able to radiate with
equal intensity in all directions. However, an isotropic radiator provides a reference point
for representing the gain of an antenna, which is usually expressed using dB isotropic
(dBi), a unit of measurement for the gain an antenna has, compared to the gain an isotro-
pic radiator would have.

The closest thing to an isotropic radiator is the sun. However, even
the sun is not perfect because of a phenomenon called sunspots,
which are dark areas on the surface of the star that change
periodically and radiate energy levels different from the rest of
the surface.
For microwave and higher frequency antennas, the gain is usually expressed in dB dipole
(dBd). A dipole is the smallest, simplest, most practical type of antenna that can be made,
which therefore exhibits the least amount of gain. A dipole has a fixed gain of 2.15 dB over
that of an isotropic radiator. Therefore, if the gain of an antenna is 5 dBd, to convert to dBi,
you simply add 2.15 to the 5 and get 7.15 dBi. Table 4-1 shows a summary of the decibel
values used in RF communications.
Antenna Characteristics
Now that you have an understanding of gain and loss, it is time to get acquainted with
antenna types, sizes, and shapes.
Antennas are reciprocal devices, which means that an antenna
that works well for transmitting a signal on a particular range of
frequencies is also effective at receiving signals in the same range
of frequencies.
Antenna Types
Antennas used in wireless communications can be characterized as either passive or active.
Each type of antenna can be constructed as either passive or active; however, most antennas
are passive.
Passive Antennas Passive antennas are the most common type and are constructed of a
piece of metal, wire, or similar conductive material. A passive antenna does not amplify the
signal in any way; it can only radiate a signal with the same amount of energy that appears
at the antenna connector, after any cable and connector losses. However, as you will learn,
certain shapes of passive antennas radiate the RF energy supplied by the transmitter in one
direction and consequently exhibit an effective gain that is similar to amplification of the

signal and is called directional gain. This is equivalent to using a flashlight that allows you to
focus the beam by moving the reflector with respect to the light bulb. The more focused and
narrow the beam is, the farther the light will reach. If you adjust it to spread the beam, you
can illuminate a wider area, but as the light disperses over a wider area, less light reaches any
point at the target, which makes it less effective as the distance increases (see Figure 4-2).
Active Antennas Active antennas are essentially passive antennas with built-in ampli-
fiers. The amplifier is connected directly to the piece of metal that forms the antenna itself.
Most active antennas have only one electrical connection. The RF signal and the power for
the amplifier are supplied on the same conductor. This is intended to reduce the cost and
make active antennas easier to install.
Antenna Sizes and Shapes
Antennas come in many sizes and shapes, depending on the following three characteristics:
●
The frequency that the antenna is designed to transmit and receive

●
The direction of the radiated electromagnetic wave
●
The power with which the antenna must transmit or how sensitive it needs to be to
receive very weak signals
The size of an antenna is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the signal it is designed to
transmit or receive. Lower frequency signals require larger antennas. Conversely, higher fre-
quency signals require shorter antennas. For example, the antenna for an AM radio station
transmitting at the frequency of 530 KHz (530,000 Hz) is 566 feet (172.5 meters) long, whereas
that of a cellular telephone operating at a frequency of 900 MHz (900,000,000 Hz) is just over
13 inches (33.33 cm) long. Antenna shapes vary according to their specific applications.
Omnidirectional Antennas Omnidirectional antennas are used to transmit and
receive signals from all directions with relatively equal intensity. Figure 4-3 shows two
examples of omnidirectional antennas for use in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. On the
left is a magnetic mount antenna, with an integrated cable designed for use in WLAN appli-
cations. These antennas are useful for improving signal reception over antennas that are
built inside notebook computers or permanently attached to a wireless NIC. Magnetic
mount antennas can be used in office environments, where they can be easily attached to
any metal surface, or they can be attached to car and truck roofs for mobile applications.
On the right of Figure 4-3 is a “blister”-type ceiling mount antenna. Blister antennas are
typically used to hide the antenna or to make it blend with the decor.
Longer omnidirectional antennas usually have higher gain but are more difficult to mount
and hide. Later in this text, you will learn how the size of an antenna can affect its gain.
Figure 4-4 shows an example of a high-gain antenna of this type.
Omnidirectional antennas have a gain because they emit a signal
in two dimensions only, not in three dimensions, which an isotropic
radiator would emit in—if one could be built, that is. When visual-
ized from the side of an omnidirectional antenna, the RF waves
form a doughnut-shaped pattern with a stick (the antenna) through
the center. This means that the energy leaving the antenna is somewhat focused.

Directional Antennas The intended direction of the radiated RF wave also affects the
shape of antennas. A directional antenna is used to transmit a signal in one direction only.
Although this may sound obvious, it represents an important distinction from omnidirec-
tional antennas. Directional antennas, by focusing the RF waves mostly in one direction,
concentrate the energy in (or receive more energy from) a particular direction and therefore
have a higher effective gain than omnidirectional antennas.
Some types of directional antennas focus the RF energy more or less than others. A yagi
antenna emits a wider, less-focused RF energy beam, whereas a parabolic dish antenna
emits a narrow, more concentrated beam of RF energy. Yagi antennas are used for out-
door applications at distances up to about 16 miles (25 kilometers), and dish antennas
are used for outdoor links at distances over 16 miles (25 kilometers). One common
application of a dish antenna is to receive satellite signals. Figure 4-5 shows two differ-
ent models of yagi antennas. The encased model on the left is a 2.4 GHz WLAN
antenna, and the open type on the right is used for paging systems. Figure 4-6 shows a
typical parabolic dish antenna. In a dish antenna, the parabolic surface of the dish is
used to reflect the received signal onto the antenna element. During transmission, the
signal leaving the antenna element is reflected by the dish and leaves the antenna in one
direction only.
Patch antennas emit an RF energy beam that is horizontally wide but vertically taller than
that of a yagi antenna. Considered a semi-directional antenna, it is often used to send RF

energy down a long corridor, although some varieties are designed for installation on the
walls of buildings—for example, to send an RF signal in one direction away from the struc-
ture. Cellular telephony antennas are also designed to emit signals away from the structure
where they are mounted. Figure 4-7 illustrates an example of antennas used in a cellular
telephone tower, and Figure 4-8 shows a small patch antenna for use indoors.

Signal Strength and Direction
The distance between the transmitter and receiver determines the strength of the signal you
need to send, which in turn determines what size and shape of antenna you need for your
application. Recall that most antennas are of the passive type and that transmitters can only
produce finite amounts of RF energy. For most applications, active antennas can be
extremely expensive, and frequency-licensing restrictions limit the amount of power with
which signals may be transmitted.
What is the best solution? An omnidirectional antenna installed high and in a central loca-
tion works well for sending a signal in all directions, but the strength of the signal is
divided more or less equally in a 360-degree circle around the antenna. A directional
antenna, on the other hand, sends all the energy in the direction the antenna is pointed;
therefore, the RF wave travels farther than a signal sent from an omnidirectional antenna
because the power is concentrated in one direction, an effect similar to the flashlight exam-
ple described earlier.
Signals also lose energy as the electromagnetic wave travels away from the antenna. This
behavior is primarily the result of free space loss. In free space loss, RF waves tend to spread
away from the source of the signal (the antenna) similar to a circular wave created by throw-
ing a stone in a pond. The farther the waves move away from the stone’s impact point, the
smaller they get because the amount of energy the wave originally had when the stone hit
the water is distributed over an ever-wider area. Eventually the wave fades to the point that
you can no longer see any movement on the surface of the water. If you place two floating
objects on the water’s surface—one near the point where the stone hits the water and another
farther away—the one closer to the center point will move more than the one farther away
because less of the wave’s energy reaches the farther object. This energy loss is the same
thing that happens with a receiver antenna that is located farther away from a transmitter.
It receives less of the energy sent by the transmitter because the RF wave is spreading its
energy out in all directions. However, if you experiment with dropping a stone into water in
a confined space, such as a bathtub, the movement of the wave is contained by the sidewalls
of the tub, and the waves will travel back and forth within the confines of the tub several
times before they fade.
Free space loss can be calculated based on the strength of the signal coming out of the trans-
mitter, the loss caused by cables and connectors, the gain of the antenna, and the medium in
which the signal is being transmitted, which is most often the atmosphere. You can find
many free space loss calculator tools on the Internet by using your favorite search engine to
look for “free space loss calculator.”
Remember that antenna gain, when referring to passive antennas, is
directional gain (not power gain) due to focusing of the energy in
one direction.
Radio stations transmit their signals in all directions to reach the largest number of listeners.
Although they transmit with a lot of power, as you travel away from the city where the sta-
tion is located, the signal gets weaker and weaker until your receiver can no longer detect it
and all you may be able to hear are intermittent fragments of the transmission interspersed
with noise.

Some AM stations in the United States transmit with as much as
50,000 watts of power, and FM stations may send a signal with
as much as 150,000 watts of power. Higher-frequency signals need
more power to reach the same distance. In comparison, an average
IEEE 802.11 WLAN AP sends out a signal with only 100 milliwatts
(0.1 watts) of power.
How Antennas Work
Designing antennas and understanding how they perform the magic of sending RF signals out
into air or space requires in-depth knowledge of physics, mathematics, and electronics. The
details of the science behind how antennas work are beyond the scope of this book and are
probably best left to university courses in electronics engineering. However, some general cov-
erage of basic antenna functionality should help you develop a better appreciation of the sci-
ence of antennas. This section explains how antennas work as transmitters (radiators) and
receivers of radio frequency signals.
Wavelength
The length of a single RF sine wave, known as the wavelength, is what determines the size of
an antenna. An antenna transmits and receives a signal most efficiently at a specific frequency
when it is as long as the full length of the wave; this is called a full-wave antenna. In most
cases, this is not practical. For example, a full-wave antenna for an AM station would be
about 1,857 feet (over 566 meters) long, while a typical cellular telephone antenna would
have to be just over 13 inches (33.33 centimeters) long. For practical reasons, antennas are
more commonly designed to be as long as an exact fraction of the wavelength, and these are
called half-wave antennas, quarter-wave antennas, and eighth-wave antennas. Though not as
efficient as full-wave antennas, these smaller antennas work reasonably well. The AM station
antenna, for example, could be built as a quarter-wave antenna at about 464 feet (141
meters), which is still quite large, and the cellular antenna, using the same ratio, would only
be about 3.25 inches (8.25 centimeters) long.
When antennas with a higher gain are required, you can increase the size of the antenna to
the next bigger fraction. A larger antenna exhibits a higher gain than a shorter antenna.
Almost any metallic object or any object that conducts electricity will act as an antenna, but
if you use an antenna that is much shorter than the wavelength for a frequency, it will not
radiate any significant amount of RF. Alternatively, if the antenna is much longer than the
wavelength, it will send out some RF energy, just not very efficiently, and this may affect
the reliability of the transmitter circuits.
The wavelength of an RF signal is usually given in metric values. The
formula for calculating the length of the wave, given that RF waves
travel through air or space at the average speed of light (300,000
kilometers per second), is: wavelength 5 speed of light/frequency.
Using a value in feet-per-second or inches-per-second for the speed
of light will yield a result in feet or inches, respectively, for the wavelength. The average
speed of light in miles-per-second is 186,000.

Antenna Performance
Antenna performance is a measure of how efficiently an antenna can radiate an RF signal.
The design, installation, size, and type of antenna can affect its performance.
Radiation Patterns
In antenna design, certain items such as fasteners, brackets, and support structures can affect
the way the antenna emits RF waves. During the testing phase of an antenna, engineers
develop a graphic called an antenna pattern by measuring the signal radiating from the
antenna. The antenna pattern indicates the direction, width, and shape of the RF signal
beam coming from the antenna. An antenna pattern is usually drawn as if you were looking
at it from the top. In the case of directional antennas, sometimes you will see an arrow indi-
cating the direction in which the RF signal is being emitted. Figure 4-9 shows examples of
antenna patterns.
Recall that antennas emit signals in two dimensions: horizontally and vertically. Antenna
specifications almost always include the vertical beam angle that a particular antenna emits.
Figure 4-10 illustrates the shape of RF waves emitted by an omnidirectional antenna, as
viewed from the side.

Antenna Polarization
When a signal leaves an antenna, the sine waves have a particular orientation; in other words,
they oscillate either horizontally or vertically. The orientation of the wave leaving the antenna
is called antenna polarization. If you hold a portable cellular phone straight up in your hand,
the antenna is positioned vertically. The signal leaving the antenna will be vertically polarized,
meaning that the sine waves will travel up and down when leaving the antenna. If you are
lying down when talking on the cellular phone, the signal is horizontally polarized, which is
to say that the sine waves travel from side to side on a horizontal plane. Cellular base station
(tower) antennas are mounted vertically and send out signals that are also vertically polarized.
Antenna polarization is important because the most efficient signal transmission and reception
is experienced when the sending and receiving antennas are equally polarized—that is, they
are both either vertically or horizontally polarized. Figure 4-11 illustrates this concept.

Most add-on wireless NICs used in notebook computers have antennas that stick out the
side of the computers and are horizontally polarized (provided that the notebook com-
puter is used under normal conditions, such as on top of a desk or on your lap). The
devices that the notebook wireless NIC is transmitting to or receiving from usually have
their antennas mounted in a vertical position, which means that the signal is not polarized
the same way as the signals emitted or received by the notebook computer. Different
polarization between devices can cause poor communication between them. The utility
software supplied with wireless NICs can show the strength of the signal. If you experi-
ence poor reception, try placing the computer on its side (carefully, of course) while moni-
toring the strength of the signal. You will most likely see a small increase in signal strength
due to the antennas having the same polarization. Figure 4-12 shows a notebook computer
with an add-on NIC (horizontally mounted antenna) and an AP with the antennas mounted
vertically.
Antenna Dimensions
The design and construction of an antenna dictates whether it is one-dimensional or two-
dimensional in structure.
One-Dimensional Antennas One-dimensional antennas are basically a length of
wire or metal. They can be built as a straight piece or bent in some shape, such as the old
“rabbit ear” antennas that used to be placed on top of television sets.
A monopole antenna is basically a straight piece of wire or metal, usually a quarter of the
wavelength, with no reflecting or ground element. As you learned earlier, dipole is the smal-
lest, simplest, most practical type of antenna. Dipoles are commonly built as two monopoles
mounted together at the base (the place where the cable(s) connect(s) to the antenna) and
AP antennas are

laid out in a straight line, with the two ends facing away from each other. Figure 4-13
shows an example of a dipole antenna.
A monopole antenna is less efficient than a dipole. Dipoles can be built larger because they
are usually laid out horizontally. To work properly, monopole antennas are mounted in
such a way that they are practically sticking out of the ground (or very close to it) or some
other type of large structure that conducts electrical energy. Because the ground is a conduc-
tor, it acts as a reflector, and this makes the monopole antenna behave like a dipole, render-
ing it more efficient. Alternatively, a monopole can be equipped with a large metal base
called a ground-plane to simulate the signal-reflecting effect of the ground. The most com-
mon application of ground-planes is on boats that have fiberglass hulls. Fiberglass is non-
conducting; therefore, antennas for nautical radios usually have either a horizontal metal
plate near the base or, alternatively, four lengths of wire sticking out horizontally from the
base, to act as the ground-plane.
Two-Dimensional Antennas Antennas organized in a two-dimensional pattern,
with both height and width, are known as two-dimensional antennas. Examples include
patch and satellite dish antennas. A satellite dish works like a signal collector, scooping
up any signal that comes in a straight line with the center axis of the antenna. A patch
antenna is usually a flat piece of metal, with different heights and widths, depending on
the desired vertical and horizontal radiation angles. Another type of two-dimensional
directional antenna is a horn antenna, such as the one shown in Figure 4-14, which resem-
bles a large horn with the wide end bent to one side. These antennas are common in tele-
phone networks and are used to transmit high-power microwave signals between two dis-
tant towers.

Smart Antennas
A recent development in antenna technology is the smart antenna. Used primarily in cellu-
lar telephony and WiMAX, smart antennas, using the strength of the signal coming from a
mobile device, “learn” where it is located, track it, and focus the RF energy in the device’s
direction to avoid wasting energy and to prevent interference with other antennas. Instead
of sending signals with wide beams, smart antennas send narrow beams of energy toward
the receiver. Figure 4-15 illustrates this concept. The illustration on the left shows a regu-
lar directional antenna. The one on the right shows a smart antenna tracking a mobile
receiver.

There are two classes of smart antennas:
●
A switched beam antenna uses several narrow beam antennas pointing in different
directions and turns each one on or off as the receiver moves across the path of the beams.
●
An adaptive or phased array antenna is similar to a patch antenna but, instead of
being just a single piece of metal, is divided into a matrix of radiating elements. A
computer-based signal processor controls circuits in the antenna system, turning
elements of the matrix on or off as well as adjusting the phase of the transmission
signal supplied to each one as the mobile user moves across the front of the antenna.
This has the effect of sending the energy beam in a particular direction and is generally
called “beam forming.” The signal processor is used to detect which elements receive a
stronger signal; this determines the position of the mobile user.
Phased array antennas are used extensively in ultramodern radar systems. For example, you
may have noticed that newer warships have fewer rotating radar antennas than older ones.
These antennas are beginning to appear in other applications as well, such as cellular mobile
telephony and mobile WiMAX. Figure 4-16 shows an example of a phased array antenna.
Note the multiple antenna elements that make up the array.

Antenna System Implementation
The proper installation of antennas requires knowledge of the user’s requirements as well as
an ability to deal with various challenges, including physical obstacles, municipal building
codes, and other regulatory restrictions.
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, cellular providers spend a great deal of time
and effort designing and testing their antenna networks in order to provide the best signal
coverage and, hence, the best service to their customers. They also need to know what the
user traffic patterns are in a given area. And they need to know how to obtain the proper per-
missions. In North America, obtaining permits from the government or from private land or
building owners takes longer and is more expensive than in other countries around the
world. As a result, cellular providers also need to be smarter and more thorough at both max-
imizing coverage and minimizing interference.
The purpose of a single RF antenna or a system consisting of multiple antennas is to allow a
group of users to communicate reliably without wires. The system’s performance and reliabil-
ity are major concerns for the RF technician, and so is security. This is especially true today,
when unlicensed frequencies are often accompanied by maximum signal power restrictions, a
lack of support from regulatory agencies in case of conflict or interference, and easy access to
a wide range of equipment by untrained and inexperienced users and hackers.
When implementing wireless communications—such as when setting up a wireless LAN—
using the antennas supplied with the wireless devices limits you to placing the transmitters
and receivers where you can achieve a good connection. If you need to go beyond the stan-
dard setup, however—if you, say, purchase several different external antennas to ensure good
signal reception in a difficult area or to create a long-distance outdoor link—there are a few
additional points to consider. We will now provide an overview of these.
You should not attempt to install towers or antennas outdoors
without
proper
training.
Instead,
you
should

hire
a
professional, bonded installer for outdoor antennas, whether
you are installing them in towers, on the sides of buildings or on
the roofs.
Antenna Cables
Most antennas are connected to the transmitter or receiver using coaxial cable. This type of
cable is built in layers of wires (conducting) and insulators (nonconducting). Figure 4-17
illustrates the construction of a coaxial cable.
Coaxial cable is also used in audio, cable television, and a variety
of other applications. It is very important to use the cable with the
right specifications for the intended application in order to avoid
problems that are difficult to troubleshoot.

Coaxial cables come in many sizes (thicknesses) and specifications. In an RF system, it is very
important to use the correct type of cable, per the equipment and antenna manufacturer spe-
cifications. Among the specifications is the impedance of the cable, which is the opposition to
the flow of alternating current in a circuit. Represented by the letter “Z” and measured in
ohms, impedance is the combination of the circuit’s resistance, inductance, and capacitance.
The cable’s impedance must match that of the transmitter circuit as well as that of the
antenna. When you need to connect an external antenna and it is not possible to attach it
directly to the transmitter output, you must consider the signal loss caused by the connectors
and by the cable itself. Almost all conducting materials offer a resistance to the flow of elec-
tricity on a wire. This is particularly important in antenna cables and more so in equipment
that transmits at very low power—such as those used in IEEE 802.11 WLANs.
Cable loss is measured in relation to the length of the cable. The longer the cable, the more
loss occurs. However, you can use special low-loss antenna cables to minimize signal loss.
Table 4-2 lists LMR low-loss cables of varying thicknesses along with the losses that occur at
2.4 GHz for every 100 feet of cable.
To calculate the total cable loss, divide the loss per 100 feet by 100 and multiply by the required
length of your cable. For example, if you needed to install the antenna about 10 feet (3 meters)
away from the transmitter, LMR-100 cable will introduce a loss of 3.9 dB (39 dB/100 ¼
0.39 dB per foot, times 10 ¼ 3.9 dB), which means that significantly more than half of the
energy produced at the transmitter output is lost, and that is before adding the connector losses!
Using LMR-400, the loss introduced by the cable will be only about 0.7 dB.

To keep loss at a minimum, you may have to use a cable that is too thick for the connector
type used in your transmitter, antenna, or both. Therefore, the first consideration when
deciding to change the manufacturer-provided or equipment-mounted antennas should be
the locations of the transmitter and antenna(s). In addition, be aware that LMR cable is sig-
nificantly more expensive than regular coaxial cable.
RF Propagation
The way that radio waves propagate, or move, between the transmitter and the receiver
through the atmosphere of our planet depends on the frequency of the signal. RF waves are
classified in three groups, as shown in Table 4-3. Ground waves follow the curvature of the
Earth. Sky waves bounce between the ionosphere and the surface of the Earth. RF waves
transmitted in frequencies between 30 MHz and 300 GHz require a line-of-sight path
between the transmitter and the receiver antennas.
Figure 4-18 illustrates how these different waves propagate through Earth’s atmosphere and,
consequently, how this affects the implementation of antenna systems.
Point-to-Multipoint Links
In most wireless communications applications, one transmitter communicates with several
mobile clients. This is called a point-to-multipoint wireless link. If the receiver is installed in
a fixed location, as in the case of a central building in a campus with wireless links to other
buildings, it is possible to maximize the signal distance by using an omnidirectional antenna

at the central location and directional, higher-gain antennas at the remote locations. Figure 4-
19 illustrates this type of application.
Point-to-Point Links
Two computer networks in different buildings can be connected by a point-to-point wireless link.
In this case, directional antennas provide the most reliable method of transmitting RF waves.
Their narrow beams and high gain ensure that most of the energy of the RF wave will be used
between the two antennas. The cost is often much lower and the performance comparable to or
higher than that of a digital telephone company line. Telephone companies make extensive use of
point-to-point microwave links, instead of cables, for long-distance voice and data communica-
tions. Although repeater towers are required, the cost of maintaining a wireless link is usually
much lower than the cost of installing and maintaining cables, which can be easily damaged and
are harder to troubleshoot. Figure 4-20 shows an example of a point-to-point link.

Fresnel Zone
Although the transmission path for point-to-point links is usually represented by a straight
line, recall that RF waves have a tendency to spread out. This means that the space between
the two antennas would be more accurately represented by something similar to an ellipse
(see Figure 4-21). This elliptical region is called the Fresnel zone, and its shape is an important
consideration in wireless links. When planning a wireless link, at least 60 percent of the Fres-
nel zone must be kept clear of obstructions, which may affect the height of the antenna tower.
The name “Fresnel” (pronounced Fray-nel) comes from the French
physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel, who studied the polarization of
light waves.
Link Budgets
Once you have considered the cables, propagation method, link type, and Fresnel zone of your
transmission, you still need to calculate whether you will have enough signal strength to meet the
receiver’s minimum requirements. This calculation is called a link budget and is used in every
type of outdoor wireless link, whether across the road or between a satellite and an earth station.
The process involves all the variables that you have read about in this chapter. The calcula-
tions are not overly complex, but there are nevertheless many link budgeting tools available
on the Internet. To calculate your link budget, you will need information from the equipment
specifications, including the gain of the antennas, cable and connector losses for the receiver
and the transmitter, receiver sensitivity, and the free space loss figure.
Antenna Alignment
One of the challenges of implementing a point-to-point link is to position the antennas at the
same height and point them toward one another to maximize the strength of the signal. Recall
that you must ensure that a minimum of 60 percent of the Fresnel zone is not blocked by obstruc-
tions. The height at which the antenna will be mounted can be affected by trees, buildings, and
the curvature of the planet surface. Some transmitters and receivers are equipped with tools
designed to assist the installers in aligning the two antennas. Others may require the rental or
purchase of additional tools to ensure perfect alignment. Some basic tools are essential, such as:
●
A compass to position the antenna in the correct direction
●
A spotting scope or binoculars, if the other antenna site is within visible range

Technicians who often perform long-distance link installations and who need to align anten-
nas with a great degree of accuracy to ensure maximum reliability (as is the case with
dish antennas) are usually equipped with a spectrum analyzer, such as the one shown in
Figure 4-22. This tool displays the signal amplitude and frequency and can also detect inter-
ference in a particular frequency channel. Spectrum analyzers have varying capabilities and
are expensive, ranging in price from about $10,000 to over $100,000, depending on usable
frequency range and other features.
Antenna system implementation, including alignment and troubleshooting, demands hours of
practical training. Although it is beyond the scope of this book, it is included here to give you
a sense of the complex issues involved. Before moving on to other more practical aspects of
wireless communications, we will discuss some of the other challenges that affect implemen-
tation, particularly of outdoor links.
Other Challenges of Outdoor Links
Recall that radio waves can reflect off, diffract, or be absorbed by various materials. Weather
phenomena (such as heavy fog, rain, dust, or snowstorms), air disturbances (such as air
masses rising quickly from the ground because of the sun heating up the surface in deserts
and other very hot areas), significant drops in temperature that occur in deep valleys during
the course of a day—all can affect the performance and reliability of wireless links. Seasonal
changes can also impact a wireless link. For example, say it was set up in the winter, when
there were no leaves on the trees; when spring comes, the leaves can block more than 40 per-
cent of the Fresnel zone, absorbing most of the RF waves.
While planning an outdoor link, you should always consider the possibility that the link
performance will be seriously affected or the link will go down completely as a result of
one or more of the environmental conditions described. Check the history of the region’s

weather. Contact the municipal planning, parks, and building permit departments to iden-
tify short- and long-term plans that may interfere with your intended link. And always
take into account how the positioning of an antenna may be affected by vegetation growth
in the spring.
The possibility of another company or person setting up a link in which the RF wave beam
interferes with the one you set up is an additional concern. If you are using unlicensed fre-
quencies, such as the ISM or U-NII bands, you cannot count on assistance from regulatory
agencies or authorities. Of course, you should always be a good citizen and make sure you
are not interfering with anyone else’s signal before you set up an outdoor link.
Chapter Summary
■By the time an RF signal reaches the receiver, it can be a billion times smaller than
when it left the transmitter. Cables, connectors, antennas, and the distance between the
transmitter and receiver are all factors that affect how much energy a signal has when
it is transmitted and when it is received. A gain occurs when a signal power is
increased—for example, when most of the signal’s energy is focused in one direction
or when it is put through an amplifier before being routed to the antenna. A loss
occurs when the energy of a signal is decreased.
■The decibel (dB) is a relative measurement used by engineers and technicians to sim-
plify the calculations of gain and loss as well as to indicate the strength of a signal.
A gain of 3 dB doubles the signal’s power. A loss of 3 dB halves the signal’s power.
A gain of 10 dB increases the signal strength 10 times, and a loss of 10 dB decreases
the signal strength 10 times. Gains and losses expressed in dB can simply be added
or subtracted together.
■An isotropic radiator is a theoretically perfect sphere that radiates power equally in all
directions. The two most basic types of antennas are the theoretical isotropic radiator,
which is only used as a reference (given that it is not possible to build a working one),
and the dipole.
■The most common type of antenna is a passive antenna, which is basically a piece of
wire or metal that can only radiate a signal with as much power as is provided by the
transmitter. An active antenna has a built-in amplifier to boost the signal power and
compensate for the losses caused by cables and connectors.
■The size of an antenna depends primarily on the frequency or range of frequencies that
it is designed to transmit or receive, and this is directly proportional to the wavelength
of the signal and inversely proportional to the frequency—that is, a longer antenna is
required for lower frequencies, and a shorter antenna is used for higher frequencies.
To keep antennas at a manageable size, most are built as half-wave (half the wave-
length), quarter-wave (a quarter of the wavelength), or eighth-wave (an eighth of the
wavelength).
■Omnidirectional antennas transmit and receive signals from all directions. Directional
antennas focus the signal energy in one direction only, which has an effect (called
directional gain) in passive antennas that is similar to the gain provided by an ampli-
fier, only without adding any additional electrical power.

■Yagi, patch, and dish are different types of directional antennas.
■Free space loss is caused by the natural tendency of RF waves to spread out and is a
measure of the amount of loss of signal strength between the transmitter antenna and
the receiver antenna.
■Larger antennas have a higher gain; conversely, smaller antennas have lower gain.
■Antennas have a horizontal and a vertical radiation pattern. Antennas also emit a sig-
nal that is either vertically polarized or horizontally polarized. The most efficient com-
munications link is when the transmitter and the receiver antennas have the same
polarization.
■There are two basic types of one-dimensional antennas: monopole and dipole. The
dipole antenna is more efficient than the monopole antenna. Monopoles that are not
mounted at or near the ground can make use of an artificial ground-plane. Patch,
phased array, and dish antennas are examples of two-dimensional antennas.
■Smart antennas, used mostly in cellular telephone applications, can track a mobile user
and send a narrower, more efficient beam of RF energy directed at the user, which
also prevents interference with other transmitter antennas. A switched beam antenna
uses several narrow beam antennas pointing in different directions. An adaptive array
(or phased array) antenna has a matrix of radiating elements and uses a signal proces-
sor to enable or disable elements in order to send a focused beam of RF energy in the
direction of the mobile user.
■Special LMR antenna cables are used to reduce the signal loss between the transmitter
and the antenna.
■RF waves propagate differently depending on the frequency of the signal. Ground
waves follow the curvature of the Earth. Sky waves bounce between the ionosphere
and the surface of the Earth. RF waves transmitted in frequencies between 30 MHz
and 300 GHz require line-of-sight path between the transmitter and the receiver
antennas.
■Directional antennas build point-to-point links that connect two buildings using a
wireless link; they are also used by telephone carriers for long-distance microwave
communication links. Point-to-multipoint links can also be set up using an omnidirec-
tional antenna and multiple directional antennas.
■A Fresnel zone is an elliptical area between two directional antennas. When setting up
a wireless link in this way, maintaining a reliable connection requires that no more
than 40 percent of the Fresnel zone be blocked by obstructions.
■Directional antennas must be aligned with each other to maximize the strength of the
signal between the two. Although some wireless equipment manufacturers include
built-in tools to facilitate the alignment of antennas, technicians also use spectrum
analyzers to ensure high reliability, accuracy, and for troubleshooting wireless links.
■RF waves can be blocked, partially or completely, by weather phenomena and
conditions such as heavy rain, dust, or snowstorms. When designing a long-distance
wireless link, you should always check with the local authorities to make sure no
buildings or trees are planned for the area, because that could interfere with your
connection.

Real-World Exercise
Exercise 4-1
The Baypoint Group (TBG), a company of 50 consultants who assist organizations and
businesses with issues involving network planning and design, has again requested your
services as a consultant.
Triangle Farms is a cooperative that grows vegetables and has two greenhouse locations
within six miles of each other on the outskirts of Bennington, Vermont. It wants to install a
wireless network in both locations but also wants to interconnect the two facilities. The
local telephone company has proposed to install a dedicated digital line to link Triangle’s
two locations and has argued that wireless links are not reliable and that they will end
up costing more than the $1,500 per month that the dedicated line will cost. Triangle
has asked TBG for an opinion. TBG has asked you to become involved because you
are the expert they always call upon to discuss and recommend antenna systems for
wireless links.
TBG is providing the network design and implementation, along with all the wireless net-
working equipment required for the connection, except for the antennas linking the two
sites. The location of the warehouses allows for line-of-sight access to each other, and the
building codes do not allow tall buildings in the area, as they are near an airport.
Each Triangle location has an office with about 10 staff members. The office area is large
and fairly open. Each of the greenhouses has two 500-foot corridors that require wireless
access because staff members perform periodic checks on the planting beds. The staff mem-
bers would like to be able to upload the updates and harvest predictions directly to the cen-
tral server using the wireless network.
Create a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the different types of connections and anten-
nas and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Include examples in the form of pictures
and stories about similar successful wireless links. TBG has asked you to be very persuasive
in your presentation, because Triangle is on the verge of signing the contract with the phone

After your presentation, TBG asks you to prepare a presentation regarding the advantages
of unregulated bands. Because an engineer who sits on Triangle’s board will be there, this
PowerPoint presentation should be detailed and technical in its scope.

their strengths and weaknesses. Provide an opinion regarding which antenna types will
become the dominant players in the future of medium- and long-distance wireless links.

For many years, there were few options for connecting and synchronizing your PDA,
cellular phone, or smartphone with your laptop or desktop computer without carrying
around a collection of cables. A new type of peripheral device usually required consumers
to use a different type of cable. One of the first wireless technologies that appeared on the
market used infrared light (IR). Although infrared interfaces had been available for quite
a long time, IR’s maximum speed of 115,200 bps limited the ability to synchronize portable
wireless devices. The IR specification was later enhanced, and speeds of up to 16 Mbps were
reached—comparable to Fast Ethernet. Despite being secure and extremely easy to use, how-
ever, IR required close-range, point-to-point connectivity, and the lack of mobility eventually
forced manufacturers to abandon an interface technology that had dominated the world of
portable devices for a couple of decades.
Since the late-1990s, many alternative technologies have appeared on the market, with the
primary goal of eliminating cables and allowing data devices and peripherals to communi-
cate without wires. This chapter discusses the now-popular Bluetooth, which is available
on computers, cellular phones, PDAs, and other products. It also discusses some of the latest
developments in short-range, personal area networking, especially those products that
are designed to eliminate some of the wires necessary in homes and buildings for lighting,
environmental controls, and so forth.
What Is a WPAN?
A wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a group of technologies used for short-range
communications—from a few inches to about 33 feet (10 meters), and occasionally up to
100 feet (30 meters). Most of these technologies were designed to eliminate the need for the
large number of wires and cables to interconnect devices such as computers, PDAs, and even
room lights and security systems. The WPAN technologies discussed in this chapter are typi-
cally
designed
to
support
applications
in
which
high-speed
data
transmission
is
not required. A large number of Bluetooth devices support a maximum data rate of only
723.5 Kbps, for example. This is sufficient to handle up to three simultaneous voice channels,
but it is not enough to handle applications such as high-definition video.
Current and future applications for WPAN technology with low data rates include:
●
Home control systems (smart home)
●
Connecting headsets to computers, cellular phones and smartphones, and other audio
and video devices for voice communications or listening
●
Portable device data exchange
●
Industrial control systems
●
Real-Time Location Services—smart tags used to locate people around the home or office
●
Security systems
●
Interactive toys
●
Asset and inventory tracking
In addition to helping eliminate wires and cables, WPANs offer two key advantages. First,
because they are designed to communicate at short ranges, they use very little power; therefore,
the batteries that power some of the devices usually last a long time. Second, their short

range also helps ensure security and privacy, which has long been a concern with other
wireless technologies.
Existing and Future Standards
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has developed several standards for
WPANs. These cover the two lower protocol layers of Bluetooth, ZigBee, and most of the
other technologies discussed in this book. Above layer 2 of the OSI protocol model, the speci-
fications for WPANs are developed by their respective industry alliances. In this chapter, you
will learn about the standards for two technologies: IEEE 802.15.1 for Bluetooth and
802.15.4 for ZigBee. These two technologies use wireless connectivity for very different
purposes.
The IEEE 802.15.x standard covers all the different Working Groups
for WPANs. The last digit in the standard (indicated by the “x” above)
identifies a specific working group, such as “1” for Bluetooth, “4” for
ZigBee, and “3” for High Rate WPANs.
The IEEE creates standards that apply to both the physical layer (PHY) of the OSI, which is
responsible for converting the data bits into an electromagnetic signal and transmitting it on
the medium, and to all or part of the data link layer, which is responsible for the transfer of
data between nodes in the same network segment and also provides error detection.
Although the OSI model is most often associated with local area
networks, it is actually used as a model for most types of data
communications protocols.
Relationship Between the OSI Model and IEEE Project 802 At about the
same time the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was creating the Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the IEEE started working on Project 802, which would
ensure interoperability among data networking products at the two lower layers of the OSI.
OSI is a theoretical model of how communication networks function, whereas IEEE 802 sets
actual standards for the implementation of hardware and software drivers. The IEEE used
the OSI model as a framework for its Project 802 specifications, but with some important
differences (see Figure 5-1).
IEEE 802 divides the data link layer of the OSI model into two sublayers: the Logical Link
Control (LLC), which is responsible for establishing and maintaining connectivity to the local
network, and the Media Access Control (MAC), which is responsible for hardware addressing
and error detection and correction.
The PHY layer in IEEE 802 is also divided into two sublayers: the Physical Layer Conver-
gence Procedure (PLCP) and the Physical Medium Dependent (PMD). The PLCP formats
the data received from the MAC for transmission by adding a header and a trailer, creating
what is called a frame—the same way an envelope “frames” a letter. A frame, therefore, is
a data link layer packet that includes the header and trailer required by the physical
medium for transmission by the PMD. It is at the PMD that the precise method for trans-
mitting and receiving data—in the case of wireless networks, that means Radio Frequency—
is defined.

RF WPANs
The remainder of this chapter discusses the standards for RF WPANs, beginning with 802.15.1
and Bluetooth and concluding with 802.15.4 and ZigBee.
IEEE 802.15.1 and Bluetooth
Bluetooth is an industry specification that defines small-form-factor, low-cost, short-range
wireless radio communications operating primarily in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. As of 2012,
more than 14,000 members, including hardware and software manufacturers, participate in
the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).
To ensure that Bluetooth networks can operate in the same areas as 802.11 Wi-Fi networks
with a minimum of interference (since they both use the 2.4 GHz frequency band), the IEEE
used a portion of the Bluetooth specifications as the base material for 802.15.1. This new
standard received final approval on March 2, 2002, and was then incorporated into version
1.2 of the Bluetooth specification. You can find out more about this WPAN technology by
visiting www.bluetooth.org and http://ieee802.org/15.
Most smartphones and cellular phones being sold today are Bluetooth compatible, which
means they enable the use of wireless headsets, the synchronization of the device’s phone
books with computers, and the downloading of pictures from a camera-equipped phone. You
can also find printers, print servers, GPS devices, computer keyboards, computer mouse
devices, medical equipment, PDAs, and even microwave ovens that are compatible with
Bluetooth, and many other devices will likely incorporate this technology in the future. Most
current notebook computer models already include Bluetooth interfaces, and even if they
don’t, adding Bluetooth capability is as easy as plugging in a tiny, low-power USB adapter
and installing a small amount of software.

Bluetooth Protocol Stack
To help you learn how Bluetooth works, let’s begin with a tour of its protocol stack. As you
know, every wireless networking technology is based on a multilayer protocol model. This
simplifies any changes that will need to be made—for example, if the designers need to
change only the frequency band used for transmission, in which case the only layer that
needs to change is the PHY.
The functions of the lower layers of the Bluetooth stack are typically implemented in
the hardware, whereas the functions of the upper layers of the stack are implemented
in software. These functions are discussed in the sections that follow. Figure 5-2 illus-
trates the Bluetooth protocol stack and compares it to the OSI protocol model, for your
reference.
Bluetooth RF Layer At the lowest level of the Bluetooth protocol stack is the RF layer.
It defines how the basic hardware that controls the radio transmissions functions. At this
level, the data bits (0 and 1) are converted into radio signals and transmitted. As shown in
Figure 5-2, this layer is equivalent to the OSI PHY layer.
Radio Module At the heart of the Bluetooth RF layer is a single radio transmitter/receiver
(transceiver) called a Bluetooth radio module. (See Figure 5-3 for a sense of its size.) This
device includes a tiny Bluetooth chip, which houses the radio module; except for the antenna,
this is the only hardware required for Bluetooth to function. The device in Figure 5-3 also
includes a USB interface and a blue LED. Bluetooth was designed so that the transceivers
that perform all the MAC and PHY functions would fit in a single chip, be as generic
or “mainstream” as possible, be low cost, and require a minimum of supporting off-chip
components.

Putting all the Bluetooth hardware on a single chip has had a significant impact. Instead of
needing expensive external devices, such as PC cards, to give a device Bluetooth functionality,
the functionality is built into the product itself during the manufacturing process. Because a
device with a Bluetooth chip in it has a Bluetooth transceiver (and, usually, an omnidirectional
antenna), it is ready to send and receive Bluetooth transmissions the moment it is powered on.
Bluetooth can transmit at a speed of up to 1 Mbps under Bluetooth specification versions 1.1
and 1.2. Most devices list their maximum data rate as 723 Kbps, given that transmission
occurs in both directions, with some time slots being used for transmission in one direction
and some being used for transmission in the other direction. Version 2.1 adds two modula-
tions that help Bluetooth devices achieve data rates of 2.1 or 3 Mbps while maintaining full
backward compatibility with versions 1.1 and 1.2 at 1 Mbps. This feature is called enhanced
data rate (EDR). Version 3.0 increases the data transmission rate to a maximum of 24 Mbps.
Version 4.0 adds low-energy (LE) capabilities to extend battery life at the cost of lower data
rates, while maintaining backward compatibility all the way down to 1 Mbps.
Bluetooth Power Classes and Range Bluetooth has three power classes that deter-
mine the communication range between devices; the classes are summarized in Table 5-1. Keep
in mind that because Bluetooth is based on RF transmission, objects such as walls as well
as interference from other RF signal sources (such as Wi-Fi networks) can affect the range
of transmission.
Modulation Techniques Versions 1.x of Bluetooth use a variation of frequency shift
keying (FSK), which is a binary modulation technique that changes the frequency of the car-
rier signal. (You learned about FSK in Chapter 2.) Bits transmitted at the higher frequency
have a value of 1, and those sent at the lower frequency have a value of 0. The variation of
FSK used by Bluetooth is known as two-level Gaussian frequency shift keying (2-GFSK).

The amount that the frequency varies between high and low, called the modulation index, is
between 280 KHz and 350 KHz. This is illustrated in Figure 5-4.
Version 2.x added two modulations: pi/4-DQPSK (for 2 Mbps transmission) and 8-DPSK
(for 3 Mbps transmission). Figure 5-5 shows a pi/4-DQPSK waveform. As for 8-DPSK, it
can only be used when the signal between two devices is robust—in other words, when
there is very little or no interference. In fact, it may only be possible to achieve 3 Mbps
when there are no other piconets or Wi-Fi networks nearby.

Version 3.0 added less power-hungry modes of operation to allow batteries to last longer,
and version 3.0þHS added an alternate MAC/PHY (AMP). AMP uses a separate radio mod-
ule that transmits using the same methods as IEEE 802.11 (discussed in Chapters 7 and 8).
All versions of Bluetooth maintain backward compatibility with versions 1.x and 2.x by
using the RF layer first, to establish communications. If both devices support AMP, then
they can switch to the alternative radio module for data transfers. Due to the simpler Blue-
tooth protocol stack, it may be possible to achieve data rates as high as 24 Mbps. In this
case, all control communications continue to be handled by the RF layer that is compatible
with Bluetooth version 1.x.
Bluetooth version 4.0, ratified on June 30, 2010, introduced Bluetooth low energy (BLE),
which is also known as ultra low power (ULP). BLE was based on Nokia’s Wibree, which
was developed in 2001, and BLE-capable devices are designed to transmit at a maximum of
200 Kbps (typically 128 Kbps), which effectively increases the transmission range to approxi-
mately 50 feet (15 meters) while reducing power consumption from tens of milliamps to an
average of a few microamps. As a comparison with current Bluetooth devices, this would
make a button-sized battery last up to one year before needing to be replaced. The technol-
ogy was originally aimed at competing with near-field communications (NFC) and can be
implemented by simply enhancing existing Bluetooth radio designs, thus avoiding costly
design and deployment of additional devices to support NFC. BLE can also compete with
ZigBee (discussed later in this chapter).
A new generation of cellular phones and tablet computers already supports Bluetooth Smart
Ready, which makes use of BLE. For example, the Apple iPhone 4S and the iPad 2, released
in March of 2011, already support Bluetooth 4.0 and are compatible with a number of
devices—heart monitors for runners and cyclists, devices for locating your car in a large
parking lot, smart watches that display caller ID information, and several others yet to be
released. Needless to say, it will be very interesting to watch how the industry develops over
the next few years and what new applications are made available.
Bluetooth Baseband Layer The Baseband layer lies on top of the RF layer in the
Bluetooth stack. This layer manages physical channels and links, handles packets, and does
paging and inquiry to locate other Bluetooth devices in the area.
Radio Frequency The part of the spectrum in which Bluetooth operates is the 2.4
GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band. Bluetooth divides the 2.4 GHz
frequency into 79 frequencies spaced 1 MHz apart and uses the frequency hopping spread
spectrum (FHSS) technique to transmit data. The specific sequence of frequencies used—
the hopping sequence—is called a channel. In other words, the frequency used for
transmitting data could be said to hop (i.e., change rapidly) through the 79 different
frequencies during transmission. The FHSS technique is shown in Figure 5-6. In just one
second of Bluetooth transmission, the frequency changes 1,600 times, or once every 625
microseconds.
Normally, the term channel would refer to a frequency. In FHSS, the
term is also used to refer to a group of 79 frequencies that form the
hopping sequence.

The Bluetooth hopping sequence is significantly faster than that of
most residential cordless telephones that also work in the 2.4 GHz
band and that usually switch frequencies approximately 100 times
per second. The interference to a Bluetooth transmission that is
caused by cordless phones can result in data errors or significant
breakups in the voice stream. This interference has a much greater range than the Bluetooth
transmission itself.
Because they use the same frequency band as IEEE 802.11b/g/n WLANs, Bluetooth trans-
missions can interfere with 802.11 WLANs and vice versa. However, after the ratification
of IEEE 802.15.1 and subsequent inclusion of this standard in Bluetooth version 1.2 specifi-
cation, Bluetooth networks coexist with 802.11 WLANs with a minimum of interference and
disruption. That is because version 1.2 added a feature called adaptive frequency hopping
(AFH), which greatly enhances compatibility with 802.11 WLANs operating in the 2.4 GHz
band. Bluetooth accomplishes this by allowing the master device in a Bluetooth network to
change the hopping sequence so that devices will not transmit in the frequency occupied by
802.11 in the piconet area.
Coexistence with other wireless devices operating in unlicensed
frequency bands is covered under the IEEE 802.15.2 standard. For
more information, see http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/index.html.

Bluetooth Network Topologies A Bluetooth device can scan the wireless medium,
discovering and connecting to devices in its transmission range, which varies depending on
the class of device used (more on this later). A Bluetooth network, called a piconet, can have
up to seven slave devices connected to one master. The master device initiates the discovery of
slave devices within RF range and controls all communications in the piconet. Piconets can
sometimes be linked to other piconets; in this case, a Bluetooth network is called a scatternet.
When two Bluetooth devices come within range of each other, they can automatically connect
with one another. One device, the master, controls all the wireless traffic. The other devices,
the slaves, take commands from the master. A Bluetooth network that contains one master
and at least one slave and that uses the same FHSS channel forms a piconet. Examples of
piconets are shown in Figure 5-7.
Each Bluetooth device is preconfigured with an address that is needed when participating or
not participating in the piconet. The different addresses used in a Bluetooth piconet are
described in Table 5-2.
All devices in a piconet must change frequencies at the same time and in the same sequence
in order for communication to take place. The timing (called the phase) in the hopping
sequence is determined by the clock of the Bluetooth master. Each active slave is synchronized
with the master’s clock. The hopping sequence is unique for each piconet and is determined
by the Bluetooth device address of the master.

In a piconet, the master and slave alternately transmit. The master
starts its transmission in even-numbered time slots only, and the slave
starts its transmission in odd-numbered time slots only.
Bluetooth Connection Procedure The initial connection between Bluetooth devices,
known as a pairing, is a two-step process. The first step, known as the inquiry procedure,
enables a device to discover which devices are in range and then determine the addresses
and clocks for those devices. When a Bluetooth device enters the range of other devices,
it first attempts to find other Bluetooth devices in the area. During the second step, the
paging procedure, an actual Bluetooth connection can be established. Once a Bluetooth
device is paired with another and has a 3-bit active member address, the inquiry procedure
is no longer needed. The master periodically sends out a page in an attempt to establish a
connection with known or paired devices. The device that carries out a paging procedure
and establishes a connection will automatically become the master of the connection.
Multiple piconets can cover the same area, and each can contain up to seven slaves. Because
each piconet has a different master and hop sequence, the risk of collisions (two devices
attempting to send at the same time on the same frequency) is slim. However, if many
more piconets are added, the probability of collisions increases. The occurrence of collisions
diminishes the performance and throughput of the network.
If multiple piconets cover the same area, a Bluetooth device can be a member of two or
more overlapping piconets, or a scatternet (see Figure 5-8). To communicate in each piconet,
the device must use the master device address and clock of that specific piconet; these are
supplied by the master of that piconet.
A Bluetooth device can be a slave in several piconets, but it can be a master in only one pic-
onet. A master and slave can switch roles, however.

Bluetooth Frames Because Bluetooth transmissions are limited to very small networks,
it uses a very simple frame structure. The PHY frame for a Bluetooth transmission is shown
in Figure 5-9. Each frame consists of three parts:
●
Access code (72 bits)—Used for timing synchronization, paging, and inquiry
●
Header (54 bits)—Used for packet acknowledgment, packet numbering, slave address,
type of payload, and error checking
●
Payload (0–2745 bits)—Can contain data, voice, or both
Bluetooth Link Manager Layer
The Link Manager layer of the Bluetooth stack can be divided into two broad functions:
managing the piconet and performing security. The functions of the Link Manager layer are
discussed below.
Managing Links Between Bluetooth Devices Managing the piconet involves
regulating the steps for attaching and detaching slaves from the master as well as over-
seeing the master-slave switch. To accomplish this, different types of links have to be
established between Bluetooth devices. There are two types of physical links between
devices: synchronous connection-oriented (SCO) links and asynchronous connectionless
(ACL) links.
●
A synchronous connection-oriented (SCO) link is a symmetric point-to-point link
between a master and a single slave. This link functions like a circuit-switched
link by using reserved time slots at fixed intervals. A master and slave can each
support up to three simultaneous SCO links. A SCO link carries mainly voice
transmissions at a speed of 64 Kbps. These transmissions occur in both directions,
as described before.
●
An asynchronous connectionless (ACL) link is a packet-switched link used for data
transmissions. Sometimes called a point-to-multipoint link, the ACL link is from one
master to all the slaves participating on the piconet. A piconet can support only a single
ACL link between one master and up to seven slaves. In the time slots not reserved for
the SCO links, the master can establish an ACL and transfer data to any slave. A slave
already engaged in an SCO link can also have an ACL link.
Table 5-3 presents the types of ACL link configurations for a piconet. SCO links are also
shown.

If an error occurs on an ACL packet, that packet is retransmitted.
A SCO packet is never retransmitted.
Error Correction Another management function of the Link Manager layer is error
correction. There are three kinds of error-correction schemes used in the Bluetooth protocol:
●
1/3 rate Forward Error Correction (FEC)—Repeats every bit three times for
redundancy. The maximum data rate is effectively divided by 3, hence “1/3 rate.”
●
2/3 rate Forward Error Correction (FEC)—Adds extra bits that are examined by the
receiving device to determine if an error took place in the transmission. For example,
if 8 bits of data were sent, they would have been expanded to 11 bits, which includes
the error-correction data. The extra bits reduce the maximum data rate that can be
achieved for a transmission but allows the receiver to detect multiple bit errors and
correct single bit errors, avoiding the need to retransmit the data.
●
Automatic retransmission request (ARQ)—Continuously retransmits the data fields
of a data-only or data-voice packet until an acknowledgment is received or a timeout
value is exceeded.
Bluetooth Power Usage Because most Bluetooth devices are designed to be mobile and
because they require battery power from a laptop computer, PDA, or similar device, conserving
power is essential. The power consumption of Bluetooth devices varies depending on their con-
nection modes. Voice transmissions through a headset use only 10 milliamps (mA). At this
rate, a typical battery can last for up to 75 hours of use. Data transmissions use only 6 mA,
which means the battery can last up to 120 hours before needing to be recharged. While not
transmitting, Bluetooth uses only 0.3 milliamps, which means the battery can last three months
if there are no transmissions. Battery life varies, of course, and depending on the type and
physical size of devices, this can affect the maximum talk times and data transmission times.
The only way to know for sure is to consult the manual for a specific Bluetooth device.
Although amps and watts can be confusing, think of watts as a
measure of the actual power used to push the radio signal out, and
think of amps as a measure of the power that is needed to make
that push.

Once connected to a piconet, a Bluetooth device can be in one of four power modes:
●
Active—In active mode, the Bluetooth unit actively participates on the channel and
consumes an amount of power that corresponds to the type of data being transmitted.
Over a period of time, this averages out to 2.5 mW in a Power Class 2 device.
●
Sniff—In sniff mode, a slave device listens to the piconet master at a reduced rate so
that it uses less power. The interval is programmable and depends on the application.
It is the least efficient of the power-saving modes.
●
Hold—The master device can put slave devices into hold mode, in which only the
slave’s internal timer is running. Slave devices can also demand to be put into hold
mode. Data transfer instantly restarts when the slave moves from hold mode back to
active mode, but power consumption is kept to a minimum while it is not transmitting.
●
Park—In park mode, the most efficient of the power-saving modes, a device is still
synchronized to the piconet but does not participate in any traffic. These slaves
occasionally listen to the traffic of their master in order to resynchronize and check
on broadcast messages. Power consumption in this mode is a mere 0.3 mA.
Other Bluetooth Layers and Their Functions
This section provides an overview of the Bluetooth protocol stack’s remaining layers (see
Figure 5-2). The Logical Link Control Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) is the layer responsi-
ble for segmenting and reassembling data packets, which are then sent through standard
data protocols such as TCP/IP for transmission. The Radio Frequency Virtual Communi-
cations Port Emulation (RFCOMM) protocol layer provides serial port emulation for
Bluetooth data. This layer packages the data so it appears as if it were sent through the
computer’s standard serial port, which is another feature of Bluetooth.
Control information is also transmitted between devices, such as an instruction for a device
to switch from master to slave. This control information comes through the Link Manager
layer but then bypasses the L2CAP layer, which is only used when transmitting data streams.
Bluetooth Profiles The ability of a device to perform certain types of functions is deter-
mined by the profiles that are located at the Application layer of the Bluetooth protocol stack
and is implemented in the software driver used with Bluetooth devices. In order for a Blue-
tooth device to operate as a remote control—to control a slide show using Microsoft Power-
Point, for example—it must support the AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control) profile. A
headset, on the other hand, would typically implement the Advanced Audio Distribution Pro-
file (A2DP). A comprehensive list of Bluetooth profiles currently adopted by the SIG can be
found on the Bluetooth developer’s Web site at http://developer.bluetooth.org/KnowledgeCen
ter/TechnologyOverview/Pages/Profiles.aspx.
IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee
Another WPAN technology designed to replace cables and wires is ZigBee. Based on the IEEE
802.15.4 standard, ZigBee is primarily aimed at providing wireless connectivity between sim-
ple stationary devices or mobile devices—such as remote controls—that require very low data
rates (between 20 Kbps and 250 Kbps), consume minimal amounts of power, and connect at
distances from 33 feet (10 meters) to 150 feet (50 meters). Although there are several other
specifications designed to perform similar functions, ZigBee is the only true global standard.

The ZigBee Alliance, formed in 2002, created a set of specifications for monitoring and con-
trolling wirelessly networked products. At the time, there was no global, open standard that
enabled manufacturers to build low-cost devices that could interoperate with those of other
countries. The requirements for monitoring sensors, sometimes called motes, and for control
systems are different from those for wireless computer networks. Although manufacturers
could implement devices designed for control and monitoring functions using IEEE 802.11
or Bluetooth, these last two technologies are far more complex and were originally designed
for the transmission of either large amounts of data or for cable replacement or for voice and
video. In addition, Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 were not originally designed to support mesh
networking, unlike ZigBee. The ZigBee specification is also far more open and relaxed; this
helps reduce the implementation costs by simplifying the communications protocols.
The ZigBee specification uses the 802.15.4 standard for the PHY and
MAC layers. Both IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee designations are used
interchangeably throughout this section. You should keep in mind,
however, that the ZigBee Alliance and the IEEE are two completely
different organizations and that the ZigBee specification goes beyond
the IEEE 802.15.4 standards definitions. You can access the ZigBee specifications at www.zigbee.
org. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is located at http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/index.html.
Today, the ZigBee Alliance has expanded its specifications to include several industry-specific
sets of interoperable standards, including ZigBee Health Care, ZigBee Home Automation,
ZigBee Smart Energy, ZigBee Telecom Services, and the ZigBee Building Automation
and ZigBee Retail Services specifications.
ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 operate in the 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2.4 GHz frequencies
that are part of the ISM band. Applications for ZigBee-compliant devices include:
●
Lighting controls
●
Automatic meter readers for natural gas, electricity, water, and similar systems
●
Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors
●
Home security sensors for doors and windows
●
Environmental controls for heating and air-conditioning systems
●
Controls for window blinds, draperies, and shades
●
Equipment for wireless patient monitoring, such as heart-rate and blood pressure
●
Universal remote control for a television set-top box, including home control functions—
such as lighting, temperature, etc.
●
Industrial and building automation controls for remote machine monitoring
ZigBee Overview The ZigBee specification is based on the relatively low-level perfor-
mance requirements of sensors and control systems. ZigBee-compliant devices are designed
to remain quiescent (without communicating) for long periods of time.
When a ZigBee device is connected to the network but is no longer needed, it can turn itself
off, thereby consuming much less power. As a result, ZigBee battery-powered devices are
capable of operating for several years before their batteries need to be replaced. Devices can
wake up any time they need to communicate, follow the network access protocol, and then

transmit on the specific network’s channel, which is already known (from when the device
first connected to the network). Once they have performed their functions, they can return
to sleep mode by turning themselves off again. Their average duty cycle (the percentage of
time they will transmit or receive data) is between 0.1 percent and 2 percent of the time,
which means that ZigBee-compliant devices use very little power. For example, if a ZigBee
device wakes up every 60 seconds and turns on its radio for about 60 ms while it communi-
cates on the PAN, its batteries will last for several years.
Although ZigBee transmissions are designed to be short in range, the specification includes
full mesh networking. This means that some ZigBee devices can route packets to other
devices, which allows them to reach beyond their radio ranges. In fact, given that each net-
work can simultaneously support 64,000 nodes, a ZigBee network can cover a large area,
such as an entire house, conference center, office building, or manufacturing plant. This
makes ZigBee technology ideal for sensors and control applications in large buildings such
as factories, warehouses, and even tall office buildings.
Mesh networking is supported, but not included, as part of the IEEE
802.15.4 standard. This means that other technologies that use
IEEE 802.15.4 may or may not support mesh networking. However,
mesh networking is an integral and important part of the ZigBee
specification.
There are three basic classes of devices in a ZigBee network:
●
Full-function device (FFD)—A full-function device can connect to other full-function
devices and route frames to other devices in addition to connecting to endpoint devices
in a parent-child relationship. It can maintain connections to multiple devices.
●
PAN coordinator—The first full-function device that is turned on in an area becomes
the PAN coordinator, which starts and maintains the network. Coordinators are
always plugged in to the main power and never turn themselves off, which allows the
ZigBee network to remain available to all other devices.
●
Reduced-function device (RFD)—This is an endpoint device—such as a light switch
or a lamp—that can only connect to one full-function device on the network and can
only join the network as a child device. Child devices do not connect to other child
devices.
ZigBee Protocol Stack The ZigBee protocol stack is based on the OSI seven-layer
model but defines only those layers that are relevant to achieving the specific functions
required in the ZigBee specifications. Shown in Figure 5-10, the ZigBee protocol stack has
the following characteristics:
●
Its two PHY layers operate in separate frequency ranges. The lower-frequency PHY
layer covers both the 868 MHz band used in Europe and the 915 MHz band used in
countries such as the United States and Australia. The higher-frequency PHY layer
covers the 2.4 GHz band; it is used worldwide.
●
The MAC sublayer controls access to the radio channel. Its responsibilities include
synchronization and providing a reliable transmission mechanism (error checking).
●
The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer complies with the IEEE 802.2 LLC and is
responsible for managing the data-link communication, link addressing, defining
176

service access points, and frame sequencing. A second LLC sublayer is included in the
specification to support other protocols and functionality.
The upper layers of the ZigBee protocol stack include specific procedures that devices use to
join a network (called an association), leave a network (called a disassociation), apply secu-
rity to frames, and perform routing. These layers are also responsible for device discovery,
maintaining routing tables, and storing information about neighbor devices.
The PHY layer in a ZigBee device is responsible for turning the radio transceiver on and off,
detecting the presence of an RF signal in the currently selected channel, analyzing and reporting
link quality for received packets, assessing whether the channel is clear before initiating a trans-
mission, selecting a frequency channel for operation, and transmitting and receiving data.
Altogether, there are 27 channels across the various frequency bands that can be used in

signal over the bandwidth of the channel, the carrier is modulated with a sequence of
15 chips, instead of the data bits themselves, in both the 868 and 915 MHz bands. To send
a binary 1, the sequence 000010100110111 is transmitted at the chip rates indicated in
Table 5-4; to send a binary 0, the sequence 111101011001000 is transmitted.
In the 2.4 GHz band, the technique employs 16 different 32-chip sequences called symbols,
which are data units that represent single bits or a combination of bits. In this case, each of
the 16 different 32-chip sequences in this band transmits a different combination of 4 bits.
These 32-chip sequences are then modulated using a technique called offset quadrature
phase shift keying (O-QPSK), which uses two carrier waves, at different frequencies, that
are exactly 90 degrees out of phase and therefore do not interfere with each other. It modu-
lates some of the chips on one carrier and some on the other. Finally, the two signals are com-
bined and transmitted. Figure 5-11 illustrates the modulation of each signal separately; one is
called I-Phase, for “in-phase,” and the other is called Q-Phase, for “quadrature signal.” The
resulting waveform, after combining the two carriers, is similar to QPSK, discussed in Chapter 2.
IEEE 802.15.4 PHY Frame Format The PHY frame for IEEE 802.15.4, shown in
Figure 5-12, has the following format:
●
Preamble (32 binary 0s)—Used for synchronization.
●
SFD (8 bits)—A fixed pattern of bits that indicates the end of the preamble and the
start of the data (SFD).
●
Frame length (8 bits)—The first seven bits indicate the length of the payload, which can
be from one to 127 octets; the additional reserved bit makes this field one octet long.
●
Payload field (variable)—This field is either five octets long (containing an ACK) or 8
to 127 octets long. Frame lengths of zero to four, six, or seven octets are reserved by
the standard.

802.15.4 MAC Layer The MAC layer in 802.15.4 handles all access from the upper
layers to the physical radio channel and is responsible for:
●
Generating time synchronization frames if the device is a PAN coordinator
●
Synchronizing to the time synchronization frames (described below)
●
Association and disassociation
●
Device security and support of security mechanisms implemented by the upper layers
●
Managing channel access
●
Giving priority for certain devices to transmit at specific times
●
Maintaining a reliable link (error detection); 802.15.4 uses a 16-bit ITU cyclic
redundancy check for validating the data
Access to the wireless medium is contention based, which means that all devices, before
transmitting, listen to the medium to determine if the frequency channel is free. This is called
carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). Because a collision
during a wireless transmission can only be detected if a packet is not understood by the
intended receiver and therefore not acknowledged, wireless transmissions can avoid, but
not actually detect, collisions.
In Ethernet, collisions are detected by using a voltage sensor on the
cable, but in wireless there is no way to know what the amplitude
of the signal will be, at either the transmitter or the receiver end,
due to the variance in attenuation. Wireless devices using a single
radio typically assume that there must have been a collision—or
some other phenomenon that destroyed the frame—if they do not receive an ACK from
the intended receiver.
ZigBee and IEEE Communication Basics When a ZigBee device needs to deter-
mine if a channel is clear, it can do it in one of two ways. The first way is by enabling the
receiver to detect and estimate the amount of signal energy in the medium. In this case, the
devices do not attempt to receive or decode any data—that is, they do not look for an IEEE
802.15.4 transmission; they only try to estimate the energy level in the wireless medium,
which would indicate that another device is transmitting in the same frequency channel.
(Note that in energy detection this could be any other type of device transmitting in the
same frequency range—such as a laptop computer—and not necessarily another ZigBee
device). This procedure is called energy detection or ED.
The second way for a ZigBee device to decide if a channel is clear is to perform a carrier
sense. In this case, the device looks for a specific 802.15.4 signal, and it attempts to
decode the data transmission before deciding that the channel is busy. If the channel is
not clear of transmissions, the device backs off—does not transmit—for a random amount
of time. The process is repeated until the frequency channel is clear of other 802.15.4
transmissions.
Beacon-Enabled vs. Non-Beacon Communications There are two types of
network access used in IEEE 802.15.4: contention-based network access and contention-free
network access. In contention-based communications, all devices that want to transmit in a

particular frequency use CSMA/CA to determine if a channel is busy. In contention-free com-
munications, the PAN coordinator allocates time slots for specific devices to transmit in.
These are called guaranteed time slots (GTS).
In beacon-enabled networks, the PAN coordinator can transmit control information about
which devices are allowed to transmit and when, and it may include timing periods in
which the other devices contend for access to the medium. The beacons are transmitted at
fixed intervals.
In beacon-enabled networks, IEEE 802.15.4 has the option of employing a superframe
concept. The superframe is a mechanism for managing transmission time in a piconet.
It consists of a continuously repeating frame containing contention access periods, but
it may also contain GTSs for critical devices to transmit priority data between two
beacons. A superframe always begins with a beacon. A beacon signals the beginning of a
superframe and contains information about the type and number of time slots contained in
the time periods between beacons. The beacon is also the time synchronization frame for the
network and is required for association when the network is using superframes. The ZigBee
coordinator allocates GTSs but always leaves time slots available for use as contention access
periods between two beacons. Each time slot consists of a complete PHY frame, which in
turn includes a MAC frame. Figure 5-13 shows an example of an 802.15.4 superframe.
Beacon frames are not required for device-to-device communications. In non-beacon enabled
networks, the PAN coordinator will send beacons periodically because they contain addresses
and timing information required for new devices to associate with the network.
In 802.15.4, all the procedures for associating with and joining a network, routing, and so
on are embedded in the hardware instead of being dependent on client software and a
driver that may require configuration. This means that, in most cases, troubleshooting a
ZigBee network is limited to configuring which switch turns on a particular light or
group of lights. The only other field troubleshooting function in ZigBee networks is deter-
mining whether the RF signal from one device is reaching another device so that they can
communicate reliably.
ZigBee devices are designed to automatically associate with and join a network once
they are powered on. The network topology is defined during initial installation,

depending on the specific needs of the system. When a ZigBee device is powered on for
the first time, it will listen for traffic on the network and scan the medium in an attempt
to identify which RF channel is being used. Only then will it send a request to join the
network.
ZigBee devices can query other devices to identify the number of devices that are con-
nected to the network and their locations in a process called device discovery. Once
the devices are associated with the network, they have the option of performing a service
discovery to identify the capabilities of specific devices of interest that may be members of
the WPAN.
Coexistence with Other Standards Relatively wideband interference, such as
that generated by IEEE 802.11b networks, appears like white noise to an IEEE 802.15.4
receiver because only a fraction of the 802.11b power falls within the 802.15.4 receiver
bandwidth. Likewise, the impact of interference from Bluetooth (802.15.1) devices
should be minimal due to the much smaller bandwidth of each of its frequency
channels.
802.15.4 devices should only interfere with approximately three out of the 79 hops of a
Bluetooth transmission, or approximately 4 percent. To an IEEE 802.11b receiver, the
signal from an 802.15.4 transmitter looks like narrowband interference. The low duty
cycles—the result of few transmissions and short, simple frames, which is typical of ZigBee
devices—further reduce the impact of interference.
Network Addressing The ZigBee specification defines four levels of addresses for
identifying devices within a PAN: IEEE address, network (PAN) address, node address,
and endpoint address. The IEEE address, also called an extended address, is a 64-bit
static hardware address that is embedded in every radio transmitter. The PAN address
is a unique 16-bit identifier for each PAN in an area. It is assigned by the PAN coordi-
nator and is only used for a single network or cluster. The node address is a 16-bit
address assigned by the PAN coordinator or parent device; this address comes from a
group of addresses distributed by the coordinator and is unique for each radio on the
network. The node address is used for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of ZigBee
transmissons, given that the IEEE address is 64 bits long. The endpoint address uniquely
identifies each endpoint device or service controlled by a single radio—a light bulb, for
example.
To understand multiple levels of addressing, see Figure 5-14, in which two switches that
control three lights on a single lamp are themselves controlled by a single radio transmitter.
Switch A, on the left, controls the bottom light. Switch B, on the right, controls the two top
lights. The ZigBee module controlling the switches can be physically located far from the
lamp. In this case, for either switch to send a command to the lamp, it needs the PAN
address (because it can vary), the node address (to identify the radio module in the lamp),
and the endpoint address (to identify the individual light bulbs). The process of creating a
relationship between a light and a switch is called binding; this needs to be performed only
when the WPAN is being set up or reconfigured.

Note that not all addresses are used in every frame; which address is used depends on which
two devices are communicating in the piconet. Although the example in the figure is
extremely simple, imagine the same process applied to endpoint devices in a tall office build-
ing or a large factory. With ZigBee, if the office layout changes, it is possible to reconfigure
all the light switches. As a comparison, in a traditional installation, this would require a
significant amount of rewiring, which is often prohibitively expensive.
ZigBee Network Topologies As shown in Figure 5-15, there are three basic topologies
for ZigBee networks: star, tree, and mesh.
In both tree and mesh topologies, alternate paths may be available for packets, even if a
nearby device is turned off or disconnected from the network. However, in tree and cluster
tree networks, alternate paths may only be available to a child or to an FFD if another FFD

is within its radio range. If a child device loses the connection with its FFD, it becomes an
orphan. An orphan can rejoin the network by becoming a child of another FFD that is
within range. If a full-function routing device loses the connection to another full-function
device, it will automatically use one of its alternate connections, if available, so that it
retains its routing capability. These are important considerations when installing a ZigBee
network.
The IEEE 802.15.4 standard only defines two topologies: star and
peer-to-peer, given that a cluster tree network essentially consists of
multiple star topology networks.
Figure 5-16 shows multiple paths for packets that are routed in a ZigBee mesh network.
Note that the mesh network itself is made up of full-function devices connected in a peer-
to-peer fashion, although each of these can have other RFD child devices connected to
them. Provided that all full-function routing devices are able to connect to one another,
forming a mesh-like topology, packets can be routed across the entire network.
In a star topology, a single device, the PAN coordinator, controls the network. All other devices
are known as end-nodes, regardless of whether they have additional capabilities. Because most
devices are connected to a coordinator, they only communicate directly with the coordinator.
Cluster tree topologies are made up of two or more tree topology networks that are inter-
connected by FFDs. Cluster tree networks have a slight advantage over mesh networks. In
a mesh network, performance is diminished because each full-function node must maintain
a complete routing table and make decisions on the best route to use when forwarding the
packets. However, the reliability of a cluster tree network is not as high as that of a mesh
network, because the failure of an interconnecting device can prevent an entire tree from
communicating with other trees and other devices on the network, perhaps preventing a
light switch from turning on a lamp located at the other end of the office or building.

Figure 5-17 shows an example of a larger cluster tree network. Notice the connections
between trees; also notice that each cluster tree uses a different channel to communicate
between devices. Each ZigBee router (FFD) must be able to communicate on both channels
in order to act as an interface between two trees of a cluster tree topology.
Power Management in ZigBee Networks Packet routing requires a lot of pro-
cessing overhead and some additional traffic, which diminishes the power-saving effect of
ZigBee devices and also reduces the data throughput. In addition, ZigBee devices are
designed to be very small—such as a light switch—and for this reason they are more likely
to be equipped with low-speed, power-efficient CPUs. In a ZigBee PAN, only the devices
that perform routing or are coordinators incur overhead and, consequently, consume more
power. The 802.15.4 standard favors battery-powered devices but does not prevent devices
from being connected to another power source, such as an electrical outlet. There is also no
limitation on devices having additional data-processing power. Most FFDs, which are routing-
capable ZigBee devices, typically connect to external power sources, although they can run on
battery power during outages. One example is an FFD that includes a temperature sensor and
is configured to transmit every 30 seconds, such as those monitoring critical machinery.
The ZigBee specification includes a number of parameters that must be maintained by
devices in case of localized or network-wide power failures or resets. These include the
PAN ID, the network address, the address of every associated child device, and the chan-
nel in use. Availability of the address information enables a ZigBee network to recover
without user intervention. This kind of functionality is also crucial for the reliability of
ZigBee devices.

Other Technologies Using IEEE 802.15.4
There are two other technologies that take advantage of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and PHY:
6LoWPAN and WirelessHART.
6LoWPAN 6LoWPAN, a protocol that implements IPv6 on WPANs, makes interfacing a
WPAN to the Internet much simpler because it uses an adaptation layer between the MAC
and Network layers of IPv6 to translate the IP information to a format that can be trans-
mitted using the MAC frame format of 802.15.4-compliant hardware.
6LoWPAN supports mesh networking and is designed to be used in nodes that have limited
memory space and processing capabilities and, like ZigBee, the Adaptation layer uses a
compression algorithm to reduce the size of the 40-octet IPv6 header and employs fragmen-
tation to allow the minimal-size IPv6 packets (1280 octets) to be transmitted in a 802.15.4
payload, which has a maximum size of 127 octets. This makes it possible to access and
manage a network node just like any other IP device.
WirelessHART The Highway Addressable Remote Transducer (HART) protocol was
designed for industrial-automation applications in wired networks—process control, equip-
ment and process monitoring, and advanced diagnostics, for example. HART supports both
a bus topology, in which several instruments are attached to the same cable, and a point-
to-point connection that allows both digital and analog signals to be sent on the same
cable. In 2007, the HART Communications Foundation (HCF) approved WirelessHART to
protect manufacturing companies’ investment in the over 30 million HART devices installed
while permitting their use over a wireless link.
Low Rate WPAN Security
Although security shouldn’t be a concern with WPANs, given that most of the transmissions
are restricted to a short physical range, there is still the danger that hackers will try to break
into devices and networks. In this section, you will learn about the security models for each
of the WPAN technologies discussed in this chapter.
One of the most serious concerns—one that is frequently ignored by end-users—is social engi-
neering. Hackers can target a company without anyone knowing it is happening. Therefore,
staff members should be constantly on the lookout for situations that might cause a security
risk. For example, equipment used outside the office should be configured to reject any kind
of file transfer unless there is specific user authorization, even if security is being used. Stolen
or borrowed equipment can also compromise security because authorized users may inten-
tionally or unintentionally provide a password or security code to someone else, or they
can change configuration parameters, thereby exposing equipment to unauthorized data
transfers. If this happens, the security keys must be immediately changed throughout the
organization.
Designing security for WPANs can be much more difficult than for other networking technol-
ogies. A single solution is not likely to meet all the security requirements, for one thing. Users
like to roam free while remaining connected, but they do not want anyone to eavesdrop on
their telephone conversations, access their private information, steal the signal, or interfere in
any way with their systems. Also, small devices tend to have limited processing capabilities

and small amounts of power; they therefore do not lend themselves to the implementation of
complex security measures.
Banking and electronic funds transactions present even more difficulties for WPANs. To
keep the transactions secure, both the user’s identity and the transaction itself have to be
verified. This is done using public key infrastructure and a certificate authority. Public key
infrastructure (PKI) uses a unique security code, or key, provided by a certificate authority,
whereas a certificate authority is a private company that verifies the authenticity of each
user in order to discourage fraud. This kind of authentication will have to be in widespread
use before financial institutions will adopt WPAN technology.
The data transmission must also be protected to prevent tampering; otherwise, hackers
can intercept a packet, make changes to it, and then forward the same packet with the
changes. This is called a man-in-the-middle attack, and the process to prevent it uses
both sequential packet freshness information as well as message integrity check (or mes-
sage integrity code). Both of these security mechanisms are discussed later in this
chapter.
Security is an extensive and complex topic that is largely beyond the scope of this book, which
nevertheless provides, on a chapter-by-chapter basis, a list of the security options that are
available for each technology as well as a brief discussion of the security issues faced by each
technology.
Security in Bluetooth WPANs
Bluetooth provides security through authentication or encryption. Authentication is based on
identifying the device itself, not who is using the device. To accomplish that, Bluetooth uses
a challenge-response strategy to determine whether the new device knows a secret key. If it
does, it is allowed to join the piconet.
Encryption services are also available for Bluetooth networks, but because Bluetooth devices
tend to be battery powered and have slower CPUs, encryption is seldom a good idea, except
in government or military applications, where it often cannot be avoided.
Encryption is the process of scrambling the data using mathematical algorithms so that the
transmission, if intercepted, still has to be decoded into the original data, which discourages
many hackers. The Bluetooth specification supports three encryption modes:
●
Encryption Mode 1—Nothing is encrypted.
●
Encryption Mode 2—Traffic from the master to one slave is encrypted, but traffic
from the master to multiple slaves (broadcasts) is not encrypted.
●
Encryption Mode 3—All traffic is encrypted.
The authentication key and the encryption key are two different keys. The reason for separat-
ing them is to allow the use of a shorter encryption key without weakening the strength of
the authentication key.
There are three levels of Bluetooth security:
●
Level 1: No security—A Bluetooth device does not initiate any security steps.
●
Level 2: Service-level security—Security is established at the higher levels of the
protocol stack after a connection is made.
186
Chapter 5

●
Level 3: Link-level security—Security is established at the lower levels of the protocol
stack before a connection is made.
Note that very few manufacturers implement security beyond the pairing key in Bluetooth.
When transferring data other than voice or video, another option that Bluetooth users have
is to encrypt the data before it is transmitted. However, you should consider that encryption
usually increases the byte count significantly and therefore reduces the speed and efficiency of
the piconet.
Security in ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 WPANs
ZigBee WPANs use a process called symmetric key for both authentication and encryption.
A symmetric key is a sequence of numbers and letters, much like a password, that must be
entered by the authorized user on all devices. No automatic key distribution or key rotation
is included in the standard, although these options can be implemented at the higher protocol
layers. The length of the key can be 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, or 16 octets, with longer keys providing
more security than shorter ones.
In addition to symmetric key security, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides frame integrity,
access control, and security services. Frame integrity is a technique that uses a message
integrity code (MIC), a sequence of bits based on a subset of the data itself, the length field,
and the symmetric key. This code is used by the receiving device to verify that the data has
not been tampered with during transmission from the sender to the receiver. In access con-
trol, a device maintains a list of other devices with which it is permitted to communicate.
This list is called an access control list (ACL). This technique allows ZigBee devices in a
large building, for example, to communicate only with devices belonging to their own net-
work and not with devices in other networks. Sequential freshness is a security service used
by the receiving device that ensures that the same frames will not be transmitted more than
once. The network maintains a sequential number that is continually incremented and
tracked by the devices to verify that the arriving data is newer than the last data transmitted.
This prevents a frame from being captured and replayed on the network by a hacker who
does not have access to the encryption key.
There are three security modes in the 802.15.4 standard: unsecured mode, ACL mode (which
uses access control), and secured mode (which uses full authentication and encryption). In
secured mode, the MAC layer may optionally provide frame integrity and sequential freshness.
Chapter Summary
■Computer networks require all the network components to follow certain rules if the
network is to function properly. A network protocol is the set of rules that specifies
the format and order of the messages exchanged between two or more communication
devices. Network protocols are organized into layers. When a set of network protocols
is viewed as a whole, the group is called a network protocol stack.
■Bluetooth is a wireless technology that uses short-range radio frequency (RF) trans-
missions, enabling users to connect to a wide range of devices without using cables.
Bluetooth can also be used to create a small network.
■Bluetooth is supported by over 2,500 hardware and software vendors who make up
the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). The IEEE used a portion of the Bluetooth

specifications as the base material for its 802.15.1 standard. The standard is fully
compatible with Bluetooth version 1.2 and higher.
■The Bluetooth protocol stack’s functions can be divided into two parts based on how
they are implemented: the lower levels and the upper levels. The lower-level functions
are implemented in hardware, whereas the upper-level functions are implemented in
software. At the lowest level of the Bluetooth protocol stack is the RF layer. It defines
how the basic hardware that controls the radio transmissions functions. At the heart
of Bluetooth is a single radio transmitter/receiver (transceiver) that performs all the
necessary functions. Bluetooth can transmit at a speed of 1 Mbps and has three different
power classes for transmitting.
■Up to version 1.2, Bluetooth uses two-level Gaussian frequency shift keying (2-GFSK)
modulation and operates in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)
band. Bluetooth uses the frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technique to send
a transmission. Version 2 of Bluetooth added two modulation methods that help it
achieve speeds of 2 Mbps and 3 Mbps. Version 3 added power-saving modes of
operation, an alternative MAC, and PHY layers that use a second radio and Wi-Fi,
all of which help it achieve transmission rates as high as 24 Mbps.
■When two Bluetooth devices come within range of each other, they automatically
connect with one another. One device is the master and the other device is a slave.
A Bluetooth network that contains one master and at least one slave using the same
channel forms a piconet. A Bluetooth device can be a member of two or more piconets
in the same area. A group of piconets in which connections exist between different
piconets is called a scatternet.
■There are three kinds of error-correction schemes used in the Bluetooth protocol: 1/3
rate Forward Error Correction (FEC), 2/3 rate FEC, and the automatic retransmission
request (ARQ).
■Devices in a piconet can be in active, hold, sniff, or park modes; device activity is
lowered during the power-saving modes.
■ZigBee, created by the Zigbee Alliance, is a specification for low-rate WPANs. It offers
a global standard for monitoring and controlling small, low-power, cost-effective,
wirelessly networked products.
■ZigBee technology is geared toward devices such as lighting controls, wireless smoke
and carbon monoxide detectors, thermostats and other environmental controls, medical
sensors, remote controls, and industrial and building automation.
■The ZigBee specification includes full mesh networking to allow networks to encompass
large buildings. Full-function devices can route frames across the network to remote
devices. Reduced function devices are an endpoint device, such as a light switch or
lamp.
■There are three ZigBee network topologies: star, tree, and mesh.
■The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines three frequency bands: 868 MHz, 915 MHz,
and the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The protocol stack has two PHY layers. One supports
868/915 MHz, and the other supports 2.4 GHz. There are 27 channels across the
three bands. Modulation is BPSK for 868/915 MHz. For 2.4 GHz, it uses O-QPSK
modulation with a fixed set of 16 chipping codes, each representing a 4-bit data
pattern (also called a symbol).

transmitting in the same frequency range. Access to the medium is contention based,
but support for guaranteed time slots is also provided through the use of superframes.
■Security in Bluetooth supports only device authentication and limited encryption.
Secure key distribution is not provided in the standard. ZigBee supports message
integrity at the MAC layer and can also check for the freshness of the message to
ensure that the same frame will not be transmitted more than once in a piconet.

Project 5-1
Different Bluetooth interfaces may have different software and procedures. For
this project, you will need two computers equipped with Bluetooth interface
adapters. The project instructions and illustrations below are based on a Dell

laptop with Windows 7 that uses a built-in Dell 365 Bluetooth module. If you are not using
a Dell laptop or are using an external Bluetooth adapter, you may need to adjust the specific
steps to fit your hardware.
If you are using Windows XP and installing an external USB Blue-
tooth adapter, you may need to uninstall the Microsoft drivers and
reinstall the vendor software. Go to http://support.microsoft.com/kb/
889814/en-us and follow the instructions.
1.
First, you need to make at least one of the computers discoverable. In Windows 7, if
you don’t see the Bluetooth icon in the system tray, click the up arrow at the bottom
right-hand corner of the screen to show the hidden icons. Now, click the Bluetooth
icon, then click Open Settings. You will see the arrows shown in Figure 5-18.
2.
In the Bluetooth Settings dialog box, click the Options tab and ensure that all
the options in this dialog box are checked by clicking the boxes next to them. Your con-
figuration dialog should look like what is shown in Figure 5-19. Click OK to set the
configuration and close the page.

4.
Once an icon for the other computer appears in the Window, click it once to select
it, then click Next. Remember that the two Bluetooth devices must be placed within
a maximum of 33 feet (10 meters) of each other. Windows will now display a dia-
log page containing an automatically generated number. On the other computer, an
information bubble will appear at the bottom right-hand side of the screen. Click
the bubble to open a dialog box (see Figure 5-21) that asks you to verify that the
pairing code is the same. Click Next to accept it. After Windows installs the neces-
sary drivers, it will display a message indicating that the pairing was successful. If
not, you may need to turn the Bluetooth device off and on again before attempting
to pair.
5.
Open the Windows system tray on the second computer and click the Bluetooth
icon. In the context menu, click Show Bluetooth Devices. You should see the
other computer identified by name. Double-click it to open the dialog box shown in
Figure 5-22.

6.
Click Send files to your computer ,Name of the other Computer.. Windows will open
a dialog page that allows you to select the files to send. Click the Browse Files button
on this page and select a sample picture from the Windows Pictures folder. Click Open
and then click Next.
7.
Windows will open a dialog page that asks you to Select the destination folder and
shows the other computer’s name. Click Send. On the other computer, Windows will
display a bubble confirming that the connection was successful and another bubble
requesting authorization for the sending computer to copy a file over Bluetooth. Click
the bubble to open the Bluetooth Image Push Service Access Authorization dialog page,
and then ensure that Allow access for the current request only is checked. Then click OK.
8.
Windows will now transfer the image using the image push profile mentioned in Step 7.
Once the file has been transferred, the receiving computer will display another bubble
for File Transfer notification. Click the bubble to open the containing folder and verify
that the file was transferred correctly.
9.
Experiment with Bluetooth by transferring other images and other types of files. Blue-
tooth networking is somewhat complex and also sometimes clumsy. Devices must be
able to support the right Bluetooth profiles; otherwise, you may not be able to transfer
some types of files.
10. To verify which profiles are supported by your Bluetooth hardware and drivers, go to
the Show Bluetooth devices page again, right-click the icon for the other computer or
device with which you are trying to communicate, and click Properties. Click Services
and check the list of Bluetooth services offered by the other device. If some of the
options are not checked and you had problems transferring a file, click all the services
offered, click OK, and then attempt your file transfer again.

If you have an older laptop equipped with an infrared port (IrDA),
you may wish to attempt a file transfer using this technology and
compare the steps required with performing the same action on
Bluetooth. In spite of its distance limitations and the requirement
to have the computers’ IrDA ports pointed at each other, the tech-
nology is much simpler to use and allows all types of data transfer between computers,
usually at 4 Mbps.
Real-World Exercises
The Baypoint Group (TBG) has once again requested your services as a consultant. One of its
clients, DeLuxe Builders, is interested in making sure that all their future construction projects
include wireless control systems for lighting, heating and cooling, and energy management
that are based on standards. DeLuxe Builders is aware that ZigBee is a global standard and
would like TBG to advise them on how to proceed.
TBG will be in charge of evaluating the right type of technology and making recommendations
to DeLuxe.
Exercise 5-1
Create a PowerPoint slide presentation that outlines how ZigBee technology works. Be sure
to include information about the standards used, the advantages and disadvantages, and
why ZigBee would be the best solution for DeLuxe.
Exercise 5-2
Your presentation convinced DeLuxe’s management that using ZigBee would be a good
solution. However, DeLuxe’s management is concerned about the reliability of the system
because it transmits using 2.4 GHz and this frequency band is also used by Wi-Fi and
cordless phones. TBG has asked you to be involved in a demonstration to the client of both
these technologies. Prepare a three-page paper discussing how ZigBee can coexist with other
systems using the same frequency band and how ZigBee devices can also make use of other
frequency bands.
Challenge Case Project
Microsoft has included Bluetooth support in Windows XP Service Pack 2 as well
and in Windows 7. Most devices today are directly supported using Microsoft
drivers.
Manufacturers of Bluetooth devices usually list the capabilities of their hardware but
seldom tell you exactly which profiles are supported. If you have many Bluetooth devices
or need specific information about your devices and you cannot locate this information
on the Internet, sometimes it is useful to be able to obtain this type of information from
your devices.

Several sites on the Internet allow you to download a free unsupported utility, originally
created by AirMagnet, a company owned by Fluke Networks, which creates and sells a
variety of software designed to help you design, deploy, and troubleshoot Wi-Fi LANs.
This utility, called BlueSweep, helps you identify nearby Bluetooth devices and the services
they offer or profiles that they support.
Download and install BlueSweep on a computer equipped with a Bluetooth adapter using
the Microsoft drivers. Most Bluetooth devices that are compatible with this driver will work.
Now turn your Bluetooth devices on and let BlueSweep run for a few minutes to identify all
the nearby devices and the Bluetooth services they are providing. You should be able to
identify cellular phones, PDAs, headsets, and so forth. (Note that the Apple iPhone does
not report its capabilities.) Save the file and produce a report listing the devices and Bluetooth
services you were able to identify.
BlueSweep may prove useful in a field technical support situation. Be sure to consult the
documentation, which is provided with BlueSweep. Write a one-page report outlining how
you could use BlueSweep to assist you in the field in solving a connectivity or service avail-
ability problem for a customer.

In Chapter 5, you learned about two low-rate wireless personal area network
(WPAN) technologies—Bluetooth and ZigBee—that meet the market need for relatively
low-speed communications. In this chapter, you learn about standards and technologies
(some of which are still under development) that make it possible for businesses and home
users to deploy entertainment systems that deliver wireless video, voice, and music through-
out an office or home. These high-rate (meaning high data rate or HR) networks are capable
of transferring data between computers and peripherals at speeds ranging from 1 to
28 Gbps, which makes them ideal to handle multiple instances of audio, video, and data.
This means that, over an HR WPAN, two people can be watching different movies while
another listens to high-quality music and yet another accesses the Internet.
The success of these HR wireless technologies depends on which and how many manufac-
turers adopt them. Currently, consumer electronic equipment (digital and high-definition
television, game consoles, and surround sound systems) is leading the way. The first HR
wireless devices became available in 2010, but the competition among the various specifi-
cations, the development of 802.11n, and the upcoming Gigabit wireless standards from
the IEEE, coupled with delays by licensing authorities in some countries releasing parts
of the RF spectrum required to support these technologies, have affected the speed
of development.
High-Rate WPAN Standards
The IEEE had discontinued work on the original 802.15.3 standard for HR WPANs due to
lack of agreement on which modulation and coding system to use. In 2005, it ratified
802.15.3b; in 2009, it released the 802.15.3c amendment as well as the 802.15.5 standard
for mesh networking.
The IEEE Project 802.15 covers all the different Working Groups for
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs), including the 802.15.1
Bluetooth and 802.15.4 PHY and MAC layers.
IEEE 802.15.3c enables multimedia connectivity between mobile and fixed consumer devices
within the home. More than 200 wireless devices compatible with this standard can be linked
using low-cost and low-power radio modules. One organization, the WirelessHD Consortium,
created a specification based on IEEE 802.15.3c for a wireless digital interface that can com-
bine the transmission of HD video, multichannel audio, and data for the purpose of multime-
dia streaming in the 60 GHz frequency band. The consortium’s specification also supports
intelligent formatting of the multimedia streams as well as content protection that is approved
by the media producers. Two other specifications have been introduced for HR WPANs that
do not use 802.15.3c:
●
WirelessHD from the WHDI (Wireless Home Digital Interface) Consortium. This
consortium was founded by AMIMON (an integrated circuit design company),
Hitachi, Motorola, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, and LG.
●
The WiGig specification (developed by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance), which is
designed to work with the 802.11ac (Gigabit WLANs) standard and can use the
202

2.4 and 5 GHz frequency bands as well as 802.11ad (multi-gigabit WLANs) in the
60 GHz frequency band.
You have already learned about Bluetooth and ZigBee WPANs. Why is there yet another
WPAN technology? The answer is simple: Although 802.11 and Bluetooth include MAC and
PHY layer optimizations for transmitting multimedia signals, no previous wireless standard
has been developed exclusively for multimedia to allow the delivery of uncompressed video
and audio data, resulting in a better experience for the users. Most of today’s technologies
support the transmission of this type of digitized and compressed data, which means that the
receiving device must be able to expand the data before displaying it on a screen or playing
the audio through the speakers in a stereo system. MP3 (Moving Picture Experts Group
Audio Layer III), which was made popular by the introduction of music players like the iPod,
is a good example of a device that decodes and expands (decompresses) the digital audio files
and attempts to reproduce the sound. It is important to consider that whenever video and
audio is compressed in any way, the process introduces losses that reduce the quality of the
movie or sound. This is the main reason why the three just-mentioned organizations created
specifications for wireless transmission of uncompressed data, which requires a lot more band-
width than any other types of digital data and helps reduce (or completely eliminates) the need
for cables while maintaining exceptional multimedia reproduction quality.
Potential HR WPAN applications include:
●
Connecting digital cameras to printers and kiosks
●
Connecting laptop computers to multimedia projectors and sound systems
●
Connecting camera-equipped cellular phones and PDAs to laptops and printers
●
Connecting speakers in a surround sound system to amplifiers and FM receivers
●
Linking multiple display monitors (including tablets, computers, and TVs) for
simultaneous video distribution
●
Distributing video signals from a cable, satellite, or IP over phone line receivers to
television sets throughout the house
●
Sending high-quality sound to wireless headphones or speakers from CD or
MP3 players
●
Photographing yourself with mobile remote viewfinders for video or digital still
cameras
These applications, whether for consumer electronics or for professional use, all share a set of
common requirements:
●
High throughput, typically a minimum of 20 Mbps, to support video and
multichannel, high-quality audio
●
Low-power transceivers so they can be used in handheld, mobile, battery-powered
devices
●
Low cost to allow manufacturers to implement wireless communications features
without a significant increase in the end-user price of the devices
●
Quality-of-service (QoS) capabilities, which allow devices to request more channel
access time in order to prioritize high-volume, time-sensitive traffic, such as voice
streams

●
Simple and automatic connections, eliminating the need for technical knowledge to set
up the systems

and performance and therefore connect automatically for the specified purposes
●
Security features included to prevent intrusion
●
Data access, which enables devices to be connected to the Internet and, for example,
allows the use of digital televisions as wireless computer displays
Networking Audio, Video, and Other I/O Devices
Each of the three organizations working on protocols for audio and video distribution has
defined different network and RF architectures. Manufacturers of both consumer electronic
devices and computers currently support most (if not all) of these three standards, and some
have already introduced products that incorporate these specifications.
You can find additional information about these three organizations,
the manufacturers that support them, and the available products by
visiting their Web sites (www.wirelesshd.org, www.wigig.org, or
www.whdi.org) and clicking the News or Products links.
Wireless Home Digital Interface (WHDI) The WHDI Consortium developed
the WHDI specification primarily for the delivery of uncompressed video and audio with
the same high resolution obtainable with a cable connection. The specification is designed
to simply and effectively mirror the screens of multiple devices to the TV screen without the
use of cables. This mirroring of screens means that video can be displayed on the small
screen of a mobile device, for example, while simultaneously displaying on an HD television
screen at full resolution. This is in addition to being able to display a video stream from a
Blu-ray player on both a mobile device as well as on the HD television set, all without
using a single piece of wire to interconnect the devices. Audio is, of course, an important
part of this equation. WHDI works in the 5 GHz frequency band and is designed to coexist
with 802.11a and 802.11n, as well as 5.8 GHz cordless phones, without causing interference.
The 5 GHz frequency band also allows WHDI to have a maximum range of approximately
100 ft. (30 meters) and to penetrate walls.
What this means is that WHDI can deliver media to a TV screen from a Blu-ray disk player
directly, or video stored and delivered from a computer or similar data device that usually
requires the use of compression decoding software (CODEC). Using Internet streaming ser-
vices like Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube, for example, typically requires specialized software
(YouTube requires Adobe Flash Player) that can decompress the video stream files.
Although some current television sets are equipped with Wi-Fi interfaces and can already
display multiple types of media, they often demand regular software updates, because of
the wide variety of video-encoding methods, which can add another level of complexity for
end-users. One alternative is to use specialized hardware devices (such as Western Digital
WDTV Live) that can decode many different types of video streams; however, this means
that additional devices and cables need to be connected to each television set, and software
updates are also still required.

WHDI aims to eliminate these complexities by using the TV set as a display-only device,
freeing the user to display any content he wishes on his TV set. In this case, the computer,
tablet, mobile phone, or any other device capable of playing video decodes the files, which
also reduces or completely eliminates the need for multiple cable connections. The responsi-
bility for handling different video or audio compression methods remains with the device
that is playing the files, minimizing complexity and compatibility issues with the TV set or
stereo system.
WHDI interfaces do not require specialized software drivers installed on the data devices.
External adapters can be plugged into virtually any data device with an HDMI interface or
a USB-to-HDMI adapter. If the manufacturers of data devices incorporate WHDI interfaces
directly into their products, these devices will be able to interface directly with compatible
TV sets, and older sets can be upgraded with an external WHDI receiver to support multiple
input devices.
WHDI makes use of dedicated integrated circuits and proprietary technology designed by
AMIMON and supports the latest versions of the HDMI specification, including copy-
protection schemes. The proprietary nature of these interfaces and their communication
protocol means that typically very little wireless troubleshooting can or needs to be done.
Detailed information about this is typically only available to members of the WHDI
Consortium, such as TV and interface manufacturers. The fact that WHDI is not an
open standard may result in limited options for users, but the concept appears to be both
valid and sound.
External HDMI interfaces are available and can be connected to
virtually any data device equipped with a USB 2.0 interface. HDMI
adapters are also available for Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, and
other brands of smartphones, which makes it easy to interface these
with a WHDI-equipped TV set.
A discussion of HDMI is beyond the scope of this book. For more
information, visit the HDMI Forum at www.hdmi.org.
Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) Architecture The WiGig specification is unique in the
sense that it is designed to be compatible with the IEEE 802.11n standard as well as
the 802.11ac standard. It will also support 802.11ad in the 60 GHz band, in which there is
far more spectrum available than in the other two bands, although the amount of available
spectrum varies depending on the country. The specification calls for WiGig to be able to
switch seamlessly between the different frequency bands used by each of the IEEE standards
as well.
WiGig also defines protocol adaptation layers (PALs) that enable it to directly support
audiovisual (A/V) display standards such as HDMI and I/O (USB and PCIe) at the PHY
and MAC layers, bypassing higher-layer WLAN protocols such as TCP and IP. Figure 6-1
shows a simplified diagram of the WiGig protocol stack.

The WiGig Alliance recently announced that the IEEE intends to include the MAC and PHY
enhancement layers in the 802.11ad standard. This will allow these layers to be implemen-
ted in hardware, enabling peer-to-peer connections between data and display devices when
using WiGig for A/V, thereby reducing complexity for end-users. Keep in mind that the
60 GHz band is only suitable for short-range connections—up to a maximum of 33 ft.
(10 meters)—due to the signal attenuation at the high frequencies, where even oxygen mole-
cules in the air can significantly decrease RF signal strength.
To maintain reliable connections at the higher frequencies, WiGig makes extensive use of
beamforming, a technique that enables the transmitting device to use multiple radios and
multiple antennas to maximize the signal amplitude at the receiver location. Beamforming
is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
In addition to supporting the existing Wi-Fi modulation schemes in the lower frequency
bands, WiGig supports two types of modulation and coding schemes that offer high-
transmission speeds in the 60 GHZ frequency band:
●
Single-carrier modulation, which is similar to 802.11b. It uses less power, so it is more
suitable for mobile devices; it can also achieve speeds of up to 4.6 Gbps.
●
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which supports longer distances
due to its ability to handle signal reflections and use obstacles such as walls as signal
reflectors to help keep devices connected. Using OFDM, WiGig can achieve
transmission speeds of up to 7 Gbps.
WiGig also specifies support for advanced security that can be implemented directly in hard-
ware using a highly efficient protocol. This is particularly important in business networks
where WiGig can use standard enterprise security mechanisms and still maintain strong
security at very high speeds in peer-to-peer A/V connections. A new scheduled access mode
allows devices to save power by using it based on the amount of traffic they handle.

WirelessHD and IEEE 802.15.3c As mentioned before, the WirelessHD Consortium
is currently the only organization that has adopted the 802.15.3c amendment to the IEEE
standard for multimedia distribution. This is also the only standard for which reasonably
full documentation is publicly available at the moment, both from the IEEE as well as from
the consortium. Access to the other two specifications previously discussed is restricted to
individual members of the consortium and member companies. As with WHDI, consumer
products that incorporate WirelessHD technology are already available from leading manu-
facturers. It is best to check the WHDI Web site for additional information regarding these
products, because availability can change frequently as manufacturers decide to incorporate
WHDI. Visit www.wirelesshd.org and click on the Consumers/Product Listing link.
Keep in mind that the 803.15.3c amendment refers only to implementation in the 60 GHz
band, and even though the original 802.15.3 standard includes support for the ISM band,
WirelessHD does not support transmission in the lower frequency bands. However, it does
support devices transmitting at many different speeds in order to allow battery-powered
devices—such as mobile phones and tablets—to conserve power.
Table 6-1 shows the range of transmission speeds and typical applications supported by
WirelessHD. Note that Table 6-1 shows only a small subsection of the supported combina-
tions of data rates.

A source device is the one that transmits the A/V or data, whereas a sink device is the receiver.
The receiver may not necessarily be a display or audio device; it may be a recording device
instead. The table shows cases in which either the video or audio stream is compressed before
transmission, as well as cases where the video stream is compressed but not the audio stream.
In addition, consider that some video streams contain embedded audio, whereas others do not.
WirelessHD supports the following video resolutions and transmission speeds:
●
Uncompressed video at 2560  1440 resolution and a transmission speed of 8.0 Gbps
●
Uncompressed 3-D video at 720p (1280  1440) at 4.0 Gbps
●
Uncompressed 1080p video at 1080p (1920  1080) at 7.5 Gbps
●
File transfers at speeds greater than 1.0 Gbps
●
Several other combinations of compressed and uncompressed audio and video transmissions
The WirelessHD specification divides the PHY layer into three sections:
●
Low-Rate PHY (LRP)—supports data rates of 2.5 to 40 Mbps
●
High-Rate PHY (HRP)—supports data rates of up to 7 Gbps and over 25 Gbps when
using spatial multiplexing, which is a technique that divides the data frame into multiple
parts and transmits each part of the same data frame using a separate radio and antenna,
effectively increasing the transmission rate by sending the data in parallel.
●
High-or-Medium-Rate PHY (HMRP)—supports data rates of 476 Mbps to 2 Gbps
WirelessHD simultaneously supports USB version 2.0 or 3.0 links with multiple devices con-
nected to a hub, as well as HDMI, enabling wireless connection of a large variety of existing
computer and other mobile devices and peripherals.
Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets can process, decode, and display some com-
pressed video and audio streams but do not currently support HRP, primarily because they
need to conserve battery power. This is why WirelessHD-compatible devices need to be
capable of supporting multiple data rates for different devices simultaneously. In addition,
WirelessHD is able to support devices that have multiple radios and antennas and can
make use of beamforming to provide both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight transmissions.
Coverage of video resolution is beyond the scope of this book. The
information provided here is intended to show the capabilities of
WirelessHD and 802.15.3c in the 60 GHz frequency band. More
details are available in the WirelessHD overview document available
from the WirelessHD Consortium Web site at www.wirelessHD.org.
Beamforming uses multiple radios and antennas to steer a signal in the direction of the
receiver. If an object blocks the direct signal between the transmitter and receiver so that
they can no longer communicate, the transmitter can steer the beam in a different direction
so that the signal reflects and still reaches the receiver with enough strength to be decoded
correctly. Beamforming takes advantage of multipath reflections—instead of allowing multi-
path to degrade the quality of the signal—to create what is called constructive interference.
By varying the phase and amplitude of the same signal sent via multiple radios, the transmit-
ter is able to create an effective amplitude increase at the location of the intended receiver.
The concept is similar to how a phased-array antenna directs the signal, but in this case it
requires the transmitter to track the location of the intended receiver. Figure 6-2 shows a

WirelessHD and 802.15.3 MAC layer Devices connect to a WirelessHD network by
first associating with the piconet coordinator. PNCs are usually an audio or video sink
device—such as an HD television—but can also be a personal video recorder. The coordina-
tor also acts as a station on what the specification calls the wireless video area network
(WVAN). Mobile devices are not able to become coordinators in a WPAN, let alone a
WVAN, because they may move out of the area and also because, being powered by batter-
ies, they may be turned off or go into power-save mode frequently. The piconet coordinator
should be a device that is plugged into an electric outlet. Figure 6-4 shows an example of a
WVAN topology.
The first sink device in an area assumes the role of piconet coordinator (PNC), which is the
device that provides all the basic communications timing in a piconet. To do this, the PNC
sends a beacon. Recall that a beacon is a frame containing information about the piconet,
such as the piconet’s unique identification. The beacon also indicates when devices are
allowed to transmit and for how long. The piconet is peer-to-peer, and devices can transmit
data directly to each other, but they can only do so based on the timing instructions sent in
the beacon by the PNC.
The PNC is also responsible for managing QoS, which is necessary for audio transmissions
because breaks or interruptions in a voice conversation or in music are unacceptable to
users. A small number of breaks can usually be tolerated in video transmissions (a few
dropped frames per second). Because the PNC may be turned off, the standard provides for
the PNC to hand over control of the piconet to another device, which will become the new
PNC. Remember that the PNC is almost always a stationary device, such as a TV or a
Blu-ray player. Figure 6-5 shows an 802.15.3 topology with the PNC sending the beacons.

There are two other kinds of piconets that can be formed in the 802.15.3c standard. These are
called dependent piconets because they are dependent on the PNC of the original or parent piconet:
●
A child piconet is a piconet that is separate from the original piconet. A child piconet has
its own piconet ID, but the child PNC is a member of the original or parent piconet. The
child piconet’s PNC can exchange data with any member of the parent or child piconet.
●
A neighbor piconet is a separate piconet that has its own PNC but depends on the
original piconet’s PNC to allocate a private block of time when its devices are allowed
to transmit. This is done in order to share the frequency spectrum between one or
more piconets when there are no other available channels for communication.
Both child and neighbor piconets are useful for extending the coverage of a piconet or for
shifting some processing or storage requirements to another device. A piconet can have one
or more child piconets. A device in the parent piconet can reach a device in the child piconet
by using the child PNC to retransmit the frames directed at the device in the child piconet.
A child piconet can also share the same frequency channel as the parent PNC but use a dif-
ferent security key. This situation may happen when a friend comes to visit you and brings
along her own gaming or music devices that both of you want to use but you want to keep

your own piconet’s security key private. This may also happen when you purchase and
install a new music system that comes preconfigured as a network consisting of the speakers
and the player; these new devices may use their own preconfigured security key.
Neighbor piconets exist mainly to allow coexistence with other piconets in the same area.
The parent piconet will only allow the formation of a neighbor piconet if there is sufficient
free channel time available. If a set of devices cannot use the security features of the parent
piconet, these devices can still function in the same area and share the same frequency chan-
nel without causing collisions, by becoming a neighbor piconet. Figure 6-6 illustrates the
concept of a child piconet, and Figure 6-7 shows a neighbor piconet.

Additional 802.15.3 MAC Layer Functionality The IEEE 802.15.3 MAC layer is
designed to support the following HR WPAN features:
●
Connection time (association) is fast, with no complicated setup.
●
Devices associated with the piconet can use a short, one-octet device ID to ensure fast
connection and access times.
●
Devices can obtain information about the capabilities of other devices either during the
association process, through broadcasts made by the PNC, or by querying the PNC
about another device. Devices can also advertise their own capabilities to the PNC.
The simplicity of this process is what guarantees fast connection times.
●
Peer-to-peer (ad hoc) networking allows all devices to communicate directly with
each other.
●
Data transport with QoS enables the implementation of voice, music, and video.
●
Security (covered in the last section of this chapter) is included to ensure privacy.
●
Efficient data transfer allows multiple devices to communicate on the same network.
In 802.15.3 networks, efficient data transfer is accomplished using superframes, which func-
tion differently than those used in ZigBee networks, as shown in Figure 6-8.
Each 802.15.3 superframe is composed of three parts:
●
A beacon, which is used to set time allocations for the devices in the piconet and to
communicate management information for the piconet.
●
An optional contention access period (CAP), which is used for association, for
command communication, or for any asynchronous data that may be present in
the superframe.
●
The channel time allocation period (CTAP). The CTAP includes channel time
allocations (CTAs), which are time slots that the PNC allocates to individual devices
and which can be used to send commands or data. The CTAP may also include

management channel time allocation (MCTA) periods, used for communications
between the PNC and devices that don’t have CTAs allocated in the current superframe.
Communication in an 802.15.3 piconet is generally accomplished as follows:
●
The beacon frame sent by the PNC includes a variable indicating the end of the CAP.
No device—not even the PNC—is allowed to transmit data that can extend past the
end of the CAP, into the CTAP. This procedure ensures that all devices have an
opportunity to communicate, and it prevents collisions.
●
Devices send asynchronous data during the CAP, if it exists in the current superframe. The
CAP is not allocated, so devices contend for the time using CSMA/CA (refer to Chapter
5). In addition, during the CAP, each device is only allowed to transmit one frame.
●
Devices request channel time on a regular basis (such as every superframe or every
two or four superframes) in the CTAP from the PNC. The amount of channel
time a device requests depends on the type of data the device wants to transmit.
The requested channel time is called isochronous time, which means a time-dependent
or synchronous transmission that must be made every frame or every so many frames
to maintain the quality of the connection. Voice and music demand more channel
time than video. Video demands more channel time than data files.
●
Devices also request channel time for asynchronous communications in the CTAP
from the PNC. Asynchronous communications are used to send large data files. Unlike
with voice streams, delays or interruptions do not affect the quality of data file
transmissions; therefore, large blocks of data are sent asynchronously.
●
During the CTAP, communications use a time division multiple access (TDMA)
scheme, in which each device gets a window of time to transmit data or commands.
Time in a piconet is allocated in units of 1 microsecond. The minimum superframe
duration is 1000 microseconds or 1 millisecond, and the maximum duration is 65,535
microseconds or 65.5 milliseconds. The PNC may allocate CTAs of any size to a
device, provided the maximum duration of the superframe is not exceeded. Recall that
CAPs are optional, so a device may get an allocation that is very large, allowing for
the transmission of large blocks of information. In addition, a device may request a
change in time allocation from the PNC at any time, or give up its time allocation
when it no longer needs to transmit.
Child and neighbor piconets operate in the same frequency channel and must follow the
same timing parameters established by the PNC. The WirelessHD specification extends
the capabilities of 802.15.3 by allowing the formation of a drone WVAN (D-WVAN).
A D-WVAN is temporarily established in a different frequency channel, and its purpose
is to accommodate more connections that are possible in a WVAN when there are no
more CTAPs available in the parent or home WVAN (H-WVAN). The D-WVAN func-
tions as an autonomous WVAN, except that the D-WVAN coordinator must maintain a
connection to the H-WVAN PNC. D-WVANs use a different connection ID between
devices that indicates the piconet is not the H-WVAN. The process of establishing a
D-WVAN is as follows:
●
An originator device sends a request to a target to form a D-WVAN.
●
If the request is accepted, the target device must send a request to the H-WVAN
coordinator.
214
Chapter 6

●
If the request is granted, the D-WVAN PNC notifies the H-WVAN PCN that it will
enter into a power-save mode (discussed in the next section) and then begins searching
for an available frequency channel.
●
If an available channel is found, the target device sends a request to enter into drone
mode to the H-WVAN PNC.
●
Once the request is granted, the D-WVAN PNC switches to the new frequency channel
and begins sending beacons as the D-WVAN coordinator.
●
When the originator device detects that the target has switched to drone mode—when
the H-WVAN coordinator grants the request—it may switch to the same channel as
the D-WVAN PNC and attempt to associate with it.
General 802.15.3 MAC Frame Format This section presents an overview of the
MAC frame format. All MAC frames include a set of fields that are present in the same
order in every frame. These are shown in Figure 6-9.
In any device, the MAC layer must be able to verify that the data
was received without error. The frame check sequence (FCS) field
that is present in every MAC frame is responsible for this validation.
However, before the PHY passes the frame to the MAC, it checks to
make sure the MAC header was received without errors by using the
header check sequence (HCS) field.
The frame control field contains information about the protocol version, type of frame,
whether it is encrypted, how the receiving device should acknowledge it, whether this is a
retransmission of a previously sent frame, and whether the data ends with this frame or
more data is to follow. The piconet ID (PNID) field contains a unique identifier for each pic-
onet and confirms that the frames were sent by devices belonging to a specific piconet. The
destination and source ID fields contain the unique piconet device identifiers for the sender
and receiver. The fragmentation control field is used to assist in the fragmentation and reas-
sembly, in the correct sequence, of parts of a large block of data, such as an MP3 file.
It contains the number of the current fragment, the number of the last fragment for this

data stream, and a frame number. If a frame is lost, the receiving device can request that the
transmitting device resend the fragment so that it will be able to reassemble the complete
file. The stream index field is used for managing and uniquely identifying different asynchro-
nous and isochronous streams.
The MAC frame payload is a variable length field that carries the actual information to be
transferred between two devices or between one device and a group of devices (multicast or
broadcast). The frame check sequence (FCS) is a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) field,
a common technique for detecting transmission errors.
The general MAC frame format can vary, but the MAC header is standard for all transmis-
sions. The frame body changes to accommodate the different types of payload and the infor-
mation required in each one. Unlike Bluetooth and 802.11 WLANs, the MAC is implemen-
ted in the hardware of the radio module. This minimizes or eliminates most aspects of
configuration of the equipment by consumers.
Power Management
One of the best methods for enabling 802.15.3 devices to user power efficiently is to allow
the devices to turn off completely or at least reduce power consumption for long periods of
time, but without losing their association with the piconet. Doing so for a period equal to
the duration of one or more superframes results in a significant power reduction for WPAN
devices. The 802.15.3 standard provides for three different power-saving methods:
●
Device synchronized power save (DSPS)—This mode allows devices to sleep for the
duration of several superframes but allows them to wake up in the middle of a
superframe to transmit or receive data. Other devices in the piconet are informed
about which devices in a group (called a DSPS set) are in this mode and when they will
awake and be able to receive or transmit data.
●
Piconet synchronized power save (PSPS)—This mode allows devices to sleep during
intervals defined by the PNC. The PNC selects beacons to serve as system-wide wake
beacons and indicates the next one to occur in the beacon fields. All devices in PSPS
mode are required to wake up and listen to the wake beacons.
●
Asynchronous power save (APS)—This mode allows the devices to sleep for long
periods of time until they choose to wake up and listen to a beacon. A device in APS
mode must communicate with the PNC before the end of its association time-out
period (ATP) in order to maintain its membership in the piconet.
The PNC will always allocate asynchronous CTAs to destination devices that will be in
DSPS or PSPS mode in the wake superframe. The wake superframe is the superframe desig-
nated by the PNC in which devices that are in power-saving mode wake up and listen for
frames addressed to them. Of course, a device that does not rely on battery power, such as
a DVD player or sound amplifier, can remain in active mode all the time. Regardless of
which power-saving mode a device is in, all devices are allowed to power down during the
parts of the superframe when they are not scheduled to transmit or receive. Figure 6-10
illustrates the wake beacons.
Two additional methods can help devices save power. In the first method, the PNC can set a max-
imum transmit power level for associated devices (this feature is not mandatory in the standard,
so not all devices may implement it). This method also allows the PNC to save power because
the quality of the link between the PNC and other devices defines the coverage area of the

piconet. The second method allows devices to request a reduction or an increase in their own
transmit power, as long as the device knows that it can maintain a good link with another device.
802.15.3c PHY Layer
As you know, the PHY layer is responsible for converting data bits into the modulated
RF signal that is transmitted over electromagnetic waves. IEEE 802.15.3c is the only stan-
dard defined in the WirelessHD specification. It is an extremely complex standard that could
justify an entire textbook on its own. This textbook covers only the basics of this standard.
If you wish to learn more about 802.15.3c, you can download a copy of the standard
from http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.15.html. The 802.15.3c standard uses the
60 GHz band and supports the channel plan, as shown in Table 6-2.
Note that there are only four channels and that each is approximately 2 GHz wide. Not
all countries permit the entire 60 GHz band to be utilized, which may reduce the number of
channels available in some parts of the world, but the center portion of the band contains
sufficient overlap of frequencies to allow at least two or three channels. Channel aggregation—
combining multiple adjacent channels—in order to transmit data faster is also covered in the

standard; in combination with spatial multiplexing, it is what enables transmission at data rates
that exceed 25 Mbps. The PHY layer in 802.15.3c includes a number of enhancements, some of
which are optional:
●
Passive scanning—Each device scans the channels to detect an existing piconet before
joining or starting a new one. The first device to be turned on in an area scans the
frequencies to find a channel that is not being used.
●
Channel energy detection—This allows stations to detect frequency and signal strength
before joining a piconet, without decoding the data.
●
Ability to request channel quality information—An 802.15.3 device can probe the
channel or request channel quality information from other devices and then make a
decision about which modulation and channel coding to use for communicating with
another device. If remote devices cannot use the current modulation (because of
interference, for example), the controlling device can change the modulation and
coding to ensure reliable communications.
●
Link quality and received signal strength indication—An 802.15.3c device can request
link quality information between itself and other devices. It also monitors the strength
of the received signal from other devices, which is important for power management.
●
Transmit power control—Upon receiving information about the channel quality and
link quality, devices may be able to decrease or increase the transmit power to improve
the quality of the link and the received signal.
●
Neighbor and child piconet capability—The 802.15.3 standard allows the formation
of dependent piconets in the same area; these piconets rely on the device that
controls the original piconet to allocate channel time for communications. This
feature permits multiple piconets to exist in the same area.
●
Two modes of superframe transmission—When using omnidirectional transmission, the
superframe is sent only once to all stations. When using beamforming, the superframe is
transmitted multiple times in the direction of each station, in a round-robin fashion.
●
Maximum data frame length of 8,388,608 octets—This helps maximize throughput.
The 802.15.3 standard defines multiple data rates that are dependent on the modulation and
coding scheme employed, the spreading factor (dependent on the length of the chipping code),
and the forward error correction (FEC) method. FEC saves time because it avoids retransmis-
sion of the data when errors occur. FEC can correct single-bit errors in a group of data bits.
There is always a trade-off between FEC and speed of transmission.
The more reliable the FEC technique, the more bits that need to be
transmitted and the slower the resulting data rate. Coverage of FEC
is an advanced topic that is outside of the scope of this textbook.
Modulation The RF modulation techniques used for each data rate in 802.15.3c are var-
iations of BPSK and QPSK modulation techniques that you learned about in Chapter 2. All
devices are required to transmit the headers using LRP. The WirelessHD specification
requires that all devices support LRP but not necessarily HRP or MRP. Once the devices
associate with the coordinator, they will inform other devices on the WVAN which other
data rates and modulations they can support. Devices will also suggest to the transmitter
which parameters—such as modulation and data rate—to use for subsequent transmissions,
depending on the quality of the signal received.

IEEE 802.15.3c operates in the 57–66 GHz unlicensed band—generally called the 60 GHz
band—where there is far more bandwidth available than in all the other unlicensed bands
combined. This should enable WirelessHD to coexist with other systems using the same band
while minimizing or eliminating the possibility of interference. The 802.15.3c standard covers
the use of single carrier for LRP, and it covers the use of OFDM encoding for HRP and MRP.

Mesh Networking (802.15.5)
IEEE 802.15.5 is a standard for mesh networking, in which each device connects to all other
devices within range, effectively creating multiple paths for transmission. Recall that the con-
cept of mesh networking is integrated into the 802.15.4 (ZigBee) standard. IEEE 802.15.5 is
a separate standard that applies to 802.15.3, although the idea is basically the same. Mesh
networking can enable WPANs to cover an entire building. Figure 6-11 shows an example
of a network using mesh technology.
Ultra Wide Band (UWB)
Ultra wide band (UWB) offers a promising solution to the shortage of available frequencies in
the RF spectrum; it allows new transmission techniques based on UWB to coexist with other
RF systems, with minimal or no interference. UWB is not really a new technology. It has been
used in radar since the 1960s and is a very established technology for ground-penetrating
radar. Ground-penetrating radar is used to locate pipes, wires, and objects buried under
roads and fields, among other applications.
What is new in UWB is its application to wireless data transmission. Because of its ability to
achieve very high data rates, UWB is capable of handling multiple streams, including high-
definition and 3-D television, with a quality level equivalent to that of a wired system, albeit
at short ranges. It may start out as a wireless PAN solution, but industry experts and analysts
have been predicting that, with the addition of mesh networking, UWB can expand to full
home and business networking use as well.
The FCC currently allows UWB transmitters to operate in the
3.1–10.6 GHz range at limited power levels of –41 dBm/MHz
(approximately 75 nanowatts of power for each MHz of bandwidth),
which minimizes interference.

For data applications, UWB has the following characteristics:
●
Unlike ground-penetrating radar, it transmits low-power, short-range signals within an
enclosed area such as a home or office.
●
It transmits using extremely short low-power pulses lasting only about 1 nanosecond
or even shorter. These pulses cannot be easily detected by other analog RF equipment;
therefore, UWB transmissions do not cause significant interference to other signals.
●
UWB transmits over a band that is at least 500 MHz wide, as required by the FCC; such a
band helps prevent interference with other RF transmission technologies in current use.
How UWB Works
This section discusses the core UWB RF transmission technique. Note that there is no discus-
sion of the MAC layer. That is because changing the RF layer does not require changes to any
other layers, so the MAC layer and all other higher-layer protocols can remain the same.
UWB PHY Layer In Chapter 2, you learned that in traditional RF data transmission, a
digital signal is modulated over an analog signal using amplitude, frequency, phase, or a
combination of amplitude and phase (for example, 64-QAM). In addition, recall that in
order to spread the signal over a wide band and allow for better error detection and correc-
tion, digital signals are transmitted using a technique such as frequency hopping spread
spectrum (FHSS) or direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). In FHSS, signals are transmit-
ted in each of several frequencies for very short periods of time (625 microseconds for Blue-
tooth). In DSSS, the spreading also has the effect of dividing the signal amplitude across the
frequency band, which helps reduce interference.
UWB, on the other hand, is a digital transmission technology. It uses short analog pulses for
signaling and does not have to rely on traditional modulation methods. In UWB, this tech-
nique is called impulse modulation, in which the amplitude, the polarity, or the position of
an analog pulse represents either a 1 or a 0. Figure 6-12 illustrates the concept of impulse
modulation and compares it with frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation.

UWB signals can be transmitted using fairly simple techniques by very simple transmitter
circuits. Several different types of modulation can be used in UWB, but the most common
is biphase modulation, which uses a half-cycle positive analog pulse to represent a 1 and a
half-cycle negative analog pulse to represent a 0. This kind of modulation is virtually
immune to background RF noise and does not cause interference. Biphase modulation
requires circuits with two separate transmitter circuits (one to generate positive pulses and
one for negative pulses), which makes it more expensive. The concept of biphase modulation
is shown in the lower-left part of Figure 6-12.
In addition to the modulation schemes just mentioned, several UWB transmission techniques
have been proposed to the IEEE using both direct sequence and multiband orthogonal fre-
quency division multiplexing. Direct-sequence UWB (DS-UWB) takes advantage of the fact
that one of the effects of transmitting pulses a nanosecond long—or even shorter—is that
the signal naturally spreads over a very wide frequency band without using any spreading
codes. In the UWB case, the signal spreads over a band that is at least 500 MHz wide in the
high-frequency bands used for this technology. This also spreads the amplitude of the signal
across the entire band; as a result, the entire pulse falls below the level of the background
noise. Figure 6-13 shows an example of what happens in the frequency domain when a
1-nanosecond pulse is transmitted.
The other method proposed to the IEEE, multiband orthogonal frequency division multi-
plexing (MB-OFDM), is based on the technique used for 802.11g and 802.11a WLAN
transmissions (you will learn more about these in Chapter 8). In MB-OFDM, the total band-
width available is divided into five groups containing a total of 14 frequency bands, as
shown in Table 6-4.

Each frequency band is 528 MHz wide, which meets FCC requirements, and is further
divided into 128 frequency channels. These channels are orthogonal, meaning that they
do not interfere with one another. Several data bits are then sent simultaneously (in par-
allel), one bit over each of these sub-channels, at a low bit rate per channel. Only 122
out of the 128 channels are used for MB-OFDM transmission. Because several data bits
are being sent at the same time, each on a different frequency, OFDM can still achieve
high data rates by sending the data bits at a slower rate. This technique is comparable
to a parallel printer cable that uses one wire for each bit sent to the printer and there-
fore transfers one byte at a time. MB-OFDM transmits using pulses that are slightly lon-
ger than DS-UWB, at 312 nanoseconds long. Although these longer pulses are easier to
generate with electronic circuits, critics claim that MB-OFDM makes the transmitters
very complex.
Although UWB offers many advantages, several manufacturers have all but abandoned
plans to implement UWB, primarily because of the strong interest in the 60 GHz band.
So far, wireless USB is the only technology that has been implemented using UWB, and
it has not enjoyed great success. The cost of wireless USB has yet to drop to a level
where it would be justifiable, except for aesthetic reasons, to replace a 6-ft. (1.8 meters)
cable priced at less than $10.00 with a wireless USB connection currently still costing
around $200.00. In addition, the advent of USB version 3.0, which can reach speeds of
up to 5 Gbps, and Thunderbolt, developed by Intel and introduced by Apple under a
technical collaboration agreement, has further reduced interest from manufacturers in
pursuing UWB.

WPAN Challenges
Now that you have explored several WPAN technologies, we will discuss some of the chal-
lenges faced by WPAN technologies. Because the ZigBee specification is specifically designed
to support devices that only transmit very small amounts of data, at low data rates, most of
this section will compare HR WPANs with Blueooth.
Competition Among WPAN Standards
For computer-to-computer and computer-to-handheld devices, you have learned about
802.15.1 Bluetooth and 802.15.3 standards and also how UWB may impact these technolo-
gies. Bluetooth products have become far more popular and are being used for many differ-
ent applications, but the technology is facing serious threats.
The technologies discussed in this chapter are positioned to compete with Bluetooth for mar-
ket share because HR WPANs are designed for higher data rates as well as for carrying other
types of traffic, such as HDMI and USB. Although it will take a few years before these pro-
ducts begin to ship in significant volume, WirelessHD, WiGig, and WHDI have the potential
to quickly outpace Bluetooth as a cable-replacement technology. If this happens, Bluetooth
may wind up only being used for connecting cellular phone headsets, keyboards, and mouse
devices, even though the Bluetooth SIG has released version 4.0 of its specifications, which
can achieve speeds of up to 24 Mbps and improved audio connections. For Bluetooth to
compete effectively, it will be necessary for manufacturers to incorporate the additional
radio required to support the higher rate. This fact alone may increase the cost of high-rate
Bluetooth above that of the other three technologies. It is not wise to try to predict which
technology will ultimately win this race, but it will be interesting to watch the developments
in the industry over the next few years.
WPAN Security
Although security should be less of an issue with WPANs than with traditional wired net-
works, given that most of the transmissions are restricted to a short range, hackers will go
to almost any length to break into devices and networks. This section discusses the security
models for Bluetooth, ZigBee, and 802.15.3c. WPAN technologies were discussed in the last
two chapters.
Security for Bluetooth Hackers are already using Bluetooth to attack mobile devices,
and Bluetooth security is becoming an issue. In bluejacking, hackers exploit a Bluetooth
device’s ability to discover nearby devices and send unsolicited messages. Another type of
attack is Bluesnarfing, which uses the same discovery ability to access contact lists and
other information without the user’s knowledge, provided the user has enabled the server
functions on his device. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which flood a Bluetooth device
with so many frames that it is unable to communicate, are another problem. In addition,
some Bluetooth devices may be vulnerable to Trojans, viruses, and worms.
These security risks extend well past PDAs and smartphones. Some laptops are shipped with
Bluetooth technology, potentially creating a backdoor into a company’s network when the
computer is connected to a LAN using Ethernet or an 802.11 WLAN. It is both easy and
inexpensive for a hacker to surreptitiously add a Bluetooth device to the network, thereby

taking advantage of an unsuspecting user’s devices. Because of their short-range, low-power
signal, devices can remain undetectable for a long period of time, especially when hidden
inside a case.
On the other hand, Bluetooth transmissions are not easy to capture and decode. Many
hackers are currently trying to develop a system to sniff Bluetooth packets and decode the
information, but so far this is proving to be a difficult challenge.
Security for ZigBee WPANs A system that is controlling the lighting and environ-
mental parameters for a building or home still requires some measure of security to prevent
intentional or unintentional changes in the settings. The ZigBee specification uses the con-
cept of a trust center, with the PNC (the trust center) being responsible for issuing the
encryption keys to all devices on the piconet. ZigBee uses a symmetric encryption key for
network-wide communications. A symmetric encryption key is a string of characters, num-
bers, or both that is used to encrypt the data within a frame. When all the devices in a single
network use the same key, it is called “symmetric.” There are two types of symmetric keys
used in ZigBee:
●
The network key is normally preprogrammed on each ZigBee node via any type of
available direct cable connection to the devices, which is more secure. It is also possible
to configure the devices so that only the PNC has this key preconfigured, distributing
the key over the wireless medium at installation time in plain text. This means that
there may be a temporary vulnerability in a ZigBee piconet until the key is distributed
to the devices. This also happens when a new device needs to join the piconet. After all
devices in the piconet have received the shared key from the PNC, all subsequent
communications between the PNC and devices will be encrypted using the network key.
●
Any two devices on the piconet can request a link key from the PNC to set up a secure
communications connection between them. The link key is based on the network key
and is generated and encrypted with the network key by the PNC before it is
distributed to the devices.
ZigBee link and network keys only apply to the application layer of the ZigBee protocol
stack. Potential ZigBee users have expressed serious concerns about the temporary vulnera-
bility just described, which can be easily exploited by attackers wishing to break into a
ZigBee piconet, perhaps just to prove that they can do it, perhaps to cause problems by
changing settings, or perhaps to collect information from ZigBee-based systems such as
smart power and gas meters. Utility companies in many countries now consider smart
meters a more effective way of collecting usage data and providing their customers with
information that enables them to better manage their energy usage.
In addition to symmetric encryption keys, ZigBee uses message integrity check and sequen-
tial freshness to enhance the security of piconets. Message integrity check is a process used
to prevent an attacker from modifying a message and resending it on a network. Message
integrity makes use of a check number that is generated and included in each frame by the
sender. At the receiver end, the number is generated again and compared with the one
received in the message. If the two numbers match, the message has not been tampered
with. Sequential freshness is the process of assigning a sequential number to each frame to
ensure that it is not transmitted more than once in the same piconet within a significant
period of time.

Without the use of these two security features, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle
attack by capturing frames, modifying them, and then retransmitting them on the same pic-
onet. When the target ZigBee devices respond to frames that they interpret as valid and
coming from an authorized device on the piconet, the attacker may be able to capture
enough information to help him decrypt the network, link keys, or both, thereby
compromising the security of the piconet. However, remember that the maximum size of a
ZigBee frame is 127 octets. This means that it would require a significant amount of frames
as well as a long period of time to capture enough frames to be able to crack the security
key(s). In addition, ZigBee devices use small, slow processors, which means that when
ZigBee devices are encrypting information before transmitting, the process of capturing
enough frames would take even longer.
Security for IEEE 802.15.3 HR WPANs Security for this standard is based on the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a symmetric key encryption mechanism introduced
by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States.
In 802.15.3, AES uses a 128-bit key. Its two security modes are:
●
Mode 0—Does not encrypt or protect the data in any way
●
Mode 1—Employs strong cryptography based on AES and supports the protection of
commands, beacons, and data frames as well as secure key distribution for command
and data frame protection
The standard defines how any two devices can establish a secure communications session to
protect both the information as well as the integrity of communications at the MAC and
PHY layers. The security key can be shared by all the devices in a piconet or by any two
devices. In 802.15.3, the key is 13 octets long and is based on a number of parameters,
such as the source and destination address, the current time token on the network, the
frame counter to ensure message integrity, and the value of the fragmentation control field.
This ensures that the key will be unique for each transaction, which makes it almost impos-
sible for a hacker to break. In addition, this standard provides a mechanism for changing or
rotating the symmetric key on a periodic basis. The new key is based on the one that was
initially entered by the user. Changing keys periodically makes it far more difficult for a
hacker to break the key and be able to decode the data.
The authentication key for the piconet is also changed periodically, or every time a device
leaves the piconet or stops responding to beacon frames. This new security implementation
is far superior to any of the previous methods employed by Bluetooth and 802.11 WLANs.
802.15.3 also supports message integrity check at the MAC layer. Message integrity check
adds certain encrypted random data to each communications session, in addition to a
frame counter, so that the receiver can verify that the message has not been tampered with
during transit or repeated. Without message integrity check, a would-be hacker could more
easily launch a man-in-the-middle attack against the piconet by capturing frames, altering
them, and retransmitting them to the intended receiver.
Cost of WPAN Components
Today, Bluetooth supports more devices than other WPAN technologies, but historically it
has suffered from the problem of component cost. Bluetooth radio modules originally cost
in excess of $75, however, the cost has decreased to around $5 in large quantities, which is
the reason behind the increased availability of Bluetooth in many different devices.
226

However, when you consider Bluetooth’s low transmission speed, it still does not make much
economic sense to use a chip that costs $5 to replace a cable that costs less than $10 but
can achieve much higher data rates. So far, the only advantage that Bluetooth has enjoyed
is the widespread availability of devices. The main challenge facing manufacturers of
802.15.3-compatible devices will be to ensure that the technology is incorporated into their
products without significantly increasing the cost for consumers and businesses.
Industry Support for WPAN Technologies
Industry experts predict that new technologies such as WirelessHD and ZigBee will be more
quickly embraced by manufacturers. ZigBee support is likely to come initially from qualified
installation technicians, which means that these devices will not likely suffer from the pro-
blems that have affected Bluetooth from its early days.
Protocol Functionality Limitations
One of the major limitations of the Bluetooth protocol is that slave devices are not designed
to move from one piconet to another without losing the connection to the master of the orig-
inal piconet. If a Bluetooth device moves beyond the communications range of each device
that controls the communications, it will disconnect from the piconet. Even if a Bluetooth
device immediately moves into the range of another piconet, and even if it is paired to both
masters, it will lose the connection to the first piconet. In cellular technology, for example,
the handsets are designed to switch from one cell or base station to the next as the user
drives down the road, without losing the connection to the cellular phone network. Devices
supporting multimedia technologies such as WirelessHD are able to remain connected to the
piconet provided that another device (or devices) can route (i.e., forward) frames across the
network. This allows a device to remain connected to the PNC and to other devices even
when they are not within RF direct communications range of the destination device. The
inability of most Bluetooth devices to route frames may prevent Bluetooth from being
adopted as a technology for cordless phones that need to roam throughout a house or office,
out of range of the piconet master.
Although Bluetooth devices can discover other Bluetooth devices in the area, they cannot
(at present) automatically determine how the functions of other devices can be used in a coopera-
tive setting. You may remember that Bluetooth devices only communicate with the piconet
master and cannot communicate directly with other slave devices. Messages in a scatternet,
for example, must be sent via the piconet masters and from there to the slave devices. This
implies that all devices in a piconet must remain within RF range of a master at all times and
that, in a scatternet, the two masters must be within RF communications range of each other.
These are concerns that Bluetooth needs to address if it is to compete with ZigBee and
WirelessHD, but this would mean a monumental change to the Bluetooth specification. Here
again, all the other technologies discussed in this chapter (and ZigBee) have a built-in advan-
tage because they can automatically identify the services and capabilities offered by other
devices in the piconet, even if these other devices are out of range of the piconet coordinator.
In addition, ZigBee and 802.15.3 devices can indeed communicate directly with each other.
Although there is no other major protocol limitation with any of the technologies discussed
in this chapter, it is important to realize that the drive in the industry is toward standardizing
the protocols as much as possible. In most cases, this will mean using TCP/IP at higher layers
and using one of the MAC and PHY protocols in lower layers.
WPAN Challenges

Spectrum Conflict
Of all of the issues with WPANs, spectrum conflict is the one that will potentially affect their
success in the market. Spectrum conflict is the potential for technologies using the same fre-
quency bands to interfere with one another to the extent that they sometimes perform poorly
when used within close range of one another. Applying UWB technology or using the
60 GHz band can significantly reduce or eliminate this issue, unlike what happens with
the limited bandwidth available for Wi-Fi networks.
For example, today’s 802.11b/g WLANs perform poorly in environments where a 2.4 GHz
cordless phone is also in use. This issue affects all the technologies that use FHSS and DSSS in
the same frequency band. To make their products more attractive and to avoid the technical
support issues related to spectrum conflict, manufacturers of cordless phones have been intro-
ducing models that transmit at 1.6 GHz instead, using the newer DECT 6.0 specification.
As noted previously, because Bluetooth uses the ISM 2.4 GHz band for its transmissions, it
can conflict with other technologies that use the same frequency band. One of the major con-
flicts comes with IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g WLANs. Older Bluetooth devices are almost
unusable in these situations. Most vendors have already implemented the recommendations of
the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, which lets Bluetooth and 802.11b/g WLANs share the spectrum
by first checking to see if the airwaves are clear for transmission and also by avoiding frequen-
cies that interfere with Wi-Fi networks. UWB can interfere with 802.11a networks, depending
on the frequency range used. Extensive tests run by the IEEE indicate that both ZigBee
products should be able to coexist with 802.11b/g without any serious problems. However,
experience with RF waves suggests that we will not know how well they actually perform
until these products have been deployed in large volume and in many different environments.
Chapter Summary
■HR WPANs are technologies optimized for the transmission of multimedia digital-
format sound and video files. There are three technologies currently competing to
become the accepted standard: WHDI, WiGig, and WirelessHD, each promoted by a
different organization.
■WHDI, founded by AMIMON Inc., defines wireless connectivity using the 5 GHz
band for distribution of high-quality video and audio signals to display devices such as
TVs and stereo sound systems. WHDI has a range of 100 ft. (30 meters) and is able to
penetrate walls. It eliminates the complexities of networking and delivering digital for-
mat files by using the display devices or sound systems for what they were originally
designed to do, which is to simply work as display or sound reproduction devices.
WHDI is also designed to coexist with 802.11a and 802.11n networks operating in
the same frequency band. It uses proprietary chip technology designed by AMIMON.
WHDI can directly support USB and HDMI connections, making them work over the
same wireless connection as video and sound.
■The Wireless Gigabit Alliance defined a set of specifications that include protocol
adaptation layers to support wireless HDMI, USB, PCIe, data, video, and audio
transmissions using the IEEE 802.11ac gigabit wireless connections in the ISM and
U-NII bands. The specifications will also work in the 60 GHz band using the IEEE
802.11ad standard.

■The 60 GHz band can only support short-range connections up to 33 ft. (10 meters)
due to the increased attenuation at high-frequency bands, and it does not penetrate
walls. To get around some of the line-of-sight limitations of the 60 GHz band,
transmitters use beamforming to maximize the signal strength at the receiving device
location and to deal with moving obstacles, such as a person walking between the
receiver and the transmitter.
■WiGig supports the same modulation and coding schemes in the ISM and U-NII bands
as 802.11 but defines two new modulations for the 60 GHz band: single carrier for
speeds up to 4.6 Gbps and OFDM for speeds up to 7 Gbps. OFDM provides better
handling of signal reflections. Using MIMO and beamforming WiGig can also use
obstacles as reflectors to help it maintain connections between devices.
■WirelessHD is the only specification that uses the IEEE 802.15.3c standard. This IEEE
standard specifies operation in the 60 GHz band only. WirelessHD supports many
different transmission speeds as well as the use of several different kinds of mobile and
stationary devices transmitting video, sound, or data on the piconet. A source device is
the one that transmits the video or audio data, whereas a sink device is either a video
display, such as a TV set, or a stereo sound system.
■WirelessHD defines three PHY layers: LRP for data dates up to 10 Mbps, HRP for
data rates up to 7 Gbps (and over 26 Gbps when using spatial multiplexing), and
MRP for data rates ranging from 476 Mbps to 2 Gbps. WirelessHD can also support
USB up to version 3.0 and can carry HDMI connections over the wireless link.
A WirelessHD piconet is also called a WVAN.
■WiGig and WirelessHD both support beamforming, which enables a device with mul-
tiple radios to virtually steer the beam in the direction of the intended receiver. Beam-
forming can use multipath reflections to create constructive interference, effectively
increasing the signal amplitude at the receiver end.
■802.15.3c supports peer-to-peer networking, but the timing of transmissions on the
piconet is always controlled by the PNC. The PNC accomplishes this by sending a
periodic beacon containing information about the piconet, such as its unique ID and the
time when devices are allowed to transmit. Devices can communicate directly to other
devices but can only transmit during the contention access period (CAP) or during the
times that the PNC allocates for each device. The PNC is responsible for QoS and allo-
cates reserved time periods, called CTAPs. Devices can request additional channel time
from the PNC. If the PNC leaves the piconet, it can hand over control to another device.
■802.15.3 piconets support child and neighbor piconets. The PNC in child piconets is a
member of the original piconet. The PNC in a neighbor piconet is not a member of the
original piconet but depends on the original piconet’s PNC to allocate a private block
of time for all devices belonging to the neighbor piconet to transmit. The two piconets
share the same frequency channel. Child piconets are useful for extending the coverage
of a piconet or for shifting processing or storage requirements to another device. The
WirelessHD specification extends this concept by supporting drone WVANs using a
different frequency channel when there are no longer any CTAPs available for use by
all the piconet devices.
■The process of association with the piconet is implemented in hardware to simplify
installation, use, and maintenance. The PNC maintains a table of all devices in the

piconet. It also broadcasts information about the piconet to all devices. It will only
send information about the availability of services when requested by a device.
■Efficient data transmission is accomplished by use of a superframe, which is the mech-
anism the PNC uses to allocate CAP, CTAP (which includes MCTAs), and CTAs. For
communications during the CAP, devices must use the CSMA/CA mechanism to avoid
collisions. Devices listen to the medium for traffic. If the medium is busy, devices must
wait before transmitting. This wait period is never applied to the transmission of
beacons. During the CTAP communications period, the piconet uses a TDMA scheme
for transmission.
■Devices can send asynchronous data in the CAP or can request channel time for
asynchronous communications during the CTAP. Normal communications during
the CTAP are isochronous or synchronous communications.
■In 802.15.3, devices can be in one of several power-saving modes. DSPS allows devices
to sleep for several superframes but wake up in the middle to transmit or send data.
The PNC informs all devices which one will be the wake superframe for each device.
In PSPS mode, devices can sleep during intervals defined by the PNC, but all devices
must wake up at the same time to listen to system-wide wake beacons. In asynchro-
nous power save mode, devices can sleep for long periods of time and decide when to
wake up and listen to a beacon. The PNC can also set a maximum transmit power
level for capable devices during the CAP, beacon, and MCTA time periods. This
method also allows the PNC to save power.
■Ultra wide band (UWB) is a digital transmission technology that supports very-
high-speed transmissions—up to 2 Gbps. Only the PHY layer needs to change in
UWB; the MAC layer remains the same one that is used with the other RF methods of
transmission. Currently, UWB is only implemented to support wireless USB. These
wireless interfaces transmit at 480 Mbps.
■UWB transmissions occupy a bandwidth of at least 500 MHz and transmit using very
short pulses. UWB uses an extremely simple modulation scheme called impulse modu-
lation, but it can also use multiband OFDM.
■Challenges for WPANs include speed, security, cost, industry support, interference,
and protocol limitations. Bluetooth suffers from these limitations more than its com-
peting standards do. 802.15.3 has a number of advantages over Bluetooth, including
enhanced security and the ability to extend the network through communications with
neighbor and child piconets.
■WPAN devices that are designed to be small and consume very little power have
limited processing capabilities and storage. This makes it difficult to implement
sophisticated security mechanisms, a source of concern when using WPANs.

Real-World Exercises
The Bay Area Cable TV Corporation installs home entertainment systems throughout Califor-
nia. About 10,000 systems are installed, expanded, or upgraded on a yearly basis. Many cus-
tomers are upgrading their equipment to multiple television sets and high-definition TV. Each
time the company sends a technician or contractor to a customer’s home or business, it’s an
additional $150 and $200 in labor costs to install the cable for additional set-top boxes in
different rooms of a house or office.
The company’s management has heard about a new way to deliver this service using wireless
networks, which would dramatically reduce installation costs. Customers also want to be able
to send multiple media streams, either movies or music, to different rooms or offices simulta-
neously. They have hired you as a networking expert to help them plan for the expansion of
their services over the next five to 10 years.
Exercise 6-1: Explaining HR WPAN Advantages
Create a PowerPoint slide presentation to demonstrate the advantages of HR WPANs for
the Bay Area Cable TV Corporation. Your presentation should cover any existing tech-
nology but should also include some recommendations based on some of the develop-
ments you learned about in this chapter. Bay Area is not asking you to guess which of
the HR WPAN technologies will be chosen, but they would like to hear your expert
review of the future of multimedia distribution in homes as well as the potential applica-
tions for businesses.
Exercise 6-2: Comparing HR WPAN Technologies
Although Bay Area’s management is thinking progressively, the board of directors is still not
sure whether to direct management to continue with wired technologies or begin to explore
wireless right away. They would like you to draw a comparison between the different HR
WPAN technologies and Wi-Fi. Therefore, create a PowerPoint slide presentation that
explains the advantages and disadvantages of the various HR WPAN alternatives and what
can be done with Wi-Fi today and in the near future.

WLANs are probably the technology that has attracted the most attention since the
introduction of personal computers to the consumer market. The explosive growth of wire-
less networks all over the world has been driven by home and small-office sales, but after
the ratification of the latest wireless networking standard—IEEE 802.11n, in 2009—more
companies have started deploying wireless networks than ever before. And growth is
expected to continue with the introduction of gigabit wireless. The Wireless Broadband
Alliance (www.wballiance.com) predicts that global public access (hotspots) deployments
alone will increase 350 percent (to 5.8 million) by 2015 as a result of mobile phone carriers
recognizing the importance of this technology and offloading some of the data traffic from
their networks. Total mobile data traffic is forecast to reach 16.84 million terabytes (that
is 16,840,000,000,000,000,000 bytes) in 2014. This figure includes both smartphones
and WLANs.
As you have learned in previous chapters, WLAN technology supports a very broad
spectrum of applications. Practically all laptop computers, netbooks, tablets, and smart-
phones are shipped with WLAN interfaces today. Many of the most popular coffee
shops and fast-food outlets, most hotels anywhere in the world, and even some airlines
offer wireless Internet access today. Public transit buses in the city of Markham, Ontario, offer
wireless Internet access to their passengers in a bid to prompt residents to use public
transportation.
This chapter begins by reviewing ways in which WLANs are used, focusing on low-speed
WLANs (up to 11 Mbps). This background will help you understand the higher-speed tech-
nologies and new standards covered in Chapter 8. So far, you have learned about various
technologies that do not always carry data that must remain private. The open nature of
the WLAN medium, which makes the signals available virtually everywhere, means not
only that these networks need to be made more secure but that working in this field requires
a more in-depth understanding of how WLANs work.
WLAN Applications
Wireless networks are increasing in popularity, especially in North America, as computer
users seek the freedom to use their mobile devices in various locations throughout their
homes or office environments. Installing cabling is inconvenient and very expensive, especially
after the building is already finished. Also, the locations available for connecting a high-speed
cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL) modem may not be ideal for working or study-
ing. Wireless networks solve these problems. Additionally, with a wireless network, multiple
users can easily share a single Internet connection. Some wireless network devices also allow
Internet and printer sharing. An example of this is a wireless residential gateway, a device
that combines a router, Ethernet switch, wireless access point, and in some cases the cable or
DSL modem. Wireless residential gateways provide better security than connecting a computer
directly to the Internet because most of them include a security firewall that prevents some
kind of security attacks on your network devices.

Wireless LAN applications today are so widespread that we could spend most of the chapter
listing different uses and applications. The Internet is packed with information in the form of
press releases and white papers about wireless LAN applications.
WLAN Components
The hardware needed for a WLAN is surprisingly minimal. In addition to a computer and an
Internet service provider for Internet access, only wireless network interface cards (NICs) and
access points (APs) are needed for communication to take place.
Wireless Network Interface Card
The hardware that allows a computer to be connected to a wired network is called a net-
work interface card (NIC) or a network adapter. A NIC is the device that connects the
computer to the network so that it can send and receive data to other devices, either
locally or via the Internet. A wired NIC has a port for a cable connection. The cable
connects the NIC to the network, thus establishing the link between the computer and
the network.
A wireless NIC performs the same functions as a wired NIC, with one major exception:
There is no port for a wire connection to the network. In its place is an antenna to send and
receive RF signals. Specifically, when wireless NICs transmit, they:
●
Change the computer’s internal data from parallel to serial prior to transmission
●
Divide the data into packets (smaller blocks of data) and attach the sending and
receiving computers’ addresses
●
Determine when to send the packet
●
Transmit the packet
A wireless NIC is most often a separate card that is inserted into one of the desktop compu-
ter’s internal expansion slots. For desktop computers, wireless NICs are available for a
peripheral component interface (PCI) expansion slot. Another option is an external wireless
adapter that can be connected to a computer’s Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. Examples of
these devices were shown in Figure 1-8.
For notebook and laptop computers, wireless NICs are available in two different formats.
The first is a standard PC Card Type II slot, as seen in Figure 1-8. Another format is known
as the Mini PCI. A Mini PCI is a small card that is functionally equivalent to a standard PCI
expansion card. It was specifically developed for integrating communications peripherals,
such as modems and NICs, onto a notebook computer. When a notebook computer is
equipped with a Mini PCI NIC, the antenna is usually embedded in the part of the notebook
that surrounds the screen. Figure 7-1 shows a Mini PCI card installed on the underside of a
notebook computer.

Smaller devices such as smartphones already include a wireless radio chip and an antenna to con-
nect to a WLAN. These small radios are the result of the development of very low-power chips.
WLANs are so popular that separate wireless NICs are quickly becoming a thing of the past.
Intel has integrated all the functions of a wireless interface into the set of chips (called a chip-
set) that is builtin to laptop computers. The chips in the set are mounted directly on the
motherboard, reducing the physical space requirements. Most notebook computer manufac-
turers ship all their models with integrated wireless LAN capabilities, whether using the Intel
Centrino chipset or a Mini PCI card.
The software that interfaces the wireless NIC with the computer can either be part of the oper-
ating system or a separate program. Beginning with Microsoft Windows XP, all Microsoft
desktop operating systems recognize a wireless NIC without the need for additional software
drivers; previous versions of Windows required specialized driver programs. Incorporating the
software into the operating system eases installation and also provides additional features,
such as the ability to create multiple wireless profiles that enable devices to automatically con-
nect to different WLANs as the user roams, instead of manually configuring the settings. Some
wireless NIC vendors include software drivers for other operating systems—such as Linux—as
well as for some dedicated devices that do not rely on industry-standard software.
Access Points
As you learned in Chapter 1, an access point (AP), as its name implies, provides wireless
LAN devices with a point of access into a wired network. APs consist of three major parts:
(1) a radio transmitter/receiver to generate the signals that are used to send and receive

wireless data; (2) an antenna to radiate these signals; and (3) an RJ-45 wired network inter-
face port that uses a cable to connect the AP to a standard wired network.
It is possible to use a standard PC as an AP by installing a wireless
NIC (which functions as the transmitter/receiver), a standard NIC
(which serves as the wired network interface), and special software
that allows the PC to serve as an AP as well as a security firewall.
You can find free public domain versions of this kind of software
at the following links: www.microtik.com and www.m0n0.ch. (The “0s” in “m0n0” are the
digit zero, not the letter “O”).
An AP has two basic functions:
●
It acts as the wireless communications base station for the wireless network. All the
devices that have a wireless NIC transmit to the AP, which in turn redirects the signal
to the other wireless devices.
●
It acts as a bridge between the wireless and wired networks. The AP is connected to
the wired LAN by a network cable, allowing the wireless devices to access the wired
network through it, as shown in Figure 7-2.
The range of an AP acting as the base station is approximately a maximum of 375 feet (115
meters) in an unobstructed office environment, in which there is little interference. However,
the data rate will drop as the signal strength, quality (affected by interference), or both begin
to fade. The exact point at which the data rate begins to drop depends on the specific envi-
ronment, the type and number of obstructions, and any sources of interference. The AP will
automatically select the highest possible data rate for transmission, depending on the strength
and quality of the signal. This process is called dynamic rate selection, and it makes testing

the signal before implementation of a WLAN an extremely important part of the deploy-
ment. You will learn more about testing the WLAN signal in Chapter 12.
The largest number of connected devices that a single AP can support varies but is usually over
100. However, because the radio frequency (RF) network signal is shared among users, most
vendors recommend one AP per maximum of 50 users if the network is lightly used—that is,
for e-mail, occasional Web surfing, and occasional transferring of medium-sized files. On the
other hand, if the users are mainly transferring large files—such as digital pictures, video, or
voice—the maximum number of users should be kept to between 20 and 25 per AP.
When the antennas are directly attached to the AP, the AP is typically mounted near the ceil-
ing or in a similar area high off the ground to ensure the clearest possible path for the RF sig-
nal. However, electrical power outlets are generally not found in these locations and, due to
building code restrictions, these outlets can be very expensive to install near the ceiling. The
IEEE has published two enhancements to the 802.3 Ethernet standard for wired networks—
namely, 802.3af and 802.3at—that define how manufacturers may implement the distribu-
tion of power over Ethernet (PoE) media. Instead of receiving power directly from an AC
outlet, DC power is delivered to the AP through the same wires that are used for data in
unshielded twisted pair (UTP) Ethernet cables that connect the AP to the wired network.
This eliminates the need for expensive electrical wiring to be installed in or near the ceiling
and makes the mounting of APs more flexible.
WLAN Modes
In an RF WLAN, data can be sent in one of two connection modes: ad hoc mode and infra-
structure mode.
Ad Hoc Mode Ad hoc mode is also known as peer-to-peer mode, although its formal
name in the 802.11 standard is Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). In ad hoc mode, wireless
clients communicate directly among themselves without using an AP, as shown in Figure 7-3.
This mode is useful for a quick and easy setup of a wireless network anywhere that a network

infrastructure does not already exist or is not permanently required. Examples of locations that
use ad hoc mode WLANs include hotel meeting rooms or convention centers. The drawback is
that the wireless clients can only communicate among themselves; there is no access to a wired
network.
Infrastructure Mode The second wireless network mode is the infrastructure mode,
also known as the Basic Service Set (BSS). Infrastructure mode consists of at least one
wireless client connected to a single AP. If more users need to be added to the WLAN or
the RF coverage area needs to be increased, more APs can be added. When an infrastruc-
ture WLAN has more than one AP using the same Service Set IDentifier (SSID), this is
called an Extended Service Set (ESS). An ESS is simply two or more BSS wireless networks
installed within the same area, providing users with uninterrupted mobile access to the net-
work, as shown in Figure 7-4. The SSID is an alphanumeric character string that uniquely
identifies each WLAN. In an ESS, each AP is tuned to a different frequency channel, but
all APs are connected to the same wired LAN, creating a virtually seamless wireless
connection. In an IEEE 802.11 WLAN, the MAC address of each AP is called the basic
service set identifier or BSSID, and in the case of an ESS, where the alphanumeric SSID is
the same for several different APs, the client device uses the BSSID to identify which AP it
is connected to.
When multiple APs are used, they create areas of coverage, much like the individual cells in
a beehive. However, unlike a beehive, these cells overlap to facilitate roaming. When a
mobile user carrying a wireless device enters into the range of more than one AP, his wire-
less device chooses an AP with which to associate, usually based on signal strength. Once

the AP accepts the connection from that device, the client device changes to the radio fre-
quency used by that particular AP.
Whenever a wireless client is not communicating on the WLAN, it will monitor all the radio
frequency channels on the network to determine if a different AP can provide a better-
quality or stronger signal. If the client finds one (perhaps because the user has moved), it
then associates with the new AP, changing to the radio frequency that the AP is set to. In
an ESS, this transition is called a handoff. To the user, a handoff is seamless, because the
connection between the wireless device and the wired network is never interrupted. The cli-
ent device remains connected to the same WLAN.
A drawback of ESS WLANs is that all wireless clients and APs must be part of the same net-
work for users to be able to roam freely between one AP and the other. Sometimes, it is dif-
ficult to manage one large network. Performance and security may also be adversely
affected. Because of this, network managers usually subdivide large networks into units
known as subnets that contain fewer computers. In an ESS divided into subnets, a mobile
user might not be able to freely roam between APs and would need to reconnect each time
he moves between subnets, because an IP address belonging to one subnet would not allow
him to communicate in another. Some of the business-class network devices that connect
these subnets are equipped with special software that allows the wireless device to be
accepted in other subnets without changing IP addresses and to maintain the connection. In
these cases, the wired switches and routers across the network allow packets to be for-
warded transparently to the user’s own subnet.
Wireless LAN Standards and Operation
In this section, you will learn about the first IEEE standards for wireless LANS. Most WLANs
are based on these initial IEEE 802.11 standards. 802.11a and 802.11g, which are covered in
Chapter 8, follow the same basic principles, albeit with a number of enhancements. Each of
these standards implements specific transmission technologies based on the differences in the
PHY and MAC layers.
IEEE 802.11 Standards
The original IEEE 802.11 standard, ratified in 1997, defines a local area network that pro-
vides cable-free data access for clients that are either mobile or in a fixed location, at a
rate of either 1 or 2 Mbps using either diffused infrared or RF transmission. In addition,
when using RF technology, this standard defines the implementation of WLANs using FHSS
or DSSS.
The standard specifies that the features of a WLAN be transparent to the upper layers
of the TCP/IP protocol stack or the OSI protocol model. That is, the functions of the
PHY and MAC layers provide full implementation of all the WLAN features so that no
modifications are needed at any other layers, as shown in Figure 7-5. Because all the
WLAN features are isolated in the PHY and MAC layers, any network operating system or
LAN application will run on a WLAN without any modification necessary. In order to accom-
plish this, some features that are usually associated with higher layers are now performed at
the MAC layer.

Because no IEEE 802.11 equipment has ever been introduced in the consumer market using
IR and FHSS, this book does not cover these technologies. Instead, this chapter focuses on
the basics of 802.11, which is applied across the products available on the market.
The slow maximum bandwidth of only 2 Mbps for the original 802.11 standard is not suffi-
cient for most network applications. As a result, the IEEE body revisited the 802.11 standard
shortly after it was released to determine what changes could be made to increase the speed.
In 1999, the 802.11b and 802.11a standards were published, increasing the speeds to
11 Mbps and 54 Mbps in the ISM and U-NII bands, respectively. Due to user demand, the
IEEE published the 802.11g standard in 2003, raising the speed of 802.11b-compatible net-
works to a maximum of 54 Mbps. This drive for more speed has not subsided yet. New stan-
dards are in the works to increase the speeds even beyond the current maximum of
300 Mbps to 600 Mbps possible with IEEE 802.11n.
It is important to remember that the most current version of the IEEE 802.11 standard is
still backwards compatible with the original maximum data rates from 1997 of 1 Mbps or
2 Mbps. This backwards compatibility has the effect of making it easier for clients to initially
establish connectivity to the WLAN, as will be explained later. The techniques used to achieve
the slower data rates will be discussed, where applicable, in the remainder of this chapter.
IEEE 802.11b Standard
The IEEE 802.11b amendment, ratified in 1999, was dubbed Higher Speed Physical Layer
Extension in the 2.4 GHz band by the IEEE. It added two higher speeds to the 1997
standard, 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps, and specified RF and direct sequence spread spectrum
(DSSS) as the only transmission technologies. 802.11b also became known as Wi-Fi shortly
after the establishment of the Wi-Fi Alliance.
Physical Layer Remember that the basic purpose of the IEEE PHY layer is to send sig-
nals to and receive signals from the network. The 802.11b PHY layer is also divided into
two parts, as shown in Figure 7-5: the physical medium dependent (PMD) sublayer and the
physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP) sublayer. The 802.11b standard made changes
only to the PHY layer of the original 802.11 standard.

Physical Layer Convergence Procedure PLCP standards for 802.11b are based on
direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). The PLCP must reformat the data received from
the MAC layer (when transmitting) into a frame that the PMD sublayer can transmit. An
example of a PLCP frame is shown in Figure 7-6.
The PLCP frame is made up of three parts: the preamble, the header, and the data. The pre-
amble allows the receiving device to prepare for the rest of the frame. The header provides
information about the frame itself. The data portion of the PLCP frame is the information
to be transmitted. The fields of the PLCP frame are:
●
Synchronization—Consists of alternating 0s and 1s to alert the receiver that a message
may be on its way; the receiving device then synchronizes with the incoming signal.
●
Start Frame Delimiter—Always the same bit pattern (1111001110100000); it defines
the beginning of a frame.
●
Signal Data Rate—Indicates how fast the data is being sent.
●
Service—Most of the bits in this field are reserved for future use and must be set to 0. Bits 2,
3, and 7 are used in combination with the Length field for data rates higher than 8 Mbps.
●
Length—Indicates how long, in microseconds, the data portion of the frame (the MAC
frame) is. The value of the Data field ranges from 16 to 65535. Approximately two
pages of the 802.11b standard are devoted to calculating the length of the data. The
details are beyond the scope of this book.
●
Header Error Check—Contains a value that the receiving device can use to determine
if the data was received correctly.
●
Data—Can be up to 4095 bytes (the maximum length of an IEEE 802.11 MAC frame).
The 802.11b PLCP frame preamble and header are always transmitted at 1 Mbps to allow
for communication between slower and faster devices. The slow PLCP preamble and header
transmission speed permits a slower transmission to cover a larger area than a faster one.
The disadvantage of using the lowest common denominator speed is that faster devices must
still fall back to the 1 Mbps transmission rate for the preamble and header, and this affects

the overall performance of the WLAN. However, the data portion of the frames can be sent
at the faster rates, if supported by the client devices.
Physical Medium Dependent Standards Once the PLCP has formatted the frame, it
then passes the frame to the PMD sublayer of the PHY layer. Again, the job of the PMD is to
translate the binary 1s and 0s of the frame into radio signals that can be used for transmission.
The 802.11b standard uses the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band (an unregulated
band that you learned about in Chapter 3) for its transmissions. For use in 802.11b, the stan-
dard specifies 14 available frequencies, beginning at 2.412 GHz and incrementing by .005
GHz (or 5 MHz of bandwidth per channel), except for Channel 14. The frequencies for
each channel are listed in Table 7-1.
The United States and Canada use channels 1–11; Europe permits
channels 1−13, with the maximum power limited at 10 mW
between 2454 and 2483 MHz; and Japan permits the use of all 14
channels but limits the use of channel 14 to 802.11b only.
The PMD can transmit data at 11, 5.5, 2, or 1 Mbps. By employing dynamic rate selection,
the transmission rate will adjust automatically from 1 Mbps to 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, or
11 Mbps and down again depending on the signal strength and quality. For transmissions
at 1 Mbps, two-level differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) is specified as the mod-
ulation technique. The phase angle change for a DBPSK 0 bit is 0 degrees; for a 1 bit, it is
180 degrees. Transmissions at 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps use differential quadrature phase shift

keying, similar to QPSK (covered in Chapter 2), which means a four-level phase/amplitude
change is used. Instead of having only two variations in phases for 0 and 1, the four-level
phase change has four variations in phase for the dibits 00, 01, 10, and 11.
You may remember that DSSS uses an expanded redundant code, called the Barker code, to
transmit each data bit. The Barker code is used when 802.11b is transmitting at 1 Mbps or
2 Mbps. However, to transmit at rates above 2 Mbps, Complementary Code Keying
(CCK), a table containing 64 8-bit code words, is used instead. As a set, these code words
have unique, mathematically calculated properties that allow them to be correctly distin-
guished from one another by a receiver. The 5.5 Mbps rate uses CCK to encode 4 bits per
signal unit, whereas the 11 Mbps rate encodes 8 bits per signal unit.
The maximum transmission rate of 802.11b networks is 11 Mbps,
but because all 802.11 transmissions use a single frequency, they are
half-duplex, which means that the maximum throughput achievable
in an 802.11b network is only between 5 and 6 Mbps.
Media Access Control Layer The 802.11b Data Link layer consists of two sublayers:
Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). The 802.11b standard spe-
cifies no changes to the LLC sublayer (the LLC remains the same as for IEEE 802.3 wired
networks), therefore all the changes for 802.11b WLANs are confined to the MAC layer.
Coordinating Transmissions in the Shared Wireless Medium
Because all devices in the same 802.11 WLAN must share the medium by transmitting in the
same frequency, if two computers start sending messages at the same time, a collision results
and the data becomes scrambled. Figure 7-7 shows an example of a collision in a wired
network. To prevent this, wireless network devices must use a variety of channel access

methods. One way to prevent network collisions, for example, is for each device to listen to
the medium first, to make sure no other device is transmitting. In addition, after a device
transmits a frame, it must wait to receive an acknowledgment from the receiving device. If it
does not receive an ACK, it assumes there has been a collision. This process is called distrib-
uted coordination function (DCF).
In Chapter 5, you learned about a channel access method called carrier sense, multiple access
with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). In this chapter, we will further explore CSMA/CA and
how it works in 802.11. This method of detecting collisions is based on the one used in IEEE
802.3 Ethernet. When Ethernet devices are connected using a shared medium, such as a
coaxial cable, or when they operate in half-duplex mode using hubs and only two wires to
communicate, they use a contention access method called carrier sense, multiple access with
collision detection (CSMA/CD). CSMA/CD specifies that before a computer starts to send a
message it should listen on the cable to see if any other computer is transmitting. If it hears
traffic, it should wait until that traffic is finished. If it hears no traffic, then the computer
can send a packet. However, what if two computers simultaneously listen for traffic and
hear nothing on the cable and then both start to send at exactly the same time? A collision
would still result. CSMA/CD also specifies that each computer must continue to listen while
sending its message. If it detects a collision, each computer stops sending data and broadcasts
a jam signal over the network, which tells all other computers not to send any messages for a
random period of time (the backoff interval) before attempting to resend.
CSMA/CD in Ethernet uses voltage sensors on the NIC. Whenever they detect a voltage higher
than 5 volts, this means that more than one device is transmitting at the same time. The same
method of detecting a collision cannot be used in a wireless system. Collision detection is virtu-
ally impossible with wireless transmissions when the signals are transmitted and received in the
same frequency. The RF signal from a transmitter is so strong when it gets to the antenna that
it will overpower that same antenna’s ability to receive a signal simultaneously. In short, while
it is transmitting, a device drowns out its own ability to detect a collision. In addition, the
amount of attenuation of a signal sent by another device cannot be effectively predicted in a
wireless system, therefore measuring the strength of voltage of an RF signal is not practical.
The shared medium of Ethernet networks is limited in maximum
length, and this, together with tight cable specifications, makes the
maximum signal attenuation predictable. In a WLAN, the signal may
be affected by unknown obstacles in the environment as well as by
signal reflections, which makes attenuation impossible to predict.
The entire family of 802.11 standards primarily uses DCF to avoid collisions. DCF specifies
that a modified procedure—CSMA/CA—be used. Whereas CSMA/CD is designed to handle
collisions when they occur, CSMA/CA attempts to avoid collisions altogether.
When using a contention-based channel access method, the time at which the most collisions
occur is immediately after a device completes its transmission. This is because all other devices
wanting to transmit have been waiting for the medium to clear so they can send their messages.
Once the medium is clear, they may all try to transmit at the same time, resulting in collisions.
CSMA/CA in DCF handles the situation by making all devices wait a random amount of
time (the backoff interval) after the medium is clear, which significantly reduces the occur-
rence of collisions. The amount of time that a device must wait after the medium is clear is

measured in time slots. Each client must wait a random number of time slots as its backoff
interval. The time slot for a DSSS 802.11b WLAN is 20 microseconds. If a wireless client’s
backoff interval is three time slots, then it must wait 60 microseconds (20 microseconds
times three time slots) before attempting to transmit.
The time slot for an 802.3 Ethernet 10 Mbps transmission is 51.2
microseconds; for 100 Mbps Ethernet, it is 5.12 microseconds.
CSMA/CA also reduces collisions by using an explicit acknowledgment (ACK). An acknowledg-
ment frame is sent by the receiving device back to the sending device to confirm that each data
frame arrived intact. If the sending device does not receive the ACK frame, either the original
data packet was not received or the ACK was not received intact. In either case, the sending device
assumes that a problem has occurred and retransmits the data frame after waiting for a time-out
period. This explicit ACK mechanism can also handle interference and other radio-related pro-
blems, such as one client device being able to hear the transmission from an AP but not being
able to hear another client that is too far away. CSMA/CA and ACK are shown in Figure 7-8.
CSMA/CA reduces potential collisions, but it does not eliminate them altogether. The 802.11b
standard provides two additional mechanisms to reduce collisions. The first is known as the
request–to-send/clear–to-send (RTS/CTS) protocol (also called virtual carrier sensing). RTS/
CTS is shown in Figure 7-9. The client wishing to transmit sends a request-to-send (RTS) frame
to the AP. This frame contains a Duration field that defines the length of time needed for both

the transmission and the returning ACK frame. The AP then alerts all other wireless clients that
Client B needs to reserve the medium for a specific number of time slots by responding back to
the client with a clear-to-send (CTS) frame that also tells all clients that the medium is now being
reserved and that they should therefore suspend any transmissions. Once the client that sent the
RTS to the AP receives the CTS frame, it can proceed with transmitting its message.
The RTS/CTS protocol imposes additional overhead and is not used unless there is poor net-
work performance due to excessive collisions. The second option to reduce collisions is
packet fragmentation. Fragmentation involves dividing the data to be transmitted from one
large frame into several smaller ones. Sending many smaller frames instead of one large
frame reduces the amount of time that the wireless medium is being used to transmit each
frame, and because of this it can also reduce the probability of collisions.
In fragmentation, if the length of a data frame to be transmitted exceeds a specific value, the
MAC layer will divide, or fragment, that frame into several smaller frames. Each fragmented
frame is given a fragment number (the first fragmented frame is 0, the next frame is 1, and so
on). The frames are then transmitted to the receiving client. The receiving client sends back
an ACK and then is ready to receive the next fragment. After all the fragments are received
at their destination, they are reassembled, based on their fragment numbers, back into the
original frame by the MAC layer of IEEE 802.11.

Fragmentation can reduce the probability of collisions and is an alternative to RTS/CTS;
however, it does create additional overhead in two ways. First, additional frames imply addi-
tional MAC and PLCP headers. Second, the receiving device must send a separate ACK for
each smaller fragment received. Fragmentation does not always have to be used separately
from RTS/CTS; in a busy WLAN, they may have to be combined to reduce collisions. The
standard allows both methods to be used simultaneously.
Point Coordination Function
Another type of channel access method is polling. With this method, each computer is sequen-
tially “asked” if it wants to transmit. After associating with the AP, client devices cannot trans-
mit unless they are polled. If the client has something to transmit, it will send a positive response
to the AP. The AP then gives permission for the client to transmit while all other devices must
wait. If the client does not have anything else to transmit, it will send a null data frame to the
AP, and then the next device in sequence will be polled. It is a very orderly way of allowing
each device to send a message. Each device is given a turn, as shown in Figure 7-10. Polling

effectively eliminates collisions because every device must wait until it receives permission from
the AP before it can transmit.
This optional polling method is known as point coordination function (PCF). With PCF,
the AP serves as the polling device. When using PCF, the AP (the point coordinator) first
listens for wireless traffic. This is because in order to allow other clients to associate with
the AP and join the WLAN, PCF must still allow some time slots for contention access, in
which case the WLAN is using DCF. If the AP hears no traffic on the wireless medium, it
sends out a beacon frame to all clients. One field of this frame contains a value that indi-
cates the number of time slots that will be used for PCF (polling) as well as the number of
time slots that will be used for DCF (contention). After the associated clients receive
this beacon frame, they must cease transmitting for the duration of PCF. Clients that
are not yet associated will take advantage of the DCF period to contact the AP and join
the WLAN.
PCF is designed for WLANs that transmit time-sensitive frames. These types of transmissions—
often voice or video—depend on each frame arriving in an orderly sequence very quickly, one
after the other. Delays in transmission can result in a video that freezes on the screen or a voice
conversation that has gaps of dead space. Data transmissions, on the other hand, are not as sen-
sitive to timely data delivery. DCF cannot distinguish between voice, video, and data frames.
Using PCF or a combination of DCF and PCF allows for the smooth transmission of these
time-sensitive frames.
Although PCF was never implemented in any commercial-grade 802.11 APs or wireless resi-
dential gateways, a hybrid of this method and DCF is used in later amendments to the stan-
dard, so it is still important to understand the basics of how PCF functions.
Association and Reassociation
The MAC layer of the 802.11b standard provides the functionality for a client to join a
WLAN and stay connected. The processes of joining and staying connected to a WLAN
are known as association and reassociation. Remember that there are two different modes
in RF WLANs: ad hoc and infrastructure. Regardless of which mode is being used, a client
must first go through a process of communicating with the other wireless clients or the AP
in order to become accepted as part of the network. This acceptance process is known as
association.
The process of association begins with the client scanning the wireless medium to dis-
cover all the APs from which it can detect a RF signal. The client that wants to connect
to the wireless network must first listen to the medium for the information that it needs
to begin the association process. There are two types of scanning: passive and active.
Passive scanning involves a client listening to each available channel for a set period of
time (usually 10 seconds). The client listens for a beacon frame transmitted from all
available APs. The information contained within most beacon frames includes how often
beacon frames are sent, the supported transmission rates of the network, and the AP’s
SSID and BSSID. The transmission of the SSID can be disabled on the AP to attempt
to “hide” the network from some clients. This hiding of the SSID will be discussed in
Chapter 8.
Point Coordination Function

SSIDs are case sensitive. For example, if you set the SSID on an AP as
“AP1” and set the SSID on the client devices as “ap1,” the client
devices will not be able to associate with the AP using this configura-
tion. The same is true for ad hoc networks. All devices must use the
same SSID.
The second type of scanning, active scanning, involves the client first sending out a special
frame, called a probe frame, on each available channel. It then waits for an answer, the
probe response frame, from all available APs. Like the beacon frame, the probe response
frame contains information the client needs to begin a dialogue with the AP. According to
the IEEE 802.11 standard, the probe response frame must always include the SSID, regard-
less of whether the AP is configured to transmit it in the beacon or not. Client devices do
not normally perform active scans of the wireless medium, but the client’s wireless NIC is
capable of sending probe frames. Some WLAN software tools, such as inSSIDer from Meta-
geek (www.metageek.net), can use the client’s wireless NIC to perform active scans by send-
ing probe frames.
Once the client scans and receives the connection information in the beacon from the AP, it
can begin to negotiate a WLAN connection with the AP. To join the WLAN, the client
sends an associate request frame to the AP that includes the client’s own capabilities and sup-
ported rates. The AP then returns an associate response frame, containing a status code and
client ID number that will be used as long as this client is connected to the same AP. At this
point, the client becomes part of the WLAN and can begin communicating.
If the WLAN includes multiple APs, the client may need to choose from many different APs.
The decision can be based on several criteria. A client can be preconfigured to connect only
to a specific AP. In this case, the client already contains the SSID of the AP with which it
needs to connect. Likewise, some APs can be configured to accept or reject a connection
from certain clients, usually based on the MAC address. As it receives beacon frames from
the different APs, the client compares its preconfigured profile’s SSIDs to the SSID of the pre-
ferred AP. The client will not attempt to connect to APs until it finds a match, at which time
it will send an associate request frame to that AP. If a client has not been preconfigured to
connect with a specific AP, it will attempt to connect with the AP from which it has received
the strongest radio signal.
Connecting with one AP does not restrict a client from associating with other APs, except
that clients can only be associated with one AP at a time. A client may disconnect from one
AP and reestablish a connection with another AP. This is known as reassociation. Reassocia-
tion may be necessary when mobile clients roam beyond the coverage area of one AP in an
ESS and are receiving a stronger signal from a different AP in the same ESS, in which case
the client reassociates with the new AP. Reassociation can also occur when the signal from
one AP weakens because of interference.
When a client determines that the link to its current AP is poor because it has been scanning
the medium and saving information related to the various APs in an ESS, it will pick the AP
with the strongest signal and send a reassociate request frame. If the new AP accepts the
reassociation request, it will send a reassociate response frame to the client. The new AP
will then send a disassociate frame to the previous AP that the client was connected to, via
the wired network, terminating the old AP’s association with the client. This process is
shown in Figure 7-11.

In the 802.11 and 802.11a/b/g standards, multiple APs can only
communicate with one another over the network cabling. In other
words, they cannot communicate over a wireless connection. As you
will learn in the next chapter, there are two separate enhancements
to the 802.11 standards that permit APs to communicate with each
other over the wireless medium, when necessary.
Power Management
Most clients in a WLAN are portable computers, smartphones, or tablets, giving the users
the freedom to roam without being tethered to the network by wires. When these devices
are mobile (and consequently not connected to a power outlet), they depend on batteries as
their primary power source. To conserve battery power, wireless devices can go into sleep
mode after a period of inactivity, when particular functions (such as hard drive, display, and
so on) are temporarily powered down by the computer’s operating system.
Note that Microsoft Windows hibernate mode, which literally shuts
down the computer, is not the same as sleep mode or standby
mode; however, it is similar to sleep mode. As defined in 802.11, a
computer in sleep mode must remain powered up, although the
hard drive and display may be temporarily shut down by the note-
book’s power save mode. In both hibernate and standby modes, the NIC also shuts down
completely. To learn more about these features of Microsoft Windows, refer to Windows doc-
umentation or your operating system’s Windows Help feature.
When a client is part of a WLAN, it must remain fully powered up to receive network trans-
missions. Missing transmissions because it is in sleep or hibernate mode may cause an appli-
cation running on the device to lose connection with a server application running elsewhere
on the network. The answer to the issue of a battery-powered client being able to shut
down its radios to save energy is known as power management. In the 802.11 standard,
power management allows the mobile client’s NIC to be off as much as possible to conserve

battery life but still not miss out on data transmissions. Power management in 802.11 is
transparent to all protocols and applications so that it does not interfere with normal net-
work functions. The 802.11b power management function can only be used when connecting
in infrastructure mode.
The key to power management is synchronization. Every client on a WLAN has its own local
timer. At regular intervals, the AP sends out a beacon signal to all clients that contains a
timestamp. When the clients receive this frame from the AP, they synchronize their local
timers with that of the AP.
When a mobile 802.11 client goes into sleep mode, it first informs the AP of the change in its
status. The AP keeps a record of those clients that are awake and those that are sleeping (with
the client’s wireless NIC receiver and transmitter powered down). As the AP receives transmis-
sions, it first checks whether the client’s NIC is in sleep mode. The AP temporarily stores the
frames that are destined to the clients that are sleeping (this function is called buffering).
At predetermined times, the AP sends out a beacon frame to all clients. This frame contains a
list—known as the traffic indication map (TIM)—of the network IDs of the clients that have
buffered frames waiting at the AP. At that same set time, all clients that have been sleeping
must awaken (by turning on their wireless NICs) and go into an active listening mode. If a
client learns that it has buffered frames waiting, that client will send a request to the AP for
those frames. If TIM does not include the network ID of a client, signaling that it has no
buffered frames, the client can return to sleep mode. This process is shown in Figure 7-12.
Note that clients that are in hibernation mode will effectively be disconnected from the
WLAN and cannot awaken to receive frames.

The maximum amount of sleep time for a mobile client is generally
set to 100 milliseconds. This means that every client in sleep mode
must awaken and listen for the TIM every 100 milliseconds.
MAC Frame Formats
The 802.11b standard specifies three types of MAC frame formats. The first are known as
management frames. These are used to set up the initial communications between a client
and the AP. The reassociation request frame, the reassociation response frame, and the disas-
sociation frame are all types of management frames.
The format of a management frame is shown in Figure 7-13. The Frame Control field indicates
the current version number of the standard and whether encryption is being used. The Duration
field contains the number of microseconds needed to transmit. This value will differ depending on
whether the point coordination function or distributed coordination function mode is being used.
Sequence control is the sequence number for the frame and, if necessary, the fragment number.
Control frames are the second type of MAC frames. After association and authentication
between the clients and the APs are established, the control frames provide assistance in
delivering the frames that contain the data. A request-to-send (RTS) frame is a control frame
and is shown in Figure 7-14.

Data frames are the third type of MAC frames. They carry the information to be transmitted
to the destination client. The format of a data frame is shown in Figure 7-15. The fields
Address 1 through Address 4 contain the SSID, the destination address, the source address,
and the transmitter address and the receiver address, depending on how the network is con-
figured. Not all address fields are present in every type of MAC data frame. The content of
the address fields varies depending on the type of frame transmitted.
A full discussion of the use of the address fields is beyond the scope
of this book. For additional information regarding the content of the
address fields, see the 802.11-1999 standard. You can find it at
http://standards.ieee.org/about/get. Copies are usually available at no
cost six months after the publication of a standard’s latest version.
Interframe Spaces
To understand the message exchange process, you need to understand the collision avoidance
mechanism in DCF that is used by an AP and a client to communicate. For CSMA/CA to
work properly in DCF, the 802.11 standard defines a number of interframe spaces (IFS), or
time gaps. These are designed to handle the contention for the medium among several devices
attempting to communicate.
To keep this explanation as simple as possible, we will only review the procedure and rules
associated with using the DCF. We will not look at the procedure or rules associated with
RTS/CTS or PCF. For additional information, you can download the 802.11-1999 standard
from the address provided in an earlier note.
In 802.11, interframe spaces perform various critical functions, depending on what type
they are:
●
The Short Interframe Space (SIFS) is a time period used to allow all transmitted signals
to arrive and be decoded at the receiving device. An SIFS occurs immediately after the
transmission of any frames. No device is allowed to transmit during the SIFS. If a
frame has been transmitted to one specific device, and provided there were no errors,
the receiving device will send an ACK immediately after the SIFS time.
●
The DCF Interframe Space (DIFS) is a time period during which all devices must wait
between transmissions of data frames. The DIFS occurs after the transmission of an
ACK or after the SIFS if the frame transmitted was a broadcast. Devices remain idle
during the DIFS.

The times of these space intervals are measured in microseconds, as shown in Table 7-2.
The basic rules of communication in an 802.11 network are as follows (see Figure 7-16):
●
A device that wants to transmit begins listening for an RF signal (carrier sensing),
which indicates the presence of frame traffic on the network, during the DIFS.
●
If no RF signal is detected at the end of the DIFS and the device’s backoff interval has
counted down to 0, it can begin transmitting a data or management frame.
●
The size of a frame includes both the length of time necessary to send the data and the
SIFS time. When the transmission is over, the sending device begins listening for an
acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiving device.
●
The receiving device must send the ACK immediately after the SIFS. After receiving an
ACK, the transmitting client begins to wait a random backoff interval.
●
If the transmitting device does not receive an ACK after the SIFS, it is allowed to
maintain control of the medium and begin retransmitting the frame that was not
acknowledged immediately after the DIFS time.

●
If the frame was acknowledged correctly, the transmitting device listens to the medium
while waiting its backoff interval, but not during the SIFS or DIFS. Once the interval
ends, the device checks for traffic at the end of the next DIFS and the process repeats
itself from the first point above.
In the case of two devices having frames to transmit, the process works as follows (see
Figure 7-17):
●
Client A has a frame to transmit. Its backoff period counter is 0. It senses the carrier
after the last DIFS (the one on the left in Figure 7-17) and finds no traffic on the
medium, so it transmits the frame.
●
Client B had two time slots left to count down, but it can only count during a
contention access period.
●
After Client A finishes the transmission of its data frame, it sets its random backoff
counter to 3.
●
The network enters a contention access period, and both Client A and Client B begin
counting down backoff time slots.
●
After two time slots, Client B’s counter reaches 0 and it has something to transmit.
Client B finds the medium free and transmits its data frame.
●
Like Client B before, Client A does nothing while Client B’s data frame transmission is
going on. Once Client B has received an ACK for its most recent transmission, the
process continues.

The process just described is a simplified version of what actually occurs, but it is the essence
of collision avoidance in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. In Chapter 8, we will briefly explore some
additional types of interframe spaces that are used in other amendments to the standard.
Chapter Summary
■The wireless technology that attracts the most attention today is wireless local area
networks (WLANs). WLAN deployments are growing, and usage is increasing at a
dramatic pace, all because WLANs allow users to access networks such as the Internet
from a wider range of locations than was ever possible before.
■A wireless NIC performs the same functions as a wired NIC, except instead of a port
for a cable connection to the network, the wireless NIC uses an antenna to send and
receive RF signals. Wireless NICs are usually a separate card that is inserted into one
of the computer’s expansion slots.
■An AP’s main function is to interconnect the wired network and the WLAN. The AP
acts as the base station for the wireless network and also serves as a bridge between
the two networks. An AP consists of three major parts: an antenna, a radio transmit-
ter/receiver, and an RJ-45 wired network interface that allows it to connect by cable to
a standard wired network.
■Data can be sent and received in an RF WLAN either in ad hoc or infrastructure
mode. In ad hoc (or peer-to-peer) mode, the wireless clients communicate directly with
each other without using an AP. Ad hoc mode is known in the 802.11 standard as an
IBSS. Infrastructure mode, also known as the Basic Service Set (BSS), consists of wire-
less clients and an AP. If more users need to be added to the WLAN or the range of
coverage needs to be increased, more APs can be added using the same network name,
or SSID. This creates an Extended Service Set (ESS), which consists of two or more
BSSs.
■The IEEE 802.11 standard defines a local area network that provides cable-free
data access at a rate of up to 2 Mbps for clients that are either mobile or in a fixed
location. The 802.11 standard also specifies that the features of a WLAN be trans-
parent to the upper levels of the OSI protocol model. However, the slow bandwidth
of only 2 Mbps for the 802.11 standard proved insufficient for most network
applications.
■The 802.11 standard uses an access method known as the distributed coordination
function (DCF). The DCF specifies that a modified procedure known as carrier sense,
multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) be used. CSMA/CA attempts to
avoid collisions. The CSMA/CA process ensures that all clients wait a random number
of time slots after the medium is clear. CSMA/CA also reduces collisions by using
explicit packet acknowledgment (ACK). Although CSMA/CA dramatically reduces the
potential for collisions, it does not eliminate them altogether. The 802.11 standard
provides two options that may be used to reduce collisions. The first is known as the
request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) protocol. RTS/CTS reserves the medium for
a single client to transmit. The second option to reduce collisions is fragmentation.
Fragmentation involves dividing the data to be transmitted from one large frame into
several smaller ones.

■The 802.11 standard provides for an optional polling function known as point coor-
dination function (PCF). With PCF, the AP serves as the polling device and queries
each client to determine if the client needs to transmit. The MAC layer of the 802.11
standard provides the functionality for a client to join a WLAN and stay connected.
This is known as association and reassociation. Association is the process of commu-
nicating with the other wireless clients in ad hoc WLANs or with the AP in order to
become accepted as part of the network. To associate with a WLAN, the client first
scans the wireless medium and listens for beacons from the APs. There are two types
of scanning: passive scanning and active scanning. A client may drop the connection
with one AP and reestablish the connection with another, which is known as
reassociation.
■Mobile WLAN devices often depend on batteries as their primary power source. To
conserve battery power, they can go into sleep mode after a period of time. Power
management, as defined by the 802.11 standard, allows the mobile client to be off as
much as possible to conserve battery life but still not miss out on data transmissions
by waking up and listening to beacons. The beacon may contain a Traffic Information
Map (TIM) that indicates whether there is data waiting at the AP to be transmitted to
the client. If so, the station will then remain awake and request the data from the AP.
■The 802.11 standard specifies three different types of MAC frame formats. Manage-
ment frames, the first type, are used to set up the initial communications between a
client and the AP. Control frames, the second type, provide assistance in delivering the
frames that contain the data. Data frames, the third type, carry the information to be
transmitted. The 802.11 standard also defines two different types of interframe spaces
(IFS), or time gaps, which are standard spacing intervals between the transmissions of
frames. Instead of being just dead space, these time gaps are used to allow enough time
for a device to finish receiving transmissions, checking for errors, and sending an ACK.
■In 1999, IEEE approved two new standards: 802.11b and 802.11a. The IEEE 802.11b
standard added two higher speeds, 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps, to the original 802.11
standard. With the faster data rates, the 802.11b quickly became the standard for
WLANs.
■The physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP) for 802.11b is exclusively based on
direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). The PLCP must reformat the data received
from the MAC layer (when transmitting) into a frame that the PMD sublayer can
transmit. The frame is made up of three parts, which are the preamble, the header, and
the data. The 802.11b standard uses the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical
(ISM) band for its transmissions and can transmit data at 11, 5.5, 2, or 1 Mbps.

Hands-On Projects
Project 7-1
In this project, you will configure a wireless network connection in Microsoft
Windows 7. As usual, there is more than one way to accomplish this task.
Windows 7 provides a built-in tool called “WLAN AutoConfig,” which is
designed to make it much simpler for the average computer user to connect to a wireless
network. WLAN AutoConfig can be used to connect to WLANs in most homes, offices, hot-
spots, as well as hotels. The procedure presented in this project is generic and can be used
regardless of the type or make of computer you have, provided that you are running
the Windows 7 operating system. Setting up a connection to an Enterprise network, which
typically uses a separate authentication server, is more complex and will not be covered in
this exercise.
Manufacturers almost always provide WLAN utilities with their hardware, and in
Windows you can choose to configure a WLAN with either the WLAN AutoConfig
tool
or
the
WLAN
NIC
manufacturer’s
utility.
The
manufacturer’s
utility
often
has additional features, but it can be more complex to use. For this project, you will be
configuring an ad hoc WLAN. You will need two computers equipped with wireless
NICs.
1.
Log in to both computers as administrator or to an account with administrator privi-
leges. Windows will not allow you to complete any of the following steps unless you
are the system administrator or your account has administrator privileges.
2.
Click the Windows Start button on the lower-left corner of the Windows taskbar, and
then click Control Panel on the right-hand side of the Start menu.
3.
In Control Panel, search for and click Network and Sharing Center.
4.
When you set up an ad hoc network, your computer is not connected to a router
or DHCP server that can provide you with an IP address. Because of this, you
will need to configure a static IP address. You will also not have access to the Inter-
net, only to shared files on the other computer(s) connected to the same ad hoc
WLAN.
5.
Once you have configured unique IP addresses on the WLAN NIC of each computer,
return to the Network and Sharing Center window. Click Manage wireless networks
on the menu in the left column of the window. If you have WLAN connections
already configured and your NIC is enabled, you will see a list like the one shown in
Figure 7-18.

6.
Click Add in the toolbar above the network list area, then click Create and ad hoc network
on the pop-up window.
7.
Read the information on the “Setup a wireless ad hoc network” window that opens,
then click Next. Type a unique name for this network, one that is not being used by
any other students working on this project at the same time. Remember that the net-
work name is the SSID of the network and is case sensitive.
8.
Under “Security type,” click the drop-down box and select No authentication (Open).
9.
Click the checkbox next to “Save this network,” then click Next. Check the parameters
of your network, then click the Close button. You should now see your network at the
top of the list in the “Manage wireless networks” window. On the right-hand side of
the ad hoc network entry you just created, you will see that the network is configured
to “Manually connect.” Perform the same steps on the other computer(s) you want to
connect to your ad hoc WLAN.
10. If your ad hoc WLAN appeared at the top of the list in Step 9, once you finish configur-
ing the second computer, they should connect automatically. To check this, click the
Windows network icon located on the far right-hand side of your Windows taskbar. (If
your taskbar is located at either side of your computer screen, the icon will appear at
the bottom.) This is shown in Figure 7-19.

11. You will see a list of the networks available. Your ad hoc network name should be at the
top of the list, and it should say “Connected.” If it is not connected, click the ad hoc net-
work entry and click the Connect button. The connected ad hoc network should look
similar to the one highlighted by the ellipse in Figure 7-20, but with your own SSID.
12. To test the connection to the other computer, click the Windows Start button on the
left-hand side of the Start bar and type cmd in the “Search programs and files” text
box to open a command window. At the command prompt, type ping and the IP
address of the WLAN NIC of the other computer you are using for this project, then

press Enter. You should receive three or four successful ping replies from the other com-
puter, as shown in Figure 7-21. (Remember that your IP addresses must be unique and
may be different than the one shown in the figure.)
13. Be sure to return the IP address settings to Obtain an IP address automatically and
delete the ad hoc entry you just created from the “Manage wireless networks” window.
Project 7-2
In this project, you will manually configure a wireless residential gateway,
which is more commonly known as a wireless router or broadband router, to
create a WLAN. The device used in this project is a Linksys WRT54G, but
you can use any model available to you and adapt the following instructions. The settings
you will configure are very similar among different manufacturers’ products, and even
when different names are used for the parameters, they are usually easy to figure out.
Remember that a wireless residential gateway includes an AP, a router, firewall, and a net-
work switch, and in some cases it also includes a built-in DSL or cable modem.
1.
Obtain a wireless residential gateway from your instructor, or you can use your own.
2.
If the device has external antennas, make sure they are positioned vertically; and if they
use a screw-in connector, make sure the antennas are finger-tight and do not fall to the
horizontal position again. Never turn on a wireless device equipped with external anten-
nas without first having them connected and tightened up. The absence of a proper load
at the output of the transmitter can damage the circuit. In addition, despite the very low
power levels of most WLAN devices, you are strongly advised to never touch the anten-
nas when the device is turned on as this may represent a health risk.
3.
Connect an RJ-45 Ethernet crossover patch cable to one of the switch ports in the back
of the device. Note that one port is separated from the others and is usually marked
“WAN.” Do not connect anything to the WAN port. Plug the other end of the cable
into an Ethernet port on your computer.
4.
Plug in the power adapter and connect it to the back of your AP or broadband router.
5.
Make sure the Ethernet adapter on your computer is configured to obtain an IP address
automatically.

6.
Open a Web browser. In the address line, type http://192.168.1.1 for a Linksys
device. Other manufacturers’ devices may use a different address. Consult the manual
or download it from the Internet for the device you have.
7.
At the login prompt, leave the user name blank and type admin in the password field.
The Linksys setup page will appear. For this project, you will not use an Internet con-
nection. You can leave all the fields in the main Setup page in their default settings
(see Figure 7-22).
8.
Click the Wireless tab to display the wireless setup page.
If you are setting up more than one Linksys AP or broadband router
in the same or an adjacent lab or classroom, make sure you select a
different channel for each of the devices. Recall that to avoid inter-
ference, you can only use channels 1, 6, and 11.
9.
Leave “Mode” as Mixed. Change the SSID to the same one you used in Project
7-1. Click Save Settings. A page should appear indicating that your settings are

Figure 7-23).
10. On the computer, click the network icon on the right-hand side of the Start bar to view
the wireless networks detected.
11. Click the SSID you set up on the gateway and then click the Connect button. Windows
may display an information dialog box stating that you are connecting to an unsecured
network. If so, click Connect Anyway. Windows will display a dialog box with a prog-
ress bar and the text “Connecting to <your SSID>.” If the connection is successful,
Windows 7 will close the dialog box and not give you any additional indication other
than a tiny icon on the Start bar that shows five bars.
12. You can verify the connection using the same procedures described in Steps 11 and 12
of Project 7-1.
Real-World Exercises
Exercise 7-1
A hotspot is a public place—such as a train, bus station, coffee shop, or restaurant—that
offers (usually) free Internet access to its customers. Using the Internet, search for hotspots by
accessing the Web sites for various nationwide cellular phone companies, such as AT&T or
Sprint. Alternatively, you can search the local media Web sites and local Internet service pro-
vider (ISP) sites. If you have access to a notebook computer, wireless-enabled smartphone, or
tablet computer and it is equipped with a WLAN interface, once you locate a hotspot, try to
visit the site and get a connection to the Internet. If you do not have access to the Internet but
you can either telephone the provider or visit the hotspot location, interview the staff at the
location and write a one-page report describing how the wireless access is provided. What
steps did you have to go through to get a connection? For how long was the connection avail-
able? Was there a cost associated with accessing the Internet? How many people use the ser-
vice daily? Were there any limitations? Who provides technical support for the site?

Exercise 7-2
Using the Internet, research wireless LAN applications. Compile a list of at least five WLAN
applications that you had not thought about before, and write a one-paragraph description
for each one. The paragraph should mention the challenges that you might face if you were
asked to provide support for such an implementation. If possible, contact users of the new
application and ask them about their particular experiences with the WLAN implementa-
tion. Add this information to your report.
Challenge Case Project
How do you measure a wireless network’s performance? In this project, you
will test your network and determine its speed of data transfer. Keep in mind,
though, that most wireless networks communicate in half-duplex mode, so the
data rate reported by the operating system does not reflect the maximum data
rate the network is capable of.
There are many network performance-testing tools available on the Web. Begin by opening
your favorite browser and, using the search engine of your choice, typing in the question
“How do you measure a wireless network’s performance?” Browse the results that appear,
then download and install a free or trial version of one or more network-testing tools. Run
as many of the following tests as possible, using Wi-Fi-enabled devices that are available to
you, while copying a large file (over 10 MB) from one device to another:
●
Create and test an ad hoc link between two devices.
●
Test from a wired to a wireless device, and vice-versa.
●
Test with more than one pair of devices transmitting via the same AP.
●
Run the tests in both directions.
●
Try to test with both a clear channel and one that is already in use in the same area.
Use inSSIDer from metageek.net to view available channels and signal strength.
Carefully record your results for each test, then write a one-page report detailing each of the
results, the tools and devices you used, and your conclusions.

Higher data rates and lower costs have made 802.11 WLANs very competitive with
wired networks, and corporations continue to deploy WLANs as a viable alternative. In
terms of speed, WLANs have come a long way since the original IEEE 802.11 WLAN stan-
dard, established in 1997, offered speeds of only 1 and 2 Mbps. Today’s WLANs can oper-
ate at data rates of 1 Gbps and above.
In 1999, the IEEE approved the 802.11b standard, which added two higher speeds—
5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps—to the 802.11 standard. At that time, IEEE also issued the IEEE
802.11a standard, which offered even higher speeds. IEEE 802.11a has a maximum speed
of 54 Mbps and also supports transmission at 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps, 24 Mbps, 18 Mbps,
12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps. 802.11a WLANs quickly became very attractive to users
because the speed of transmission represented a significant increase over that of 802.11b
systems. In addition, because of more bandwidth, 802.11a offered an additional five chan-
nels, which gave it a clear advantage over 802.11b.
IEEE 802.11a
Although the IEEE ratified 802.11b and 802.11a at the same time (in 1999), 802.11b pro-
ducts started to appear almost immediately, whereas 802.11a products did not arrive until
late 2001. 802.11a products came to the market later because of technical issues and, at least
initially, the high cost of implementation.
The 802.11a standard maintains the same medium access control (MAC) layer functions as
802.11b WLANs, with practically all differences confined to the Physical layer. It achieves its
increase in speed and flexibility over 802.11b through the use of its multiplexing technique
and through a more efficient error-correction scheme. These factors are described in detail in
the following sections.
This book refers to the amendments to the standards by the lower-
case letter appended to the end of the standard number (e.g., IEEE
802.11n) even though the IEEE, when an amendment is ratified,
now incorporates the content into the latest revision of the standard
documentation and appends the year in which the work was com-
pleted (e.g., IEEE 802.11-2009, which includes the 802.11n amendment).
U-NII Frequency Band
Recall that the 802.11b standard uses one part of the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific,
and Medical (ISM) band for its transmissions and specifies 14 frequencies that can be
used, beginning at 2.412 GHz and increasing by increments of .005 GHz. IEEE 802.11a
uses
another
unlicensed
band,
the
Unlicensed
National
Information
Infrastructure
(U-NII). The U-NII band is intended for devices that provide short-range, high-speed
wireless digital communications. Table 8-1 compares ISM and U-NII bands available for
use in WLANs.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has segmented the total 555 MHz of
the U-NII spectrum into four bands. Each band has a maximum power limit. These bands
and their maximum power outputs as per the 802.11 standard are shown in Table 8-2.
In 2008, the IEEE ratified the 802.11y amendment, which extended
operation of 802.11a to the licensed 3.7 GHz band. This band offers
increased power limits, which allows radios to achieve a maximum
range of up to 16,400 feet (5,000 meters), but an FCC license is
required to operate in this band.
The U-NII-3 band is only approved for outdoor use and is deployed
most often for building-to-building, point-to-point wireless connec-
tions using directional antennas.
Outside the United States, parts of the 5 GHz band are allocated to users and technologies
other than WLANs, and the bands may have different widths and power limitations. When
you configure computers or APs that will be used during business trips or will be deployed
in other countries, it is always wise to check the limitations and ensure that the local regula-
tions will be followed. To automatically adjust power requirements and meet the limitations
in other countries, most enterprise-class 802.11 equipment manufacturers require that you
select the country in which you are going to install the equipment before it enables the

radios. Channel availability as well as the maximum transmission power for different chan-
nels are then set automatically.
Although the U-NII band is segmented, the total bandwidth available for IEEE 802.11a
WLANs using U-NII is almost seven times that available for 802.11b. The ISM band offers
only 83.5 MHz of spectrum in the 2.4 GHz range, whereas the U-NII band offers 555 MHz.
Channel Allocation in 802.11a
A second reason for the higher performance of an 802.11a WLAN is increased channel allo-
cation. Remember that in 802.11b the available frequency spectrum (2.412–2.484 GHz) is
divided into 14 channels and that only 11 of those channels are available in North America.
The center points of each channel—2.412 GHz, 2.417 GHz, 2.422 GHz, and so on—are the
frequencies at which the transmissions actually occur, before spreading. IEEE 802.11 requires
a 25 MHz passband, so only three non-overlapping channels are available for simultaneous
operation: channels 1, 6, and 11. This is shown in Figure 8-1.
In 802.11a, eight frequency channels can be used simultaneously in U-NII-1 (5.15–5.25 GHz)
and U-NII-2 (5.25–5.35 GHz). When using newer-model equipment that can also transmit in
the U-NII-2 Extended band, up to 23 channels are available. Within each frequency channel,
there is a 20-MHz-wide channel that is divided into 52 subcarrier frequencies, with each sub-
carrier being 300 KHz wide. This is shown in Figure 8-2.
The channel numbers in the 5 GHz band are the result of a mathe-
matical formula, whereas in the 2.4 GHz band, channels numbered
1 to 11 are arbitrarily assigned.
With only three channels available in the ISM band, it follows that a maximum of three APs
can be installed within a radius of roughly 300 feet. Using 802.11g APs, for example, this
would provide a maximum data throughput of only 162 Mbps (54 Mbps  3) spread evenly
across the three APs.

Using 802.11a instead of 802.11g, up to 23 channels are available, depending on whether
the equipment can transmit in the U-NII-2 Extended band. Because there are more available
channels than in the ISM band, additional APs can be added, providing up to 1,242 Mbps
(23  54 Mbps) of total throughput. A comparison of co-locating three APs in 802.11b versus
co-locating eight APs in 802.11a is shown in Figure 8-3.
When multiple APs are used, you can configure them to allow only certain user’s devices to
associate. This enables you to support a larger number of users per area. Using technologies

such as wireless controllers (discussed later) can offer load-balancing methods to automati-
cally distribute clients across multiple channels so that one AP doesn’t get overcrowded
when others are available. Another advantage of having more channels available is that if a
nearby WLAN is using the same channel as you are, you have more options and can set
your AP to use a different channel to eliminate the interference.
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
In Chapter 3, you learned about multipath distortion, which occurs when the receiving device
gets the same signal from several different directions at different times, due to signal reflec-
tions, diffraction, or scattering. Even though the receiving device may have already received
the complete transmission, it must still wait until all reflections are received. If the receiver
does not wait until all reflections are received, some of the signals that arrive later may
spread into the next transmission because the reflected signals traveled a longer path and,
as a result, have been delayed. Increasing the data transmission speed through denser and
more complex modulation schemes tends to make multipath distortion worse and force the
receiver to wait even longer before it gets the reflected signals. The required waiting time
effectively puts a limit on the overall speed of the WLAN. With a single carrier modulation
radio technology, the maximum data transmission rate falls between 10 and 20 Mbps.
A baseband processor, or equalizer, is required in 802.11b systems
to unravel the delayed radio frequency signals as they are received.
IEEE 802.11a solves the multipath distortion problem by using a multiplexing technique
called orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Its primary function is to split a
high-speed digital signal into several slower signals running in parallel.
OFDM is also the technology used for consumer-based digital
subscriber line (DSL) service, which provides home Internet access
over standard telephone lines at speeds ranging from 256 Kbps to
16 Mbps.
Instead of sending one long stream of data across a single channel, OFDM radios transmit
the data bits in parallel, at lower speeds, across several narrower frequency channels. The
receiving device recombines the signals received in each individual frequency channel and
rebuilds the frame. By using these parallel transmission channels, OFDM can combine several
lower-speed channels to send data at higher speeds. This is shown in Figure 8-4.

Although it may seem contradictory, OFDM breaks the 802.11b data-rate limit by transmit-
ting data at a slower bit rate than 802.11b does. OFDM avoids problems caused by multi-
path distortion by sending the bits slowly enough that any delayed copies (multipath reflec-
tions) are late by a much smaller amount of time than those sent in 802.11b transmissions.
This means that the network does not have to wait as long for the reflections to arrive at the
receiver, thus the total throughput is actually increased. With OFDM, in other words, the
total amount of data sent in parallel over a given unit of time is greater and the time spent
waiting for reflections to arrive is less than with a single-carrier transmission. A comparison
between the two systems is shown in Figure 8-5.
In 802.11a, OFDM uses 48 of the 52 subcarriers for data. Data is modulated on to each of
these 48 subcarriers using simpler modulation schemes, which are also easier to decode at the
receiver. The remaining four subcarriers are used for monitoring the signal quality and cor-
recting timing errors during transmission.
The modulation techniques used to encode the data vary depending on the speed. At 6 Mbps,
phase shift keying (PSK) is used (see Chapter 2). The change in the starting point of the cycle
varies depending on whether a 0 or a 1 bit is being transmitted. PSK can encode 125 Kbps of
data per each of the 48 subcarriers, resulting in a 6,000 Kbps (125 Kbps  48), or a 6 Mbps
data rate. (You may wish to review the waveform shown in Figure 2-29.)
Whereas PSK has only two possible changes in the starting point of a wave, allowing 1 bit to
be transmitted at a time, quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) has four possible changes in
the starting point of a wave, allowing it to transmit 2 bits per symbol (see Chapter 2), as
shown in Figure 8-6. QPSK can double the amount of data encoded over PSK to 250 Kbps
per subcarrier, which produces a 12 Mbps (250 Kbps  48) data rate.

Transmitting at 24 Mbps requires a 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM)
technique. 16-QAM has 16 different signals that can be sent, as shown in Figure 8-7. Each
group of bits modulated into one signal change in a carrier is called a symbol, which is also
referred to as a baud. Whereas QPSK transmits 2 bits per symbol, 16-QAM can transmit
4 bits per symbol. For example, to transmit the bits 1110, QPSK would send 11 and then
10 by modifying the phase and amplitude. 16-QAM would only send one signal (1110).
16-QAM can encode 500 Kbps per subcarrier.
A data rate of 54 Mbps is achieved by using 64-level quadrature amplitude modulation
(64-QAM), which can transmit at a rate of 1.125 Mbps over each of the 48 subcarriers
(see Figure 8-8).

Hardware developers cannot increase the complexity of the modulation on the subcarriers
beyond the maximum 54 Mbps rate because of the maximum amount of noise allowed.
Transmitting at higher speeds requires additional subcarriers and a wider bandwidth.
Error Correction in 802.11a
IEEE 802.11a also handles errors differently than 802.11b. The number of errors is signifi-
cantly reduced due to the nature of 802.11a transmissions. Because transmissions are sent
over parallel subcarriers, radio interference from outside sources is minimized. Instead of the
interference impacting the entire data stream, it generally affects only one subcarrier. IEEE
802.11a uses a technique called forward error correction (FEC), which transmits extra bits
per byte of data. These extra bits allow the receiver to recover (through sophisticated algo-
rithms) data bits that may be lost during the transmission. This can eliminate a lot of retrans-
missions when errors occur, which saves time and increases the total throughput of the
WLAN. A full discussion of FEC is beyond the scope of this book, but it is widely employed
in many modern digital communications systems.
The extra bits transmitted when using FEC means that transmission
overhead is increased, but because of its higher speed, 802.11a can
accommodate the FEC overhead with a negligible impact on
performance.

802.11a PHY Layer
The 802.11a standard made changes only to the Physical layer (PHY layer) of the original
802.11 and 802.11b standards; the MAC layer remains the same. Recall that the basic pur-
pose of the IEEE PHY layer is to send and receive the signal from the network.
The 802.11a PHY layer is divided into two parts: the Physical Medium Dependent (PMD)
sublayer and the Physical Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP) sublayer. The PMD sublayer
defines the characteristics of the wireless medium as well as the method for transmitting and
receiving data through that medium. The PLCP sublayer reformats the data received from the
MAC layer (for transmission) into a frame that the PMD sublayer can transmit. The PLCP is
also the sublayer that determines when the medium is free so that data can be transmitted.
The PLCP for 802.11a is based on OFDM instead of direct sequence spread spectrum
(DSSS). An example of a PLCP frame is shown in Figure 8-9.
The frame is made up of three parts: the preamble, the header, and the data. The preamble
allows the receiving device to prepare for the rest of the frame. The header provides informa-
tion about the frame itself—such as the length of the current frame. The data portion of the
PLCP frame is the information that is to be actually transmitted, which is essentially the
MAC frame. Here are descriptions of the fields in the PLCP frame:
Synchronization—Consists of 10 repetitions of a short training sequence signal and two
repetitions of a long training sequence signal. The purpose of these signals is to synchro-
nize the transmitter and receiver in both time and frequency. The Synchronization field is
transmitted in 16 microseconds.
Rate—This field, which is 4 bits long, specifies the speed at which the Data field will be
transmitted.
Reserved—Kept available by the standard for future use.
Length—Contains the value that indicates the length of the Data field, from 1 to 4095
octets.
Parity—This single bit is used to check for errors in the previous fields.

Tail (header)—Indicates the end of the header. All six bits are set to 0.
Service—The first seven bits are used to initialize part of the transmitter and receiver circuits
and are set to 0; the remaining nine bits are reserved for future use and are also set to 0. The
Service field is part of the header but is transmitted at the same rate as the Data field.
Data—The actual data to be transmitted is contained in this field. The length of the Data
field is from 1 to 4095 octets.
Tail (Data)—Indicates the end of the Data field. All six bits are set to 0.
Pad—The IEEE standard specifies that the number of bits in the Data field must be a
multiple of 48, 96, 192, or 288. If necessary, the length of the Data field may need to be
extended with padding bits to match this requirement.
802.11a WLANs are being deployed in areas that demand higher transmission speeds, greater
throughput, or a larger number of users. The disadvantage of 802.11a networks is that they
have a shorter range of coverage due to the higher signal attenuation in the 5 GHz band as well
as to the lower power limit of U-NII-1. An 802.11a WLAN has a range of up to approximately
225 feet, compared to up to 375 feet for an 802.11b WLAN. Of course, this depends upon a
number of factors, such as walls and other obstacles that can affect the RF transmission.
IEEE 802.11g
The tremendous success of the IEEE 802.11b standard shortly after its release prompted the
IEEE to reexamine the 802.11b and 802.11a standards to determine if a third, intermediate
standard could be developed. This best-of-both-worlds approach preserves the stable and widely
accepted features of 802.11b but increases the data transfer rates to that of 802.11a. The IEEE
802.11g standard, which was published in June 2003, specifies that 802.11g operates in the
same frequency band as 802.11b and not the higher frequency band used by 802.11a.
802.11g PHY Layer The PHY layer for 802.11g basically follows the specifications for
802.11b, with changes (described next) for data rates between 1 and 11 Mbps. As with
802.11a, no changes were required to the MAC layer of the 802.11g standard. The stan-
dard specifies two mandatory transmission modes along with two optional modes.
The first mandatory transmission mode is the one used by 802.11b; it supports data rates of
1 Mbps, 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, and 11 Mbps. The second mandatory transmission mode uses
OFDM like 802.11a but in the 2.4 GHz frequency band used by 802.11b. The 802.11g
standard divides each of the three usable channels in the ISM band into the same number
of subcarriers, as 802.11a does (48 data subcarriers and four pilot subcarriers), and provides
the same data rates. However, the number of non-overlapping channels available for
802.11g (i.e., three) is the same as the number available for 802.11b, compared with the
23 channels available for 802.11a.
An additional coordination method is required to allow legacy devices (802.11 and
802.11b) to participate in the WLAN. Using this method, which is called CTS-to-self, an
802.11g client transmits a clear-to-send frame before initiating an OFDM transmission.
Remember that a clear-to-send frame includes a field containing the number of time slots
required to send a frame of data. Because legacy clients do not “understand” OFDM, one
or more of them could potentially attempt to initiate a transmission using DSSS (802.11) or
CCK (802.11b). By transmitting a clear-to-send using DSSS, an 802.11g device effectively

prevents any legacy device from initiating a transmission before the end of the 802.11g
device’s OFDM transmission.
There are two optional transmission modes. The first mode uses PBCC (Packet Binary Convolu-
tional Coding), can transmit at 22 or 33 Mbps, and is capable of supporting 802.11b. The sec-
ond, known as DSSS-OFDM, is a combination mode that uses the standard DSSS preamble of
802.11b so that both APs and clients are able to understand the beginning of the transmissions
and then remain quiet while a frame is being transmitted, regardless of whether they understand
the modulation and coding. The data portion of the frame, in this mode, is transmitted using
OFDM. This mode does not require any additional coordination, such as a CTS-to-self, because
all devices will be able to receive and decode the full contents of the frame headers and therefore
will not initiate a transmission while another device is transmitting using OFDM.
To be fully compliant with 802.11a and 802.11g at the higher data
rates, a device must be able to transmit only at 6, 9, 12, and 24
Mbps. Data rates of 36, 48, and 54 Mbps are not required for com-
pliance with the standards.
There are two other important differences among the 802.11g, 802.11a, and 802.11b stan-
dards; they are related to signal timing. First, 802.11g specifies that any time a device is trans-
mitting at a higher rate than 802.11b, a 6-microsecond quiet time (no transmission) is included
at the end of the data portion of every frame to allow additional processing time for the receiver
to decode the data. This requirement accommodates both 802.11b-only devices and devices
that can transmit at higher data rates. In 802.11a, this additional time is not required because
the standard does not have to maintain backward compatibility with any other standard.
The other difference has to do with short interframe space (SIFS) timing. In Chapter 7, you
learned that 802.11b time slots are 20 microseconds and the SIFS time is 10 microseconds.
802.11g maintains the same time slot duration; however, the SIFS duration is affected by
the addition of the quiet time. Therefore, when data is being transmitted at rates above
11 Mbps, the SIFS cannot begin until the quiet time is completed, effectively extending the
SIFS to 16 microseconds. This change in the SIFS affects the performance of 802.11g, mean-
ing that although it can transmit at 54 Mbps, the overall performance is lower than that of
802.11a. Note that when the network is supporting only 802.11g devices, the standard
allows the time slot to be reduced to 9 microseconds instead of 20 microseconds, which
removes the performance difference between the 802.11a and 802.11g standards. Figure 8-10
shows the format of an 802.11g PLCP frame.

The PLCP frame formats used in 802.11g are the same as for 802.11b. For transmission at
54 Mbps, the PHY layer follows the same general specifications as for 802.11a. Note, how-
ever, that when 802.11b and 802.11g devices share the same network, the standard defines
how the frame header is transmitted at 1 or 2 Mbps using DSSS, for compatibility with
802.11b devices. If the communicating device is 802.11g-capable, the transmission changes
to OFDM for the data portion of the frame. This is shown in Figure 8-11.
The optional 22 Mbps rate is achieved by using the PBCC encoding method. PBCC uses a
256-state code (the spreading code) to send 8 bits per transmission symbol. To achieve the
data rate of 33 Mbps using PBCC, the 802.11g standard specifies a change in the clock
rate used to transmit the chips from 11 MHz to 16.5 MHz. The preamble is transmitted
with an 11 MHz clock (at 1 or 2 Mbps), and the change is accomplished in a
1-microsecond-long clock switch section of the PLCP frame, as shown in Figure 8-12.
The tail is 3 clock cycles at 11 Mchip/s, and the head is 3 clock cycles at 16.5 Msymbols/s
(QPSK). The resync is 9 clock cycles at 16.5 Msymbols/s. The total clock switching time
(tail, head, and resync) is 1 ms. The tail bits are 1 1 1, the head bits are 0 0 0, and the

resync bits are 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1. The modulation used for transmission at 22 or 33 Mbps is
binary phase shift keying (BPSK), which is essentially the same modulation as PSK, which
you learned about in Chapter 2. Only two phase changes are used to represent either a
1 or a 0. The phase change is always made with reference to the phase of the signal received
immediately before the current one.
IEEE 802.11n and Other Amendments
As you have realized by now, work on dynamic standards such as those for WLANs never
ends. User demand for faster and more reliable WLANs suggests that the IEEE will continue
to enhance these technologies for the foreseeable future. This section covers some of the latest
amendments and how they differ from the other WLAN technologies discussed earlier.
IEEE 802.11n
The IEEE began working on the 802.11n amendment in 2004, shortly after the ratification of
802.11g in 2003. Several other amendments were introduced in the 2007 revision of the
802.11 standard, but it was clear that 54 Mbps was not enough for the 802.11 standard to
compete effectively with wired networks. The work on 802.11n became the most widely dis-
cussed enhancement to this WLAN technology. A few consumer equipment manufacturers
began introducing devices based on the first draft of the standard. Before we continue dis-
cussing this technology, it is important for you to understand that 802.11n is an extremely
complex topic that could easily fill an entire book. This section will provide you with an
introduction, but it is not intended to offer complete coverage of 802.11n.
The excitement about this new technology reached a high point when the Wi-Fi Alliance
began certifying equipment based on the second draft of the amendment in 2007, roughly
two years before the members of the IEEE ratified the standard. Some enterprise-class equip-
ment manufacturers also began shipping compatible equipment and recommending it to their
customers while offering guarantees that if any other changes were introduced before ratifi-
cation, their equipment would require only a software upgrade to meet the standard.
Wi-Fi-certified products must also support Wi-Fi multimedia (WMM) capabilities, includ-
ing quality-of-service (QoS) as well as WPA and WPA2 security mechanisms, all of which
are discussed later in this chapter. Draft 2 of the 802.11n amendment—high throughput
(HT), as it is called in that document—was finally ratified and released by the IEEE near
the end of 2009.
In Chapter 3, you learned about multipath interference and how it can degrade the quality of
a signal to the point where the SNR is so low the data can become corrupted and no longer
understood by a receiver. HT utilizes a completely new approach to implementing the PHY
layer. The 802.11n amendment uses multiple antennas along multiple radios in each device.
This allows it to take advantage of multipath interference to actually increase the SNR,
which results in an increase in the range and reliability of WLAN transmissions. Additional
enhancements to the MAC layer, together with the changes to the PHY layer, help 802.11n
achieve data rates that were not possible before.
Although the transmission techniques are somewhat different than those of previous versions
of the standard, HT-capable devices are required to maintain backwards compatibility with
802.11b and 802.11g in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. A novel aspect of 802.11n is that it is also
288

designed to work in the 5 GHz band; therefore, it is required to maintain backwards compat-
ibility with 802.11a.
MIMO Technology Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technology is based
on using multiple radios, both transmitters and receivers, as well as multiple antennas.
Until its introduction in 802.11n, most devices employed a single radio with two antennas
and supported a technique called antenna diversity, which increases a signal’s range. With
antenna diversity, the receiver senses which one of its two antennas is getting the strongest
signal from the transmitter, and when it sends a response frame—an ACK, for example—it
uses the antenna that received the strongest signal.
Instead of antenna diversity, 802.11n MIMO-capable devices use multiple radios, each with
its own antenna, and they employ beamforming to virtually direct a transmission back to
the device from which they just received a frame, thus increasing the transmitted signal’s
range. Multiple radios can also increase the throughput. Instead of transmitting a frame via
a single radio, 802.11n MIMO-capable devices breakup a frame into multiple parts and
transmit each one via a different radio. This is called spatial multiplexing. At the receiver
end, the data is reassembled into a full PHY frame before being passed back to the MAC
layer. Keep in mind that, for reliability reasons, it is always better, when possible, to have
more receivers than transmitters. Figure 8-13 shows a graphical example of this concept.
The 802.11n amendment specifies the different radio configurations of multiple transmitters
and receivers, up to a maximum of four transmitters and four receivers, for a maximum
transmission speed of 600 Mbps. For example, a 23 (two-by-three) device has two trans-
mitters and three receivers, whereas a 33 device has three transmitters and three receivers,
and so on. Each transmitter sends a different spatial stream of data containing different
parts of a frame. Figure 8-14 shows examples of 23 and 33 MIMO devices. Note that
to take advantage of spatial multiplexing, the receiver and the transmitter need to have
the same number of radios. The more radios a device has, the higher the cost as well as the
higher the power consumption. Because of these two factors, few manufacturers have
implemented devices beyond a 33 configuration.

Spatial multiplexing and beamforming can be combined to increase range and reliability of
transmission. Both of these techniques rely on feedback information from the receiver,
meaning that any two devices need to be able to evaluate each other’s capabilities and wire-
less medium information—such as signal quality—and inform each other. This can be
accomplished by the devices monitoring the medium and following up with an exchange of
information within a data frame header or via the exchange of management frames.
Channel Configuration One of the ways 802.11n is able to achieve high data rates is
by using more bandwidth in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. IEEE 802.11a and
802.11g each consume 20 MHz of bandwidth to transmit using OFDM; 802.11b uses
about 22 MHz of bandwidth.
HT radios can support DSSS and OFDM in the ISM band, which means they can be config-
ured to automatically use 20 MHz or 22 MHz of bandwidth and support communications
with 802.11b and 802.11g devices. However, the higher speeds of up to 300 Mbps or 600
Mbps can only be achieved if the radios are configured to utilize 40 MHz of bandwidth. In
the ISM 2.4 GHz band, this means that HT uses either channels 1 and 6 or channels 6 and
11, and this can result in excessive interference in channel 6 if more than one AP is in use or
if channel 6 is already being used nearby, whether in an office building, a public hotspot
network—such as a coffee shop—or a residential neighborhood.
The kind of interference that happens when two devices are using the same channel on a dif-
ferent BSS is called co-channel interference. Depending on how close the WLANs or the
BSSs are, interference on channel 6 may prevent 802.11n devices from achieving their
maximum data rates in the ISM band. The only viable solution in this case is to deploy equip-
ment that works in the 5 GHz U-NII band. Keep in mind that, to conserve power, many
different models of mobile devices are not able to make use of the 5 GHZ frequency band.
When communicating with other HT devices, 802.11n radios divide the frequency space
into 56 subcarriers for 20 MHz of bandwidth and use four of them as pilot subcarriers.
When using 40 MHz-wide channels and communicating with other 802.11n devices that
are also capable of using the wider bandwidth, the radios divide the frequency space into
114 subcarriers and use six of them as pilot subcarriers. In essence, HT combines two
802.11 channels in either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency band to allow it to carry more

data. Figure 8-15 shows a graphical example of the channel bonding in 802.11n. Note how
the channels overlap on channel 6 in the 2.4 GHz band when using 40 MHz wide channels.
Note also that both 802.11a and 802.11g use only one 20 MHz channel. In the 2.4 GHz
band, there is approximately 5 MHz of frequency space between usable channels—channels
1, 6, and 11—that is left unused. This frequency space between the channels is called a
guard band, and it helps prevent adjacent channel interference, which occurs when signals
in two adjacent channels cause interference with each other. When 802.11 uses a 40 MHz
channel, there is no need for the 5 MHz guard band. The additional frequency space allows
for more subcarriers, and this also helps 802.11n achieve higher data rates in both the ISM
and U-NII bands. Figure 8-15 shows a graphical example of channel bonding in 802.11n,
which is when two channels are combined into one 40 MHz channel.
Guard Interval As was discussed in the “IEEE 802.11a” section, to transmit digital sig-
nals, data is modulated onto a carrier in either single bit streams or groups of bits called
symbols. The more bits that are encoded in each symbol, the higher the data rate. In non-
HT transmissions (compatible with 802.11a/g), because of multipath, a certain amount of
delay is required at the end of every frame to allow all reflected signals to arrive at the recei-
vers. This is called a guard interval (GI), and it prevents a new symbol from arriving at the
receiver before the last multipath signal reaches the receiver’s antenna, which can cause data
corruption. This kind of data corruption is called intersymbol interference (ISI). Although it

normally takes a maximum of 200 nanoseconds for all the multipath signals to arrive at the
receiver’s antenna, the GI, in order to prevent data corruption, should always be two to four
times larger than that. In 802.11a/g, the GI is set at 800 nanoseconds.
The 802.11n amendment specifies an 800-nanosecond GI for compatibility with 802.11a/g,
but it optionally specifies a 400-nanosecond GI to reduce the symbol time and increase data
rates by about 10 percent. When using the shorter GI, ISI can still occur, and the resulting
data corruption means that frames would have to be retransmitted, which has the effect of
reducing throughput.
Modulation and Coding Scheme Because of the multiple factors involved in deter-
mining the data rate in 802.11n—the type of modulation, the number of spatial streams, the
GI, the FEC coding, etc.—the amendment now uses combinations of nine different factors to
define the data rates. These combinations are referred to as modulation and coding schemes
(MCSs). The 802.11-2012 version of the standard lists 77 different definitions that apply to
both 20-MHz-wide and 40-MHz-wide channels and specify a different data rate. There are
eight mandatory MCSs supporting data rates of up to 72.2 Mbps. All the other rates, up to
those for a 44 device supporting up to 600 Mbps, are optional. By comparison, 802.11a
and 802.11g support only 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps, and the only mandatory rates
are 6, 12, and 24 Mbps.
HT PHY Layer The 802.11n HT PHY layer supports three different frame formats. The
first frame format is used to transmit in non-HT mode when communicating with 802.11a/g
devices. The second frame format is used in mixed environments, with both HT and non-
HT (legacy 802.11a/g devices). This allows non-HT devices to decode the beginning of the
preamble, which contains information about the duration of the frame, so that legacy
devices will not attempt to communicate until the transmission ends, thereby avoiding colli-
sions. The third frame format is used when the WLAN is exclusively supporting 802.11n
devices. This mode of operation is called greenfield and is not compatible with non-HT
devices. Though optional in 802.11n, it is the most efficient way to communicate with
other HT devices if legacy support is not required.
HT MAC Sublayer The 802.11n MAC sublayer includes new enhancements designed to
address the increase in throughput and power management. Power management becomes
really important in 802.11n because of the optional use of multiple radios. The more radios
a device has, the more power it will consume.
One of the new enhancements deals with frame aggregation, a method of combining multi-
ple MAC frames into one PHY frame to reduce the number of MAC headers as well as the
overhead caused by random back-off timers during medium contention, which contributes
to increased WLAN throughput and reduced collisions.
There are two variations of frame aggregation. The first combines multiple MAC frames into
one PHY frame, removing the individual headers. When using this method, all MAC frames
must be of the same type, meaning that voice frames cannot be combined with video frames.
The aggregated frames must also have a single destination—in other words, they must be uni-
cast frames. As you know, in 802.11 the receiver must acknowledge each transmitted MAC
frame, but in this case a single ACK is transmitted for the entire group of aggregated frames,
which saves time and overhead, increasing throughput. The disadvantage of this method is
that, should an error occur, the entire group of aggregated frames must be retransmitted.
292
Chapter 8

The second method of frame aggregation combines individual MAC frames, including the
headers, body, and trailers. Here again, the frames must all be unicast. In this case, the
receiver sends an ACK for each individual MAC frame. However, if the receiving device is
802.11e compliant (802.11e is discussed in the next section), then a block ACK frame is
transmitted back to the sender acknowledging the multiple MAC frames transmitted. In
case of an error, only the frames following the one in which an error was detected must be
retransmitted.
Because of the higher power consumption of 802.11n devices with multiple radios, the stan-
dard defines two new power management methods. In Spatial Multiplexing Power Save
(SMPS) mode, a MIMO device can shut down all but one of its radios, then wake up and lis-
ten for a TIM in the beacons sent by the AP. If the TIM indicates that there is data waiting,
the device must wake up and inform the AP, which will then transmit the buffered data. In
the second new power management method, called Power Save Multi-Poll (PSMP), the devices
also turn off all but one radio. When there is data to be transmitted to the device, the AP can
wake up the devices by transmitting an RTS frame. The device will then inform the AP when
all of its radios are operating again, in preparation for receiving the data using HT.
The Wi-Fi Alliance Web site offers a variety of resources on the topic
of Wireless Multimedia (WMM) power management, especially for
mobile devices. For more information, visit www.wi-fi.org and use
the search feature.
Reduced Interframe Space (RIFS) In greenfield mode, the 802.11n amendment
allows for a Reduced Interframe Space (RIFS)—a shorter (2-microsecond) interframe space
that can be used instead of an SIFS at the end of each transmitted frame, resulting in far
less timing overhead and helping further increase the overall throughput of 802.11n.
Remember that the SIFS interval in 802.11 is 10 microseconds long; in 802.11g, in order to
maintain backward compatibility with 802.11, it is extended by 6 microseconds of quiet
time at the end of each frame.
HT Operation Modes To allow 802.11n WLANs to coexist with non-HT devices
(both APs and clients) and to allow devices that can only support 20 MHz channels (maxi-
mum data rate of 150 Mbps) to participate in the WLAN, 802.11n can operate in one of
four different modes, depending on the presence or absence of different types of devices.
Here are brief descriptions of these four modes of operation:
●
Mode 0, the greenfield mode, supports only HT-capable devices using either 20 MHz
or 40 MHz channels but not both in the same WLAN.
●
Mode 1 is an HT mode, but if the AP detects stations that are not HT-capable and
transmitting in a 20 MHz channel that interferes with either the primary or secondary
channel in a 40 MHz channel, the AP will employ protection mechanisms to reduce or
eliminate interference.
●
Mode 2 supports either 20 or 40 MHz channels. If the AP detects a device that cannot
communicate using a 40 MHz channel, it will employ protection mechanisms to allow
20-MHz-only devices to associate and communicate on the network.
●
Mode 3, also called non-HT Mixed Mode, is used when one or more non-HT devices are
associated with an HT AP. Mode 3 supports HT devices at 20 MHz or 40 MHz and

employs protection mechanisms to allow non-HT devices to participate in the BSS. Of all
the modes, it is the one most commonly used and implemented by AP manufacturers,
because in the near future most networks will have to support non-HT devices.
IEEE 802.11e
The IEEE 802.11e standard was approved for publication in November 2005. It defines
enhancements to the MAC layer of 802.11 to expand support for LAN applications that
require Quality of Service (QoS), and it provides for improvements in the capabilities and
efficiency of the protocol. When combined with other recent enhancements to the PHY
layers, it promises to increase overall system performance and expand the application space
for 802.11.
Unlike the 802.11a and 802.11g standards, which require that each frame be acknowledged
before a transmission can continue, 802.11e allows the receiving device to acknowledge after
receiving a burst of frames (i.e., after several frames are transmitted). Figure 8-16 shows a
logical diagram comparing the two methods.
The 802.11e standard enables prioritization of frames in distributed coordination function
(DCF), taking advantage of the higher data rates of 802.11a and 802.11g. In addition to
delayed or burst acknowledgements, 802.11e implements two new coordination functions:
enhanced DCF (EDCF) and hybrid coordination function (HCF).

All APs that comply with the standard must implement both modes, although the network
administrator has different levels of control over how these are configured. In addition, both
modes include a traffic class (TC) definition. E-mails, for example, would be assigned a low
priority, whereas voice communications would be assigned a higher-priority class. In EDCF,
a station with higher-priority traffic waits less long to transmit and therefore has a better
chance of getting its traffic through.
HCF is a combination of DCF and point coordination function (PCF). The interval between
beacon frames is divided into a contention-free period and a contention period. During the
contention-free period, the hybrid coordinator (the AP) controls access to the medium and,
based on information about the traffic received from a client, allocates more time slots to
the station with high-priority traffic—such as voice-over-IP frames. During the contention
period, all stations work in EDCF mode.
This prioritization aspect is an important development of the 802.11 standards family. The
802.11e standard enables voice, audio, and video to be transmitted reliably over WLANs by
supporting traffic prioritization based on QoS (quality-of-service). QoS is a resource reserva-
tion mechanism that allows certain types of network traffic—voice and video, for example—
to be transmitted with a higher priority than traffic that is not time sensitive, such as copying
a data file. QoS also adds improved security features for both mobile and nomadic applica-
tions. A nomadic user is one that moves frequently but does not use the equipment while
in motion.
IEEE 802.11r
The amount of time required by 802.11 devices to associate with one AP and disassociate
from another in an ESS is in the order of hundreds of milliseconds. For 802.11 devices to be
able to support mobile phones used for voice calls, the reassociation time cannot exceed
50 milliseconds; otherwise, the human ear will sense a break in the continuity of the voice
stream. This will make users unhappy with the quality of the call, and they may stop using
the mobile phones. To support voice over WLAN (VoWLAN), which enables organizations
to implement and use VoIP in their ESSs, the 802.11 standard needs a way to provide
quicker handoffs. A handoff in a WLAN happens when a computer or a handset connects
with a new access point and disconnects from the previous one. Another issue is that the cur-
rent 802.11 MAC protocol does not allow a device to find out if the necessary QoS
resources, such as the required number of time slots and security features, are available on
an AP before a telephone handset associates with it, which can affect the quality and reliabil-
ity of a voice call.
The 802.11r standard is designed to resolve these issues as well as security concerns regard-
ing the handoff. It does so by refining the MAC protocol and providing a way for the client
to communicate with multiple APs on different channels to establish all the necessary para-
meters, including security, before a handoff occurs. This amendment to the standard is
designed to enhance the convergence of wireless mobile voice, data, and video by improving
the functionality and performance of WLANs.
IEEE 802.11s
Imagine that you need to deploy a WLAN over the entire downtown area of a medium-sized
city and provide seamless connectivity to all city employees for events and functions. Though

theoretically possible, connecting each of the APs to a wired network and configuring the sys-
tem would be a monumentally expensive and complex undertaking because of the need for
interconnecting all the different locations. Installing network cabling outdoors is not an
option, so the only way to address this would be to lease communications lines from a local
utility. Not only would this make the cost prohibitively high, achieving high data rates might
also be difficult, depending on the technology available.
The ideal solution would be to connect the wireless APs to each other over the wireless
medium. However, as you recall from previous sections of this chapter, 802.11 does not cur-
rently provide a way for APs to communicate with each other, much less forward wireless
frame traffic, except over the wired interface.
The 802.11s standard provides the solution. Figure 8-17 shows an example of a wireless
mesh network. In this figure, AP5 provides the single connection to the Internet to keep the
landline connection costs low. The notebook associated with AP3 and the PDA connected to
AP7 would be able to access the wired network or the Internet because the APs can commu-
nicate with each other over the wireless medium until the frames get to AP5.
802.11ac and 802.11ad As of this writing, 802.11ac and 802.11ad are under develop-
ment. The 802.11ac amendment achieves data rates ranging from 433 Mbps to nearly
7 Gbps at the cost of using a minimum of from 80 to 160 MHz of bandwidth per channel.

It also allows between two and eight radios to transmit a maximum of eight spatial streams
per AP. If all eight radios are present in an AP and not all are being used to communicate
with a client device, the additional spatial streams can be used to communicate with other
client devices simultaneously. The 802.11ac amendment only works in the 5 GHz U-NII
band, given that the ISM 2.4 GHz band has only a total of 83.5 MHz of bandwidth
available.
The IEEE 802.11ad standardization effort was spawned by the WiGig Alliance specification,
which you learned about in Chapter 6. The goal is to expand the 802.11 standard to work
in the 60 GHz band while maintaining backward compatibility with 802.11 in both the ISM
and U-NII bands simultaneously.
Expanding WLAN Functionality
Thus far, this book has focused on two primary WLAN hardware components: APs and
WLAN interfaces on client devices. In this section, you will learn about other types of devices
that expand the functionality of WLANs and improve the ability of IT staff to manage and
support WLANs in large companies.
As you know, the signal range of a WLAN is limited to a few hundred feet. An optional com-
ponent of WLANs, wireless bridges, are specifically designed to interconnect two wired net-
works or to extend the range of a WLAN beyond its maximum range.
Wireless Bridges and Repeaters
Wireless bridges are the ideal solution for connecting such sites as remote campus buildings
or temporary office locations, especially when there are such obstacles as roads or railroads,
which make using a wired connection impractical or too expensive. For 802.11 bridges, the
distance between buildings can be up to 18 miles (29 kilometers) when transmitting at 11
Mbps or up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) when transmitting at 2 Mbps. In point-to-point,
802.11a wireless bridges can transmit at 54 Mbps at distances of up to 8.5 miles (13.5 kilo-
meters) or at 28 Mbps at up to 20 miles (32 kilometers). IEEE 802.11a wireless bridges typi-
cally operate in the U-NII High band, between 5.725 and 5.825 GHz, which is only
approved for outdoor applications and can use very-high-power transmitters when deployed
with directional antennas.
At 11 Mbps, remote wireless bridges are several times faster and a
fraction of the cost of high-speed digital communication lines that
are available from telephone carriers.
When used to interconnect two buildings, wireless bridges are typically deployed in a point-
to-point configuration, as illustrated in Figure 8-18.

For long-distance links, in which the signal may take longer to arrive at the receiver, trans-
mitting wireless bridges can extend the SIFS time, thereby allowing the receiver enough time
to acknowledge a frame. (Recall that the ACK is always sent after the SIFS.) Extending the
SIFS means that wireless bridges operate without fully conforming to the 802.11 standards.
This is only possible in a point-to-point configuration.
WLAN Extension Wireless bridges can also extend the range of a WLAN. A bridge is a
device that can also be configured to connect to an AP as a repeater in point-to-multipoint
mode. Client devices that are out of the range of the access point can associate with the
bridge, which will receive and acknowledge each frame sent by the AP or by the client,
then forward the frame to the AP or client, depending on the direction of the transmission.
Some manufacturers’ APs can also be connected as a repeater or as a bridge. Before pur-
chasing an access point for this purpose, you should carefully check the user manual to
make sure it meets your requirements.
One thing that a network designer must keep in mind is the amount of extra delay intro-
duced in WLAN extension applications. Because the device configured as the repeater must
receive each frame correctly, acknowledge it, then wait the appropriate number of back-off
time slots for its next turn to communicate, certain kinds of applications running on the cli-
ent may not be able to tolerate the resulting additional transmission delay. In addition, you
must consider that this increased delay effectively cuts the throughput in half. This means
that in a WLAN operating at 300 Mbps, the maximum throughput is reduced to as little as
75 Mbps.
Wireless Controllers
When a large number of APs are deployed throughout a building or campus, managing these
devices remotely can become very difficult. Most configuration settings can be distributed

and administered remotely, but physical problems such as network connectivity and hard-
ware failures may demand that a technician be sent to the location—an expensive way to
provide support.
In addition, APs often need to be deployed in branch offices, which increases the support
delays and cost. The more features an AP has, the more complex it can be to configure and
maintain; also, signal coverage and strength are more difficult to monitor remotely.
An alternative way to simplify the management of a wireless network is to use a wireless
controller. Wireless controllers are devices that incorporate most of the functions of an AP
but do not have any radios. They connect to multiple, less-complex APs either via direct
cable connection or, for remote locations, via a logical network connection. These simpler
APs consist of PHY-layer devices (radios) with some MAC-layer functionality. The wireless
controller handles the interface and communications with the wired LAN and most of the
MAC-layer functionality.
This way, the management of a WLAN is effectively centralized. The network administrator
configures the WLAN on the wireless controller, including the parameters of the radios,
and the configuration is then pushed to the APs. If an AP fails, the controller is able to adjust
the transmit power on two nearby APs to restore signal coverage to the area previously
served by the failed AP. Extra APs can be set up as monitoring devices to detect the presence
of unauthorized APs as well as to monitor the quality of the wireless signals.
Quality-of-service (QoS) features incorporated into the wireless controllers can make it easier to
deploy VoWLAN, which enables users to make calls while roaming in an ESS. Wireless con-
trollers can greatly simplify the deployment and continuous management of large WLANs.
For additional information on wireless controllers, see www.aruba
networks.com, www.cisco.com, and www.meraki.com and search
for their wireless products. Meraki is among a few WLAN equipment
manufacturers that do not make a hardware-based controller.
Instead, its APs are managed via the Internet (i.e., using cloud-based
software controllers).
Other WLAN Expansion Hardware
The explosive growth in the WLAN market spawned an entirely new range of devices for the
wireless home and office. However, with the introduction of the latest IEEE 802.11 standards,
as well as the WMM specification from the Wi-Fi Alliance that is intended to support audio
and video, many of the products that were specifically built for distributing media or connect-
ing computers and media projectors for business or classroom use are being discontinued.
With the exception of media players like Apple TV, Western Digital’s WDTV Live, and
others, products that simply take advantage of an existing WLAN in a home or office are
replacing most of the dedicated devices today.
WLAN Security
No discussion of WLANs is complete without looking at the topic of security. Broadcasting
network traffic over EM waves has created an entirely new set of issues for keeping data

transmissions secure. It is no secret to IT professionals that the security provisions in the orig-
inal IEEE 802.11 were seriously flawed. This section introduces a few types of network
attacks and additional measures that have been engineered by the IEEE and Wi-Fi Alliance
to improve WLAN security.
It is important to keep in mind that these measures apply equally to wireless networks,
regardless of the standards they use. Because the standards define how data is transmitted
at the PHY layer, the security implementations are analogous to those in an Ethernet net-
work. However, because the WLAN transmissions utilize a medium that is not contained
in any way, a WLAN is far more exposed to intrusion, jamming, and hijacking of the
information.
No security setup can prevent all potential breaches. Security must always be viewed as a
work-in-progress. Network administrators must check systems and logs regularly to
ensure that the security features have not been compromised. For example, a user who
often travels with a laptop computer may temporarily reconfigure his system to solve an
immediate problem connecting to another network, thereby potentially exposing the cor-
porate WLAN to security attacks and breaches unless specific measures are taken to pro-
tect the network.
Attacks Against WLANs
A variety of attacks can be generated against WLANs. Some of the more dangerous are hard-
ware theft, AP impersonation, passive monitoring, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, all dis-
cussed in this section.
The theft of a laptop computer is a threat because the device may contain information—for
example, the security key and passwords—that can be used to break into a network.
AP impersonation takes advantage of a problem with legacy 802.11 WLANs, which is that
clients authenticate themselves with the APs but the APs do not authenticate themselves with
clients. When a rogue AP or software installed on a laptop computer impersonates a valid
AP, thereby tricking clients into associating with it, information from the clients can be mon-
itored and security keys broken. AP impersonation can also form the basis for other types of
security attacks targeted at specific devices on the WLAN, such as using software on a laptop
PC to impersonate an AP by spoofing the AP’s MAC address and other parameters. This
type of attack is called man-in-the-middle.
Passive monitoring, in which an attacker simply captures data transmissions, can also be used
to acquire information, such as the MAC and IP addresses of APs and wireless clients. Over
time, the attacker can build a profile of the WLAN and may be able to use this information
to break into the network. An attacker can use a wireless sniffer to capture enough frames to
decode the security key. Although this requires capturing perhaps several million frames
(depending on the type of security key used) and can consume a huge amount of computer
processing power, it can be done, especially if an attacker is targeting a particular company
and has plenty of time to spare. Because the frames used to associate with the WLAN are
not always encrypted, they can be intercepted and important data collected to help create an
attack. An unauthorized user can use this information to flood the network with transmis-
sions directed at one or more devices. This is one example of a DoS attack that can effec-
tively deny other devices access to the WLAN.

DoS attacks and AP impersonation can be easily detected and avoided through the use of
special equipment or software such as AirMagnet Enterprise (see www.airmagnet.com) or
AirCheck (see www.flukenetworks.com). Although the equipment and software can cost
$2,500 or more, it can prove a worthwhile investment if the company is subject to an attack,
which may end up costing a lot more in lost productivity or failure to comply with privacy
laws (in cases where information is stolen). Another way to prevent these types of attacks is
to deploy an external authentication mechanism such as those outlined in 802.1X and
802.11i, described later in this chapter.
802.11 Security
The IEEE 802.11 standard defines basic security measures along with support for encryption.
Authentication in 802.11 is essentially limited to the client devices being authenticated by the AP.
However, the clients do not authenticate the AP and therefore do not know whether they are con-
nected to an enterprise or an attacker’s computer impersonating one of the company’s APs.
Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying that the client device has permission to access the
network. Although authentication is important in wired LANs, it is even more important in
WLANs because of the open nature of wireless transmissions.
IEEE 802.11 WLANs provide a very basic means of authenticating potential client devices.
Each WLAN client can be given the SSID of the network. This value is transmitted to the
AP when the client is negotiating permission to connect to the network. Only those clients
that know the SSID are then authenticated as valid users and are allowed to connect to the
network.
A wireless client can be given an SSID in one of two ways. First, the SSID can be manually
entered into the wireless client device. Once it is entered, anyone who has access to that wire-
less device can see the SSID and pass this information along to other people. By default, APs
freely advertise the SSID to any mobile device that comes within the range of the AP’s wire-
less radio and can decode the beacon frames.
An administrator can configure the APs to not broadcast the SSID. However, keep in
mind that when a client transmits a probe frame, the AP is required by the 802.11 stan-
dard to send a probe response frame that includes the SSID of the network. An attacker
using a simple tool like Metageek’s InSSIDer software, which sends probe request
frames to all APs it detects, has access to all the information contained in the probe
response frames.
Privacy
Privacy is different from authentication. Authentication ensures that the user (or device) has
permission to be part of the network. Privacy is a collection of processes that attempts to
ensure that unauthorized users cannot understand wireless transmissions. This is accom-
plished with data encryption, which scrambles the data in a way that it cannot be read and
can only be decoded by the intended recipient, who also has access to the encryption key

and can decode the message. The strength of encryption rests not only on keeping the keys
secret but also with the length of the key itself. The longer the key is, the stronger the encryp-
tion, because longer keys are more difficult to break. The trade-off is that stronger encryption
increases the number of octets transmitted, which in turn decreases the overall throughput of
the WLAN.
Wired Equivalent Privacy
The 802.11-1997 standard provided an optional specification called Wired Equivalent Privacy
(WEP) that is used to encrypt the data between wireless devices to prevent eavesdropping.
WEP encryption comes in two versions: 64-bit encryption and 128-bit encryption. The for-
mer uses a 40-bit key (5 bytes or 10 hexadecimal digits) plus a 24-bit initialization vector
(IV), which is part of the encryption key sent in clear text, before the encrypted data. Like-
wise, 128-bit encryption uses a 104-bit key plus a 24-bit IV. Some vendors offered 256-bit
encryption in their equipment; however, the equipment uses the same 24-bit IV. Also, with
256-bit encryption, there may be compatibility problems among equipment sold by different
manufacturers.
In 2001, researchers at various universities outlined just how an attacker could collect the
necessary data for breaking WEP encryption. By late 2001, they were able to decrypt the
128-bit WEP key used in a WLAN transmission in less than two hours. And in 2005, the
time was reduced to less than two minutes when the attacker was able to capture around
200,000 frames. WEP uses a weak implementation of the RC4 encryption algorithm that
was developed by Ron Rivest for RSA Data Security, Inc.; except in the case of home net-
works, it is seldom used today.
Wi-Fi Protected Access
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a standard for network authentication and encryption intro-
duced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in response to the weaknesses of WEP. WPA uses a 128-bit pre-
shared key (PSK), also known as “Personal mode,” which needs to be manually added to the
configuration of every device that will be connected to the WLAN. Unlike WEP, which only
varies the 24-bit IV, WPA-PSK uses a different encryption key for each client device, for each
packet, and for each communications session.
WPA-PSK is not suitable for larger companies with many client devices because the pass-
phrase has to be created by the user and manually entered on both the AP and clients. Strong
passphrases should be longer than 8 bytes and should include a mixture of letters, numbers,
and non-alphanumeric characters. The passphrase is used by the hardware to generate an
encryption key. This key is rotated, based on a user-configurable timer that is often set to
300 seconds by manufacturers. This mode does not offer the same level of protection as
enterprise class systems that rely on an authentication server installed somewhere else on
the network.
WPA employs the temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP), which provides per-packet key-
mixing. In addition, TKIP provides message integrity check (MIC), which uses a combina-
tion of variable and static data items, such as the current network uptime (not based on
current clock time) and other data items, to ensure that the encrypted data has not been
tampered with. With WEP, it was possible to tamper with the encrypted data without the
302

possibility of detection. MIC verifies that an attacker has not modified the data sent by the
source device.
TKIP uses a 48-bit hashed initialization vector and also changes the key after a user-specified
amount of time. WPA includes the mechanism necessary for the AP to change the keys and
transmit the new key to all client devices.
WPA2 is the WPA version that the IEEE certified as compatible with IEEE 802.11i, which is
described in the next section. It adds support for the advanced encryption standard (AES),
which meets U.S. government security requirements. However, because AES requires addi-
tional processing power, it may not be supported by older hardware.
The Wi-Fi Alliance also has certification programs for WPA and
WPA2. Vendors use these programs to verify that their equipment
complies with the standard and to ensure that it will interoperate
with equipment from other vendors. Vendors pay the Wi-Fi Alliance
and supply equipment for the interoperability tests. In exchange, if
the equipment passes all tests, vendors are allowed to add the “Wi-Fi CERTIFIED” logo to
their equipment, packaging, brochures, and other promotional material.
IEEE 802.11i and IEEE 802.1X
The 802.11i amendment, ratified in June 2004, was the result of a series of efforts to deal
with the security weaknesses of the original WLAN standard. In combination with IEEE
802.1X, IEEE 802.11i defines a Robust Security Network Association (RSNA), which is a
grouping of several security functions that protects data frames by providing mutual
authentication between client devices and access points, controlled access to the network,
establishment of security keys, and key management. Although full coverage of 802.11i and
802.1X is beyond the scope of this text, you can obtain more information by downloading
the 802.1X and 802.11i standards documents from http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/
index.html.
802.1X is part of the IEEE 802.1 group of network standards and
applies to wired as well as wireless networks. However, 802.1X is
not an amendment to any standard; it is a set of recommendations
for implementation of RSNA.
In 802.11i, a client device must be authenticated on the network by an external authen-
tication server—such as a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS), a
popular method of authenticating users on a network—before associating with an AP.
Another option is for the client to be authenticated by an authentication server similar
to RADIUS but provided by the AP itself. All communication between the client
device and the AP is blocked until the authentication process is completed. After the
authentication process is completed, data protection through encryption and MIC are
enabled. Only then is the client association with the AP allowed and communication
unblocked. Figure 8-19 shows a diagram of a typical network employing an authentica-
tion server.

RADIUS software is available from many different vendors and also in a
free version called FreeRADIUS. The “Dial In” portion of the RADIUS
acronym is a holdover from the old telephone-line modem days.
RADIUS is applicable to wired as well as wireless networks. FreeRADIUS
is available for download from many Internet sites and is supported by
a variety of networking devices, including APs, routers, and so on.
802.1X uses the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for relaying access requests
between a wireless device, the AP, and the RADIUS server. There are several variations of
EAP, each supporting a different authentication method and its associated network security
policy. For EAP to work, all three devices must support the same authentication method.
When EAP is used, the network administrator does not need to configure a WPA passphrase
or WEP key in each computer. The RADIUS server provides the key to the wireless device
and AP. This saves configuration effort and time both initially and when the key has to be
changed for any reason. It also indirectly verifies to the client device that it is communicating
with an authorized AP.
Push-Button Wireless Security
Because many home users who install wireless networks fail to set up proper security, leaving
their networks exposed to potential attackers, a few vendors have joined forces to create a
new method of configuring wireless residential gateways as well as client devices. Although
each vendor’s method has a different name or acronym, all of them provide an additional

which only then allows the client

button on the front panel of the wireless gateway or in the configuration software that automat-
ically configures the security settings in both the wireless gateway and the client device. Keep in
mind that to take advantage of push-button wireless security, both the wireless NIC and the AP
or gateway must support the feature. The button needs to be activated once on each device, and
for each client, one at a time. The feature transfers the security key to the wireless NIC, then
automatically establishes a connection with the wireless device. If you are using wireless NICs
and gateways from different vendors, check first to make sure this feature is compatible.
Virtual Private Networks
Virtual private networks (VPNs) use an encrypted connection to create a virtual tunnel
between two points across a public or corporate network. VPNs using strong encryption
algorithms, such as AES, are the most secure method of implementing a wireless network.
Due to the encryption requirements, VPNs consume a large amount of processing resources,
thus some time-sensitive client-server applications may not perform acceptably in a VPN
environment. In these cases, wireless networks should be secured using one of the techniques
described previously in this chapter. However, employees who use wireless-equipped portable
computers to access a company network through the Internet from remote locations should
do so only through a VPN. Most public wireless networks are not secure, and this can
expose corporate data—such as e-mails and even customer names and addresses—to an
attacker. In fact, if VPNs are not implemented properly, the entire corporate network can be
exposed to attacks from the Internet. Disabling access to the Internet when users log in to the
corporate network through a VPN avoids this problem, so most VPNs are set up in this way.
Additional WLAN Security Tactics
In addition to the security strategies discussed in the previous section, you can increase
WLAN security by reducing WLAN transmission power. However, keep in mind that an
attacker equipped with a high-gain directional antenna would still be able to detect the RF
signal. Changing the default security settings on the APs is probably the most important first
step. Don’t forget antivirus and antispyware software. Mobile wireless clients are exposed to
more of these threats when operating outside company offices and can introduce those
threats into your wired network.
For highly secure WLANs, you may need to separate WLAN transmissions from wired net-
work traffic by placing a firewall between the WLAN and the wired LAN, although this
means that you will need to implement virtual local area networks (VLANs) in order to
allow authorized users to access the wired network. This is especially important if you allow
guest wireless devices to connect to your WLAN.
Chapter Summary
■Operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency range, 802.11b has a maximum data rate of
11 Mbps and has been widely deployed, though mostly for residential applications.
However, the ISM band is crowded and subject to interference from other networking
technologies, cordless phones, and Bluetooth.
■The 802.11a standard has a maximum rated speed of 54 Mbps and also supports 48,
36, 24, 18, 12, 9, and 6 Mbps. 802.11a achieves its increase in speed and flexibility

over 802.11b through a higher frequency, more transmission channels, and a new
multiplexing technique.
■IEEE 802.11a networks use the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)
band. The total bandwidth available for IEEE 802.11a WLANs using U-NII is 555
MHz, almost seven times what is available for 802.11b networks using the ISM band.
■In 802.11a, 23 frequency channels can operate simultaneously. Each frequency chan-
nel is 20 MHz wide and supports 52 subcarriers 300 KHz wide. Because there are
more available channels, more users can access more bandwidth in an 802.11a
WLAN, when managed correctly.
■IEEE 802.11b WLAN reception is slowed down by multipath distortion. The 802.11a
standard solves this problem through a new multiplexing technique called orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM transmits several bits at a slower
rate, in parallel, across several subcarriers instead of sending a long stream of data
across a single channel. This increases the data rate while reducing the multipath pro-
blems created by higher speed transmissions in 802.11b.
■OFDM uses 48 of the 52 subcarriers for data, with the remaining four used for moni-
toring and error correction. The modulation techniques used to encode the data vary
depending upon the speed.
■The number of errors in an 802.11a transmission is significantly reduced compared to
802.11b. Error correction is enhanced using forward error correction (FEC). IEEE 802.11a
also transmits a secondary, redundant copy of the data, which helps to increase reliability.
■The 802.11a standard made changes only to the Physical layer (PHY layer) of the
original 802.11 and 802.11b standard; the MAC layer remains the same. The 802.11a
PHY layer is divided into two parts: the Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer
and the Physical Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP). The PMD covers the charac-
teristics of the wireless medium and defines the method for transmitting and receiving
(OFDM) data through that medium. The PLCP reformats the data received from the
MAC layer (when transmitting) into a frame that the PMD sublayer can transmit and
listens to the medium to determine when the data can be sent.
■IEEE 802.11g preserves the features of 802.11b but increases the data transfer rates to
those of 802.11a. The 802.11g amendment operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency
band and not the U-NII band used by 802.11a.
■The 802.11e amendment adds QoS to the original 802.11 standard. In addition, it
helps improve performance through burst acknowledgements and two new coordina-
tion functions: enhanced DCF (EDCF) and hybrid coordination function (HCF).
■The 802.11n amendment increases the data rate up to 600 Mbps using either the 2.4
GHz ISM or the 5 GHz U-NII band. This is accomplished by bonding two frequency
channels for up to 40 MHz of bandwidth using OFDM, and transmitting up to four
simultaneous data streams using a different radio and a different antenna. To maintain
backward compatibility with 802.11a/b/g, 802.11n includes a number of MAC
enhancements called protection mechanisms.
■The 802.11r amendment enables fast roaming and reduces the time required for a
device to associate with a new AP from hundreds of milliseconds to less than
50 milliseconds. This permits WLANs to effectively support VoWLAN in ESS
306

environments. It also allows a client device, prior to establishing a connection, to obtain
information from multiple APs regarding bandwidth availability and security features.
■The 802.11s amendment enables APs to communicate and pass traffic from one to the
other, over a wireless connection, supporting cost-effective deployment of extensive
mesh WLANs over a larger geographical area without the need to connect every AP to
the wired network.
■The 802.11ac amendment boosts the speed of WLANs up to nearly 7 Gbps using the
U-NII band and between 80 and 160 MHz of bandwidth.
■The new 802.11ad amendment operates in the 60 GHz band for short-range connec-
tions at up to 7 Gbps but remains backward compatible with 802.11a/ac/b/g/n, being
able to also transmit in the U-NII and ISM bands.
■WLANs can suffer a range of security attacks. IEEE WLANs require enhanced security
measures. WLAN security has been greatly enhanced through the introduction of
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2).
■WLANs can be protected against attacks through the use of VPNs, 802.11i authenti-
cation, and 802.1X security measures. Authentication is a process for verifying that
the user has permission to access the network and ensuring that the client device is
communicating with an authorized AP. Privacy is a collection of data-encryption
processes for ensuring that unauthorized persons do not read transmissions.

Hands-On Project
Project 8-1
This project covers the basic configuration of an 802.11n-capable residential
gateway or AP. You can do this project using any manufacturer’s device. The
brand of the equipment is not important, because in the real world you will
likely be configuring a variety of different equipment makes and models. Although the con-
figuration screens will be different than the ones shown in the figures, the point of the exer-
cise is for you to understand which configuration items to modify and how these will affect
the speed and performance of the wireless links.
The devices used to create this exercise are a DLink DIR-825 simultaneous dual-band
(2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) wireless residential gateway and a Dell Latitude E4300 Notebook
PC, but virtually any type of wireless residential gateway and PC compatible with 802.11n
will work. To keep it simple, a wireless residential gateway (hereafter called “gateway”) was
used to create this project. The project covers only those settings that are relevant and
assumes you already know (from Chapter 7) how to perform the basic configuration steps
and connect a computer with a wireless NIC to the gateway.
1.
Connect your computer to the gateway for configuration purposes. Whenever possible,
you should use a wired connection to change settings on a gateway or access point.
Some of the settings, such as security, will cause your computer to disconnect until you
reconfigure it to use the new settings.
2.
Consult the documentation for your gateway on how to configure the wireless settings
manually. Even if a configuration wizard is available, it often does not provide you

dures for manual configuration. Figure 8-20 shows an example of the settings you need

Configure a unique SSID for your WLAN. Consult with your instructor if there are
other devices being used in the same classroom.

It is usually better, especially in 802.11n, to allow the gateway to automatically select
the channel, but you can select the channel manually, if you prefer, keeping in mind
that, with more than two gateways in the same room, there are really only two usable
channels, 1 and 6, and that interference will affect the overall performance of your wire-
less link.
5.
To achieve data rates of up to 300 Mbps, you need to configure the gateway to use
Auto 20/40MHz. Make sure you turn off any devices in the room—cellular phones,
etc.—that only support 802.11g and therefore can only use 20 MHz of bandwidth.
Otherwise, you may find that your gateway will only use 20 MHz. This is because
every time a broadcast frame is transmitted, the gateway needs to send it in a way that
is compatible with non-802.11n devices.

You will not need to transfer any files to determine the data rate for the connection.
Windows 7 will provide this information in the Wireless Network Connection Status
dialog box. To get to this dialog box, click the wireless network icon on the bottom-
right-hand side of the screen and click Open Network and Sharing Center. On the
right-hand side of the window, click Wireless Network Connection. Figure 8-21 shows
the Wireless Network Connection Status dialog box.

You will see the data rate beside the label “Speed.” If your data rate is showing any-
thing less than 300 Mbps, you may need to modify the configuration of the NIC. To
do this, click the Properties button at the bottom of the Wireless Network Connection
Status dialog box (not the Wireless Properties button). This will open the Wireless Net-
work Connection Properties dialog box.

Click the Configure … button next to the name of your wireless NIC. Click the
Advanced tab. Note that some NIC manufacturers do not provide you with the abil-
ity to configure advanced parameters on the NIC from this dialog box, in which
case you may need to use the manufacturer’s utility, which should be installed
when you install your NIC. There is no industry standard for configuring these
parameters, so each manufacturer’s adapters may use different parameter names,
etc. Figure 8-22 shows an example of the dialog box displayed for the Dell Wireless
1510 WLAN Mini-Card. Make a note of all the current settings for your card
before changing any values, and then make sure that it is configured for 802.11n
and for 20/40 Mhz. Try changing some of the settings that appear to be related to
bandwidth or standard support and observe the results you get when communicat-
ing on the WLAN.

you can use the same tools you used for the Chapter 7 Challenge Case Project.
Alternatively, you can go to www.openmaniak.com/iperf and review the tutorial
on how to use Iperf tools to measure the bandwidth and quality of a network link. Then
download and install Iperf from sourceforge.net/projects/iperf.
Using the hardware and configuration you set up for Hands-On Project 8-1, measure the net-
work’s performance before configuring security and encryption. Record your results. Next,
configure your gateway to use WPA2 with AES encryption and measure the performance
again. Then write a one-page report outlining any differences in performance that you
encounter. Be sure to calculate and provide a brief comparison of how long it would take to
copy a 10 MB or larger file.

By now, you understand the tremendous impact that wireless communications has
and will continue to have on the world around us. Wireless networks allow users to be con-
nected as they move about, freeing them from cables and phone lines. However, the WPANs
and WLANs you have learned about thus far have restricted user mobility to homes, offices,
or campuses, allowing them to roam from only a few feet to a few hundred feet from the
source of the RF signal. Limits on the strength of these RF signals, mandated by the regula-
tory authorities and designed to prevent interference in the unlicensed bands, are the main
reason for this restriction. Users have also been subject to line-of-sight limitations. There-
fore, except for voice communications and data over cellular networks, user mobility has
remained largely confined to homes, offices, and hotspots that offer wireless access, which
include coffee shops and airports as well as the core downtown areas of a few cities that
have deployed Wi-Fi networks.
In small towns and remote areas, the relatively small number of wireless network users may
not make it economically viable to implement hotspots and mobile access. In fact, in areas
with low user density, the cost of installing wired high-speed communications channels over
long distances often prevents telephone companies or small ISPs from offering high-speed
Internet access at all.
In this chapter, you will learn about technologies and standards that allow wireless access to
expand beyond a few hundred feet—to connect buildings several miles apart, for example,
or an entire city. The chapter begins with coverage of infrared (IR)-based short-distance and
medium-distance technologies and concludes with standards for medium-distance and long-
distance RF-based WMAN technologies.
What Is a WMAN?
Wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs) are a group of technologies that provide
wireless connectivity across a substantial geographical area such as a large city. WMANs
have two primary goals:
●
To extend the reach of existing wired networks beyond a single location without the
expense of deploying and maintaining high-speed wire or optical-cable-based
connections.
●
To extend user mobility throughout a metropolitan area. An important additional
benefit of a WMAN is that it can provide high-speed connections, including Internet,
to areas not serviced by any other method of connectivity. Such connectivity can
encompass metropolitan areas, expanding to small towns nearby, as well as to remote
locations not usually serviced by high-speed communications lines.
Last Mile Wired Connections
A last mile connection is typically defined as the link between an end-user and an ISP. Even
today, most last mile connections are based on some type of copper wiring; more recently,
they are based on optical fiber cables. As of April 2012, only about 19.3 million homes in
the United States are directly connected to fiber networks, and only a very small number of
office buildings are wired for cable TV. In spite of its exceptional reliability for data commu-
nications, fiber optics is slow, inconvenient, and expensive to install; most important of all,
318

it is costly to maintain, especially in regions where the ground freezes and thaws once or
twice a year, which can damage buried cables. Figure 9-1 shows an example of an
overhead-wire last mile connection.
Today, home users in large metropolitan areas can take advantage of both DSL at up to
16 Mbps and cable-TV connections at up to 105 Mbps. However, these types of connec-
tions are usually not available in small, remote communities. Business users do have a
few other options beyond basic copper wiring, however. As you have learned, ISDN,
T1, and DSL technologies offer higher data rates, are widely available, and are wire based.
Similar to T1 is T3, which is a faster but more expensive digital line. Table 9-1 summarizes
some of the connection options and speeds for homes, office buildings, and Internet service
providers.

For long-distance connections between cities and states, copper-based digital communications
lines, such as T1, require the signal to be regenerated every 6,000 feet (1.8 kilometers). In
addition to the challenges of cable installation and maintenance, regenerating the signal
requires electrical power at each repeater location. Maintenance costs for this type of connec-
tion are extremely high, especially where the geography or the environmental conditions (e.g.,
mountainous or desert areas) are challenging.
Last mile delivery of telephone and data lines has long been a problem for the carriers (i.e.,
the providers and operators) of the networks, who must be able to justify the cost of instal-
ling wired connections in remote areas. In previous chapters, you learned that “carrier” refers
to the RF signal that carries data. The term also refers to telephone, cable TV, and other
communications-provider companies that own the wires and transmission towers that carry
voice and data traffic.
Since the early 1980s, fiber-optic technology has largely replaced all other technologies for
connections between major metropolitan centers, mainly because it has a higher capacity for
carrying voice and data transmissions, lower maintenance requirements, and is much more
reliable than copper wiring. However, the higher costs of the fiber-optic medium and in-
ground installation often preclude its use in remote and less-populated areas. Fiber-optic
cables are also used to carry voice and data traffic across the world’s oceans. Submarine
fiber-optic cables span practically the entire globe and are laid and maintained by specialized
ships and crews. The cost of deploying and maintaining these cables is extremely high, but
today the world is heavily dependent on them. For more information, search for “submarine
cable” on the Internet.
Last Mile Wireless Connections
Most of the technologies used in WMANs and last mile wireless connections are based on
microwave signals, but they also include infrared light. Microwaves are higher frequency RF
waves with transmission taking place in the 3–30 GHz range of the electromagnetic spec-
trum, which is known as the super high frequency (SHF) band. Microwaves were introduced
in the early 1950s by AT&T and brought about a new era in communications. Originally,
they were used to transmit data in a point-to-point fashion, using the lower and middle por-
tions of the SHF band. The conventional thinking in the early days was that the lower-
frequency, high-powered approach was the only way in which microwaves could be used
for communication. High-frequency microwave technology was ignored for many years, and
the section of the RF spectrum between 27.5 and 29.5 GHz went virtually unused.
Microwave towers are installed roughly 35 miles (56 kilometers) apart from each other, and
a link operating at 4 GHz carries about 1,800 voice calls simultaneously. In comparison, a
T1 link can carry only 24 simultaneous voice calls. Improvements in microwave technology
have reduced the cost of the equipment and have made telephone and data communications
services available in many remote locations across the United States that were previously out
of range of high-capacity connections.
The first transcontinental microwave link was completed in 1951, con-
necting New York and San Francisco. It used 107 towers spaced
about 30 miles (48 kilometers) apart, covering a distance of about
3,200 miles (5,140 kilometers). The same link using T1 digital copper-
based lines requires over 2,850 repeaters to regenerate the signal.

The options for WMANs and last mile connections include Free Space Optics, RF-based
(microwave) local multipoint distribution service, and multichannel multipoint distribution
service as well as WiMAX, and they are discussed in the remainder of this chapter. The
advantages of these types of wireless connections are that they can cost less, can be installed
relatively quickly, offer greater flexibility, and have better long-term reliability. Using wireless
as the last mile connection for buildings is called fixed wireless because buildings are fixed in
one location.
Fixed wireless networks have been used for several years for both voice and data commu-
nications, generally in backhaul networks operated by telephone companies, cable TV
companies, utilities, railways, paging companies, and government agencies. A backhaul
connection is a company’s internal infrastructure connection. For example, a phone com-
pany’s backhaul network may be a connection from one telephone company central office
to another. Cellular telephone towers along highways are often interconnected using a
microwave backhaul link.
Fixed wireless systems can be used to transmit the same type of data that is sent over a
wired cable system. However, point-to-point long-distance microwave links, such as
those employed by telephone carriers, use high-power signals that are not suitable or
safe for use in crowded city skylines. In addition, microwaves require licensed frequencies,
which carry a high cost, and spectrum availability may be very limited in busy metropolitan
areas.
In Chapter 8, you learned that WLAN equipment such as 802.11 wireless bridges can be set
up to connect two buildings provided the installation does not interfere with other wireless
links using the same unlicensed RF bands. Installation of longer-distance connections with
this technology—beyond the range of Wi-Fi (375 feet)—is possible but can be a lot more
complicated. In addition to loss of speed as the distance increases, 802.11 technologies are
designed to support only a single repeater link, which means that a maximum of three
bridges can be used between two destination points. Achieving line of sight between two
directional antennas is difficult or may not be possible due to tower height limitations in met-
ropolitan areas. Additionally, the throughput of a single 802.11 frequency channel is typi-
cally only enough to carry a limited amount of data, such as e-mail, Web browsing, and
moderate file transfers, mainly due to the half-duplex characteristic of wireless bridges.
Although using multiple bridge links to increase bandwidth can alleviate the problem, it
tends to make antenna installation far more complicated because you would have to align
multiple pairs of directional antennas instead of just one.
Baseband vs. Broadband
Another point to consider when designing wireless links is that there are two ways in
which digital signals can be transmitted over a wireless medium. The first is called broad-
band transmission, in which multiple signals are simultaneously sent over the medium
at different frequencies. An example of broadband transmission is cable TV, in which
multiple entertainment channels are sent on a single cable. When you pick a channel to
watch, the TV set filters out all other frequencies and decodes and displays a single
channel.
The second technique is called baseband transmission. Baseband treats the entire transmis-
sion medium as if it were only one channel and transmits only one data signal at a time
9

over a single frequency. An example of baseband transmission is Ethernet, in which digi-
tal signals are sent over a cable. Ethernet 100BaseT, for example, means 100 Mbps, base-
band signaling using twisted pair cabling. As you learned in Chapter 2, digital signals use
a change in voltage to represent a 1 or a 0. You can change the voltage differential between
two wires on a cable, but you cannot transmit this change over an analog medium such as
an EM wave, which is an analog medium. To transmit digital signals over an analog
medium, you need to modulate a carrier wave to represent a change between a 1 and a 0.
The examples just given describe the differences between broadband and baseband trans-
missions over a cable, but keep in mind that transmissions over an analog medium (such
as EM waves) can be sent as broadband or baseband. Purely digital signals can only be
transmitted over a wire as baseband, because mixing multiple voltage changes on a cable
would create different bit patterns and corrupt the data, given that there is no way to
separate one signal from the other. However, if you modulate multiple digital signals over
different carrier frequencies, they can be transmitted over any analog medium. The receiver
can then separate each frequency using filters and decode each of the digital signals
individually.
Note also that there is no predefined frequency bandwidth separating baseband from broad-
band. For example, the wider the bandwidth, the more frequencies are available to transmit
separate channels of data using frequency division multiplexing. Alternatively, broadband
transmissions can be made using time division multiplexing. Both methods can be considered
broadband transmission. In comparison, a baseband transmission consists of only one data
channel.

Land-Based Fixed Broadband Wireless
The data communications industry has developed a few different solutions for last mile con-
nections over the past few decades. Some have proven too costly and were hard to justify.
Others have proved to be less than 100 percent reliable for implementation in all locations,
as explained later in this chapter. Most are proprietary solutions or RF-based equipment that
require licensed frequency bands. Until 2001, RF-based fixed broadband systems operated at
frequencies and with modulation techniques that limited implementation to line of sight only.
In addition, most fixed broadband systems could only send from one site to another—in other
words, they are set up in point-to-point fashion. As a comparison, in cellular telephone
systems, a single base station can communicate with several mobile devices simultaneously.
However, cellular technology was originally designed to carry multiple voice conversations
and not for high-capacity data transmissions, although this is changing today.
Faced with having to rely on land-based lines from telephone and cable TV carriers, many
companies have deployed their own building-to-building connectivity solutions. This section
begins with an IR-based solution called Free Space Optics. We look briefly at two types of
legacy proprietary last mile microwave connection technologies: local multipoint distribution
service and multichannel multipoint distribution service. Later in the chapter, you will learn
about the IEEE 802.16 group of wireless standards, which is already in use in many fixed
business wireless networks and for Internet connectivity applications. Recent enhancements to
the 802.16 standards also promise to help solve the challenges of user mobility and compete
with DSL, cable TV, and even local telephone carriers.
Free Space Optics
Free Space Optics (FSO) is an optical, wireless, point-to-point, line-of-sight broadband tech-
nology. Although it was originally developed over 30 years ago by the military, FSO has
become an excellent alternative to high-speed fiber-optic cable. Currently, FSO can transmit
at speeds comparable to fiber-optic transmissions, reaching up to 1.25 Gbps at a distance of
4 miles (6.4 kilometers) in full-duplex mode. Future improvements in the technology will
likely push the top speed to 10 Gbps and possibly beyond.
FSO uses infrared (IR) transmission instead of RF. The technology is similar to that used
with a fiber-optic cable system. A fiber-optic cable contains a very thin strand of glass called
the core, which is as thick as a human hair. Instead of transmitting electrical signals, fiber-
optic cables use light impulses. A light source, usually created by a laser or light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), flashes a light at one end of the cable that is detected at the receiving end.
Light travels at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second, so fiber-optic cable systems
can transmit large amounts of data at high speeds. In addition, these transmissions are
immune to electromagnetic interference and cannot be easily intercepted.
FSO is an alternative to fiber-optic cables. Sometimes called “fiberless optical,” FSO does
not use a medium, like a fiber-optic cable, to send and receive signals. Instead, low-
powered invisible infrared beams carry the data. These beams, which do not harm the
human eye, are transmitted by transceivers, as shown in Figure 9-3. Because FSO is a line-
of-sight technology, the transceivers are mounted in the middle or upper floors of office
buildings to provide a clear transmission path. However, unlike other technologies that

require the units to be located on an open roof (which sometimes requires leasing roof
space from the building’s owner), FSO transceivers can be mounted behind a window in
an existing office.
Under perfect conditions, such as environments free of fog, dust,
and high heat and humidity, FSO can transmit at distances of up to
6.2 miles (10 kilometers).
Recall that the lower-frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is the area in which
RF EM waves travel. The spectrum above 300 GHz is the area in which IR waves move.
FSO also uses this part of the spectrum. This higher frequency is unlicensed worldwide, so it
can be freely used. The only limitation on its use is that the radiated power must not exceed
specific limits in order to avoid harming the human eye.
FSO equipment works at either of two wavelengths. A single world-
wide wavelength will likely be standardized for these devices.

Advantages of FSO The advantages of FSO include cost, speed of installation, trans-
mission rate, and security.
FSO installations cost significantly less than installing new fiber-optic cables or even leasing
lines from a local carrier. One recent project compared the costs of installing fiber-optic
cables to FSO in three buildings. The cost to install the fiber-optic cables was almost
$400,000, compared to less than $60,000 for FSO.
FSO can be installed in days, compared to months—or sometimes years—for fiber-optic
cables, which require a series of permits from city authorities, whether installed under-
ground or strung along lampposts. In some instances, installers can set up FSO systems
over a weekend without disrupting the users.
The transmission speed for FSO can be scaled to meet users’ needs—anywhere from 10
Mbps to 1.25 Gbps. If high speeds are not required, the user does not have to pay a pre-
mium for unused capacity.
Security is a key advantage in an FSO system. IR transmissions cannot be as easily inter-
cepted and decoded as some RF transmissions.
Disadvantages of FSO The primary disadvantage of FSO is that atmospheric condi-
tions can have an impact on FSO transmissions. Scintillation is the temporal and spatial var-
iations in light intensity caused by atmospheric turbulence. Turbulence caused by wind and
temperature variations can create pockets of air with rapidly changing densities. These air
pockets can act like prisms and lenses that distort an FSO signal. Inclement weather is also
a threat. Although rain and snow can distort a signal, fog does the most damage to light-
based transmissions. Fog is composed of extremely small moisture particles that act like
prisms, scattering and breaking up the light beams.
Scintillation is readily observed in the twinkling of stars in the night
sky and the shimmering of the horizon on a hot sunny day.
FSO overcomes scintillation by sending the data in parallel streams from several separate laser
transmitters. These transmitters are all mounted in the same transceiver but are separated
from one another by distances of about 7.8 inches (200 mm). It is unlikely that, while travel-
ing to the receiver, all the parallel beams will encounter the same pocket of turbulence, given
that scintillation pockets are usually quite small. At least one of the beams will arrive at the
target node with adequate strength to be properly received. This solution is called spatial
diversity because it exploits multiple regions of air space. An example of spatial diversity is
shown in Figure 9-4, with parallel light beams coming from an FSO transmitter.
In dealing with fog, there are several potential solutions. One solution is simply to increase
the transmit power of the signal (the intensity of the light). In regions of heavy and frequent
fog, it may be necessary to choose FSO systems that transmit at the highest available fre-
quency because these devices can also emit light at higher power levels. Several vendors
also claim to customize their distance and product recommendations based on weather sta-
tistics for particular cities. Other FSO vendors use a backup (wired) connection along with
FSO to ensure that transmissions go through in foggy weather.

In order to prove that FSO can send transmissions through fog, one
vendor ran trials in some of the foggiest cities in the United States.
In San Francisco, one of the worst cities in the country for fog, one
vendor has proven that FSO can maintain carrier-class transmission
speeds (1.25 Gbps) over 90 percent of the time.
Some experts recommend that the distance between FSO transcei-
vers in regions of heavy and frequent fog should be limited to 650
to 1,640 feet (200 to 500 meters).
Signal interference can also be a problem for FSO, such as when birds fly through the
IR beam and block it. If the signal is temporarily blocked, the beam automatically
reduces its power, then raises itself to full power when the obstruction clears the
beam’s path.
Another potential problem is that storms and earthquakes can cause tall buildings to move
enough to affect the aim of the beam. This problem can be handled in two ways. In the
first method, known as “beam divergence,” the transmitted beam is purposely allowed to
spread, or diverge, so that by the time it arrives at the receiving device it forms a fairly
large optical cone. If the receiver is initially positioned at the center of the beam, divergence
can compensate for any movement of the building. The second method, known as “active
tracking,” is based on movable mirrors that are controlled by gyroscopes that, in turn, con-
trol the direction in which the beams are sent. A feedback mechanism continuously adjusts
the mirrors so that the beams stay on target.

FSO Applications There is a variety of applications for FSO. More common ones include:
●
Last mile connection—FSO can be used in high-speed links that connect end-users with
Internet service providers or other networks.
●
LAN connections—FSO devices are easily installed, making them a natural solution
for interconnecting LAN segments that are housed in buildings separated by public
streets or other obstacles, such as in a university campus spanning several city blocks.
●
Fiber-optic backup—FSO can be deployed in redundant links to back up fiber-optic
cables in case of a break in the cable.
●
Backhaul—FSO can be used to carry cellular telephone traffic from antenna towers
back to facilities wired to carrier-provided high-speed communications lines.
Most experts agree that FSO holds great potential for fixed wireless communications as well
as for other wireless applications. In spite of all the other technology developments, FSO has
remained a stable player in the wireless field.
Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS)
Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) is a fixed broadband microwave, line-of-sight
technology that can provide a wide variety of wireless services. LMDS has often been called
“wireless cable” for its ability to compete with cable TV networks in localized areas. The
services that can be provided with LMDS technology include high-speed Internet access,
real-time multimedia file transfer, remote access to local area networks, interactive video,
video-on-demand, video conferencing, and telephone service. LMDS can transmit anywhere
from 51 to 155 Mbps downstream and 1.54 Mbps upstream over a distance of up to about
5 miles (8 kilometers).
One of the best ways to explain LMDS is by examining each of the words that make up its
name:
●
Local (L)—Refers to the area of coverage of LMDS systems. Because they use high-
frequency, low-powered RF waves, these systems have a limited range. The coverage
area for LMDS is only 2–5 miles (3.2–8.0 kilometers).
●
Multipoint (M)—Indicates that signals are transmitted to the remote stations in a
point-to-multipoint fashion from a base station omnidirectional antenna. The signals
that are transmitted back from the remote stations to the base station are point-
to-point transmissions from directional antennas.
●
Distribution (D)—Refers to the distribution of the various types of information that
can be transmitted. These types include voice, data, Internet, and video traffic.
●
Service (S)—Indicates that there is a variety of services available. However, the local
carrier determines which services are offered. This means that all the services that can
be offered—voice, data, Internet, and video traffic—may not be available to the LMDS
users in each location.
Figure 9-5 shows examples of point-to-point and point-to-multipoint LMDS transmissions.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) grants LMDS
frequency band licenses to carriers for a specific area. This way, the
same frequencies can be licensed to other carriers in different areas.

Frequency Bands In 1996, the FCC began making frequency spectrum allocations for
LMDS. In 1998, the U.S. government auctioned the frequency spectrum in two blocks:
Block A, consisting of frequencies in the 27.5–28.35 GHz range, the 29.1–29.25 GHz
range, and the 31.075–31.225 GHz range, for a total of 1,150 MHz; and Block B, another
150 MHz of frequency spectrum, this in the 31–31.075 GHz range and the 31.225–31.3
GHz range. These were all allocated to LMDS on a co-primary (shared) basis.
LMDS Network Architecture Because an LMDS signal can only travel up to 5 miles
(8 kilometers), an LMDS network is composed of cells similar to a cellular telephone system.
Unlike a cellular telephone network, however, LMDS radios transmit only to fixed buildings
within the cell. There is a variety of factors that can affect the size of the LMDS cell. The
main factors that determine the cell size are line of sight, antenna height, overlapping cells,
and rainfall. An example of an LMDS cell setup is shown in Figure 9-6.
Because of the line-of-sight requirement, if the transmitting and receiving antennas can be
placed on the rooftops of tall buildings, particularly those buildings that are farthest away
from each other, then cells can typically be larger because the number of obstructions is
reduced. LMDS cells can also overlap one another to ensure better coverage.
Rainfall also determines the size of an LMDS cell. Because of the higher frequencies in
which LMDS works, signals lose strength in the presence of heavy rain or snow. To correct
this, LMDS equipment can increase the transmit power of radios to ensure a strong signal
that reaches the receivers. Most LMDS cells are sized according to the average local annual
rainfall. An LMDS cell, under ideal conditions, can be up to 5 miles (8 kilometers) across.

However, cells located in areas of heavy rainfall are between 2 and 5 miles (3.2 to 8 kilo-
meters) across.
LMDS signals are broadcast from radio hubs (transmitters) that are deployed throughout
the carrier’s market, which is the area in which the carrier has a license to use a certain fre-
quency. This area is usually limited to a city or part of a city. Each hub broadcasts signals to
buildings within its cell. The hub connects to the service provider’s central office, which in
turn can connect to other networks, such as the Internet.
At the receiving site, there are three pieces of equipment: a 12–15-inch diameter directional
antenna, a digital radio modem, and a network interface unit. The digital radio modem per-
forms digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversions. The Network Interface Unit
(NIU) connects to a local area network as well as to other services provided via a digital
wired communications line.
LMDS systems can use either Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) or Frequency Divi-
sion Multiple Access (FDMA) to share the frequency spectrum among users. The modula-
tion techniques can also vary among carriers. Most use a form of quadrature phase shift
keying (QPSK) or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).
Advantages and Disadvantages of LMDS The advantages of LMDS include
cost, service area, and data capacity. LMDS costs less to implement than fiber-optic cables.
These costs are low for both the user and the carrier. For the user, the cost is minimal to
install the antenna, modem, and NIU compared to the cost of installing fiber-optic cable.
For the carrier, LMDS is an attractive last mile solution because it allows a number of
concentrated customers that connect to a cell to access the carrier’s network at a lower

cost than wired alternatives. LMDS carriers can have as much as 1,300 MHz of spectrum
in a local market. This spectrum can simultaneously support 16,000 telephone calls and
200 video channels.
In spite of its relatively low cost and data-carrying capacity, LMDS began to face serious
competition in the late 1990s and early 21st century from the rapid development of DSL,
cable TV networks, and much-higher-capacity fiber-optics networks. Deployments were lim-
ited and today there are only a few manufacturers that still provide this type of equipment.
In most cases, today’s LMDS systems are being deployed in point-to-point fashion as a
backhaul for cellular telephone towers.
Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS)
Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) is a fixed broadband wireless tech-
nology similar to LMDS. A significant difference between the two involves transmission
capabilities. MMDS can transmit video, voice, or data signals at 1.5–2 Mbps down-
stream and 320 Kbps upstream at distances of up to 35 miles (56 kilometers), compared
to 155 Mbps downstream and 1.54 Mbps upstream at distances of up to 5 miles for
LMDS.
MMDS was designed in the 1960s to provide transmission for 33 one-way analog television
channels (simplex transmission). This multiple-channel technology (hence the term “multi-
channel”) was designed to provide long-distance learning for educational institutions. The
FCC allocated the 2.5–2.7 GHz part of the frequency band for MMDS, but in other interna-
tional markets it has been deployed in the 3.5 GHz frequency band. Unlike LMDS, MMDS
is a non-line-of-sight technology, and the signals can also penetrate walls better than LMDS
signals because of their lower transmission frequency.
The acronym “MMDS” is sometimes expanded to “Multipoint Micro-
wave Distribution System” or “Multichannel Multipoint Distribution
System.” All three terms refer to the same technology.
The original vision for MMDS never fully materialized. Private companies later purchased
part of this spectrum to compete against wired cable television companies. (MMDS is also
sometimes called wireless cable.) Using MMDS, television signals could be wirelessly beamed
to homes instead of delivered over a cable system. In the 1980s, new digital technology
allowed service providers to increase their capacity from 33 analog channels to 99 digital
channels. Later improvements in video compression and modulation techniques increased
the capacity of MMDS, enabling the technology to broadcast 300 channels.
A major change to MMDS occurred in 1998. The FCC allowed service providers to use the
200 MHz of bandwidth in the MMDS frequency bands to provide two-way services such as
wireless Internet access at the same time as voice and video transmissions. In the home, Inter-
net access using MMDS is an alternative to cable modems and DSL service, particularly in
rural areas where cabling is scarce. For businesses, MMDS is an alternative to T1 or expen-
sive fiber-optic connections, but although it can support downstream speeds of up to
1.5 Mbps, the upstream speed is only 300 Kbps, limiting its use in businesses that host their
own Web sites and other similar services.

Note that, for Internet access, most of the traffic is downstream. For example, when you are
browsing the Web, fewer packets are sent upstream to request the pages from the servers. The
amount of data transmitted from the Web servers to the user’s computer (downstream), which
may include graphics, is much larger. Most home Internet users download far more data than
they upload. This is why services such as DSL, cable Internet, and MMDS have a higher band-
width downstream and a lower bandwidth upstream. This type of communications is known
as asymmetric because there are different upstream and downstream data rates.
MMDS Network Architecture An MMDS hub (transmitter) is typically located on
a high point, such as a mountain, tower, or building. The hub uses a point-to-multipoint
architecture that multiplexes communications to multiple users. The tower has a backhaul
connection to the carrier’s network, and the carrier network connects with the Internet.
Because they operate at a lower frequency than LMDS signals, MMDS signals can
travel longer distances. This means that MMDS can provide service to an entire area with
only a few radio transmitters. MMDS uses cells, as LMDS does. However, an MMDS cell
can have a radius of up to 35 miles (56 kilometers), which covers 3,800 square miles
(9,481 square kilometers) of area. A similar area would require over 100 LMDS cells.
At the receiving location, a directional antenna approximately 13 × 13 inches (33 cm) is
aimed at the hub to receive the MMDS signal, as shown in Figure 9-7. This antenna, some-
times called a pizza box antenna, is usually installed on the roof of a building so that it has
a direct line of sight to a radio transmitter. A cable runs from the antenna to an MMDS
wireless modem, which converts the transmitted analog signal to digital. The modem can
then connect to a single computer or a LAN, as shown in Figure 9-8.

Advantages and Disadvantages of MMDS Advantages of MMDS include signal
strength, large cell size, and cost. Low-frequency MMDS RF signals can travel farther,
generally are less susceptible to interference from rain or fog, and are better able to pene-
trate buildings than high-frequency LMDS RF signals. These characteristics permit MMDS
transmitters to cover areas seven times larger than LMDS transmitters. Finally, the cost of
electronic equipment is typically linked to the frequency used to transmit: The higher the
frequency, the higher the cost of the equipment. Because MMDS uses a lower frequency in
comparison to LMDS, MMDS equipment is less expensive.
The disadvantages of MMDS include physical limitations, frequency sharing, security, and
availability of the technology. Current-generation MMDS still requires a direct line of sight
between the tower and the buildings. This makes installation more difficult and prevents
MMDS from being used in a large number of buildings in a given cell because the signals are
blocked by taller obstructions. Also, a single MMDS cell might be servicing a larger number of
users within its 35-mile (56-kilometer) radius. These users all share the same radio channels;
and, as a result, data throughputs and speed decrease as more users are added. Providers of
MMDS technology sometimes quote transmission rates of up to 10 Mbps, but because the
channels are shared, the actual speed may be closer to 1.5 Mbps.
Carriers do not encrypt the wireless MMDS transmissions. Although only a highly sophisti-
cated user could intercept and read the transmissions, business users should add security
enhancements to their transmissions to keep them safe. MMDS is available in only a limited
number of areas across the United States at the present time and has not experienced any
significant growth, due to competition from other technologies.

IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX)
IEEE 802.16 is an open-standard, broadband MAN technology that can work in either
line-of-sight or non-line-of-sight mode, depending on the frequency used, and is designed to
support a large variety of fixed or mobile digital data communications services for MANs.
The term WiMAX stands for “Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access.” The
IEEE introduced 802.16 in 2000, with the goal of standardizing fixed broadband wireless
connections as an alternative to wired access networks such as fiber-optic links, cable TV
modems, and DSL. IEEE 802.16 supports enhancements and extensions to the MAC proto-
cols so that it is possible for a base station (BS) (the transmitter connected to the carrier
network or to the Internet) to communicate with another BS as well as directly with subscriber
stations (SS), which can be either a laptop computer or a device that attaches to a LAN. LMDS
and MMDS do not provide connectivity with mobile devices and are also not designed to
work beyond the size of a single cell by allowing one BS to communicate with another. FSO
also cannot support mobile communications because of its directional requirements.
Figure 9-9 shows a WiMAX lab setup that includes two BS controllers (top) and four SSs
(bottom). Each two SSs in the photo are connected to one of the BS radios (middle, vertical).
The flat areas in the front of the SSs are integrated antennas, which in this case are disabled
for safety (because of the high-power microwaves); instead, cables are used to interconnect all
the devices. The SSs in the photo are normally installed on the outside wall of a house or
building that faces the antenna of the nearest BS.

In January 2006, Samsung introduced a notebook computer and
mobile telephone handset that were both 802.16-compliant. Several
other PC manufacturers followed shortly after by offering built-in
WiMAX connectivity options in their portable computer product
lines.
FSO, LMDS, and MMDS are not based on an open standard, which means that equipment
from different manufacturers may not interoperate. This forces both customers and carriers
to purchase all their equipment from a single manufacturer.
A group of manufacturers established the WiMAX Forum in June of 2001 to promote the
implementation of 802.16 by testing and certifying equipment for compatibility and inter-
operability. Currently, the Forum’s Web site lists approximately 150 member companies.
Many standards become loosely known by the more popular name of the industry organiza-
tions, such as “WiMAX” instead of the IEEE designation “802.16.” You can find out more
about WiMAX by visiting the Forum’s Web site at www.wimaxforum.org.
The IEEE 802.16 standard offers multiple RF interfaces (PHY layers), depending on the
frequencies used and associated regulations for different countries, but they are all based on
a common MAC protocol. Next, you will learn about the applications and situations in
which WiMAX can be employed.
South Korea was one of the first countries in the world to implement
wireless broadband networks based on the nation’s WiBro standard.
The IEEE subsequently made the 802.16 standard fully compatible
with the Korean standard.
WiMAX Applications With data rates of up to 70 Mbps in the 2–11 GHz bands and
up to 120 Mbps at short distances (indoors) in the 10–66 GHz bands, WiMAX is suitable
for backhaul business applications as well as last mile delivery applications that replace
T1, DSL, and cable TV modems for Internet connectivity. WiMAX can support simulta-
neous voice, video, and data transmission with QoS. This makes it particularly suitable for
voice-over-IP (VoIP) connections, which has enabled small companies to enter the telecom-
munications market and compete with major carriers in providing telephone services to
consumers. The convergence of voice, video, and data on IP networks is what the industry
calls triple-play.
WiMAX enables vendors to create many different types of products, including various con-
figurations of base stations and customer premises equipment (CPE), which are the devices
that are installed in a customer’s office or home. In addition to supporting the point-
to-multipoint applications just mentioned, WiMAX can be deployed as a point-to-point
network to provide broadband access to rural and remote areas.

tions, visit www.ruggedcom.com/products/ruggedmax/win7200. You
can also search “WiMAX CPE” and “WiMAX base station” to locate
other manufacturers’ Web sites.

Manufacturers can design and build standards-based equipment that can be employed by
wireless operators using licensed frequencies and also by business users using both licensed
and unlicensed frequencies. Compared to MMDS and LMDS, the cost for the equipment
and service has already dropped significantly. Whereas an LMDS network can cost upwards
of $60,000, an 802.16 network can be put together for under $10,000. The cost of CPEs
has dropped to as low as $80 each. Some CPE devices can support TV (video), telephone
(voice), and data on the same network.
The WiMAX MAC layer includes features designed to make it easy for carriers to deploy
the network. Once the BSs are in place, an end-user can connect to a WiMAX network by
simply taking the CPE device out of the box, placing the antenna near a window or mount-
ing it on an outside wall, roughly in the direction of the BS, and turning it on. In contrast to
configuring a Wi-Fi wireless residential gateway, for example, little or no configuration is
required by the customer to install a WiMAX CPE. This process also has the effect of dra-
matically reducing the installation costs for the service provider, who will no longer have to
send a technician to the customer’s site. By remotely managing the device, the provider also
reduces ongoing maintenance costs.
In December 2005, Nortel deployed the first commercial WiMAX net-
work, which covers 8,000 square miles (20,720 square kilometers) in
the southeast region of Alberta, Canada. The network, which began
serving both the public and the provincial government in 2006, oper-
ates in the 3.5 GHz band and provides Internet access to this large
rural area at speeds between 1 and 3 Mbps. The network is easily upgradeable to 802.16e to
support mobile WiMAX.
The range of a WiMAX network is measured in miles, unlike Wi-Fi, which is measured in
feet. With low costs and interfaces becoming available for laptop computers and other hand-
held devices, even at slightly lower speeds, WiMAX can offer serious competition to 802.11
networks and hotspots.
Standards Family Overview
IEEE 802.16 covers a wide range of functionality and has a number of variations
that address specific applications. It defines the interface specification for fixed, point-
to-multipoint broadband wireless metropolitan area networks. The 802.16-2001 standard
includes a PHY-layer specification for systems operating in the 10–66 GHz range and
forms the basis for all the other standards in the family. IEEE 802.16-2004 is a revised
version of the initial standard that adds support for systems operating in the 2–11 GHz
range.
The 802.16e standard, ratified in December 2005, is an amendment to the 802.16-2004 stan-
dard that defines the specifications for a mobile version of WiMAX. This enhancement can
enable data rates of up to 2 Mbps for portable devices that are slow moving or stationary,
and speeds of up to 320 Kbps in fast-moving vehicles. IEEE 802.16-2009 is the latest full ver-
sion of the standard and incorporates all the amendments up to that year. The most recent
amendment is 802.16m, which the WiMAX Forum calls “Release 2.” It raises the data rate
to 100 Mbps and makes it possible to combine MIMO, multiple frequency channels, and
spatial multiplexing to achieve rates of up to 1 Gbps.

WiMAX Protocol Stack
As with many of the technologies you have learned about in this book, the PHY and MAC
layers are the only ones that change between different networking standards. WiMAX is
unique in that, in addition to the PHY layer supporting multiple frequency bands, its PHY
layer is able to adapt on the fly. The modulation techniques and access mechanisms can
change dynamically from a BS to the remote devices and to other BSs, depending on distance,
the existence of any interference, or the requirements of the particular device itself.
Unlike Ethernet and other protocols, the MAC layer for WiMAX is connection oriented and
includes service-specific convergence sublayers that interface to the upper OSI layers. Remem-
ber that in the OSI protocol model, only the Transport layer (layer 4) is connection oriented.
The convergence sublayers of the MAC layer in WiMAX can map a particular service to a
connection, which allows WiMAX to offer multiple simultaneous services through the same
link and to carry a mix of protocols, such as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), IPv4,
IPv6, Ethernet, VLAN, and others, all in the same network. The MAC layer in WiMAX
also includes a privacy sublayer that is used to secure the link (discussed in the security
section of this chapter). The 802.16 WiMAX protocol stack is shown in Figure 9-10.

PHY Layer There are several variations of the PHY layer in 802.16. Determining which
variation to use for a particular implementation depends on the frequency range and
whether it is a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint setup. The first two are based on the
modulation of a single carrier signal. Remember that when transmitting on a single fre-
quency, all transmitters have to work in half-duplex mode because they cannot transmit
and receive at the same time. In this case, each transmission is divided into fixed duration
frames that are 5 milliseconds long. Each frame is subdivided into one uplink subframe and
one downlink subframe. The BS transmits to the SSs during the downlink subframe, and the
SSs transmit to the BS during the uplink subframe.
The PHY frames can be 0.5 ms, 1 ms, or 2 ms long and are divided into a variable uplink
subframe and downlink subframe. The subframes are further divided into a series of time
slots. The number of time slots in the uplink and downlink subframe varies, which helps
the BS allocate more time slots for the uplink or downlink. The number of uplink or down-
link time slots allocated depends on the amount of data being transmitted in either direc-
tion. A data transmission to or from a single device is called a burst in the 802.16 standard.
A burst can also be a broadcast transmission from the BS to all SSs. A transmission also
contains commands or network management information that is sent prior to the transmis-
sion of the frame’s data portion. The BS allocates time slots for specific SSs in both the
downlink frame and the uplink frame. The amount of data contained in a burst depends on
the number and length of the time slot as well as on the modulation and coding scheme used
for that particular burst. This mechanism, called time division duplexing (TDD), is shown in
Figure 9-11.

WiMAX also allows the use of two different frequency channels, in which case one fre-
quency is used for downlink and another for uplink. This mechanism is called frequency
division duplexing (FDD). The structure of the frame in FDD is similar to that for TDD,
except that one frequency is used exclusively for the downlink and the other is used exclu-
sively for the uplink.
WiMAX can support less-expensive half-duplex equipment that does not transmit
and receive simultaneously as well as higher-performance, full-duplex stations that can
transmit and receive simultaneously, using different frequencies on the same network
and at the same time. The adaptive characteristic of the uplink and downlink, coupled
with support of both TDD and FDD, allows 802.16 to use the frequency spectrum more
efficiently.
A WiMAX FDD network can support a mixture of full-duplex and half-duplex devices.
When half-duplex transmitters are connected to an FDD network, the BS needs to make
sure that it does not schedule time for those devices to transmit and receive simultaneously,
given that these are half-duplex-only stations.
In a point-to-multipoint architecture, the BS transmits using time division multiplexing
(TDM). The SSs are each allocated a time slot in sequence. Note that because only the BS
transmits in the downlink direction, it does not have to be concerned with contention and
can simply address information in different time slots to different SSs.
Access in the uplink direction (from the SSs to the BS) uses time division multiple access
(TDMA), in which one or more time slots are allocated to each SS depending on the require-
ments of the type of data being transmitted. Some of the time slots are also allocated for
contention access, which enables SSs that are not currently members of the network to com-
municate with the BS for the purpose of establishing a connection to the network.
In the
10–66 GHz licensed
bands, 802.16-2009
supports
one transmission
mode:
WirelessMAN-SC (single carrier). It is used for fixed point-to-point connections using either
TDD or FDD. At these higher frequencies, line of sight to the transmitter and directional
antennas are required.
All the other transmission modes in WiMAX are designed to work in the 2–11 GHz licensed
or unlicensed bands. The 802.16 standard also supports non-line-of-sight applications. Non-
line of sight (NLOS) occurs when the transmitter antenna cannot be seen from the receiver
end or vice versa because of the geography of the area or obstructions such as buildings
and trees that block the direct path of the signal.
Outdoor, tower-mounted antennas for homes can be expensive to purchase and install, espe-
cially in areas subject to high winds or ice accumulation, and significant multipath distortion
is likely to occur. Remember that when using directional antennas in line-of-sight applica-
tions, multipath distortion is negligible and can be ignored; however, in point-to-multipoint
applications, the BS will typically use an omnidirectional antenna. Examples of LOS and
NLOS are shown in Figure 9-12.
To support NLOS applications, additional PHY-layer functionality is required. The intro-
duction to WiMAX in this book discusses only the generic functionality because there are
far too many options, and to cover all of them would require an additional chapter. For
NLOS applications, 802.16 supports three additional PHY-layer transmission modes:
WirelessMAN-OFDM, WirelessMAN-OFDMA, and WirelessHUMAN.

WirelessMAN-OFDM can be used for fixed, mobile, or mesh applications. It uses TDD or
FDD in licensed bands below 11 GHz. This mode divides the frequency band into a number
of data subcarriers, pilot subcarriers, and null subcarriers to make it resistant to multipath
problems. The radio does not transmit during null subcarriers; the null subcarriers are used
as guard bands to prevent adjacent channel interference. The number of subcarriers is
dependent on the bandwidth of the RF channel. For example, in a 1.25 MHz-wide channel,
there can be up to 256 subcarriers, of which 192 are used for data, eight are used as pilot
subcarriers, and 55 are used for guard bands. Conversely, for a 20 MHz-wide channel,
there can be up to 2048 subcarriers.
WirelessMAN-OFDMA uses Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), a
technique based on OFDM that divides the available frequency channel into 1536 orthogo-
nal data subcarriers. These subcarriers are then grouped into subchannels and each SS is
allocated a subchannel, allowing multiple stations and the BS to communicate in a single
transmission. Here again, the number of data subcarriers is dependent on the channel
width. OFDMA is also extremely resistant to multipath problems and is used in licensed
bands below 11 GHz.
A third transmission mechanism, Wireless High-Speed Unlicensed Metro Area Network
(WirelessHUMAN), is also based on OFDM and is specifically designed for use in the
unlicensed 5 GHz U-NII band.

In 802.16, OFDMA is also scalable, meaning that the number of subcarriers allocated to an
SS for the uplink can vary, depending on the QoS requirements of the transmission, the sig-
nal quality, or the distance between the SS and the BS. However, to accommodate channel
aggregation (multiple contiguous channels used to increase data rates) in 802.16m, the num-
ber of UL and DL frames is fixed and asymmetric, meaning that there are more DL frames
than UL frames.
Another key characteristic of the 802.16 PHY is that it supports adaptive modulation. In
simple terms, this means that for each SS, 802.16 can dynamically change the modulation,
increasing or decreasing the data rate based on signal quality. In addition, in order to meet
the regulatory requirements in different countries as well as to optimize the use of the spec-
trum, the 802.16 standard allows transmitters to use frequency bandwidths of a minimum
of 1.25 MHz up to a maximum of 20 MHz. Table 9-2 summarizes the WiMAX specifica-
tion’s nomenclature, frequencies used, applications, and duplexing alternatives.
Modulation and Error Correction In 802.16, modulation and error correction are
directly linked. You may remember that forward error correction (FEC) is a technique that
inserts additional bits in the data stream to enable the receiver to detect multiple-bit errors
and to correct single-bit errors in groups of bits. In the extreme case, FEC simply sends
another copy of the same data bit for each one transmitted.
In addition to FEC, 802.16 uses automatic repeat requests (ARQ) to ensure the reliability of
the transmissions. In other words, sometimes it is necessary to resend the frame. IEEE
802.16 was designed to achieve 99.999 percent reliability—“five nines,” as this level of reli-
ability is commonly referred to in the data communications industry. FEC improves the
chances of receiving the data correctly and thus reduces the number of retransmissions,
which increases the performance of the link. However, the additional bits add overhead to
the transmissions, increasing the total amount of data and therefore reducing the overall
performance of the link. By dynamically changing the modulation, 802.16 can achieve an
optimum balance of speed and transmission for a given signal quality.
Table 9-3 lists the types of modulation supported in 802.16 and the associated mandatory
FEC coding. The coding rates are listed here for informational purposes only; a full explana-
tion of the FEC coding techniques requires complex mathematical formulas and is beyond
the scope of this book. However, it is important to know that the different FEC coding
rates are used for increasing the reliability of the transmission.

The ability of 802.16 to dynamically change modulations is also what makes it possible for
WiMAX to reduce latency and improve QoS. Latency is the amount of time delay it takes a
packet to travel from source to destination device. Figure 9-13 shows how WiMAX uses dif-
ferent modulations. Adaptive modulation also helps WiMAX use the channel bandwidth
more efficiently.

The BS sends information to the SSs about which modulations it will use for a particular
burst and for a particular SS in a downlink map (DL-MAP) in the first few data frames at
the beginning of the transmission. The SSs respond by sending an uplink map (UL-MAP) at
the beginning of their assigned bursts. The DL-MAP and UL-MAP are parts of the frame
that describe the method of transmission as well as the contents of the bursts, time alloca-
tions, and other information.
WiMAX Profiles IEEE 802.16 defines certain profiles, which are sets of predefined
parameters that can include the frequency channel, bandwidth of the channel, and trans-
mission modes (OFDM, OFDMA, etc.). These profiles also help to reduce or eliminate
the need for truck-rolls, which are support-technician visits to the site, given that they
can be changed remotely, when a user signs up for a new type of service. WiMAX
also specifies basic profiles: point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and point-to-point (PTP) as well
as an optional mesh networking profile. A WiMAX system profile is a combination of
the basic profile and one of the transmission profiles; it is preset on the equipment
by the operator companies (carriers) before it is shipped to an end-user site. Burst
profiles are negotiated between BSs and SSs for the allocation of time slots required to
maintain QoS.
Each truck-roll to install a single broadband network device at an
end-user’s site can cost a communications operator up to $500.
Range and Throughput The maximum distances achievable in a WiMAX network
depend on the frequency band used. Recall that the higher the frequency, the shorter the
range of the signal at a given power setting. Conversely, higher frequency signals allow for
higher data rates.
In general, higher frequencies are used for metropolitan-area line-of-sight, point-to-point,
or multipoint applications at very high data rates for carrier networks using licensed
frequencies. Lower licensed frequencies—below 11 GHz—are typically used for private,
line-of-sight network connections of up to 10 miles (16 kilometers) as well as for
long-distance links of up to 35 miles (56 kilometers). Frequencies below 11 GHz are
also used for non-line-of-sight networks with a maximum range of up to 5 miles
(8 kilometers).
WiMAX base stations and subscriber stations perform ranging (distance) calculations based
on signal quality. This process occurs when a subscriber station initially joins the network
and periodically thereafter, and it helps the equipment establish the modulation and FEC
coding to use for data transmissions.
As you already learned, the maximum achievable data rates in WiMAX depend on the mod-
ulation, channel bandwidth, and FEC coding used. Table 9-4 shows a summary of some of
the data-rate combinations that are possible.
Note that a wider channel bandwidth also means that more data can be sent per signal unit
(symbol), as you learned in Chapter 2, hence the higher data rates achievable with wider
channels. Realistic throughput will be lower than the rates shown in Table 9-4. One reason
342
Chapter 9

for this is that the WiMAX channel bandwidth is shared, and therefore the number of
simultaneous users affects the maximum data rates at any given time. Another reason for
the lower throughput is that some of the overhead, such as MAC layer framing, is not
included in the rate calculations shown in the table.
MAC Layer WiMAX is typically implemented on a point-to-multipoint basis, with one BS
and potentially hundreds of SSs, including mobile users. The 802.16 MAC dynamically allo-
cates bandwidth to individual SSs for the uplink; this is the key to the high data rates possible
in WiMAX networks. In addition to supporting a large number of SSs, the MAC convergence
sublayers allow WiMAX to be implemented as an efficient transport in point-to-point systems
for backhaul applications and support such line protocols as ATM and T1.
A point-to-multipoint WiMAX network usually operates with a central BS that can be
equipped with either an omnidirectional or a smart, sector-based antenna, which is also
called an advanced antenna system (AAS). An AAS can transmit multiple simultaneous sig-
nals in different directions to stations that fall within the range of each of the antennas. It
also helps to maximize the amount of RF energy sent in each direction. Remember that, for
the uplink, the only stations sending signals are the ones that were scheduled by the BS to
transmit. WiMAX can also take advantage of multiple-in and multiple-out (MIMO) antenna
systems to reduce interference with other systems (see the next section, on WiMAX coexis-
tence) and the impact of multipath distortion. In addition, 802.16m enables support for
multiple radios and spatial multiplexing to increase data rates.
To address a burst to a particular SS, the BS uses a 16-bit number called a connection iden-
tifier (CID), which is used to identify both the device and the connection after it connects to
the WiMAX network. (Recall that the WiMAX MAC is connection oriented.) Each station
also has a 48-bit MAC address, which is only used during connection establishment. When
the stations receive a transmission from the BS, they check the CID and keep only the MAC
frames that contain data addressed to them.
Stations can request additional dedicated bandwidth (for QoS) if this is required to support a
particular service, such as the transmission of telephone calls or a video stream. The BS polls
the SSs periodically to identify their bandwidth needs, granting bandwidth as required. Except
in the case of connections that require a guaranteed bit rate, such as T1, most data connec-
tions cannot tolerate errors but can tolerate latency and jitter, which is the maximum delay

variation between two consecutive packets over a period of time. Web browsing, transmitting
e-mail messages, and downloading files are latency-tolerant and jitter-tolerant activities. Video
and voice, on the other hand, can tolerate a certain amount of errors but not latency or jitter.
The WiMAX MAC protocol maintains a consistent bandwidth by using a self-correcting
mechanism for granting more bandwidth to SSs. This creates less traffic on the network,
given that there is no need for SSs to acknowledge the grant. Instead, if an SS does not
receive the bandwidth grant or the BS does not receive the request, the SS will simply
request it again. The requests from the SSs are cumulative, but they will also periodically
inform the BS of their total bandwidth needs. This mechanism is far more efficient than
those used by other networking standards.
The scheduling services in WiMAX that map the connections in the
uplink direction for allocating channel bandwidth to the SSs are
based on the scheduling services defined for cable modems in the
Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standard.
Go to www.cablemodem.com/specifications and click “DOCSIS.”
A MAC frame includes a fixed-length header, an optional and variable-length payload
(data), and an optional cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Header-only MAC frames are used
to send commands and requests between the BS and the SSs. The generic MAC frame for-
mat is shown in Figure 9-14.
WiMAX Coexistence
One of the concerns of end-users and carriers when considering wireless data transmission
in the unlicensed bands is that as the number of transmitters grows, so does interference.
Eventually, interference can make the technology and, consequently, the user’s investment
worthless. This concern is of particular importance considering the distances achievable
with 802.16.
WiMAX is different from technologies such as 802.11 in that it is not limited to the 2.4 GHz
band or the 5 GHz band. Although business users are encouraged to develop a sharing

connectivity to customers should consider a low-cost purchase or lease of a small amount of
spectrum in the 2–11 GHz band. FCC policies allow spectrum holders to resell unused spec-
trum to other operators.
The ISM band offers approximately 80 MHz of bandwidth; however, the U-NII band
offers 24 channels and 555 MHz of bandwidth, which users and operators can share.
Depending on the distance between transmitters, interference may not be a serious prob-
lem because WiMAX signals are limited to between 30 and 35 miles (approximately
48 to 56 kilometers) under ideal, line-of-sight conditions. When adaptive modulations,
variable data rates, and FEC are taken into account, testing the performance of a link
can dispel any remaining concerns. Most vendors, eager to sell their equipment, would
be happy to assist in this process. Power levels can also be adjusted, as long as these
adjustments do not exceed the limits mandated by the FCC or the regulatory bodies in
other countries. Smart antenna systems are another potential solution to this type of
problem.
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), which
you learned about in Chapter 3, has published a standard called
High Performance Radio Metropolitan Area Network (HIPERMAN). It
is based on 802.16 and specifies systems that are based on OFDM
and work at frequencies between 2 and 11 GHz only.
WMAN Security
As with other types of networks, security in WMANs is a major concern. Despite using multi-
ple beam technology (which could allow an attacker to attempt to capture information by
interrupting a single beam), FSO systems are generally considered secure. Anyone trying
to sniff information from FSO systems would have difficulty accessing the equipment and
blocking only a portion of an invisible beam. In addition, such interference would affect the
performance of the network, immediately alerting the user or operator. In LMDS and
MMDS systems, a receiver can capture RF signals without blocking the radio signal. Because
most of these systems are proprietary and expensive, system manufacturers or operators are
typically responsible for designing custom security measures into their equipment. Because
most future WMAN installations will likely be based on WiMAX technology, this section
will focus on WiMAX security measures.
WiMAX Security
As you learned in the section on the WiMAX protocol stack, the MAC layer includes a
privacy sublayer. Unlike 802.11 and Bluetooth, the WiMAX standard was initially
designed to include very powerful security measures. These features make it extremely
difficult—if not impossible—for a would-be hacker to steal information from WiMAX
transmissions.
The privacy sublayer provides a client/server authentication and key management protocol,
with the BS controlling the distribution of security keys to the SSs. In addition, the standard
encrypts all the data transmitted between the BS and SSs and makes use of digital certificates,
which are messages digitally signed by a certification authority, as well as public-key

infrastructure embedded in the BS, to ensure privacy and protection against information
theft. Manufacturers install a unique digital certificate, which includes a serial number in
every device. The digital certificates can be verified with the manufacturer as being valid and
unique by sending a copy of the certificate encrypted with the manufacturer’s public key over
the Internet (a connection to the Internet is required). This is a requirement of the 802.16
standard.
The privacy sublayer has two protocol components: the encapsulation protocol and the pri-
vacy key management protocol. The encapsulation protocol is used for encrypting packet
data and includes a set of cryptographic suites (the encryption and authentication mechan-
isms) used to apply encryption to the transmitted data. The privacy key management proto-
col is used for securing key distribution from the BS to the SSs; it is used for synchronizing
the security keys between the BS and SSs as well as for preventing unauthorized stations
from associating with a WiMAX network.
Once a device is authenticated with the BS using the digital certificate, a traffic encryption
key (TEK), which is the security key used to encrypt the data, is exchanged between the
BS and SS for each service connection that’s being carried over the wireless interface.
Remember that the 802.16 MAC is connection oriented and can carry multiple types of
service. TEKs expire, and the SS must periodically renew the keys with the BS. The default
TEK lifetime is 12 hours. The minimum value is 30 minutes, and the maximum value is
seven days.
Only the headers are not encrypted in WiMAX, to allow SSs to associate with the network.
Although data can be sent unencrypted, most users are likely to (and should) use encryption.
All data sent across the wireless medium is then encrypted using one of the following
algorithms:
●
3-DES (Triple-DES)—Data is encrypted three times with a 128-bit key, using the
United States Data Encryption Standard (DES).
●
RSA with 1024-bit key—RSA was developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir,
and Leonard Adleman. The algorithm uses a large integer, composed of smaller
numbers that are multiplied by each other. It is based on the idea that it will be
difficult to figure out each of the smaller numbers that are used to arrive at the
large integer.
●
AES with a 128-bit key—The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the latest
encryption standard, was developed by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) to replace DES. It is considered unbreakable and is used to encrypt
unclassified U.S. government material.
The security mechanisms designed into WiMAX should be sufficient to allay any concerns
that end users may have.
The high reliability and high security of WiMAX, together with its
long distance and NLOS characteristics, make it an excellent candi-
date for use by security companies providing burglar alarms for
homes and businesses. WiMAX makes it viable to secure a building
or home using a live video link and IP-based security cameras.

Chapter Summary
■WMANs are a group of technologies that provide wireless connectivity throughout an
area, such as a city without cable infrastructure. WMANs also extend user mobility
throughout a metropolitan area.
■Last mile wired connections are the link between the customer’s premises and an ISP.
Most last mile connections today are still based on copper wiring.
■Long-distance telephone and data connections between cities have mostly migrated to
fiber-optic cable due to its high speed, reliability, and channel capacity.
■There are two ways in which a signal can be sent. The first technique, called broad-
band, sends multiple data signals at different frequencies. This allows many different
signals to be sent simultaneously. The second technique, called baseband, treats the
entire transmission medium as if it were only one channel, sending only one stream of
data. Until 2001, RF-based fixed broadband systems were limited to connecting with
only one other device at a time and could only transmit using a line-of-sight link.
■Free Space Optics (FSO) has been an excellent alternative to costly high-speed fiber-
optic connections. FSO transmissions are sent by low-powered infrared beams in
point-to-point fashion. Because FSO is a line-of-sight technology, the transceivers
must be mounted in high locations to provide a clear transmission path.
■Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) is a fixed broadband technology that
can provide a wide variety of wireless services, including high-speed Internet access,
real-time multimedia file transfer, remote access to LANs, interactive video, video-
on-demand, video conferencing, and telephone service. LMDS can transmit anywhere
from 51 to 155 Mbps downstream and 1.54 Mbps upstream over a distance of up to
about 5 miles (8 kilometers).
■Because an LMDS signal can only travel up to 5 miles, an LMDS network is com-
posed of cells much like a cellular telephone system. A transmitter sends signals to the
fixed buildings within the cell. LMDS is a fixed technology for buildings. The main
factors that determine the LMDS cell size are line of sight, antenna height, overlapping
cells, and rainfall.
■Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) is a fixed broadband wireless
technology. MMDS can transmit video, voice, or data signals at distances of up to
35 miles (56 kilometers). Because MMDS operates at a lower frequency, the signals
can travel longer distances. These longer distances mean that MMDS requires fewer
radio transmitters compared to the equipment required by LMDS to send the same
signal. MMDS is used as an option in both home and business settings. MMDS uses
the 2.1 GHz and 2.5–2.7 GHz bands to offer two-way service at speeds of up to
1.5 Mbps downstream and 300 Kbps upstream. LMDS and MMDS technology is
not based on standards.
■The IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) standard was introduced in 2000 with the goal of stan-
dardizing fixed broadband wireless services and as an alternative to wired access net-
works. A single WiMAX base station (BS) can communicate with hundreds of sub-
scriber stations (SSs) simultaneously in point-to-multipoint mode, or with another BS
in point-to-point. IEEE 802.16 equipment can transmit in either the 10–66 GHz range
or in the 2–11 GHz range and can use licensed or unlicensed frequency bands. A BS

can also connect directly with a laptop computer equipped with a WiMAX wireless
interface.
■WiMAX can transmit at speeds of up to 70 Mbps in the 2–11 GHz bands and can
achieve 120 Mbps at short distances in the 10–66 GHz bands. The 802.16m amend-
ment allows the use of multiple radios and spatial multiplexing and can potentially
increase the data rates to 1 Gbps when aggregating multiple 20-MHz-wide frequency
channels. QoS support makes WiMAX suitable to carry simultaneous voice, video,
and data (triple-play) at a much lower cost than LMDS and MMDS networks.
WiMAX equipment is relatively easy and inexpensive to install and maintain.
■WiMAX range is measured in miles. Cellular phone operators can overlay WiMAX
networks on their existing networks, which will reduce the cost of sending data from
handheld cellular phones.
■The 802.16e amendment brings full support of mobile devices to WiMAX technology.
Mobile WiMAX can achieve data rates of up to 2 Mbps for portable devices that are
slow moving or stationary and up to 320 Kbps in fast-moving vehicles.
■The WiMAX MAC layer is connection oriented and includes convergence sublayers
that allow WiMAX to directly support ATM, T1, Ethernet, and VLANs in addition to
other services. There are five variations of the 802.16 PHY layer. The first two are
based on the modulation of a single carrier signal. All devices work in half-duplex.
The PHY frames can be 0.5 ms, 1 ms, or 2 ms long and are divided into a variable
uplink subframe and downlink subframe. The subframe is divided into time slots that
carry the payload. A single time slot or multiple time slots can be allocated to a spe-
cific station. The mechanism is called time division duplexing (TDD). WiMAX also
supports the use of two frequency channels, one for the uplink and another for the
downlink. This is called frequency division duplexing (FDD).
■The BS can support both half-duplex and full-duplex devices simultaneously on the
network and is the only device transmitting on the downlink. The BS transmits using
time division multiplexing (TDM). The stations transmit using time division multiple
access (TDMA). The BS allocates time slots for contention access in the uplink sub-
frame in order to allow stations to establish a connection and join the network.
■The WiMAX 802.16 standard defines three PHY layers for LOS and NLOS imple-
mentations in the 2–11 GHz licensed or unlicensed frequency bands: WirelessMAN-
OFDM, WirelessMAN-OFDMA, and WirelessHUMAN, the last which is intended for
use in the 5 GHz U-NII band.
■OFDM and OFDMA in 802.16 are scalable, meaning that the number of subcarriers
allocated to an SS for the uplink can vary depending on the QoS requirements of the
SS, the distance between the SS and BS, and the signal quality. The WiMAX PHY
layer uses adaptive modulation. It can dynamically change modulation techniques
depending on the distance and signal quality. WiMAX transmitters can transmit using
frequency bandwidths from 1.25 MHz up to 20 MHz. Through the use of error-
correction techniques and adaptive modulation, WiMAX makes efficient use of the
spectrum and achieves high performance.
■WiMAX profiles specify the frequency channel, bandwidth, and transmission mecha-
nism. A basic profile specifies whether the network is point-to-point or point-
to-multipoint. A system profile is the combination of a basic profile and transmission
348

profile. The use of profiles helps make WiMAX installations simpler and reduces the
cost of implementation for the operators.
■The MAC layer is the key to the intelligence and security behind WiMAX networks.
Efficient bandwidth-saving protocols and QoS help WiMAX reduce latency and jitter
and maintain a consistent bandwidth. WiMAX includes a number of features that help
operators and end-users reduce interference problems.
■The security features of WiMAX were designed to offer operators and end-users the
peace of mind that other wireless technologies have failed to provide so far. WiMAX
uses verifiable digital certificates, the most advanced encryption mechanisms (3-DES,
RSA, and AES), and secure key exchange protocols.

Hands-On Projects
Project 9-1
Identify at least two manufacturers of WiMAX equipment. Prepare a report on
what type of equipment they supply (such as base stations, CPEs, or adapter
cards for laptop computers). Ensure that the manufacturer can supply at least
two of the different classes of products noted. Create a one-page or two-page list that includes
the frequencies that the equipment is capable of operating on (if available) and at least one
other important feature of the equipment.
Project 9-2
By researching news media Web sites, locate one or two places in North
America (not mentioned in the chapter) where the local government, a vendor,
or a business association is planning to deploy a WiMAX network. Outline the

purpose and the extent of the deployment as well as the expectations of the project, such
as what types of services are offered (i.e., Internet access, video, and telephone). To help
you in your search, try to think of situations for which WiMAX would be an excellent alter-
native. One example of this is using WiMAX to connect oil-drilling platforms that are
located near the coast.
Real-World Exercise
The Baypoint Group (TBG) is once again calling on you, their wireless expert. A cus-
tomer, Advancomms Inc., plans to deploy smart (advanced) antenna systems for a mobile
WiMAX network it wants to install in your area, and you will be locating possible sites
for the system. The ideal location would be a building at least eight stories high, which
avoids the high cost of erecting towers and supplying power. Another important factor
in selecting the site is avoiding, as much as possible, interference from other wireless
systems in the area.
Exercise 9-1
Your job is to drive or walk around the downtown area and spot as many wireless antennas
as you can, marking on a map the location and positioning of each antenna. Smart antenna
systems require several small antennas that point in all directions. If there are antennas
already installed on top of the buildings in your area, you will need to consider whether
there is enough vertical space to mount the smart antennas. If there are no tall buildings in
your area, you should try to identify possible tower locations while ensuring that the
antenna signals will not be blocked by any other structures or terrain, such as hills and
mountains. If you live in a large city with many tall buildings already filled with antennas,
you may need to consider installing the smart antenna system on the side walls, close to the
top, if there is space available.
Identify the existing links where two directional antennas are pointed towards each other,
and mark these on your map as well. You can use Google Maps to display and print a
map of your local downtown area.
Produce a short (5–10 slide) PowerPoint presentation that includes the maps and locations
of all the potential sites. Also prepare a one-page report to accompany your slides, indicat-
ing any potential problems. Use Google Images or your favorite search engine to identify as
many different types of antennas as possible, and include this information in your report. If
you have a camera, you may also want to use your own pictures of the potential sites in
your presentation.

are wired for Ethernet, but students currently do not have access to either the university’s net-
work or the Internet because the dorms are in a remote area without DSL or cable TV service,
due to the remoteness of the campus. The university considered implementing a satellite-based
system or installing fiber optics, but the cost of each option proved prohibitive. The university
has access to the Internet through a backhaul MMDS connection to an ISP, but the cost of
installing a private MMDS network also is too high. TBG has asked you to become involved,
given that you are its wireless networking expert. The residence buildings have line-of-sight
access to each other and to the computer center building.
Based on the research you did for Project 9-1, prepare a two-page recommendation and a
10-minute PowerPoint presentation for a specific WiMAX implementation. Make sure you
address the features of WiMAX and how it can provide long-term benefits for the university.
Include photos and basic specifications for the equipment in your presentation. Also include
similar examples that you may have located in Project 9-2.

A wireless wide area network (WWAN) spans a geographical area as large as an
entire country or even the entire world. WWANs can use the cellular phone network to
span a country or an entire continent. Where cellular phone networks are not available, sat-
ellite technology enables users to make telephone calls or access the Internet from remote
areas. These two technologies complement each other in many ways and make it possible
for users to connect to corporate networks via the Internet and run business applications
from virtually any location on the planet.
Although the browsers on cellular phones often lack the capabilities of PC and MAC browsers,
a cellular phone can be connected to a laptop using a cable, and the resulting Internet connec-
tion can be used to run applications that would otherwise not work on the cellular phone.
Several models of smartphones also include a “hotspot” feature that enables them to act as
Wi-Fi APs, which allows users to connect to the Internet using two different wireless technolo-
gies simultaneously, thereby increasing productivity while away from the office or home.
From the user’s perspective, cellular phone technology is ubiquitous. No matter where you
look, people are using cellular phones and smartphones to make and receive calls, send and
receive short text messages, send and receive e-mails, access the Web, send faxes, upload
pictures and movies, even watch TV and movies. Using a digital cellular phone today is as
common as making a landline telephone call; and in many parts of the world, especially
where the traditional telephone wire infrastructure is either outdated or nonexistent, cellular
phones are making these services available to users who never before had access to a private
telephone line, let alone the Internet. In fact, cellular phones are quickly replacing traditional
land-based telephone lines for large groups of people.
Cellular phones are literally changing lives. By the time fishermen tie their boats to the dock,
the catch is often already sold to the highest bidder. Farmers in remote communities sell
their products directly to retailers while on their way to the market. Often, this remote mar-
ketplace enables producers and small manufacturers to bypass the middlemen and enjoy
higher profits, something that in the end benefits both producers and consumers.
From a technological point of view, there is nothing simple about digital cellular telephony.
On the contrary, cellular telephony is probably one of the most complex of all wireless
communication technologies, and users expect it to perform as well for data as it does for
voice calls. Over the past four decades, developments in cellular phone technology have
been driven by the users’ demand for high data rates and quality of voice connection.
These technologies all have strange acronyms, such as GSM, EDGE, CDMA, HSDPA,
HSPAþ, and LTE. The cellular phone business, from the manufacturer to the carriers, is
one of the most fiercely competitive businesses anywhere in the world. Even governments
are taking advantage of the growth of the cellular phone business, auctioning off parts of
the wireless spectrum to the highest bidders, thereby earning billions of dollars.
For many years, satellites have provided us with global positioning systems, brought communi-
cations to the remotest of areas, and transmitted radio and TV signals that can reach virtually
anyone anywhere on the planet in real time. They have also played an important role in
WWAN data networks because they can deliver signals to any point on the oceans that cover
most of Earth’s surface, to the Arctic and Antarctic continents, and to remote and mountainous
areas where electricity and cellular phone transmission tower infrastructure does not yet exist.
Because of the complexity of launching them into space and placing them in the correct orbit,
satellites are one of the most expensive of all wireless communications technologies.

This chapter explores how cellular phones work and looks at some of the complex technol-
ogy behind digital cellular phone networks. We will also examine what tasks can be
achieved using digital cellular phone devices, the various platforms and software that make
these enhanced features work, and issues surrounding implementation of digital cellular
phone technology. Finally, we will take a look at how satellites are deployed, some of the
issues surrounding the use of satellites for data transmission, and how satellites complement
cellular telephony to help provide a truly global wireless wide area network.
Cellular Telephone Technology
Cellular phone technology has continued to expand at what can only be described as an
alarming rate. The range of applications and features that digital cellular networks provide to
mobile users is the main cause of this growth. Today, cellular phone networks are based on
digital instead of analog transmission technology. They can transmit at ever-increasing speeds
and are no longer limited to voice communications. Digital cellular phones can be used to:
●
Browse the Internet
●
Send and receive short messages and e-mails
●
Participate in videoconferencing
●
Receive travel reports, news reports, weather updates, entertainment, and many other
types of information
●
Connect to corporate networks and run a large variety of business applications
●
Watch television or on-demand movies
●
Take and transmit pictures and short movies
●
Display maps and information about your current location as well as locate vehicles,
family members, and employees using GPS
●
Scan barcodes, QR codes, and even product labels to get more information or pricing
for products
●
Play online and offline games
●
Access and control servers and workstation console displays remotely
Short Message Services (SMS), which allows for the delivery of short (160 character) mes-
sages (70 characters for non-Latin Arabic and Chinese) between cellular phones, remains one
of the most widely used cellular phone applications. In 2011, the number of SMS messages
sent worldwide exceeded 7 trillion. Unlike text-message services that send messages over the
Internet from a central site, such as an answering service that sends a message to a physician’s
pager, SMS lets users send messages directly from one device to another without using the
Internet. The cellular phone carrier’s equipment stores the message if the receiver’s telephone
is out of range or powered off.
SMS can be used in the following ways:
●
Person-to-person—This is the most common use of SMS, namely one user sending a
text message to another user. It has been called the digital cellular phone equivalent of
instant messaging.
Cellular Telephone Technology

●
Agent-to-person—Automated agents can send notifications whenever an event occurs.
The users set the parameters and criteria. For example, an automated agent can send
out an SMS message when a stock reaches a certain price or the user has received a
voice mail message.
●
Information broadcast services—These include news, weather, and sports scores sent
on a regular basis or when a breaking story occurs.
●
Software configuration—SMS can make some changes to the software running
on a cellular phone device; it can also send links for downloading software
to smartphones.
●
Advertising—Messages containing advertising can be sent to users over SMS.
How Cellular Telephony Works
There are two keys to understanding how cellular telephony works. The first key is that the
coverage area is divided into smaller individual sections, called cells, as shown in Figure 10-1.
A typical cell ranges from a few thousand feet in diameter to approximately 10 square
miles (26 square kilometers). At the center of each cell are a transmitter and a receiver
with which the mobile devices near that cell communicate, via RF signals. These

transmitters are connected to a base station, and each base station is connected to a
mobile telecommunications switching office (MTSO). The MTSO is the link between the
cellular phone network and the wired telephone world; it controls all transmitters and
base stations in the cellular phone network. A large city may have multiple MTSOs, each
controlling a group of cells.
Cells are drawn as hexagons simply because it makes it easier to
show adjacent cells without the use of overlapping lines, which
can be confusing. In reality, a cell’s shape is closer to a circle,
although buildings and other geographic features can affect the
shape.
In 2011, the number of cellular phone subscribers worldwide was
approaching 6 billion and growing fast. For more information, see
mobithinking.com/mobile-marketing-tools/latest-mobile-stats.
The second key to understanding how cellular telephony works is that all of today’s dig-
ital transmitters and digital cellular phones operate at a low power level. This enables the
signal from a single phone to stay confined to the cell and not cause any interference
with any other cells. Because the signal at a particular frequency does not go far beyond
the cell area, that same frequency can be used in other cells at the same time, though
not in adjacent cells. This is called frequency reuse, and it is shown in diagram format
in Figure 10-2.

Cellular phones have special codes associated with them. These codes are used to identify the
phone, the phone’s owner, and the carrier or service provider (such as AT&T or Sprint).
Some of these codes are preprogrammed when the phone is manufactured, whereas others
are associated with the user’s account. Some cellular phones require a SIM card to be
installed on the phone before they can be used. A SIM (subscriber identity module) card is a
very small electronic card used to associate the phone with the user’s account and with the
carrier. Figure 10-3 shows a regular-size SIM card and a micro SIM card—the type used on
Apple iPhones and some other cellular phone devices.
SIM cards have between 64 KB and 512 KB of ROM, between 1 KB and 8 KB of
RAM, and between 64 KB and 512 KB of EEPROM. The user’s phone number is stored
on the SIM card, and users have a choice of storing contact numbers on the phone’s
memory or on the SIM. Users can move the card between one phone and another and
use different phones without reprogramming. An example of this is when a user is

travelling in an area where the frequency bands used are different than those she uses in
her home area. She may be able to rent a phone that is compatible with the local
cellular phone service but still use her home account simply by moving the SIM to a
different phone.
Table 10-1 summarizes the codes used in cellular telephony along with their respective sizes
and purposes.
An ESN or IMEI number is permanently assigned to a specific cellular
phone when it is manufactured. The carrier or reseller programs the
MIN into the phone at account-activation time. The SID code is pro-
grammed into the carrier’s system and associated with the SIM card
at account-activation time.
When a cellular phone user moves around within a particular cell, the transmitters
at the base station for that cell handle all the communications. As the user moves
toward the next cell, the cellular phone will automatically associate with the base
station of that cell. The process of the new cell taking over the user’s call is called a
handoff. However, what happens if a cellular phone user moves beyond the coverage
area of the entire cellular phone network—for example, if he goes from Nashville to
Boston? In this case, the cellular telephone would connect with the cellular phone net-
work in Boston, which then communicates with the network in Nashville to verify that
the user has a valid account and can make calls. This connection to a cell outside a
user’s home area is known as roaming. A comparison between handoff and roaming is
shown in Figure 10-4.
A cellular phone user’s home area is the location where she lives or works and where she has
an account with the cellular phone carrier. When connected to the home area, the user pays
local, per-minute call rates. When roaming, the per-minute rates tend to be higher, and a
roaming fee may apply. Per-minute rates and roaming rates depend on the carrier with
which the user has an account.

The steps (shown in Figure 10-5) that a cellular phone uses to receive a call are as follows:
1. When the cellular phone is turned on, it scans the frequencies that it is programmed
to use and listens for a broadcast from the nearest base station on a selected fre-
quency known as a control channel. This broadcast contains information about the
network, the frequencies used in a particular cell, etc. If the phone cannot detect a
control channel, it may be out of range of a compatible network, in which case it
displays a message to the user such as “No Service.”
2. If the cellular phone receives the broadcast information correctly, it compares it with
the SID of the carrier that was programmed into the phone or the SIM card. If the
information on the phone or the SIM card matches the broadcast, the cellular phone
is in a network owned by its carrier. The cellular phone then transmits a registration
request number to the base station that the MTSO uses for tracking the cell(s) in
which the phone is located.
3. If the SID does not match, then the phone is roaming. The MTSO of the remote net-
work contacts the MTSO of the home network, which confirms that the SID of the
phone belongs to a valid account. The MTSO of the remote network then tracks the
phone and sends the call information (including length of call and the call’s status as
a roaming connection) back to the home MTSO.

4. When a call comes in, the MTSO locates the phone through the registration
request and then selects a frequency that will be used for communication. The
MTSO sends the frequency information to the phone over the control channel.
Both the phone and the transmitter switch to that frequency, and the connection
is then completed.
5. As the user moves toward the edge of a cell, the base station notes that the phone’s
signal strength is decreasing while the base station in the next cell determines that the
phone’s signal strength is increasing. The two base stations coordinate with each
other through the MTSO. The cellular phone then gets a message on the control
channel to change frequencies as the call is handed off to another cell.
6. The phone and transmitter change frequencies as required.
The process of making an outgoing call is similar to the one for receiving a call.
Although the Telecommunications Act of 1996 makes it illegal to
intercept cellular transmissions, callers should remember that their
conversations are being broadcast across the public airwaves and
may not be as private as calls using the wired telephone network.

Evolution of Cellular Technology
Because cellular technology is available worldwide, it is useful to learn about how it evolved and
where it might be going in the future, because you never know where you may travel or where
you may end up working some day. Cellular phones have been available since the early 1980s in
the United States. Since that time, cellular phone technology has changed dramatically. Most indus-
try experts talk in terms of several generations of cellular telephony, which are discussed next.
First Generation Cellular Telephony The first generation of wireless cellular tech-
nology is known, appropriately enough, as First Generation, or 1G. 1G transmissions use
analog signals, which are radio frequency (RF) transmissions in which the caller’s voice is
modulated using basic frequency modulation (FM).
1G technology is based on, and sometimes referred to as, Advanced Mobile Phone Service
(AMPS). AMPS operates in the 800–900 MHz frequency spectrum. Each channel is
30 KHz wide, with a 45 KHz passband. There are 832 frequencies available for transmis-
sion. Out of those frequencies, 790 are used for voice traffic and the remaining 42 are used
for control channels. However, because two frequencies are used for each cellular telephone
conversation (one to transmit and one to receive, in full-duplex), there are actually 395 voice
channels, 21 of which are used for control channel functions.
Channels that are 30 KHz wide provide voice quality comparable to
a standard wired telephone transmission, which is why AMPS chan-
nels are 30 KHz.
AMPS uses Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), which you learned about in
Chapter 3. Remember that in RF communications systems there are two resources, frequency
and time. Division by frequency, so that each caller is allocated part of the spectrum for all of
the time, is the basis of FDMA. This is shown in Figure 10-6. FDMA allocates a single cellular
channel, with two frequencies to one user at a time. If the channel deteriorates due to interfer-
ence from other frequencies, the user is switched to another channel, if one is available.

AMPS was one of the first wireless communications systems to use
FDMA. Today, AMPS is not commonly used; however, some older
tri-mode mobile phones still support the AMPS system.
1G networks use circuit-switching technology. When a telephone call is made, a dedicated
connection is made between the caller and the recipient of the call through the telephone
company’s switch. While the telephone conversation is taking place, the connection
remains open between only these two users. No other calls can be made from that phone
while the first conversation is going on, and anyone who calls that phone will receive a
busy signal. This direct connection lasts for the duration of the call. At the end of the
call, the switch drops the connection and the frequencies are released, so that another
caller can use them.
Analog signals, the basis for 1G cellular telephony, are prone to interference, and the con-
nections do not exhibit the same quality as systems that employ digital transmission. In
addition, sending data over an analog signal requires a modem or similar device to convert
the signals from digital to analog and then back again. A 1G analog cellular telephone can
be realistically used only for voice communications. For these reasons, 1G was soon
replaced with improved digital technology.
Second Generation Cellular Telephony The next generation of cellular tele-
phony, known as Second Generation, or 2G, started in the early 1990s and continues
to the present but will likely be phased out very soon. 2G networks are capable of trans-
mitting data at between 9.6–14.4 Kbps in the 800 MHz and 1.9 GHz frequency bands.
The only major feature that 2G systems share with 1G is that they are circuit-switched
networks.
2G systems use digital instead of analog transmissions. Digital transmissions provide several
improvements over analog transmissions:
●
Digital transmissions use the frequency spectrum more efficiently.
●
Over long distances, the quality of the voice transmission does not degrade as it does
with analog. This is because analog signals can be amplified, but any noise that
appears cannot be removed since there is no way for the receiver to differentiate
between the noise and the voice signal.
●
Digital transmissions are difficult to decode and consequently offer better security.
●
On average, digital transmissions use less power. As a result, they enable smaller and
less expensive individual receivers and transmitters.
Another difference between 1G and 2G systems is that the carriers of 2G cellular networks
build their cellular networks around various multiple access technologies. Three technologies
are used with 2G: time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access
(CDMA), and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications).
Whereas FDMA, used with AMPS, divides the available spectrum into several frequency
channels, so that each caller is allocated part of the spectrum for all of the time, TDMA
divides by time, so that each caller is allocated the entire spectrum for part of the time, as
shown in Figure 10-7. TDMA divides a single 30 KHz radio frequency channel into six

unique time slots, and each caller uses two time slots (one for transmitting and one for
receiving). TDMA can send three times as many calls over a single channel as FDMA can.
With CDMA, which was discussed in Chapter 3, every caller is allocated the entire spectrum all
of the time, as shown in Figure 10-8. CDMA uses direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and
unique digital codes, rather than separate RF frequencies, to differentiate between the different
transmissions. A CDMA transmission is spread across the frequency, and the digital codes are
applied to the individual transmissions. When the signal is received, the codes are removed from
the signal in the way described in Chapter 3.
GSM, which was developed in the 1980s as a European standard for public mobile com-
munications, uses a combination of FDMA and TDMA technologies. It divides a 25 MHz

channel into 124 frequencies of 200 KHz each. Each 200 KHz channel is then divided into
eight time slots using TDMA. The modulation employed is a variation of FSK called Gaussian
minimum shift keying (GMSK), which uses filters to help reduce interference between adjacent
channels. GSM systems can transmit data at speeds up to 9.6 Kbps.
In 1989, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)
chose TDMA over FDMA as the technology of choice for digital
cellular networks. However, with the growing technology competi-
tion posed by CDMA and the fact that Europe was using GSM for
mobile communications, the CTIA reconsidered and decided to let
carriers make their own technology choices.
These three technologies—TDMA, CDMA, and GSM—make up the backbone of 2G digital
cellular telephony.
2.5 Generation Cellular Telephony Current digital cellular telephony far surpasses
the characteristics of 2G, and the industry’s transition to Third Generation proceeded at
an accelerated pace. Carriers were making major changes to the infrastructure of their
networks, and a completely new generation of mobile cellular devices was on its way. Until
the migration to Third Generation technology was completed, an interim step known as 2.5
Generation, or 2.5G, cellular systems was being widely deployed throughout North America.
2.5G networks operated at a theoretical maximum data rate of 384 Kbps for data transmissions.
They were also widely deployed in many other nations, such as China, Japan, and Korea, along
with a few cities in Europe.
The primary difference between 2G and 2.5G networks is that in 2.5G networks data is
transmitted over a packet-switched connection instead of a circuit-switched connection.
Although circuit switching is ideal for voice communications, it is not efficient for transmit-
ting data because data transmissions normally occur in bursts, with periods of delay in
between, when nothing is being transmitted. The delays result in time wasted while a chan-
nel is tied up, dedicated to one user.
Packet switching has two major advantages over circuit switching. First, packet switching is
much more efficient because it can handle three to five times more transmissions over a
given channel. Second, packet switching permits an always-on connection. With a circuit-
switched network, a connection between two devices ties up an entire channel that is dedi-
cated only to those devices; it is not practical to keep that connection open when there is
little or no traffic. Doing this would be like calling a friend on the telephone and then laying
the telephone down but not hanging up just in case you want to talk again later. Tying up
the line in this way prevents any other calls from coming in or going out. With packet
switching, it becomes practical to keep the data connection up all the time. Each packet is
transmitted independently through the network to the destination and only uses the channel
for the time required to transmit it. Other devices can use the same packet-switched connec-
tion to send and receive data, with each device taking a turn sending packets.
The always-on feature, along with higher transmission speeds, made
cable modems and DSL connections more popular than dial-up
connections for home use. You can watch TV or talk on the phone and
access the Internet at the same time. The computer can remain con-
nected to the Internet, and you don’t have to wait for a connection to
be reestablished when you want to browse the Web, send or check your e-mails, chat, etc.

There are three 2.5G network technologies. Which one is used depends on which 2G-
network technology is being migrated from. For TDMA or GSM 2G networks, the upgrade
path is a 2.5G technology known as general packet radio service (GPRS). GPRS uses eight
time slots in a 200 KHz spectrum and four different coding techniques, in addition to the
modulation used by GSM, to transmit at a top speed of 114 Kbps. The next upgrade step
beyond GPRS was Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE).
EDGE is a booster for GPRS systems and can transmit data at up to 384 Kbps. It is based
on a 8-PSK modulation, in which the phase of the carrier is shifted in 45-degree increments
and 4 bits can be transmitted per phase change. EDGE-based networks can coexist with
standard GSM networks.
If migrating from a 2G CDMA network, the transition is to CDMA2000 1xRTT (“1xRTT”
stands for “1-times Radio Transmission Technology”), which operates on a pair of 1.25-MHz-
wide frequency channels and is designed to support 144 Kbps packet data transmission and
to double the voice capacity of CDMA networks.
Third Generation Cellular Telephony Imagine using your cellular telephone to
videoconference with a friend in the United States while you are traveling on a train in
Japan. That was the original vision of Third Generation (3G), which was designed to be
a uniform and global standard for cellular wireless communication. The International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) suggested the following standard data rates for a wireless
cellular digital network:
●
144 Kbps for a mobile user
●
386 Kbps for a slowly moving user
●
2 Mbps for a stationary user
As with converting from a 2G network to a 2.5G network, converting from a 2.5G network
to a 3G network depends on the 2.5G technology that’s being converted from. If the transi-
tion is being made from CDMA2000 1xRTT, the transition would be to CDMA2000
1xEVDO (“EVDO” is short for “Evolution Data Optimized”). This technology can transmit at
2.4 Mbps. However, EVDO can only send data and must be coupled with 1xRTT to process
both voice and data. EVDO transmissions are very similar to those of 1xRTT, but EVDO
uses a pair of separate dedicated channels for data, often in new frequency bands being
added to the bands available for use with CDMA2000 technologies. EVDO radios measure
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in each channel pair every 1.667 milliseconds to determine
which cellular phone device to service next. By using dedicated data channels and continually
optimizing transmissions to the devices that have the best signal at any given time, EVDO can
achieve its higher data rates. The successor to CDMA2000 1xEVDO was to be CDMA2000
1xEVDV (“EVDV” is short for “Evolution Data and Voice”), which can send both data and
voice transmissions simultaneously over a packet-switched network. EVDV was the next logi-
cal upgrade path for this technology. It can reach data transfer speeds of up to 3.09 Mbps.
Release D of EVDV supports up to 1.0 Mbps upstream.
In 2005, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel Corporation in the
United States as well as Bell Canada and TELUS in Canada initiated
nationwide deployment of 1xEVDO. Alaska Communications Systems
(ACS) deployed 1xEVDO in Alaska’s main population centers.

If a network is transitioning from EDGE 2.5G technology, Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) is
the migration path to 3G. W-CDMA adds a packet-switched data channel to a circuit-switched
voice channel. It can send at up to 2 Mbps in a fixed position and 384 Kbps when mobile.
Beyond W-CDMA, the upgrade path is to High-Speed Downlink Packet Access, or HSDPA,
which can transmit at 8–10 Mbps downstream. HSDPA uses a 5 MHz W-CDMA channel
along with a variety of adaptive modulation, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) anten-
nas, and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) techniques, all grouped together to
achieve very high data rates. Several carriers in North America that were supporting GSM
moved quickly to update their equipment to HSDPA.
But the changes do not end there. As the number of subscribers increases, carriers are under
pressure to support more users with a limited amount of bandwidth. Most, if not all, of the
carriers that had deployed CDMA found themselves under pressure to move to a technology
that was proposed in 2005 and could support theoretical peak download data rates as high as
300 Mbps and upload rates of 75 Mbps. CDMA carriers needed to match these speeds, which
could not be accomplished with EVDV, so they began deploying and testing the immediate
successor to HSDPA, which is HSPA1. This technical standard, also called Evolved HSPA, pro-
vides theoretical data rates of up to 168 Mbps on the downlink (a realistic maximum is around
42 Mbps) and 22 Mbps on the uplink and combines two HSDPA transmitters into one, using
MIMO, 64 QAM modulation (downlink; 6 bits per symbol) and 16 QAM modulation (uplink;
4 bits per symbol). The two parallel transmission channels form a spatially multiplexed channel
that allows HSPAþ to achieve the higher data rates. Keep in mind that higher data rates are
also dependent on the processing capacity of the cellular phones themselves.
HSPAþ allows the carriers to move to an all-IP, packet-only architecture in which the base stations
can bypass the legacy infrastructure of cellular networks, connecting directly to a gateway and
using IP routing technology to forward packets to and from a mobile user. This means that even
voice calls are encapsulated into IP packets (VoIP), and this promotes more efficient use of the
available RF spectrum, reduces latency, and can handle up to five times more users per cell on the
downlink and twice the number of users on the uplink than previous generation systems. All of this
reduces the cost per bit for the carrier, and the savings eventually flow through to the end users.
HSPAþ also provides an upgrade path to the latest-generation technology, which many car-
riers worldwide are fast moving towards: LTE (Long Term Evolution), also known as “4G
LTE.” LTE expands the MIMO/Spatial Multiplexing beyond the 2 × 2 radio configuration
of HSPAþ, utilizes OFDM, and allows the use of wider bandwidth RF transmission chan-
nels, up to 20 MHz to achieve data rates up to 100 Mbps on the downlink.
You may be wondering if there is a next step in cellular technology. Yes, there is, and it is called
LTE Advanced, which the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) introduced in 2009. The
3GPP (see www.3gpp.org/Partners) is a group of six standards organizations from Asia, Europe,
and North America that proposed standards for GSM, GPRS/EDGE, HSDPA, HSPAþ, and
LTE. LTE Advanced, its proposed standard for broadband cellular telephony, expands on LTE
by allowing carriers to combine up to five 20-MHz-wide frequency channels to raise the maxi-
mum downlink data rate possible for mobile cellular devices to 1 Gbps. In addition, LTE
Advanced standardizes the use of very small cells, called microcells and femtocells, to further opti-
mize frequency reuse and allow more carriers to share the available frequency space (spectrum).
As competition increases and users demand better service and higher speeds for data, most
cellular networks worldwide are being rapidly upgraded to LTE technology. Some

challenges remain in a few countries concerning the availability of spectrum, but most gov-
ernments realize the potential for expansion of connectivity and are working towards mak-
ing more of the spectrum available. Figure 10-9 summarizes the technology paths to 4G.

Figure 10-10 shows a comparison of the data-rate speeds for various cellular technologies.
Client Software
Features such as Internet surfing and videoconferencing require client software to operate on a
wireless digital cellular device. The software provides the functions and interfaces that allow
users to display or manipulate the data. In the recent past, the number of cellular-capable
handheld devices that could display all the information on a Web page was very limited. This
has, of course, changed dramatically with the introduction of Apple iOS and Android operat-
ing systems for mobile devices. Today, these devices can display almost all Web page content,
with a few exceptions, notably Adobe Flash-based movies or similar animated content.
A few remaining legacy devices may still incorporate client software that is unique to cellular
telephones, but this situation is changing rapidly; in the near future, most mobile browsers
will support HTML 5 and will be able to display virtually any Web content in addition to
running a variety of software applications, including cloud-based applications. In fact, this is
the case with the Apple iOS and Android environments for both cellular phones and tablet
computers, as well as with some Nokia Symbian phones and the newest Blackberry models.
Historically, four technologies have provided standard ways to display Web content on cellu-
lar phones:
●
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)—Developed in 1997, WAP employed a tiny Web
browser program that ran on cellular phones and required a gateway computer that
translated Web pages into plain text. It was designed for monochrome display screens
and did not support color text or pictures. The WAP gateway translated the Web
pages using a simplified markup language called Wireless Markup Language (WML).

●
Wireless Application Protocol version 2 (WAP2)—WAP2 was based on XHTML and
could display text and graphics in color on small cellular phone screens without the
need for a gateway computer to translate the Web content.
●
Binary Run-Time Environment for Wireless (BREW)—Brew was a tiny software
environment that competed with WAP2 and could display a variety of content. It
also did not require a gateway to translate Web content for display on a cellular
phone.
●
i-mode—i-mode was a complete carrier-based Internet access system developed and
owned by the Japanese corporation NTT DoCoMo. It was based on compact HTML
(cHTML), a subset of HTML designed for mobile devices, which has its own set of
tags and attributes.
In addition to these specialized technologies, manufacturers began including support for the
Java programming language in some of the early smartphones. Java was developed by Sun
Microsystems (now part of the Oracle Corporation) as an object-oriented programming
language used for general-purpose business programs as well as for interactive Web sites.
Java can run on almost any hardware platform today, notable exceptions being the Apple
iPhone and iPad. A subset of Java, Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME), was specifically developed
for programming software applications for wireless devices.
J2ME-enabled cellular telephones have more intelligence than basic digital cellular tele-
phones that run a WAP microbrowser or i-mode. J2ME enables a cellular phone to access
remote applications and e-mail as well as run programs on the cellular phone itself. These
programs include voice-activated dialing, calendars, and voice recorders. The cellular phone
can handle specific tasks, such as automatically turning off the phone’s ringer and for-
warding calls to voicemail when the user is in a meeting that has been entered into the
phone’s calendar.
Digital Cellular Challenges and Outlook
Despite strong public skepticism in the late 1990s and early 2000s, cellular telephony did
sweep the world and has significantly changed the way people work and communicate.
With other options competing for users, such as WiMAX, and with globalization of markets
continuing, users stand to benefit the most from digital cellular telephony once the industry
settles on a single cellular standard, such as LTE. Having one standard available worldwide
will eventually lower costs for carriers, forcing them to deliver more competitive pricing
and services; it will also enable consumers to use their phones regardless of where they are
in the world.
Limited Spectrum The single largest factor limiting the development of 3G is the avail-
ability of spectrum. This problem was especially apparent in the United States, where a
shortage of frequencies delayed 3G and 4G implementation. Although both 3G and 4G can
operate in almost any part of the spectrum, the various cellular industry associations have
tried to designate a particular part of the spectrum for communications all over the world,
primarily to benefit users and lower costs for carriers. Currently, the 1.710–1.855 GHz and
2.520–2.670 GHz bands are designated as the spectrum to be used for 3G and 4G world-
wide. In North America, the 700 MHz band, formerly used for analog television channels,
374

is also being used for cellular networks; in Europe, the 500–800 MHz part of the spectrum
is being used.
For more information on 3G and 4G cellular technologies, visit
www.3gpp.org and www.umts-forum.org.
Cellular equipment manufacturers and carriers are continually looking for ways to maxi-
mize the use of the available frequency bands. Overlaying an inexpensive WiMAX network
on a cellular network for handling data is one potential way to free up more bandwidth for
voice calls and allow for a higher user load for data as well, provided that WiMAX-enabled
cellular devices are readily available.
The use of cellular data is growing at such a fast rate that carriers are struggling to keep
their networks updated. In fact, many of them are spending large sums of money to acquire
more bandwidth and are deploying more Wi-Fi hotspots, both in an attempt to reduce the
data load on their cellular networks. Because smartphone users are the largest users of
data, and because all smartphones today are equipped with Wi-Fi interfaces, this should
not be a problem. However, increased Wi-Fi use will reduce the revenues for the use of
data on the cellular networks, so carriers need to strike a balance between the two.
Costs The service fees for data can easily run over $100 per month for 500 megabytes of
e-mail, especially for people who travel often and need to roam with their phones. However,
this cost pales in comparison to the billions of dollars that carriers have to spend to build
and constantly upgrade their cellular networks. Just the cost of buying the necessary spec-
trum is astronomical. In early 2001, carriers in Germany paid over $46 billion for licenses
to use the spectrum. Carriers in other nations face similar costs, and that’s just one element
in building a modern cellular network. Networks must be deployed, tested, managed, and
maintained to keep customers satisfied with the service. In addition, the costs associated
with high-volume data connections to the Internet runs into the millions of dollars per
month.
Satellite Broadband Wireless
Although the use of satellites for personal wireless communications is fairly recent, satellites
have been used for worldwide communications for nearly 50 years. Satellite use falls into
three broad categories. The first use is for acquiring scientific data (e.g., measuring the radia-
tion from the sun) and performing research in space (e.g., gathering data from the Hubble
Space Telescope). The second use is for looking at Earth from space. This includes weather
and mapping satellites as well as military satellites. The third use is as reflectors that bounce
or relay signals from one point on Earth to another. This includes communications satellites
that reflect telephone and data transmissions, broadcast satellites that reflect television signals,
and navigational satellites. The three types of satellites are compared in Figure 10-11.
Wireless communications falls under the third use of satellites: bouncing signals from one
point on Earth to another.

Satellite Transmissions
Satellites generally send and receive on one of four frequency bands, which are known as
the L band, the C band, the Ku band, and the Ka band. These bands are summarized in
Table 10-3.
As you already know, frequency band affects the size of the antenna. Figure 10-12 compares
the typical sizes of antennas used for the four bands.

Class and Type of Service Satellites provide two classes of service: consumer class
and business class. Consumer class service shares the available bandwidth among the users;
business class service, the more expensive of the two, offers dedicated channels with dedi-
cated bandwidth.
Satellites that reflect signals back to Earth offer different types of service. They may be
designed for point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, or even multipoint-to-multipoint communi-
cations. This is shown in Figure 10-13.

Modulation Techniques Satellites use a variety of common modulation techniques,
most of which were discussed in Chapter 2. Here are brief descriptions of them:
●
Binary phase shift keying (BPSK)—Shifts the starting point of a carrier wave by 180
degrees, depending on whether a 1 or a 0 is being transmitted
●
Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)—Shifts the starting point of the carrier wave by
90 degrees; can transmit 2 bits per symbol
●
Eight-phase shift keying (8-PSK)—Can transmit up to 3 bits per symbol
●
16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM)—Primarily used for sending
data downstream; considered very efficient but is susceptible to interference, so not
generally used for upstream transmissions
Multiplexing Techniques Satellite systems employ two common multiplexing techni-
ques, FDMA and TDMA, along with some specialized techniques designed to maximize
utilization of these very expensive communications channels. Detailed coverage of these spe-
cialized techniques is beyond the scope of this book, but here are brief descriptions of them:
●
Permanently Assigned Multiple Access (PAMA)—One of the oldest techniques, in
which a frequency channel is permanently assigned to a user
●
Single channel per carrier (SCPC)—Assigns a frequency channel to a single source;
used for broadcasting radio stations, which are always transmitting
●
Multiple channel per carrier (MCPC)—Uses TDM to consolidate traffic from different
users on to each carrier frequency; in the European digital video broadcasting
standard, typically used in point-to-multipoint applications
●
Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA)—Allocates bandwidth on a per-call or per-
transmission session between two or more Earth stations; can efficiently share the pool
of available frequency and time resources and permits full mesh routing, similar to how
a telephone company’s switch works, but requires more complex and costly hardware
For TV broadcasting directly to the user (satellite TV), the set-top box
at the user’s home or office includes a utility that enables the instal-
lation technician to align the dish antenna with the satellite antenna.
The antenna needs to be initially positioned in a certain direction and
at a certain angle, then the technician uses the TV set and set-top
box and fine-tunes the antenna position until the strongest possible signal is achieved.
Satellite Classification
Satellite systems are classified according to the type of orbit they use. The three orbits are low
earth orbit (LEO), medium earth orbit (MEO), and high earth orbit (HEO). Most HEO satel-
lites fall into a subclass called geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO).
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites circle the Earth at altitudes
between 200 and 900 miles (321 and 1,448 kilometers). Because they orbit so close to
Earth, LEO satellites must travel at high speeds so that the Earth’s gravity will not pull
them back into the atmosphere. Satellites in LEO travel at 17,000 miles (27,359 kilometers)
per hour, circling the Earth in about 90 minutes.

Because LEOs are in such a low orbit, their area of coverage (called the footprint) is small,
as shown in Figure 10-14. This means that more LEO satellites are needed to provide cover-
age, compared to MEO and GEO satellites. One LEO system calls for over 225 satellites for
total coverage of the Earth.
LEO systems have a low latency (delays caused by signals that must travel over a long distance)
and use low-powered terrestrial devices (RF transmitters). It takes 20 to 40 milliseconds for a
signal to bounce from an Earth-bound station to a LEO, then back to an Earth station.
LEO satellites can be divided into Little LEO and Big LEO groups. Little LEOs provide
pager, satellite telephone, and location services. Using a Little LEO satellite, a user can
make a phone call from anywhere on Earth. In contrast, cellular telephone services require
the user to be within RF range of a transmission tower. Big LEOs carry voice and data
broadband services, such as wireless Internet access. Some satellite Internet services provide
shared downstream data rates of up to 400 Kbps but require a telephone connection for
upstream data to an ISP. Another LEO wireless Internet service provides two-way data ser-
vices with speeds of up to 500 Kbps. Two-way satellite Internet users need a two-foot by
three-foot dish antenna and two modems (one each for uplink and downlink).
In the future, LEOs are expected to be in demand for three markets: rural conventional tele-
phone service, global mobile digital cellular service, and international broadband service.
The speeds for wireless access are expected to exceed 100 Mbps.

Today, many companies use satellite technology to reduce line costs. In particular, drugstore
and supermarket chains, which usually have stores located in remote towns, use LEO satel-
lites to link these stores with the head office.
Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) Medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites orbit the Earth at
altitudes between 1,500 and 10,000 miles (2,413 to 16,090 kilometers). Some MEO satel-
lites orbit in near-perfect circles, have a constant altitude, and travel at a constant speed.
Other MEO satellites have elongated orbits called highly elliptical orbits (HEOs).
Because they are farther from the Earth, MEOs have two advantages over LEOs. First,
they do not have to travel as fast; a MEO can take up to 12 hours to circle the Earth.
Second, MEOs have a bigger Earth footprint; thus, fewer satellites are needed, as shown in
Figure 10-15. On the other hand, the higher orbit also increases the latency. A MEO signal
takes from 50 to 150 milliseconds to make the round trip.
The average orbit characteristics of a HEO satellite are about the same as a MEO. HEO
satellites have a high apogee (maximum altitude) and a low perigee (minimum altitude). In
addition, HEO orbits can provide good coverage in extreme latitudes. The orbits also

typically have a 24-hour period, which means the satellites dwell for a long time at a fixed
point over the Earth. This means that with just two satellites in the same orbit, one is always
visible from any point on the ground.
Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and High Earth Orbit (HEO) Geosyn-
chronous earth orbit (GEO) satellites are stationed at an altitude of 22,282 miles (35,860
kilometers). A GEO satellite orbit matches the rotation of the Earth and moves as the Earth
moves. This means that it remains “fixed” over a given location on the Earth and seems to
hang motionless in space. HEO satellites are somewhat rare, but they orbit the planet at a
much higher altitude—i.e., above 63,333 miles (101,925 kilometers). Because of their great
distance from the surface of the Earth, GEO and HEO satellites can provide continuous ser-
vice to a very large footprint. In fact, only three GEO satellites are needed to cover the entire
Earth (except for the polar regions). Their high altitude causes GEO satellites to have high
latencies of about 250 milliseconds and require high-powered terrestrial transmitting devices
along with very sensitive receiving equipment. GEO satellites are typically used for global
communications—such as TV broadcasting and weather forecasting—but are not normally
used for telephony or computer communications because of the one-quarter second delay in
round-trip transmissions. The distance of the satellite from the surface of the planet causes
this delay, and it affects the performance of computer communications protocols like TCP/IP.
Figure 10-16 shows how three GEO satellites can cover the entire planet. HEO satellites have
been used to monitor compliance with the nuclear test ban agreements; they are also used in
Russia to provide satellite services in the Polar Regions.
Although GEO satellites are much more expensive to launch, they are an attractive option
because of their lifespan of 12–15 years. (The average lifespan of a LEO satellite is only five
years.) Also, because their footprints are so large, they are much more efficient compared to
LEO satellites. LEO satellites spend a portion of their orbit over sparsely populated areas
where continuous coverage may not be needed. The International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) regulates GEO usage.

Some HEO satellites, like the ones used for Sirius satellite radio
(Radiosat), follow a highly elliptical orbit called Tundra. This orbit is
chosen because it allows the satellites to provide better coverage at
higher latitudes. Geostationary orbits are only possible around the
equator, which would make it difficult to provide service across
Canada and the northern part of the United States.
To find how many satellites are in orbit around Earth and operational at any moment, visit www.
ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-
database.html, where you can download the most current satellite database in either MS-Excel or
text format. These two files include the satellite names and provide a wealth of other information
about each device. The Apogee column lists the maximum altitude (distance from the planet).
NASA’s J-Track 3D Web site lets you see the orbits of all the satellites around Earth in real time
and get information on each satellite, such as its purpose, who owns the satellite, the orbital alti-
tude, and current location. Make sure Java is installed on your computer, then visit
science.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html. Note that you can also click and hold the left
mouse button inside the Java applet window and rotate the planet to view it from any angle.

Experimental Technologies
Satellites are sensitive to disturbances on the surface of our sun and other outer-space phe-
nomena that can cause interruptions in communications or incapacitate a very expensive sat-
ellite. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) experimented with
ultra-lightweight, solar-powered, unmanned high-flying aircraft in the 1990s (see www.nasa.
gov/centers/dryden/news/ResearchUpdate/Helios/index.html). The European Space Agency
(ESA) has a similar program. The idea behind developing these vehicles is that an aircraft
powered by solar cells and using fuel cells as a backup, flying at approximately 100,000
feet, could carry cellular telephone-switching equipment and circle the same area for several
days. These aircraft could be used in place of a satellite or ground-based antenna tower infra-
structure and would be significantly less expensive to launch and operate than a LEO satel-
lite. The aircraft could also be repaired, which is extremely difficult and expensive to do
with a satellite.
Satellite Technology Outlook
The fact that satellites can provide wireless communication service in areas not covered by
cellular or WiMAX means that end-users and companies will continue to rely on this tech-
nology indefinitely. Today’s satellites enable carriers—in combination with airlines, merchant
shipping companies, and tourism operators—to offer Internet access and voice calls to pas-
sengers and crews across large oceans as well as in high latitudes and remote corners of the
Earth. As reliance on communications and data connectivity continues to increase, these com-
panies will continue to look for ways of providing uninterrupted, faster, and lower¼cost
access for end-users. In addition, satellites can make these services available to unpopulated
areas of the planet, such as deserts, large forests, and mountainous regions, where it is not
economically viable for any carrier or operator to deploy the required infrastructure.
Chapter Summary
■In cellular telephone networks, the coverage area is divided into sections called cells.
Each cell includes one or more transmitters with which the mobile devices
communicate.
■The transmitters and cellular phones operate at a low level of power, which allows the
signals to stay confined to one cell and not interfere with other cells. This means the
same frequency can be used in other, nonadjacent cells at the same time. Cellular
phones have special codes associated with them that identify the phone, the phone’s
owner, and the carrier or service provider.
■Some cellular phones use SIM cards to store the user account information and, some-
times, the user’s contacts. SIM cards can be moved among different cellular phones,
and the phones do not have to be reprogrammed to use the same account and phone
number.
■When a cellular phone user moves from a cell to an adjacent cell, the cellular phone
will automatically associate with the base station of that cell. This is called a
“handoff.” If a cellular user moves beyond the coverage area of his cellular network,
the cellular phone automatically connects with whatever cellular network is in place in
the remote area. The cellular network in the remote area communicates with the one

in the home area and verifies that the user has a valid account and can make calls.
This connection to a cell outside a user’s home area is known as “roaming.”
■First Generation cellular technology, known as 1G, uses analog signals, is based on the
AMPS standard, operates in the 800–900 MHz frequency spectrum, and uses FDMA.
1G networks use circuit-switching technology and can transmit data at a maximum
speed of 9.6 Kbps.
■The Second Generation of cellular technology, known as 2G, can transmit data between
9.6–14.4 Kbps in the 800 MHz and the 1.9 GHz frequency bands and uses circuit-
switched networks. 2G systems use digital instead of analog transmissions. 2G systems
employ three different multiple access technologies: TDMA, CDMA, and GSM. GSM,
developed in Europe, uses a combination of FDMA and TDMA technologies.
■2.5G networks transmit data at a maximum speed of 384 Kbps. The primary differ-
ence between 2G and 2.5G networks is that 2.5G networks use a packet-switched
technique to transmit data instead of a circuit-switched technique. Voice calls still use
circuit switching. Circuit switching is ideal for voice communications but is not effi-
cient for transmitting data.
■3G networks provide new and expanded capabilities and data applications features to
mobile users. Because the networks are based on purely digital rather than analog
technology and can transmit at much higher speeds, they are not limited to circuit-
switched voice communications.
■4G networks achieve data rates that are competitive with wired communications. Long
Term Evolution (LTE) technology can achieve data rates as high as 75 Mbps.
■One of the most widely used applications in the world today is Short Message Services
(SMS). It allows for the delivery of short, text-based messages between wireless devices
such as cellular phones and pagers.
■3G and 4G cellular phones allow Internet surfing and videoconferencing. HTML-
compatible browsers allow cellular phones equipped with color screens to display rich
content. Many carriers worldwide are upgrading their networks to LTE at an acceler-
ated pace.
■Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) is a subset of Java specifically developed for program-
ming wireless devices. J2ME enables a cellular phone to access remote applications
and e-mail and run programs on the cellular phone itself.
■Satellites used for wireless data connectivity employ simple modulation and multiplex-
ing techniques. Satellite systems can transmit point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and
multipoint-to-multipoint.
■LEO satellites orbit the Earth at a low altitude and at high speeds. They have a limited
footprint and low latency and use low-powered terrestrial devices.
■MEO satellites orbit the Earth at higher altitudes than LEOs but do not travel as fast
as LEOs and have a bigger Earth footprint, requiring fewer satellites. MEOs have
higher latency than LEOs.
■GEO satellites orbit at much higher altitudes than MEOs, and their orbits match the
rotation of the Earth, so they stay in the same position with reference to a point on the
ground. GEO satellites have high latencies and require high-powered terrestrial send-
ing devices. GEO satellites are used for global communications.

telecommunications services in the northern part of Argentina. The company has contracted
TBG to assist it with the selection and implementation of a new field service system. The goal
is to provide service technicians with wireless access to the corporate network and a vast elec-
tronic library of technical manuals and schematic diagrams, which would reduce or eliminate
the need for staff to carry a large number of books and drawings, especially while servicing
equipment underground or when climbing on transmission towers. In addition, this means
that the technicians would be able to immediately read and update the records for all the
equipment, thereby avoiding massive amounts of paperwork as well as potential errors
and omissions. However, the company is having trouble deciding on which technology to
adopt—handheld cellular, tablets with 3G or 4G access, or notebooks equipped with cellular
cards. TBG has asked you to help.
Exercise 10-1
Create a presentation outlining the advantages for Telecom Argentina of using digital cellu-
lar handsets or cellular wireless cards. Determine the ability of the smaller cellular handsets
(as opposed to notebook computers, which may be difficult to carry everywhere) to display
standard PC documents such as Word, Excel, and PDF files, and evaluate how this could
help the company. Because the group you will be presenting to is composed of nontechnical
managers, be sure your presentation is not too technical. Limit yourself to a maximum of
15 PowerPoint slides.
Exercise 10-2
Jose Riveras, one of the senior executives at Telecom Argentina, was convinced by your
presentation. However, he recently heard about 4G cellular and wants to know how this
technology will affect the company’s plans to purchase equipment now. TBG has asked you
to create another presentation for Jose that explains the different generations of cellular
technology. Research the status of 4G deployment in Argentina, then create a PowerPoint
presentation consisting of 15–18 slides.
Challenge Case Project
Telecom Argentina is unsure about investing in cellular phones, so it is consider-
ing alternatives, including Wi-Fi tablets and notebook computers with the data
preloaded onto the devices. Working with three other students, form two teams
of two people, with each team selecting one of these technologies. Research in
depth the advantages and disadvantages of these respective technologies and
how they work. Hold a friendly debate in which each two-person team gives a
five-minute talk about the advantages of its technology. After the talk, allow
time for the others to ask questions.

Imagine that you are just making a quick stop at a local supermarket to pick up a
few grocery items. As you enter the store, you obtain a bag near the door. Then you walk
through the aisles and load the bag with the products you need. When you are finished,
you simply walk through an arch-like structure where the cash register should have been,
and then you exit the store. There’s no need to stop and pay for the products or even to
show anyone which products you purchased. You reach for your smartphone, check the
receipt, and connect to your bank, instantly verifying that the correct total was deducted
from your account.
While driving back home, you stop at a self-serve gas station to fill up the tank. You reach for
your smartphone again, activate an application, and bring the phone near the front panel of
the pump. The display on the gas pump beeps and authorizes your purchase. When you are
finished pumping and replace the gas nozzle, your smartphone beeps again and displays
the cost of the fuel. You press a button on the screen, and the smartphone displays the receipt.
Arriving home, you put your purchases in the refrigerator. A display screen on the refrigera-
tor door is automatically updated with the contents, the expiration date of each individual
product, and the quantity.
Although this example may sound like a futuristic dream, the standards and technology to
make it work are already in use. In fact, there is practically no end to the potential applications
of this technology. In this chapter, you will learn about how radio frequency identification
works, how it is being used, and some future applications. You will also learn about some of
the challenges related to the implementation of such systems.
What Is RFID?
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology similar to the barcode labels that are
used for almost every single off-the-shelf product anywhere in the world today, the difference
being that RFID uses RF waves instead of laser light to read the product code. RFID stores
product information in electronic tags. A tag is a small component that contains an antenna
and an integrated circuit chip. RFID tags can store significantly more information than the
bar-code system. This data, held in read-write or read-only memory, can include the date,
time, and location where the product was manufactured, the manufacturer name, product
serial number, and so on. In comparison, bar-code labels typically include only an item’s
stock-keeping unit (product code).
RFID technology is not new; it has been in use around the world, in one form or another, for
many years. In the late 1930s, the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy introduced a system designated
IFF (Identification Friend-or-Foe) that distinguished Allied aircraft from enemy aircraft by use
of special codes that could be read by a friendly aircraft at a distance. Likewise, for many
years, microchips and antennas inside tiny capsules have been implanted under the skin of
household pets. These tags contain a numeric code that gets registered in a centralized database
by the company that supplies the tags.
You may also be familiar with a simpler form of RFID that is frequently used in retail stores
to prevent theft. After you pay for an item, a small tag attached to the product is run through
a powerful magnet at the checkout; the magnet disables the tag, preventing it from activating
the alarm as you pass near an antenna located at the store entrance.

What is new about RFID has to do with the standardization efforts of the International Orga-
nization for Standardization (ISO) and EPCglobal Inc. EPCglobal is an organization entrusted
by industries worldwide to establish RFID standards and services for real-time, automatic
identification of products in the supply chain of any company anywhere in the world. By
publishing a single worldwide set of standards, it is possible for RFID to be implemented and
utilized in a global context. EPCglobal adopts the ISO 18000 series of standards for RFID;
these define the operating frequencies of the equipment and tags and include all of the other
relevant PHY and MAC layer specifications. The EPCglobal specifications concentrate on
defining services and higher-layer functions of the standards. In this section, you will learn
about the hardware, software, and services that are required to implement RFID. For more
information about EPCglobal, visit www.EPCglobalinc.org.
RFID System Components
Several components are required to implement an RFID system, connect it with a corporate
network, enable integration with existing business software, and ultimately connect with the
services that enable worldwide integration of a company’s suppliers, manufacturers, distri-
butors, and transportation providers. This section describes the most common components
required to implement an RFID system—the tags, antennas, readers, software, and the
EPCglobal Network services.
Electronic Product Code (EPC) RFID systems make use of product codes and data
formats standardized by EPCglobal Inc. The mission of EPCglobal is to make organizations
more efficient by making information about any kind of product available at any time and
anywhere. The standards published by EPCglobal enable users to track products from
manufacturing through to the end-user and beyond—potentially all the way to the recycling
depot or garbage heap. The Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a standardized numbering
scheme that can be programmed in a tag, which in turn can be attached to any physical
product. Think of EPC as the evolution of the barcode or Universal Product Code (UPC),
which you can find today in most products.
Each EPC is a unique number or code that is associated with an individual product—a case,
box, or pallet, depending on how the owner wishes to tag products so that the items can be
identified electronically. EPCs are usually represented in hexadecimal notation. A sample
code is shown in Figure 11-1.
The EPC is either 64 or 96 bits long. The 96-bit EPC includes the following fields:
●
Header—This 8-bit field identifies the EPC version number.
●
EPC Domain Manager—This 28-bit field identifies the manufacturer of the product;
it can represent almost 268.5 million different companies.

●
Object Class—This 24-bit field identifies a product’s stock keeping unit (SKU); it can
represent over 16 million different products for each company (e.g., each brand or
size of shampoo bottle produced by the same company as a different product).
●
Serial Number—This 36-bit field identifies each instance of a product; it can represent
over 68.7 billion unique serial numbers.
A 256-bit version of the EPC may be defined in the future. All the
EPCglobal specifications for the PHY layer allow for the EPC to be
expanded without any changes in the protocol.
The structure of the 64-bit and 96-bit EPCs is shown in Figure 11-2. Whether a manufac-
turer elects to use a 64-bit or a 96-bit EPC code is dependent on the company’s individual
needs and that of its clients. The Header field identifies which EPC format is being used,
and the software (discussed later in this chapter) translates the tag’s data into a format that
is compatible with the end-user’s business applications. Please note that the diagrams in
Figure 11-2 are only intended to show that there can be different formats; it does not go
into specific details. Also, these examples are not drawn in the correct scale based on the
number of bits in each field.
RFID Tags RFID tags are also commonly known as transponders. The word is a combi-
nation of “transmitter” and “responder.” A typical RFID tag includes an integrated circuit
that contains some nonvolatile memory and a simple microprocessor. These tags can store
data that is transmitted in response to an interrogation (a transmission) from a reader, the
device that captures and processes the data received from the RFID tags.
There are two basic types of tags: passive and active. Passive tags are the most common
type; they are small, can be produced in large quantities at low cost, and do not require
battery power. Passive tags use the electromagnetic energy in the RF waves transmitted by
the reader’s antenna to power the built-in chip and transmit the information stored in
its internal memory. Animal-tracking microchip implants, asset management, and access
management (access cards for security controlled doors and parking lots) are examples of
passive tag applications. Figure 11-3 shows an example of a passive tag.

Active tags are equipped with a battery to power the microprocessor chip and memory.
Having their own power source means that these tags can transmit the signal farther away
than passive tags can; however, active tags have a limited life due to the battery. They are
also far more expensive ($25 and higher) than passive tags and therefore are used to track
only high-value items, such as an entire pallet or container. An example of the application
of active tags is to track military supplies shipped around the world; they can also be used
for commercial applications, however. Some active tags are called beacons because they
transmit on a periodic basis without receiving an interrogation from a reader.
A variation of active tags is the semi-active tag. This type of tag, also called a semi-passive
tag, uses a built-in battery to power the circuit only when a reader first energizes (powers)
the tag. The energy transmitted by the reader activates the tag, which then uses the internal
battery to power its circuits and respond to the reader. The best example of this type of tag
is the devices used for electronic toll collection along highways. The batteries in semi-active
tags usually last several years, given that they are only used when the tag is activated by
the reader’s electromagnetic field.
The size of the memory in a tag varies with the manufacturer and application but is usually
between 16 bits (for storing temporary operation parameters) and hundreds of kilobits.
The tags are initially programmed with a unique identification code obtained from
EPCglobal. The additional memory can be used to record historical information about
the product to which the tag is attached, such as the health and vaccination records of cat-
tle, the temperatures that a product has been exposed to during shipping (using a sensor
attached to the tag), manufacturing and testing dates, calibration records for test equip-
ment, and so on.
All three types of tags can be produced in flexible packages, also called smart labels. Smart
labels include an adhesive backing and can be attached to a box, the underside of a product
casing, or a pallet. Smart labels can be used to track luggage in airplanes and trains, for
example. Because they use RF, the tags are not limited to being placed in a visible area
or on the outside packaging of a product. They can be read regardless of their position or
orientation, which is one of the major advantages of RFID over bar codes. The ability to
read the tags in any position avoids the difficulty store clerks sometimes have of getting the
equipment at the counter to read the bar-code labels on products.

Tags called 1-bit tags are passive devices used in some retail stores. They do not contain a
unique identification code, a chip, or any memory. They are simply used to activate an
alarm to prevent theft. Figure 11-4 shows a 1-bit tag and a passive tag applied to the inside
of a product package. These can be used for security, but the passive tag can also be used
for inventory control.
An emerging form of RFID is chipless tags, also known as RF fibers. Chipless tags do not
contain an integrated circuit or memory. Instead, they use fibers or other types of materials
that reflect a portion of the reader’s signal back; the unique return signal can be used as an
identifier. The fibers are made of thin threads, fine wires, or laminates that affect the propa-
gation of RF waves. Chipless tags are typically used in applications in which the tag needs
to be hidden and very difficult to reproduce. One example is the card invitations used for
high-end events such as the Academy Awards (Oscars).
Chipless tags can be used to identify specific paper-based documents inconspicuously, which
means that a person handling the document is not necessarily aware that it is “tagged.”
Chipless tags also perform far better than other types of tags when attached to a metal
surface or to a liquid container. Both cans and bottles present significant problems for most
RFID systems because metal surfaces can affect the propagation of RF waves and because
most liquids attenuate the signal. Chipless tags can be read at greater distances than 1-bit
or passive tags.
Sensory tags, as their name indicates, can be equipped with thermal, gas, smoke, pressure,
and a variety of other kinds of sensors to monitor and record environmental conditions,
liquid volume levels, or attempts to tamper with a product. They can be produced as
passive tags; however, the sensors are not powered until a reader interrogates the tag.
Most sensory tags are considerably more expensive than other types of passive tags, come

in larger packages, and may be equipped with replaceable batteries that allow them to be
used for longer periods of time.
To learn more about RFID and its applications, including sensory
tags, you can watch a short video clip at www.symbol.com/video/
RFID_VNR_Only_1.wmv. (To view this on a Mac, you will need to
install a WMV player such as Flip4Mac.)
The cost of a tag can vary greatly, depending on the type and number of tags purchased
over a period of time. In general, passive tag prices range between $0.07 and $0.25 each.
As the technology develops and the volumes increase, RFID manufacturers and users expect
the cost to fall well below $0.05 per tag. Sensory tags can cost between $25.00 and $100.00
each, depending on the battery life and capabilities.
Table 11-1 compares the tag classes specified by EPCglobal.
Class-0 tags may still be in use in many locations around the world. However, the Class-0
tag communication protocols are not compatible with the tag classes listed in Table 11-1,
and tag types cannot be mixed and used in the same system.
Readers In addition to interfacing with the tags, readers (also called interrogators)
connect with the company’s network and transfer the data obtained from the tags to a com-
puter. Some readers can also write data onto tags, but those devices are still called readers.
Readers that work with passive tags also provide the energy that activates the tags. The read
distance is determined by the size and location of the tag and the reader antennas as well
as the amount of power transmitted. These specifications are generally limited by national

regulations that specify how much power can be transmitted in each frequency. Variations
in regulations can result in incompatibilities between the equipment manufactured and
licensed for use in different countries.
It is important to keep international standards and regulations in mind when designing and
implementing an RFID system that will be used to identify products worldwide; these are
generally available from the ISO and EPCglobal.
The frequency ranges and common applications of RFID systems are shown in Table 11-2.
Figure 11-5 shows an LF RFID reader used to scan cattle and an LF tag applied to the
mock-up of a cattle ear.
RFID readers come in as many sizes and types as there are applications for this technology.
From left to right, Figure 11-6 shows three examples of RFID readers, each with its own
antennas. There is a fixed reader designed to be installed at a retail store entrance, a hand-
held reader designed to be plugged into a computer’s USB port, and a self-contained,
computer-based RFID reader (top right) with tags.

Antennas In Chapter 4, you learned that antennas are responsible for converting the RF
energy from the transmitter into electromagnetic waves. The design and location of an
antenna can significantly affect the range of the signal and the reliability of the communica-
tions. RFID antennas used in tags may be limited in size due to the dimensions of the tag
itself. Most tags are small, which allows them to be placed in a variety of different products
and packaging.
There are two main types of tag antennas: linear and circular. Linear antennas offer greater
range but less accurate reads. Circular antennas have greater read accuracy, especially in
applications in which the orientation of the antenna varies due to positioning of the pro-
ducts, but have a more limited range. Some older-style RFID tags sported a large circular
antenna that spiraled outward from the center of the tag, where the chip was located.
These types of tags are not often used today.
Larger antennas allow the tags to be read at greater distances than smaller antennas. How-
ever, remember that, as the frequency increases, the wavelength gets smaller and, conse-
quently, so does the antenna. Higher-frequency antennas can be made relatively small and
still allow the tags to be read at greater distances than lower-frequency tags with the same
antenna size. Conversely, to detect a higher-frequency signal and minimize attenuation, the
antenna needs to be approximately 10–20 microns thick (10 microns ¼ 0.0003937 inches).
Lower-frequency antennas can be 2 microns thick. RFID tag design can be quite complex,
due to antenna size and thickness, and this can significantly affect read performance. In
passive tags, the antenna itself acts as the energy storage device, which supplies electricity
to the tag and allows it to respond to a reader. Figure 11-7 shows additional examples of
RFID tags.
Reader antennas have to be designed for the specific type of application. Whether the
antenna will be located at a retail store entrance for security reasons, near a warehouse shelf,
or on a refrigerator door, the type, size, shape, and location of the antenna are critically impor-
tant to ensure good readability and accuracy. No “typical” style of RFID antenna exists;

the variety is huge. To see examples of different RFID reader antenna types, visit www.inter-
mec.com/products/rfid/antennas/index.aspx or search the Web for “RFID antennas.”
You can also search the Web for additional examples of RFID antennas. Always keep in
mind, however, that for many specialized RFID applications, antennas may need to be
custom designed.
Software The type of software used in an RFID implementation depends on the specific
RFID application. Nevertheless, there are three basic categories of software components pres-
ent in every RFID system: system software, middleware, and business application software.
System software is usually stored in read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory and is pres-
ent in both the tag and the reader. It is executed by the microprocessor in each device and is
used to control hardware functions, implement communication protocols (including collision
control, error detection and correction, authorization, authentication, and encryption), and
control the flow of data between tags and readers.

Middleware is responsible for reformatting the data from the readers to comply with
the formats required by the business applications. It usually runs on a computer that is
implemented as a gateway between the readers and the other data-processing equipment at
the end-user company. Because each company will likely use different types of business soft-
ware, RFID middleware allows users to ensure that they can communicate with the RFID
equipment. Keep in mind that middleware is not typically sold as prepackaged software,
like Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat, for example. Instead, each company in the business
of providing RFID solutions usually writes its own middleware application software or uses
a customizable software package provided by the reader manufacturer.
Business application software is responsible for processing orders, inventory, shipments,
invoices, and so on. This type of software also usually relies on database software to store
and manage all the transaction records in a typical business period.
EPCglobal Network Services
To use bar codes, a business has to record in a database the item’s UPC (bar code), the com-
pany’s internal product number (SKU), a product description, the manufacturer’s name, the
price, and the quantity of items in stock. It then has to cross-reference the bar code and
SKU so that this information can be accessed by the bar-code readers at the cash register.
With RFID, because the EPC already contains a reference to the manufacturer along with
a product code, the need for manually entering data for cross-referencing is reduced; the
potential for introducing errors when entering this information into the database is less-
ened as well.
The manufacturer name is used to reorder products when the stock is low or depleted. With
EPCs, companies will be able to acquire the manufacturer’s name over the Internet using a
service from EPCglobal called Object Name Service (ONS). Modeled after the Internet’s
Domain Name System (DNS), ONS is a mechanism for discovering information about a
product and related services. When a reader gets the EPC from a tag, it passes it to the com-
pany’s servers, which send it to ONS via the Internet. Upon identifying the manufacturer,
ONS responds with the URL of the Internet server where the product information is stored.
The company’s servers can then retrieve all the information about that particular product
and can use this for additional data processing.
If you are not familiar with how the Domain Name System (DNS) works,
read the information at http://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm.
Eventually, trillions of products from millions of companies will likely be included in the
ONS database. Like DNS, ONS will be a worldwide-distributed database.
An additional component that will enable companies around the world to exchange informa-
tion regarding their trade transactions is EPC Information Services (EPCIS). Similar to the
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) specifications that many large companies use to complete
paperless transactions, EPCIS will eventually enable large organizations to purchase, invoice,

and track product orders over the Internet, eliminating the need to send paper documents
by mail or fax. Figure 11-8 shows the five fundamental components of an EPCglobal RFID
system—tags, readers, middleware, business applications, and EPCglobal services—and how
they are logically connected.
How RFID Works
Describing how the different RFID tags and readers work would require an entire book,
given that these devices use different transmission techniques in each frequency band. This
section introduces you to the technical details of how two of the most common types of
passive tags and readers transmit and communicate with each other: UHF (400–900 MHz) and
HF (13.56 MHz).

PHY Layer
A passive tag, the most common type, only transmits when it receives a signal from the reader.
The connection between a tag and a reader is called a coupling. RFID primarily uses two types
of coupling, depending on the application:
●
Inductive or magnetic coupling—This type is designed for tags that either touch the
surface of the antenna or are inserted in a slot in the reader’s case. In these systems,
the tags are typically used at a maximum distance of half an inch (just over 1 centimeter)
from the antenna. The basic difference between inductive and magnetic coupling is the
shape of the antennas.
●
Backscatter coupling—This type is designed for tags that can be read at distances
greater than 3.3 feet (one meter) and up to 330 feet (100 meters) in some cases.
Backscatter is a reflection of radiation. Recall that passive tags are powered by an RF signal
sent by the reader. After the reader transmits data (the reader transmission itself supplies
power to the tag, so it can receive and decode the reader’s transmission), it then begins to
transmit a continuous wave (CW), which is an unmodulated sine wave. The CW is captured
by the passive tag’s antenna, and the tag uses the energy from the CW to supply power to the
chip so that the tag can respond to the interrogator. The tag essentially reproduces (reflects)
the same wave it receives from the reader, but it modulates this signal with the data by
changing the electrical properties and consequently the reflection coefficient of its own
antenna. This means that the antenna will transmit with more or less power, affecting the
amplitude of the signal reflected.
Backscatter modulation is based on variations of amplitude shift keying (ASK) or a combina-
tion of ASK and phase shift keying (PSK), both of which you learned about in Chapter 2.
The data is also digitally encoded to ensure that there will be enough transitions between
0 and 1 and vice versa to assist the devices in maintaining synchronization during transmis-
sion. (In Chapter 2, see the section titled “Binary Signals.”)
The reader has separate transmitter and receiver circuits and antennas; and because it is a
powered device, it transmits a much stronger (higher-amplitude) signal than the tags. In
order to detect the modulated signal from the tag, the receiver in the reader compares its
own strong CW signal with the backscatter. The difference between the two is the data sent
by the tag.
Both reader and tag modulate the signal in amplitude by as much as 100 percent or by as lit-
tle as 10 percent. Ten percent modulation is more sensitive to interference and noise, but the
signal can travel farther. One hundred percent modulation is easier for the reader to detect;
but during the periods without a CW, the tags are not being powered, so the distance
between tag and reader must be significantly reduced. In practice, the signal is modulated
somewhere between 10 percent and 100 percent, given that neither of the extremes is very
usable. The resulting modulation is a result of the amount of power generated by the reader
and the size of the antenna. Figure 11-9 shows a signal modulated at 10 percent and at
100 percent. Note that the signals in the figure are not drawn to scale, in amplitude or in
frequency.
Communications between tag and reader are always half-duplex. Interrogators and tags do
not transmit and receive data simultaneously. To prevent interference issues from affecting

the reliability of RFID systems, and to allow for environments in which multiple readers
are installed in the same area (also called dense interrogator environments), the EPCglobal
standards also specify the use of frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct
sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) transmission. The latter systems are generally only used
for advanced active tags.
HF Tag Communication
HF RFID transmission uses a protocol called Slotted Terminating Adaptive Collection
(STAC), in which the tags reply within randomly selected positions or time intervals, referred
to as slots, which are the reply intervals used in the STAC protocol. The interrogator trans-
mits signals to mark the beginning and end of each slot, depending on the amount of data
requested from each tag. Figure 11-10 shows the concept of slots. Note that the slots are
not equal in size (the figure is not to scale). The number of slots is regulated by the inter-
rogator and is always a power of two. Some shorter slots may exist when there is no reply
from any tags, in which case the interrogator terminates the slot. The maximum number of
slots available is 512. The STAC protocol is used to prevent tag collisions in HF, and it is
described further in the section titled “Tag Collision Handling in HF.” Note that slot F is
always present and signals the beginning of the reply intervals. Slot F is the only one with

a fixed size. It also ends automatically, meaning that the interrogator does not signal the
end of slot F.
UHF Tag Communication
UHF readers today support what is called Generation 2 (Gen2) protocols. Gen1 protocols
may still be used for tags and readers, but support for Gen1 RFID technology is quickly
being discontinued.
The Gen2 protocol defines three techniques for communication between tags and readers. In
the first technique, a reader can select tags by transmitting a bit mask that isolates a tag or
group of tags. The bit mask works very similarly to the way network masks work in IP
addressing, by isolating subnets. In the second technique, a reader can inventory tags by iso-
lating them using a repetitive process (described later in this chapter). In the third technique,
once the EPC for a particular tag is known to the system, a reader can alternatively access
each tag individually. Gen2 readers may transmit with a lot more power and UHF systems
are designed to work at greater distances than HF.
Tag Identification Layer
When an interrogator initiates communication in an RFID system, there must be a way to
prevent every tag within range of the reader’s signal from responding at the same time. The
tag identification layer defines three methods that allow an interrogator to manage the popu-
lation of tags within reach of its signal: select, inventory, and access.
With the select method, an interrogator sends a series of commands to select a particular seg-
ment of the population of tags within its reach. This is done in preparation for an inventory or
for the purpose of accessing a specific tag. The selection is based on user-specified criteria, such
as a particular category of products from one manufacturer. Tags do not respond to these
commands. They simply set internal flags (bits) for responding to later transmissions. In UHF,
with the inventory method, an interrogator sends out a series of query commands to get infor-
mation from one tag at a time. As each tag receives an acknowledgment from the interrogator,
it resets the inventory flag and does not respond to further inventory commands in the same
round. In HF, the interrogator simply waits for each tag to reply in a different slot. With the
access method, the interrogator sends one or more commands to multiple tags or exchanges
data with a single tag at a time after uniquely identifying the tag with a command.
The minimum amount of information contained in a tag’s memory is the EPC, a 16-bit cyclic
redundancy check (CRC), and a destroy password. The destroy password is a code pro-
grammed into the tag during manufacturing. After the destroy password is transmitted by
the reader, the tag is permanently disabled and can never be read or written to again. This
tag information structure is shown in Figure 11-11.

Tag and Reader Collisions
With a potentially very large population of tags, all tags may respond to a reader at the same
time. Depending on whether each product is tagged or not (in warehouses, only boxes or pal-
lets may be tagged), this would result in collisions and would prevent the reader from identi-
fying individual tags. LF tags and readers do not support any collision-handling mechanism;
therefore, LF systems can only read one tag at a time. This is not an issue when the applica-
tion is reading an access card used to open a door or reading cattle tags as the animals pass
through a narrow corridor one at a time. However, for RFID to work in a warehouse, in a
store, or inside a refrigerator, a better solution is available.
Tag Collision Handling in UHF Because the reader initially may not know which
tags are present within the range of its signal, and because new tags may enter the reader’s
signal field from time to time, the reader may send a VerifyID command. However, if you
consider how shelves in a store or warehouse are typically organized, the tags within a certain
reader’s field belong to certain groups of products. All tags within the reader’s field that are the
intended recipients of the verification command will reply with their EPC, CRC, and destroy
password. If the reader can identify at least one of these tags, it can proceed to select a range
of tags by sending a series of commands that instruct the tags about an upcoming inventory.
The process repeats until the reader has identified every group of tags within range of its signal.
The reader can also tell a tag or a group of tags to be quiet by sending a special command.
This selection process can be compared to a teacher that meets her class for the first time at
the beginning of a semester and does not have a list with the names of all the students. To
identify each student, the teacher might begin by asking all students to call out their full
names. Initially, several students may reply at the same time. The teacher can then ask the
students whose last names begin with the letter A to call out their names. Again, she may
get more than one reply and not be able to single out a student. Next, she can request that
only those students whose last names begin with the letters AA call out their names. This
time, the chances of getting multiple simultaneous replies will be much smaller.
By repeating this process and refining the query, eventually the reader will have enough
information to be able to communicate with all the tags within a group. It then sends a com-
mand to an entire group to set an inventory flag. The next command instructs the tags that
the reader will begin an inventory round. During the inventory round, the reader sends an
inquiry to each individual tag. Once a tag has replied to an inventory query, it resets its inven-
tory flag and does not reply again until the reader announces the next inventory round.
Tag Collision Handling in HF In HF systems, the reader selects groups of tags based
on the STAC protocol. Each tag uses its EPC, CRC, and destroy password to calculate a
64-bit or 96-bit EPC

number that becomes the slot number in which each particular tag will reply. The calcula-
tion uses the above parameters along with a random number generator in each tag. The
reader then begins an inventory round and waits for each tag to reply in its own time slot,
which prevents collisions. The ISO standard assumes that the number of potential collisions
in these cases will be less than 0.1 percent. If a collision does occur, thereby preventing the
inventory process from finishing correctly, the reader will select a smaller group of tags using
the process described earlier, under HF tag communication, and repeat the inventory process.
Reader Collisions Reader collisions may also happen in dense reader environments. If a
reader does not receive any replies, it assumes a reader collision has occurred, which means
that the tags could not understand the last reader transmission, and backs off for a random
period of time before listening for network traffic and attempting to transmit again.
MAC Layer
The RFID MAC layer is responsible for establishing and communicating the transmission
parameters—such as transmission bit rate, modulation type, operating frequency range, and
frequency hop channel sequence—that are used for communications at the PHY layer. The
reader sends commands to the tags establishing the communication parameters for each
communications session. The MAC layer parameters for different types of tags—HF, UHF,
and others—differ. These variances usually don’t pose a problem because it is unlikely that an
end-user company will use multiple types of tags in a single environment or application.
Data Rates
As you learned earlier, the amount of data stored in a typical passive RFID tag is relatively
small. The lack of a power supply along with low processing power, both of which help
keep the tag cost low, means that the resulting data transmission rates for the tags are also
low. Some of the EPCglobal standards specify a minimum number of tags per second that a
reader should be able to access rather than a specific data rate.
The specifications for HF tags call for readers to be capable of reading 200 tags per second.
For tags containing just an EPC, the actual rates will likely be between 500 and 800 tags
per second.
The UHF specifications define the tag-to-reader data rate as twice that of the reader-to-tag
rate. In North America, the allowed tag-to-reader data rate can be up to 140.35 Kbps. In
Europe, due to the RF signal power limitations, the maximum data rate is only 30 Kbps.
Conversely, reader-to-tag data rates are 70.18 Kbps in North America and 15 Kbps in
Europe. The Gen2 protocol specifications support much faster tag isolation, which results
in tag read rates as fast as 1,600 per minute in North America and 600 per minute in Europe.
Near-Field Communications
Now that you have a pretty good understanding of RFID, it’s time to find out about Near
Field Communications technology. Near Field Communications (NFC) is a technology that
provides short-range wireless connectivity between devices such as smartphones and tablet
computers. NFC is based on the ISO 18092 RFID technology standard along with those of
several other organizations.
Near-Field Communications

NFC requires little or no configuration by users, and devices connect automatically as soon
as they are brought to within a minimum of 1.6 inches (4 centimeters) of each other. This
technology is able to transfer data between devices or read passive tags at rates of between
106 Kbps and 424 Kbps.
NFC originated from and is compatible with FeliCa, a smart card protocol created by Sony
that is still in use in parts of Asia, and the MIFARE protocol developed by Philips; both
protocols were designed for payment systems. The NFC Forum, founded in 2004 by Nokia,
Philips, and Sony, created a set of specifications that builds on RFID and enables contactless
two-way data transfer between two powered devices—beyond the typical one-way communi-
cation that happens between a smart card and a reader.
NFC can be used with a handheld device for the following:
●
MasterCard PayPass transactions and Visa payWave transactions at stores and
restaurants
●
Electronic discount coupons
●
Exchanging business cards, schedules, and maps between handheld devices
●
Transferring images, videos, and other types of files between devices or between a
device and a printer
●
Debit card or prepaid card transactions
●
Electronic public transport system tickets
●
Airline tickets
●
Pairing Bluetooth devices without entering a PIN
●
Storing and using secure, encrypted identification numbers, electronic signatures,
access codes, and passwords
NFC Operation Modes
NFC-capable handheld devices are typically equipped with a low-power interrogator that can
supply power and read tags. The technology uses inductive coupling between two loop
antennas. An NFC device can operate in the following modes:
●
Listen mode—The initial mode of an NFC device, in which the device essentially acts
as a passive tag.
●
Poll mode—When an NFC device generates a CW and probes for other devices within
its communication range of 1.6 inches (4 centimeters).
●
Reader/writer mode—When an NFC device in Poll mode behaves like an interrogator.
In this mode, devices can transmit commands to other devices.
●
Card emulator mode—When an NFC device in Listen mode behaves like a smart card.
●
Initiator mode—When an NFC device in Poll mode changes the communication
protocol to talk to another device that only supports half-duplex communications,
using the NFC-Data Exchange Protocol (NFC-DEP).
●
Target mode—When an NFC device is the target of an initiator that can only
communicate in half-duplex mode, using NFC-DEP.

The Initiator and Target modes are a unique characteristic of NFC that differentiates it from
RFID in the sense that NFC-capable devices are able to exchange many different types of
information with other NFC-capable devices. RFID, on the other hand, is limited to commu-
nications between readers and tags. NFC devices can read from and write information to tags
when operating as interrogators and can also behave like passive RFID tags.
NFC Tags and Devices
The NFC specifications currently define four types of tags. Each type of tag is designed for
a different purpose and has slightly different capabilities, including the amount of memory.
Different tag types also communicate using slightly different frame formats, at different
speeds, and use different digital encoding (NRZ, NRZ-I, etc.) and different synchronization
and modulation methods. Thus, the first thing an NFC-capable device in Poll mode needs to
do is identify the type of tag—or tags, given that there may be more than one within range of
its magnetic field.
Some tags can be written to only once; others can be protected by a password so that they
cannot be written to again unless they are unlocked. The memory on the tag can be used to
store URLs, business cards, pictures, brochures in PDF files, etc. This makes NFC far more
flexible, useful, and accurate than the Quick Response (QR) codes that are very popular
today. Depending on the type, NFC tags can store anywhere from 48 bytes to 32 KB of infor-
mation. Virtually everyone can purchase NFC tags for as little as $15.00 and, with the right
type of application loaded on their phones, program the tags using a smartphone (see www.
tagstand.com). You can find more information about NFC tags at kimtag.com/s/nfc_tags.
NFC technology is still evolving. Although the ISO 14443 specifications have been ratified,
the best way to find out which devices currently support NFC, along with the latest news of
the industry, is to browse the NFC World Web site at www.nfcworld.com.
NFC Communications
NFC-capable devices transmit in the 13.56 MHz unlicensed frequency band (the same as for
HF RFID) and modulate the signal using ASK or a combination of ASK and PSK over a
range of approximately 7–14 KHz of RF bandwidth. Modulation varies between 10 percent
and 100 percent, depending on the type of tag. The digital signal is encoded using a method
similar to the return-to-zero (RZ) technique you learned about in Chapter 2, which provides
enough signal transitions to help ensure good synchronization between wireless devices and
between devices and tags.
To transfer data between two smartphones or tablet computers, NFC employs the Data
Exchange Protocol (NFC-DEP). A DEP message consists of one or more records. Each record
is encapsulated in an RF frame that contains a header and a payload. The header includes the
following fields:
●
Identifier—This optional field is used to define the type of payload carried by the
record.
●
Length—This field can be one octet long for short records but is normally four octets
long. A payload length of 0 is used to indicate an empty message (no payload field)
and signals the end of the current NFC-DEP communication session.
●
Type—This field indicates what type of data is carried within the payload and will
be used by the receiving device to decide which application will process the data.

For example, pictures are stored in the photo application and URLs are sent to the browser
application. An error is generated if the device cannot support the data type specified in this
field.
Figure 11-12 shows the components of a DEP message and how they relate to one another.
RFID Applications
This section outlines a few of the more interesting RFID applications. These are only the tip of
the iceberg, however; the potential uses for RFID are practically unlimited.
One of the possible applications of RFID is a wireless mouse that
doesn’t require batteries. The RFID reader is built into a special
mouse pad, and the mouse is essentially a passive RFID tag.
Automobile Security
Many new cars are equipped with an antitheft device called an immobilizer. The vehicle’s
ignition key head contains a tiny Class-1 RFID chip that transmits in the 135 KHz frequency
band. A hardware store copy of the key can be inserted in the ignition, but it cannot start the
engine. When the original key is inserted in the ignition, a small reader device in the steering
column transmits a signal to the key to activate it. The computer that controls the engine
only allows the engine to start upon receiving a response from the tag chip in the key. If
you lose your key and obtain a replacement from the dealer, you must program the new key
in the car. Most vehicles equipped with this type of immobilizer provide in the owner’s man-
ual a series of instructions on how to accomplish this.

Health Care
In hospitals, RFID tags in a patient’s identification bracelet can provide vital information that
cannot be easily misplaced. The tag can contain the patient’s admission history, blood type,
medications, prescribed dosages, and so on, and it can be read by handheld devices carried
by staff. In addition, the EPC on the tag can instantly link the hospital staff with the patient’s
record in the hospital’s database. This feature can prevent errors and also enhance patient
comfort and safety.
For elderly and very young patients, the system can sound an alarm if the patient leaves a
designated area. Newborn babies and their mothers can wear bracelets that contain matching
information, ensuring that the right baby goes to the right mother. Such tags could also
prevent babies from being taken out of the hospital by an unauthorized person.
Transportation and Military
RFID tags embedded in standard courier packages and other small boxes can speed up and
help automate sorting as well as prevent errors. The wide variety of shapes and sizes of
packages today makes it almost impossible to completely automate the process. Humans
must still handle the packages and bar-code readers by hand.
During the recent wars in the Middle East and Bosnia, materials officers in the armed forces
were faced with having to transport millions of pieces of equipment, ammunition, and
replacement parts, often on short notice. With many of these items stored in sealed contain-
ers at very large military warehouses all over the United States, coordinating and tracking
these shipments is a challenge. Missing or incorrectly stored spare parts and ammunition
can put the lives of large factions of the military at serious risk. The U.S. Department of
Defense’s material goods inventory is valued at over $700 billion, and part of it is composed
of perishable or sensitive items—including explosives—that must be protected from extreme
environmental conditions.
During Operation Desert Storm, over 40,000 containers were shipped
to the Persian Gulf. Because these shipments could not be adequately
tracked while in transit, “iron mountains” accumulated in ports and
airfields across the United States, which, in many instances, con-
tained redundant materials and supplies. At least two-thirds of
these containers had to be opened so that personnel could see what was inside. This can be
a dangerous operation when the containers are loaded with explosive items like bullets, missiles,
or bombs.
The DoD handles approximately 100,000 ground combat and tactical vehicles, 250,000
wheeled vehicles, 1,000 strategic missiles, 300 ships, and 15,000 aircraft and helicopters.
These items are involved in approximately 300,000 shipments per year. When it was initially
deployed, the DoD RFID system comprised more than 800 locations with over 1,300 read/
write stations used to manage the flow of supplies through the military’s In-Transit Visibility
(ITV) network.
Sports and Entertainment
RFID tags are used for monitoring tire pressure in racecars. The tiny tags with a built-in
sensor and battery are installed right on the tire valve and can be read automatically or

manually from inside the car. This technology can also be used in transport trucks and
interstate buses; on these vehicles, the tags help save money by controlling tire wear and
preventing accidents related to tire condition. Tire pressure monitors are beginning to appear
in luxury automobiles as well; these can provide an added measure of safety. Monitoring
participants in marathons and triathlons is another common use for RFID tags.
RFID usage is not limited to exotic sports. Common sports such as golf can also benefit from
RFID technology. The cost of a high-quality golf ball today can be quite high. Passive tags
can be installed inside the balls so that, if they are lost during a game, a pocket reader can
help the owner locate the ball in tall grass fields, among trees or fallen leaves, and even
under water, depending on the technology employed.
In 2004, the Golden Globe awards used an inconspicuously placed RFID tag in the event
invitations to prevent unwelcome paparazzi and other members of the public from entering
the event.
People Monitoring, Crowds, and Access
In large amusement parks, parents of children wearing special bracelets containing RFID
tags can instantly locate the kids if they become separated from them. Readers installed
throughout the park track the location of the youngsters, and parents can go to a kiosk
that instructs them how to locate their children, based on information the reader gets
from the parent’s own RFID tags. Figure 11-13 shows an example of an RFID tag bracelet
used to identify people.

In an application similar to the Golden Globe awards, RFID-tagged concert and sports event
tickets can simplify the jobs of security personnel. Even with extensive use of bar codes
today, some fans attempt to gain access to a stadium with fake tickets, sometimes trying to
take advantage of the volumes of people in order to bypass the gate security. RFID tags
embedded in the tickets can make this much more difficult, if not impossible.
Many oil companies, including Shell, Mobil, and Esso, implemented
loyalty systems in the 1990s that allow customers to pay for gas at
the pump by simply swiping a tiny RFID transponder (held on a key
chain) in a specifically marked area at the front of the gasoline
pump. Customers sign up for the service, and the charges are auto-
matically made either on the customers’ bank accounts or credit cards or to an account
where the customers have preloaded funds for fuel. By avoiding the use of credit and debit
cards at the pumps, this latter option increases security.
Pharmaceuticals
The pharmaceutical industry is vulnerable to counterfeit drugs that result in monetary loss
and can pose a health hazard to consumers. To combat this, individual drug packages are
using specialized tags that store the date of manufacture and detailed tracking information
that is generated as the packages move through the supply chain. This tracking can help iso-
late the exact location of the counterfeiting activity by monitoring events at every stop in the
supply chain.
Tags in over-the-counter and prescription medication allow vision-impaired people using a
special device to listen to a spoken description of their drugs and dosages. This system can
be used at home or in a pharmacy.
RFID and NFC Challenges
It is not hard to think of a thousand other applications for RFID that have the potential for
making life and business easier, safer, and simpler. However, the technology does face some
challenges, as you will learn about in this section.
RFID Impact on Corporate Networks
One of the major challenges for the implementation of RFID systems is the impact of the
volume of data on a company’s network. With manual or bar-code-based inventory control
systems, the amount of data that is collected and transmitted across a company’s network is
usually limited to the on-hand quantities of particular products along with the UPC code for
each product. However, RFID systems are usually implemented so that inventory can be
counted by simply activating the tags. To ensure that the shelves in a large retail store are
always fully stocked with products, for example, the system can direct the readers to interro-
gate all of the RFID tags every 5 minutes or so. This scanning can add a lot of traffic to an
organization’s network.
To get a sense of the amount of increased traffic on a company’s network, consider a sce-
nario in which a large national retailer tags each of the 10,000 individual items in each of
its 1,000 stores and then interrogates all of its readers from a central head-office location

every 15 minutes. At 17 bytes per product (remember that with the 96-bit EPC, the minimum
information from a tag is about 136 bytes), this would generate 170 MB of data for a single
read. It would fill a CD-ROM in 1 hour and create 5.44 GB of network traffic in a typical
8-hour business day. In only 1 month, the total volume of traffic would swell to 1.632 tera-
bytes of data. In comparison, the entire collection of 17 million books in the U.S. Library of
Congress equals 136 terabytes of data. It would only take 7 years for the library to process
that much data through its network. Although most of this data will be processed and the
duplicate data discarded, we are still talking about a significant increase in the volume of
data on the network.
Network Availability in RFID
Assume that such a system is eventually implemented and that a company relies on it to
replenish inventory automatically. In this case, network availability becomes a serious factor
in the store’s ability to serve its customers. As retailers become dependent on RFID systems
to enhance service and reduce costs, greater network bandwidth must be available. The retai-
ler’s network must also be reliable—that is, it must remain functional. (Ninety-nine percent
availability means that the network is expected to be down for about 80 hours per year.)
Any downtime that occurs during business hours can quickly become a serious problem. For
most companies, these demands will translate to expanding and adding redundant equipment
and communications capabilities to their existing networks, a costly undertaking at best.
In grocery stores and large retail establishments, products are out of stock 7 percent of the
time, and some popular items are unavailable 17 percent of the time. This inventory shortfall
can represent significant losses for retailers. To combat this problem, many retailers order
more products than they need or can sell out of one location. As a result, supermarkets in
particular often are forced to discard perishable products, which leads to higher costs for
consumers. Item-level tagging for product tracking is a means to reduce or eliminate these
types of problems.
Storage Requirements for RFID
Large banks and corporations already are saddled with archiving tremendous amounts of
historical data—potentially, tens or even hundreds of terabytes of data for each company. In
addition, new laws designed to protect investors and consumers, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, require companies to accumulate and securely store even more information. The huge
volume of data that can be generated by RFID systems significantly increases the need to
store information accurately and reliably.
Since 2003, cattle producers in Canada and Europe have been using
RFID to track their animals’ histories. As of January 1, 2005, each
head of cattle in Canada has had to have an RFID tag that stores
such information as any health issues, vaccinations, movement (locally
or to a new herd), and production of milk and offspring. Records
must be kept on slaughtered cattle for many years afterwards.
Device Management
Even without RFID in place, businesses are finding it a challenge to manage the huge numbers
of devices on their networks. Network management software does not come at a low price.

Even for small networks with fewer than 1,000 devices, the cost of network management
software can easily escalate to well over half a million dollars. As networks expand, the
need to remotely monitor and manage servers, routers, switches, and RFID readers from a
central location becomes a critical factor in a company’s ability to ensure greater network
availability. Add to this the task of managing and tracking hundreds, thousands, or even
millions of RFID tags and you can imagine the security issues related to wireless RFID trans-
missions. Managing RFID systems can quickly become a very complex and costly job.
Security Considerations for RFID and NFC
The growth of RFID and the development of relevant worldwide standards have given rise to
a large number of security and privacy concerns. There are solutions for RFID-related secu-
rity issues, but they are not perfect fixes, and challenges still exist. For example, the growth
of NFC is still being driven by its application as an electronic wallet that can be used in
place of credit and debit cards as well as by its applications in public transportation tickets,
passwords, and so forth, and concerns from users are increasing. Recent developments in
multi-core processors will no doubt enable the use of more sophisticated encryption algo-
rithms that can help ensure the security and privacy of device users. NFC transmissions are
harder to interfere with or capture, due to the short distance between devices; nevertheless,
it is theoretically possible to access information from a user’s smartphone or tablet if you
have a reader that is sensitive enough to capture information from a greater distance.
For how an attacker can exploit a security flaw in the the Mifare system, you can watch the
YouTube video at www.youtube.com/watch?v¼NW3RGbQTLhE.
It is possible to read the information from a tag or RFID/NFC-enabled credit card, but
financial organizations would not allow these systems to be used by their customers unless
there were enough security mechanisms in place to prevent financial loss. At least in North
America, it’s the financial organizations that have to absorb these losses; as a result, they
employ a large variety of tactics to prevent theft. Users are not made aware of these tactics
for the simple reason that making this information available would invite additional attempts
to defeat the security measures.
In North America, debit and credit card agreement clearly state that customers are not
responsible for the charges if their card information is stolen. And even if they were, a thief
would need a connection to the financial organization’s computer system in order to obtain
any other personal information about a customer. The three-digit security code that appears
on the back of a credit card is not stored electronically on the magnetic stripe or the RFID/
NFC chip. Nor is personal information, such as name, address, and telephone number,
although it is stored in a tablet or NFC-enabled cellular phone. All a thief can access is a
number, which means that, to obtain your personal information, the thief would need to
hack into the financial organization’s computer system from your home.
In the United States, the concerns about RFID are centered on privacy. Tag data used for a
product after it is purchased could be linked to the consumer and used for targeted market-
ing. Governments and businesses could then collect that data and use it for a number of
applications that would potentially interfere with the consumer’s privacy. This is not that dif-
ferent from data being captured from the use of debit and credit cards; the difference is that
RFID-generated data could possibly be captured without the user being aware of it. How-
ever, to associate this data with a particular person would require obtaining information
from debit and credit cards or by following the user home. This is unlikely to happen,

because it is the government that creates the privacy laws in the first place. Most of the
privacy concerns that people have regarding RFID are due to not having enough information
about the technology.
Security related to RFID readers falls under the wired network security policy. Reader-to-tag
and tag-to-reader communications have the same vulnerabilities as any wireless network, the
only exception being that capturing the tag-to-reader communications may be very difficult.
Tag transmissions occur at very low power levels; readers are also transmitting a CW during
tag-to-reader communications. Once a tag is installed on a product or packaging, it usually
cannot be removed without permanently damaging the tag; however, it is still possible to
tamper with the data in a Class-1 (read/write) tag by recording over the existing tag data or
by adding new data. Powering a mobile reader capable of emitting a high-power CW would
require heavy batteries. This could be done from inside a vehicle, but then the mobility of the
reader would be severely limited.
Most passive tags do not support authorization or encryption security methods because they
lack their own power supply, use chips with low processing power, and are low in cost.
Shielding stores and warehouses to prevent RF signals from coming in or going out may
solve some of the problems associated with unauthorized access from outside the building,
but that is a very expensive proposition. In addition, once consumers take the products to
their homes or workplaces, someone using an interrogator nearby may still expose them to
privacy violations.
RFID tags do not carry the type of information that would be so critical and useful as to
require drastic measures to prevent most anyone from capturing the information contained
in the tags’ memory storage. In the case of credit and debit cards, there are far easier (but
no less criminal) ways to capture the information contained in RFID/NFC chips, so the use
of remote sensing equipment, which requires a very complex setup, is unlikely. Nevertheless,
both financial institutions and users should continue to be aware of the need to protect
against losses and identity theft.
Data in tags can be locked and require a password for the tag to be used again. By using a
combination of the EPC, CRC, and built-in destroy password, tags can also be permanently
disabled. Locking the tags would make it very difficult to use the information from the tag
throughout the distribution channels. Permanently destroying the tag, either by issuing a kill
command or by physically damaging it, would prevent a retailer from using the tag again if
the customer returned the product, limiting the functionality of the RFID system. Physically
destroying tags would also prevent the consumer from taking advantage of features like the
smart refrigerator application described at the beginning of this chapter.
A blocker tag is a device that can be used to simulate the presence of a virtually infinite
number of tags. Blocker tags can be used to disable unauthorized readers from accessing the
information from a selective group of tags by sending so many responses that an unautho-
rized reader cannot differentiate between the blocker tag and a legitimate tag. Blocker tags
also offer an alternative solution that minimizes some of the issues described earlier in this
section, and at a much lower cost. After getting her purchase home, the consumer may
optionally destroy the blocker tag so she can continue to use the legitimate tags in, say, her
smart refrigerator.
Security for RFID and NFC systems is a complex topic, and there is no single solution that
addresses all possible situations. Applications of RFID and NFC far outweigh the potential

problems, however. RFID and NFC usage will continue to expand, and eventually these tech-
nologies will be present in nearly every aspect of our lives. Educating users and implementing
legislation related to data collection and privacy will play a big part in raising consumers’
comfort level with the technology, just as it has with the Internet.
Chapter Summary
■Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) stores information about an item’s manufacturer
and the date and location of production in electronic tags that include an antenna
and a chip.
■Standards being published by EPCglobal Inc. will allow RFID to be used worldwide.
■RFID systems are composed of electronic tags, readers, antennas, software, and the
EPCglobal network services. The format of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) is
defined by the EPCglobal standards. The EPC is either 64 or 96 bits long and
includes a code that refers to the manufacturer, a stock keeping unit number, and
a serial number.
■RFID tags are also known as transponders. Typical tags include a microprocessor
and memory. Tags are accessed by a reader device that captures and processes the
data. There are two basic types of tags: passive and active. Passive tags are the most
common type. They do not have a power source and rely on the electromagnetic
energy in the RF waves transmitted by the reader to power their microprocessors.
Active tags are equipped with a battery and can cost upwards of $20. The battery
usually limits the life span of active tags. Semi-active tags also include a battery.
However, it is only used when the tag is activated by a transmission, which helps
the battery last many years.
■Tags can be produced in flexible packages called smart labels with an adhesive back-
ing. They can be affixed to product packaging, pallets, or to the product itself. They
are also used to track passenger baggage. Tags are not limited to being placed in a
visible area and can be read in virtually any position.
■Retail stores sometimes use 1-bit tags to prevent theft. These tags do not include a
unique identification, a chip, or any memory; they are only used to activate an alarm.
Chipless tags use fibers or materials that reflect a portion of the reader’s signal with a
unique pattern that can be used as an identifier.
■Sensory tags are equipped with thermal, smoke, or other type of sensors used to
monitor environmental conditions to which a product may have been exposed during
shipping and storage. The cost of a tag can vary, depending on the type. Most passive
tags cost between $0.07 and $0.25. Class-1 tags are read/write. Some tags can be
written to, whereas others are read-only.
■A reader, also called an interrogator, communicates with both the tags and the corporate
network. Some readers have the ability to write data to the tags. Readers also provide
the energy to activate and power passive tags. Readers and tags operate in one of four
frequency bands: 135 KHz (LF); 13.56 MHz (HF); 433 MHz and 860–930 MHz (UHF);
and 2.5 GHz and 5.8 GHz (ISM).
■There are two types of tag antennas: linear and circular. Linear antennas have a better
range, but circular antennas achieve more reliable reads.

■RFID software includes system software, which controls the functions of the tag and
reader hardware; middleware, which is responsible for reformatting the data to meet
the requirements of the business applications; and the programs that companies use to
process business transactions.
■RFID has a multitude of uses, ranging from health care to entertainment-related appli-
cations. The systems are also being used in pharmaceuticals to prevent drug fraud
and to assist patients.
■The connection between a reader and a tag is called a coupling. Inductive coupling tags
need to be placed within a half-inch of the antenna. Backscatter coupling allows tags to
be read at distances of 3.3 feet to 330 feet. Backscatter is a reflection of the reader’s sig-
nal modulated with the tag data. In order to power the tags, the reader, when not trans-
mitting, sends out a continuous wave. Backscatter modulation is based on variations of
ASK and PSK. Communication between tags and readers is always half-duplex.
■In HF RFID, the tags use time slots to communicate with the reader. The number of
slots is always a power of two, and the communication is always controlled by the
reader. Tags never initiate communications with the reader.
■RFID has the potential for significantly increasing the amount of traffic and storage
requirements in the corporate network. With the implementation of RFID systems,
network availability and device management become even more critical.
■NFC is a wireless communication technology, based on RFID, that allows enabled
devices to communicate at short distances. Unlike RFID, NFC allows devices to trans-
fer files, pictures, videos, URLs, and business cards between smartphones or tablet
computers. NFC-enabled devices can also read and write to passive tags. NFC tags
typically have greater storage capacity than RFID tags.
■With the implementation of wireless technologies such as RFID and NFC, there are
many security and privacy concerns. A tag can be locked or destroyed (electronically
or physically), but doing so can limit its functionality. Blocker tags may offer an
alternative solution. User and consumer education, along with government legislation,
should help raise the comfort level and allow RFID usage to expand.
Key Terms
1-bit tags
RFID devices that do not include a chip or memory and cannot store an EPC;
they are only used to activate an alarm at retail store entrances as a means of preventing theft.
active tags
RFID tags that include a battery.
backscatter
The type of modulation used by passive RFID tags, backscatter is a reflection
of radiation in which the tag reflects the signal sent by an interrogator while modulating it
with the data to be transmitted.
beacons
RFID tags that are battery powered and transmit on a periodic basis.
blocker tag
A type of Class-1 passive tag that can be used to disable unauthorized readers
from accessing the information from a selective group of tags by sending so many responses
that a reader cannot differentiate between the blocker tag and a legitimate tag.
chipless tags
RFID devices that use embedded fibers to reflect a portion of the RF waves
emitted by a reader; the reflected portion of the RF waves is unique and can be used as an
identifier.

Project 11-3
Many manufacturers and retailers of non-perishable goods already use RFID
technology today. Several products come already tagged, and if you have
recently purchased a high-value product in a computer store, you may find
some tags in the box. Go to several large stores located in a local shopping area
and ask the stores’ staff whether they are currently using RFID to protect against
theft. Do they use it for security only or do they also use it for inventory control?
Be conscious of some of the security issues with RFID and identify yourself as a
wireless communications student before you ask any questions regarding their
use of RFID. Keep in mind that some job opportunities may be available
through contacts that you initiate through this project; therefore, be sure to
present yourself in a professional manner. If possible, make a list of the types
of tags used, such as passive, semi-active, etc. Write a report on your findings.
Real-World Exercises
Exercise 11-1
Instrument Rentals Inc. (IRI) rents electronic test instruments to a variety of heavy industries.
The instruments are usually rented for a period of 1 week to 1 year. IRI offers a customer guar-
antee that its instruments will always be available and calibrated to factory specifications. With
120 locations across the country, the company ships the instruments, checks their calibration
upon arrival, and recalibrates them if necessary. It also often services the instruments at the
customer’s site, which can be in an oil field or inside a mine, to maintain them in top working
condition. Finally, it checks every instrument when it is returned at the end of its rental period.
To prevent delays, minimize errors, and avoid Internet access problems, IRI would like
to store each instrument’s calibration records, its technicians’ names, the rental/travel log,
and other relevant information stored with the instrument itself. Toward this end, the
service-call software that the technicians have in their notebook computers needs to be
able to automatically read a record, display it on the screen, and update it on the instru-
ment record storage device. All the instruments are leased by IRI from the manufacturers
for a period of 3 years. When a lease expires, IRI wants to be able to look at the records
for that particular instrument and make a decision whether to replace it with a new model
or extend the lease to prevent interruption of service to its customers. As a well-known
RFID and NFC expert, you have been asked to recommend which of these two technologies
would be the right solution for its needs.
Prepare a PowerPoint presentation (consisting of 10 to 15 slides) that lists the advantages
and disadvantages of RFID and NFC for this type of application, and specify the type of
tags and devices that IRI should acquire, should it decide to go ahead with this project.
Exercise 11-2
IRI has decided to go ahead with the project and has asked you to provide a proposal (five
pages maximum) specifying all the equipment that will be required to add this technology to

1,000 of its most expensive test instruments. There are two technicians per location, but
only one will be equipped to service the equipment in the field. The other technician will be
servicing equipment in the office.
Your proposal should include pricing for the tags (including about 100 replacement tags), a
portable reader, a fixed reader, middleware, and other equipment. If required, IRI’s IT staff
will be in charge of reprogramming the middleware to interface with the company’s
in-house database. Keep in mind that if the project is successful, it may be expanded within
6 months to a year to cover IRI’s entire instrument asset base, which consists of more than
10,000 instruments.
Challenge Case Project
The trade union to which the technicians at IRI belong has sent a letter to the
company expressing concerns about the privacy of its members, given that the
company intends to include the name of the technician who last serviced a par-
ticular instrument in its RFID tag. Now, the company has asked you to become
involved. A team of three people from IRI will research the union’s concern,
including checking state regulations. It will then organize a meeting so that all the parties can
discuss the matter.
In groups of six, form two teams of three members each—one team representing the union
and the other representing IRI. Research the issues just outlined and engage in a friendly
debate regarding the union’s concerns. The union team may need to do added research so
that it is prepared to defend its members’ rights.

In the early 1930s, a mathematician developed a formula that could be used to make
accurate weather forecasts, something that was unheard of. However, because there were no
computers or calculators at that time, it took almost three months of hand calculations
to come up with the next day’s forecast. Obviously, this was far from useful, and many indi-
viduals scoffed at such a preposterous solution to weather forecasting. However, with the
introduction of computers in the late 1940s, the amount of time needed for the calculations
was dramatically decreased. Suddenly, mathematical weather forecasting became very popular,
and today it forms the basis for all weather forecasting.
The point is that it sometimes requires vision to see how an idea or technology could be
used. This need for vision also applies to new technologies like wireless communications.
Whether it is for security reasons or lack of existing knowledge and skills, some IT depart-
ments and users still question why we should use wireless technology when the existing
wired systems seem to work just fine. But many users find that wireless access to e-mail,
Web, and corporate resources does save them time and trouble. They also want to use their
own devices—such as tablets and cellular phones—rather than being restricted by those that
are supplied by the companies. This has created an entire new set of challenges for IT
departments, especially in the area of security.
As you have learned so far, there are many factors to be considered when deploying wire-
less technologies. Short-range technologies like Bluetooth for headsets and ZigBee for
lighting and environmental control can be relatively simple to install and operate, requir-
ing little user intervention after initial setup and configuration. Cellular, Wi-Fi, and
WiMAX demand a much higher level of involvement from designers and troubleshooting
staff to ensure a reliable and stable environment. Although residential installations usually
do not require any specialized skills, deployment in large-business environments can be
far more complex. For example, wireless signal propagation presents specific challenges
to office buildings, sports stadiums, cruise ships, passenger aircraft, and manufacturing
environments.
This textbook cannot possibly cover all the different wireless network design and deployment
situations. Instead, this chapter discusses what it takes to convert the potential of wireless
technology into a successful business installation. We will take a look at the steps needed
to incorporate IEEE 802.11 wireless technology into a business environment, and we’ll
also look at the challenges that business users adopting this technology must face. The
intent is to provide you with a brief introduction to what it takes to achieve a successful
wireless installation.
Advantages of Wireless Technology
The advantages of incorporating wireless technology into a business are far-reaching and
can positively impact an organization in many ways. In addition to the advantages already
discussed in this book—mobile data access, easier network installation, easier office moves,
and better disaster recovery—wireless technology provides business-specific advantages,
including universal access to corporate data, increased productivity, ability for customers
to access their own data, data availability around the clock, and improved information
technology (IT) support.

Universal Access to Corporate Data
A major advantage of wireless technology is that it provides access to corporate data from
almost any location. This universal access can help a business generate more revenue. For
example, a traveling sales representative calling on a customer needs the most current infor-
mation at his fingertips before he walks in the door. He could review printouts in his hotel
room the night before, but these are only as recent as the day they were printed. He could
access the company’s corporate database from his hotel room that morning, but changes in
inventory and sales may occur before his 2:00 P.M. appointment.
But what if the sales representative uses a WiMAX network, a cellular USB Internet stick, his
smartphone connected to his laptop, a mobile hotspot, or a tablet with 3G or 4G to access
live data, such as the status of the customer’s buying history, the product’s current inventory,
and an up-to-the-minute competitor price list? The information is accessible before he steps
out of his car for his appointment—even while he is meeting with the customer. And there is
no need to connect to his customer’s network. By having universal access to the latest data,
the sales representative will be well prepared to make the sale.
Traveling sales representatives are not the only users who can benefit from universal access to
corporate data. Anyone who needs to be mobile but also needs access to data can benefit
from it. Physicians who move around a hospital can have current data at their fingertips to
make decisions, which results in lower costs and improved care for patients. Physicians
can also monitor a patient’s vital signs from anywhere in the world using a smartphone (see
www.airstriptech.com). Likewise, factory managers can access data as they check available
warehouse storage space for arriving inventory. Wireless technology can also be useful when
all parties are in one location. For example, during an intense negotiation session, attorneys,
bankers, and their clients can all use wireless laptops to access data or receive SMS messages
on their cellular phones, thus helping them make the best decision.
In 2004, Baycrest, a center for geriatric care in Toronto, Ontario, was
one of the first hospitals in North America to implement a computer-
ized physician order entry system. The system lets doctors order tests,
exams, and medications directly from a patient’s bedside using
the WLAN from a handheld device. Physicians can also check the
patient’s records and charts in the hospital’s health information system.
Industry experts agree that access to corporate data from almost anywhere is the greatest
advantage of wireless technology. This access allows decisions to be made quickly using the
most up-to-date information. For a business, these factors translate into increased revenues.
Keep in mind that access to corporate data from public networks needs to be properly
secured through the use of VPNs, which must make use of the latest encryption methods to
ensure the security of the corporation’s network as well as compliance with a number of pri-
vacy and long-term data storage laws. VPNs and other methods of corporate data access via
the Internet are a vast, advanced topic that is well beyond the scope of this text.
Increased Productivity
Having universal access to corporate data leads to increased productivity by employees. As
far back as 2001, in a survey commissioned by Cisco, users reported that when using a
WLAN they could access data almost two additional hours each day than if they were only
Advantages of Wireless Technology

using a wired network. This increase occurred when users were away from the computer in
their offices but still connected to the WLAN during meetings, conferences, and sales calls. If
the additional two hours of connection time translated into 70 minutes of increased produc-
tivity (a standard ratio), this means the average user could be 22 percent more productive.
For a worker with a salary of $64,000, this means that the annual productivity improvement
per wireless user could be worth as much as $7,000 each year to the business. In addition,
almost two-thirds of WLAN users reported that the wireless connection improved the
accuracy of their everyday tasks. Because more and more companies are now implementing
wireless, there are literally dozens of similar surveys that show results just as dramatic or
even more so than in the past.
Increased Access to the Customer’s Own Data
A key factor in reducing business costs is to shift the burden of accessing a customer’s data
from the business to the customer. If customers can see data about themselves on the busi-
ness’ computer system, they can make better and more informed decisions. This self-service
decreases the use of the business’ human resources, which in turn reduces costs and increases
revenue for the business.
An example of customers’ access to their own data can be seen in the airline and banking
industries. Bank clients today can access their account balances, pay bills, and transfer
money between accounts from a mobile device. Most airlines have Web sites where custo-
mers can view schedules, make reservations, download boarding passes, and check on the
current status of their frequent flier miles. These sites generate cost savings for the airlines
because they are able to hire fewer telephone reservation clerks. Most airports today offer
wireless access for travelers, albeit not always free. Customers can use the WLAN to check
their flight information once they enter the terminal, learning their gate number and check-in
time. Personal check-in is available for those who have a smartphone, which allows custo-
mers to print or sometimes simply display their own boarding passes or a QR code on a
smartphone screen, check their baggage at curbside, and access other services. This helps
the airline make better use of its staff. In addition, customer satisfaction is increased because
travelers spend less time waiting in lines. Increased satisfaction means a repeat customer. All
these benefits result from wireless technology that makes the customer’s data available from
more locations, thereby reducing the burden on the business and thus increasing profits.
Data Availability Around the Clock
Leaving work at 5:00 P.M.—and leaving the work behind—is a thing of the past. Business
professionals regularly work evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays to catch up and stay
ahead. This means that business users need access to corporate data 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. In the past this required a trip back to the office on weekends or staying late at night to
finish that report. However, wireless technology can help make data available from almost
anywhere at any time. This means that a business user can still catch her daughter’s soccer
match or son’s music performance without sacrificing productivity. The introduction of
RIM’s BlackBerry device, and later the Apple iPhone, as well as Android devices represents a
paradigm shift in accessibility to e-mail and corporate data. Many business applications have
been developed for the smartphones, including software that allows a field technician to
update trouble tickets and access technical documents and also allows construction foremen
to enter payroll work-hour records while on the job site. There are no limits to how wireless
networks can make us more productive and allow us to make better-informed decisions.

Improved IT Support
Wireless technology can help improve the support that information technology (IT) depart-
ments provide to users. Two of the most significant advantages for IT departments are easier
system setup and decreased cabling costs compared to wired systems. Troubleshooting a
wireless network is often simpler than troubleshooting cabling problems, especially for busi-
nesses that have large offices with many connection points and hidden cabling infrastructure.
Cabling infrastructure issues are frequently overlooked as a potential source of serious
network connectivity issues, and troubleshooting and repairing a cable infrastructure can be
very labor intensive and time consuming (i.e., expensive).
Other improvements include easier and faster equipment moves, more efficient use of office
space, and lower support and maintenance costs. These benefits can lead to lower costs for
the business and more time for the IT staff to provide improved support to the users.
Voice over Wireless LAN (VoWLAN)
Consider the cordless telephone you have probably grown to rely on at home. Until 2003,
there were few options for businesses that wanted to enable their staff to move around the
office while remaining available at their extension numbers. VoWLAN is about to change
this, without the high cost of cellular telephone calls. As early as June 2004, there already
were approximately 1,600 hospitals in the United States using VoWLAN.
For more information on VoWLAN equipment for hospitals,
see www.vocera.com. For the latest news about this topic, see
vowlan.wifinetnews.com.
In many other kinds of workplaces, such as sports facilities, construction sites, and
manufacturing plants, some of the staff must remain mobile within the confines of a building
or site at all times, which can limit voice communications, given that these people are not
always near a phone. Cellular telephones have largely solved this problem, though at a high
cost. And although cordless phones are common in homes, business telephone systems do not
usually offer good mobility options. WLAN technology allows businesses to go beyond data
access and transform the way their staff communicates while performing their daily tasks.
The new WLAN standards discussed in Chapter 8, along with 802.11-enabled telephone
handsets manufactured by a growing number of companies, means that today’s businesses
can benefit from the full potential of mobile communications.
VoWLAN takes advantage of voice over IP (VoIP) technology, but instead of using the wired
network to carry voice calls, VoWLAN uses the wireless infrastructure to carry both voice
and data. Wireless VoIP phones, the telephone handsets that connect to a WLAN’s access
point (AP), enable you to use the WLAN for regular telephone calls while using only a small
amount of network bandwidth. Depending on what type of connection a location has with
the telephone carrier—either traditional land-based telephone lines or over the Internet—
additional equipment may be required to interconnect the wireless network with the phone
lines. As more manufacturers and telephone carriers enter the VoIP market, and as more cus-
tomers sign up for these services, the wireless VoIP handsets will likely become common-
place, eventually replacing cordless phones, thus enabling both data and voice connectivity
without wires through a single, common interface.

Keep in mind that regular household telephones, including cordless
phones, must never be plugged into an enterprise phone system (a
PBX or Private Branch Exchange). These systems are not compatible
and use a different voltage than the regular landline phones; also,
trying to interconnect them can sometimes damage the phone.
Most newer models of wireless residential gateways and wireless SOHO routers support
automatic prioritization of VoIP for Internet calls. Vonage (see www.vonage.com) and Skype
(see www.skype.com) offer adapters that can be plugged into a residential gateway and into
a regular cordless phone to enable Internet calls to phone lines. Skype also offers some
cordless phones that support their own menu system and can be used to make Skype-
to-Skype calls without requiring a computer. (SOHO is an acronym for “small office/
home office.”)
Making telephone calls using VoIP can save a substantial amount of money in long-distance
calls. In addition, most VoIP providers allow a business to have a telephone number that
has an area code belonging to a different part of the country, or even the world. This can
also generate significant savings when most of a company’s business comes from a differ-
ent region than where the company’s offices are located, because it avoids the expense of
long-distance calling.
Even some of the major carriers, such as AT&T, have launched VoIP
services for business and residential customers. For a current list of
VoIP service providers, see voip.about.com or www.voip-info.org.
Challenges of Using Wireless Technology
Just as there are distinct advantages for a business using wireless technology, there are distinct
challenges. These include competing technologies, data security and privacy, user reluctance,
and a shortage of qualified staff.
Competing Technologies
Some wireless technologies are clearly based on approved industry standards, such as WLANs
following the IEEE 802.11 standards. A business that uses an IEEE standard WLAN is assured
that it is investing in a technology that will be the standard for several years to come and can
be upgraded, in most cases, by simply loading a new version of the software on the APs and
client devices.
However, with other wireless technologies, such as digital cellular telephony, there is no clear
indication of what will become the standard and what will fade away. This uncertainty poses
a critical decision for businesses. Making the wrong selection may mean investing hundreds
of thousands of dollars in a technology that is orphaned in a few years, with dwindling
users and support.
As long as technologies continue to compete before one becomes the standard, companies
face a certain amount of risk in selecting the right wireless technology. An organization

must not only determine which technology is best for it, it must determine which technology
will be viable in the future, a task that can be made much easier by having trained staff on
board or hiring the right reseller or consulting organization to provide some guidance.

Data Security and Privacy
Wireless technology’s greatest strength—allowing users to roam freely without being con-
nected to the network by wires—can also be its greatest weakness, if not addressed properly.
Just as a roaming user can receive radio frequency (RF) signals anywhere within a building,
so too can an unauthorized user outside the building. Broadcasting network traffic over the
airwaves has created a concern for keeping that data secure. Most industry experts agree
that opening up a corporate network by adding a wireless component without considering
security is far too dangerous. Hardening such systems requires expertise and may significantly
increase costs.
User Reluctance
In technology, changes are nearly constant because as standards and technology advance,
established vendors continue to improve their products and to make it easier, simpler, and
more transparent for users to adapt. Change can be painful for users because it takes time
and energy to learn a new system. Unless users can see an immediate benefit to abandoning
their comfortable old ways of doing things, they will be reluctant to do so. The human factor
in implementing wireless technology is sometimes a significant obstacle.
Shortage of Qualified Staff
Wireless communications technology has touched almost every business in one way or
another, including manufacturing, health care, telecommunications, and retail, and it is
poised to continue growing, as you have learned throughout this book. As a result of this
growth, the need for IT professionals to develop and implement wireless applications and
provide support is skyrocketing. However, many schools and training facilities have not yet
caught up with the demand for wireless IT workers. Consequently, there is a shortage of
qualified IT professionals trained to install, support, and maintain wireless systems.
As technology improves and becomes ever easier to use, the life of a network administrator
or a reseller can get more complicated. Users who begin to feel more comfortable with the
technology may feel empowered to modify settings, occasionally creating connectivity issues
or perhaps exposing the network to security risks. In companies that implement WLANs,
network support staff and administrators must not only be aware of these issues, continually
monitoring them, but must ensure that their knowledge and training keeps pace with the
advances in the IT industry. The latest BYOD (bring your own device) trend is worrying for
IT departments, both for reasons of security and because of the user-support headaches it
may cause.
Before embarking on building a wireless infrastructure in a business, it is critical to iden-
tify the various needs, solutions, and threats and then determine the best way to balance
these factors.
Building a Wireless Infrastructure
Once a business has decided to invest in wireless technology, it faces the task of building a
new wireless infrastructure. This is much like adding a new network to the organization. In
fact, several of the steps necessary to build this new infrastructure are similar to those needed

when adding a new wired network. You must also keep in mind that installing APs does
require a cable infrastructure. This section looks at the implementation of IEEE 802.11 net-
works because they are the most common type used in business. Some of the steps required
to deploy other types of networks, such as WiMAX and cellular, are similar; however, the
process (as well as the business reasons) for deploying these other types is very different, and
the cost of the equipment and testing tools is also much higher. This section provides a gen-
eral overview of the steps and reasoning behind building a wireless network.
Needs Assessment
“Do we really need it?” is a question that must be asked first when deciding whether to add
a wireless infrastructure to a business. Sadly, this question is often asked too late in the pro-
cess. Sometimes, it’s enough to make a procedural change or add personnel rather than invest
in wireless technology. Evaluating needs involves looking at the organization and the current
network, gathering basic information, and determining costs.
Look at the Organization The first step in assessing the need is to step back and
examine the organization or business as a whole. Sometimes, users fall into the trap of view-
ing only their department or unit instead of looking at the entire organization. There are a
series of basic yet vital questions that need to be asked, including:
●
What is the current size of the organization?
●
How much growth is anticipated?
●
How do employees in different positions and departments perform their daily activities—
meaning, do they need to move around the office and work from different locations?
●
How frequently does the company move staff to other offices and need to reconfigure
the wiring setup?
Although these questions may seem very basic, they can help focus the thinking on the
organization as a whole and away from any one part of it. In addition, they can reveal a
great deal in terms of assessing needs and identifying priorities. A company’s employees may
not be aware of all the implications of implementing a wireless network, such as the need for
new security policies and continuous monitoring, not to mention the potential interference
problems, which can affect user and application performance and offset the advantages
of a WLAN.
Employees who work primarily at their desks on a single computer, such as call center/
customer service operators, may not require wireless access. If the room configuration is
static, a wired network will provide performance that is more consistent in the long run.
Assess the Current Network The next step in assessing the need for adding a wire-
less infrastructure is to look at how the organization or business uses its current network.
Questions to ask include:
●
How does the current network support the organization’s mission?
●
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the current network?
●
How many users does it support?
●
What essential applications run on the network?

Different industries have different network requirements. The banking industry needs net-
works that offer a very high degree of security. The manufacturing industry usually cannot
afford any downtime and often needs networks that are completely fault-tolerant. Educational
institutions may be able to tolerate a small amount of downtime, but their networks often
need to authenticate thousands of new students every few months.
Assessing the current network can help to identify why a new technology may be needed. If
the current network can be upgraded or adapted to meet the current needs, then wireless
technology may not be necessary at this time. However, if the current network cannot sup-
port the anticipated future growth of the business or there is a clear indication that wireless
technology can help the business grow, then the investment may be worthwhile.
Documenting the current network in detail can help the assessment. Networks tend to grow
in unplanned fashions, as new users or equipment are needed, so documenting the network
is necessary to gain a view of the system as a whole. You must always keep in mind that
the wired network infrastructure must be able to support the amount of traffic you expect
there will be from the new wireless clients. For example, when deploying an 802.11n network,
which is capable of transmitting data at 600 Mbps, you must take into account that your
wired infrastructure—including cables, switches, and routers—may only support 100 Mbps.
Furthermore, to effectively deploy or upgrade to an 802.11ac network and take full advantage
of the increased data rates, you may need to replace large portions of the wired network
equipment and cabling as well.
Table 12-2 summarizes a sample current network to help you quickly visualize the require-
ments for a new wireless deployment or upgrade. If the network is complex, a diagram or
layout of the network can also help. An example of a simple diagram is shown in Figure 12-1,
but keep in mind that an existing network may need to cover several floors of a building,
making the task even more challenging.

Gather Information After the organization and the current network have been evalu-
ated and it is determined that wireless technology can fit into the current business strategy,
the next step is to gather information. With all the different wireless technologies available
and the constant changes taking place in this area, the expertise to gather the information
may be beyond that of the current IT staff. Many organizations turn to outside consultants
and vendors to help provide information at this point. Some organizations may send out
a request for information (RFI). An RFI is a document that seeks information about what
vendors may have to offer. RFIs are general in scope. A broad statement such as “The ven-
dor will install a wireless network on the second floor of the building to accommodate
45 users” may be enough to start things rolling. Usually, several vendors are encouraged to
respond with information about the particular products they sell.
Once all the RFIs have been returned, the organization can examine each of them in detail.
Generally, a pattern will emerge from the RFIs. For example, if four vendors recommend an
IEEE 802.11n wireless WLAN whereas one vendor recommends using 80211g, the direction

starts to become clear. Evaluate RFIs with caution. Vendors want to sell a product or
service, and they may overemphasize the strength of their products while minimizing
their weaknesses. Independent research is still needed after the responses to the RFIs have
been received.
Perform a Wireless Site Survey The information you gather about the current net-
work in preparation for implementing a WLAN would never be complete without a proper
wireless site survey. A wireless site survey consists of measuring the strength and quality
of the signal and the resulting transmission speeds and throughput achievable in all the
different locations around the office where users will need wireless access to the network.
In addition, the site survey helps determine the existence of interference sources, both
internal and external, which will establish the susceptibility of the WLAN to environmental
factors. The survey helps ensure that the actual performance of the network will meet the
needs of all the users.
A simple wireless site survey for a SOHO can be performed using an AP, a wireless adapter
card, and the client software provided by the adapter card manufacturer. (The Windows XP
or Windows 7 client software is far too simplistic and does not provide enough information.)
However, a comprehensive site survey, especially for large office buildings, manufacturing
plants, multiple floors of a building, or other complex environments, should be performed
using more sophisticated software tools and people who have a level of training and experi-
ence that isn’t currently available in the organization. The site survey should ideally be per-
formed using the same type and model of equipment that will be installed. The cost of tools
and equipment to perform a site survey is fairly high; purchasing them can only be justified if
you will be using these tools on a regular basis. There are many prerequisites and steps
involved in a site survey. One of the most important is a floor plan, preferably one that
includes the location of office furniture items and any large machinery as well. Floor plans
assist in the site survey and yield more detailed and complete reports.
A variety of site survey guides and white papers is available on the Inter-
net. To find more information, search for “Wireless Site Survey Guide.” A
good starting point is www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3761356.
A wireless site survey will identify a number of additional factors regarding the potential
implementation of a WLAN, such as:
●
Security features and policies required
●
Radio signal range (distance requirements)
●
Number of APs and channels required (based on user population, and application
load) to provide good coverage and security
●
Throughput required
●
Location of AP radios and antennas
●
Location of fixed client devices
●
Location of Ethernet cables for connecting APs
●
Type of client adapters (WNICs) and whether external antennas may be required to
increase range

●
Power (electricity) requirements and type—that is, power over Ethernet or wall sockets
●
Growth (expansion) requirements and impact on current design
●
Potential interference sources and their locations, how they affect signal quality, and
channel selection based on existence of interference sources
●
Standards and frequencies to be implemented (802.11a/b/g/n), which may be
dependent on the client devices
●
Requirements for integration with the company’s wired network (additional equipment
such as switches, firewalls, authentication servers, Ethernet speed)
These factors will help determine the type and range of equipment that will be needed and
will assist in the creation of a request for proposal (RFP, discussed later in this chapter).
The wireless site survey may be performed by the company’s own technical staff, by a poten-
tial vendor, or by a consulting organization, but it should always be done before a vendor
provides a final proposal.
Site Survey Tools To perform a proper 802.11 site survey, you will need to have a
number of tools available. You can perform a site survey in an existing WLAN—in fact, it
is advisable that you do this on a periodic basis, if you suspect interference from nearby
WLANs or if equipment, furniture, and people have been moved to different locations
around the office. To evaluate the environment for a new deployment, you will need at
least one AP of the same model that you intend to install. This is the most essential compo-
nent of a site survey. A connection to the wired network is not essential, but you will need
to supply power to the AP, so be sure to have an extension cord that is long enough to
reach the nearest outlet.
The AP will need to be configured to transmit a signal in a channel that is preferably clear
of other transmissions. To check the available channels, you can use a tool such as inSSIDer
from MetaGeek or any similar tool that can scan the Wi-Fi frequency spectrum that you will
be using for this installation and display the presence of nearby WLAN signals. Interference
from nearby WLANs will affect the signal quality and, consequently, the maximum
throughput of the WLAN you are deploying. There is also a variety of dedicated devices
that can do a much better job of checking the Wi-Fi spectrum. One of these is the Fluke
Networks AirCheck Wi-Fi Tester, which can also produce comprehensive reports (see www.
flukenetworks.com/enterprise-network/network-testing/AirCheck-Wi-Fi-Tester). In addition, it
can be equipped with an Yagi antenna that helps you locate the direction that a signal is
coming from. Figure 12-2 shows a picture of the AirCheck Wi-Fi Tester’s home screen.
Although you can perform a wireless site survey using simple tools like the manufacturer’s
client software for a wireless NIC and a laptop computer or even an Android smartphone
with a Wi-Fi test application, a large office would require that you make extensive notes at
every point to record the data about signal strength and quality. If you will be performing
site surveys on a regular basis, there are software tools that allow you to load a floor plan,
walk around, and complete a survey in far less time. Two notable options are the Ekahau
Site Survey (go to www.ekahau.com, click Products, then click Site Survey) and AirMagnet
Survey (go to www.flukenetworks.com, click Products, WLAN Design and Troubleshooot-
ing, then click AirMagnet Survey). These tools produce extensive graphical and text reports
that save time and can help you accomplish a WLAN deployment with optimal performance
and security in addition to helping you troubleshoot Wi-Fi signal and coverage issues.

Other items that will be required for your site survey include:
●
A laptop computer compatible with the software you will be using
●
A ladder, some wire, packaging tape, or any other means of mounting the AP near the
ceiling
●
Additional external antennas, if required
●
If a floor plan is not available, some means of measuring distances, such as a long tape
measure, a laser-measuring device, or a measuring wheel
●
Some means of communication, such as a cellular phone or walkie-talkie, for
working in teams
You will also need these tools when performing an outdoor site survey. Figure 12-3 shows a
picture of a laser-measuring device. These are often the best option because they measure
distances up to 167 feet (about 51 meters), cost as little as $100.00, can save you a lot of
time, and are accurate to 1/16 of an inch (about 1.6 millimeters).

Keep in mind that the list of items required for site surveys is by no means complete.
Different site surveys may require additional tools or equipment, but the items listed here
are the most essential.
Return on Investment
After the company has collected potential solutions from vendor RFIs and conducted inde-
pendent research, it must determine the project’s cost. The cost by itself cannot be the sole
basis of the decision. Rather, the company must consider the cost in light of the benefit
that the project will provide. It may cost $50,000 to implement wireless technology,
which might seem like a high cost. However, if the new technology saves $100,000 per
year in other costs and increases revenue by $150,000, then $50,000 may seem very
reasonable.
Determining the cost in relationship to the benefit is known as calculating return on
investment (ROI). In strict accounting terms, ROI is the profit divided by the amount of
the investment. ROI projections are useful when considering the purchase of products
or services needed for a business. It is best expressed over a specific period of time.

For example, you might project that a $50,000 wireless network will save a total of
$75,000 in 18 months. The trick with ROIs is to determine all the costs as well as all the
projected savings.
Upfront costs are ones that are necessary to start a project, such as the cost of installing the
wireless technology. As an example, the upfront costs for a WLAN might include APs and
wireless NICs for all the devices and computers. The number of APs depends on the coverage
area, number of users, and types of services needed. Hardware costs vary, depending on such
factors as performance requirements, coverage requirements, and bandwidth.
Upfront costs are not the only costs to be considered. Recurring costs are often overlooked
when determining final costs. A recurring cost is one that a user continues to pay over an
extended period of time. For example, if the company leases a free space optics transceiver
or a wireless bridge from a local carrier, the annual lease cost is recurring and should be con-
sidered as part of the total cost for the technology over its useful life. The initial cost of
equipment is usually amortized (reduced) by a certain percentage every year, but lease and
maintenance costs either remain the same or may even increase over time. The installation,
projected maintenance, hardware or software maintenance contracts, IT staff training, and
user training should all be factored into the total cost of implementation.
A much more difficult task is to determine the savings that can be accumulated. Because the
system is not already in place, it may be very difficult to calculate the savings or increased
revenue that can result from the implementation of the WLAN. The key here is to be as
conservative as possible. Gathering information from other users of the technology can be
very helpful.
Although ROI studies are considered very important, they are not
conducted as frequently as they should be. In a recent survey, only
26 percent of the respondents said they had conducted an ROI
analysis prior to installing a WLAN system. Almost 25 percent indi-
cated there was “simply no need to,” whereas 16 percent said
that cost was simply not an issue.
Develop a Plan
Once it has been determined that there is a real need that can be solved by implementing
wireless technology, and if the ROI projection is positive, the next step is to create a plan.
The adage that “those who fail to plan, plan to fail” is never more true than when consider-
ing a new technology. The landscape is littered with projects that were poorly planned and
then abandoned after cost overruns escalated astronomically. Developing a sensible, work-
able plan is perhaps the most critical piece of the entire process. Planning should never be
done in a vacuum; instead, the IT staff, users, and consultants should all be asked for their
input. Once the plan has been completed, a request for proposal (RFP) is sent out to
vendors, who respond with a formal cost for the project or equipment. An RFP is a detailed
planning document that contains precise specifications for the products and services that the
organization intends to buy.
Another type of document often sent to vendors is a request for quotation (RFQ). The differ-
ence between an RFP and an RFQ is that an RFP asks the vendor to submit a proposal for
the entire project, whereas an RFQ asks vendors for their most competitive prices on specific
440

equipment. RFQs are generally used when the project is designed and implemented by the
company’s internal staff.
Whom to Involve Making an investment in wireless technology involves the efforts of
many people. One of the most important groups is the organization’s IT team. The purpose
of involving the IT staff is twofold. First, the IT team’s members have a broad background
in technology and can contribute much to the dialog regarding their experiences and knowl-
edge base. Nothing alienates an IT staff more quickly than when an outside consultant is
hired without first tapping the in-house expertise. The second, and most important reason
for involving the IT staff, is to make them aware of the proposed project, because they are
the ones who will provide technical support and training and will therefore be the strongest
promoters of the new technology. If the IT staff is alienated from the planning process, the
project will likely be slow to take off or even fail.
Another group to involve in the planning process is the people who will be using the new
technology. Generally, it is not practical to involve all users at this early stage. Instead, a
representative group should be selected to participate. However, the group should represent
a true cross-section of the user base. Too often, only the most technological users, who tend
to be enthusiastic about any new technology, are chosen to participate, but that’s not a good
idea. Instead, the representative group should include both technological users and average
users; this will result in more impartial input and more widespread support when the new
technology rolls out.
External consultants are the third group to involve in the planning process. By viewing the
organization from the outside, they can evaluate its needs from an unbiased perspective.
However, a common mistake is to turn an entire project over to consultants and allow
them to create the plan, which not only fails to draw on the expertise that users and the IT
team can provide but may antagonize those two groups. External consultants should be
used as one source of input but not the sole source.
Regular meetings should be scheduled in which the external consultants provide detailed
explanations of how the project is moving forward, including a schedule of activities, a list
of proposed technologies, and a phased implementation plan—that is, a complete project
management plan. This plan should establish priorities and allocate the time needed for the
other participants in the process to respond, thereby ensuring that the planning phase stays
on target.
Developing a Request for Proposal
Once a plan for wireless technology has been designed, the next step is for the organization
to submit a request for proposal (RFP). An RFP might start with a sentence like the follow-
ing: “The vendor will install an 802.11b WLAN network for 45 users in an area in which
users are no more than 275 feet from the access point.” It would then include more detailed
information, such as a proposed schedule, relevant issues (such as a building that contains
certain types of hazardous materials, like asbestos or chemicals, large machinery, a walk-in
safe, or a shielded X-ray room in a clinic), and any other information that would assist the
vendor in creating its response. Some of the key elements contained in an RFP are:
●
Statement of values—This helps vendors understand the organization’s philosophy
and priorities—for example, whether network performance is more important than
the average amount of time it takes the vendor to respond to a problem, or whether

the immediate availability of the hardware and software is more important than price.
A statement of values assists the vendor in developing its response RFP.
●
Description of operations—This includes any future business plans that might affect
the RFP, such as a planned expansion in a branch office building.
●
Current network and applications—This includes the number of sites, the current
configuration, the applications that are currently being used, and the planned
additions.
●
Timetable—This lists specific dates for each step of the RFP evaluation by the
customer. A sample RFP timetable is shown in Table 12-3.
Vendors respond to the RFP with their proposals for the project. A vendor’s response should
contain detailed information regarding what will be installed, suggested timelines, and costs.
If a site survey has not yet been performed, it should be included as part of the requirements,
so that vendors can provide the cost of the site survey along with their responses. Once all
the RFPs have been received and analyzed, the company makes a final decision regarding
which vendor to select. Choosing a vendor should be done carefully by checking the vendors’
backgrounds and references. Choosing the vendor who submits the lowest cost can often
turn out to be a very costly decision.
Performing a Limited Trial
After the RFPs have been received and the vendor has been selected, it is important to per-
form a limited trial, also known in the industry as a pilot project. It is usually possible to bor-
row sample hardware and software from the vendor who won the bid. The IT staff should be
thoroughly involved in the trial, along with a select group of users. Those users who were
involved in the planning process are good candidates.
The new wireless technology should be thoroughly tested. Devices should be connected and
then taken offline, the base stations disconnected, and other similar activities performed to
see how the technology reacts under both normal and unusual circumstances. Throughput

and applications should be tested. This is a time in which the IT department can be intro-
duced to the technology and start learning troubleshooting techniques while dealing with the
trial group of users. The security of the new technology should also be thoroughly tested at
this point. It is also an opportunity for managers to see the technology in action so that they
can begin to understand how it will impact the business.
Training Staff
After the technology has been tested thoroughly, the next step is to begin training. Do not
underestimate this step. Training provides users as well as support specialists with the knowl-
edge to effectively operate and support the new wireless technology, and it can save time and
costs during the transition. Users need to know how to use the new hardware and software,
and the support staff needs to know how to manage the network and diagnose problems.
Training will increase the effectiveness of the new technology when it is first installed because
users will have less of a learning curve. This, in turn, will minimize the temporary drop
in productivity that is normally associated with the installation of a new system. Also,
well-trained users will have fewer questions and require less IT support after they start
using the new system.
The IT staff must be trained first. This may include on-site training from the vendor, if it was
included as part of the RFP, or attending workshops or specialized classes that cover the
technology. Once the IT staff has been trained, it can train the users. Because all users
learn differently, a variety of training sessions should be offered to accommodate them.
The different types of training include:
●
Small-group sessions
●
Detailed written instructions
●
Web-based training
●
One-on-one sessions
Rolling Out to All Users
As the training moves toward completion, the final rollout can begin. The most efficient way
to do a widespread rollout of a wireless technology is to do it in phases. If possible, start by
introducing the wireless technology to just one department or unit of the business. The IT
staff will be able to deal with problems more easily if it only has to deal with one department
or unit at a time. This also limits the effect of any rollout problems to one department instead
of the entire community of users.
On occasion, a project may need to go live before it is entirely debugged and before every
feature is added. If this is the case, it is important that the key users understand this, feel
comfortable with the temporary state of the new technology, and are aware of the full scale
of the project. The key users’ leadership among the other users can determine the success of
the project.
Once the system is installed and running in a unit, it is a good idea for the vendor and the IT
staff to confer and identify any problems before additional units are brought on. IT staff
members can also compare notes to determine if the training sessions are meeting the needs
of the users based on the type and number of questions that have been received. The training
can then be tweaked as the remaining users are trained.

Providing Support
Whereas training is primarily done before the new system is turned on, support continues
as users’ questions are answered. User-support functions can be carried out in various
ways, including:
●
Establishing informal peer-to-peer support groups
●
Creating formal user-support groups
●
Maintaining an internal help desk
●
Assigning support to the IT department
Each of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses. However, an internal help desk is
one of the most effective means of support. A help desk is a central point of contact for users
who need assistance using the technology. It addresses users’ problems and provides support
services to solve those problems. This can involve providing basic information to users,
such as why an FSO connection is slower when it is raining. But the help desk can use the
various requests for information to identify areas where improved technology might save
the company some money.
Here are some suggestions for running a help desk:
●
Have one telephone number for the help desk.
●
Plan for temporarily increased call volume after the new network is installed.
●
Create a method to track problems effectively.
●
Use surveys to determine user satisfaction and to identify any remaining issues.
●
Periodically rotate network personnel into the help desk.
●
Use information from the help desk to organize follow-up training.
Chapter Summary
■Wireless technology can positively impact an organization in many ways. WLANs
allow current data to be accessed quickly from any location. Universal access to cor-
porate data can also lead to increased mobility, productivity, and accuracy by
employees.
■VoWLAN uses IP phones and VoIP on the same network the company uses for data.
VoWLAN can help to enhance employee availability and customer service. Implementing
VoIP may increase the load on the network and require the replacement of some wired
network devices, such as switches and routers.
■The challenges related to wireless technology include investing in the correct technology.
Unauthorized users outside a building can receive RF signals from an inside WLAN.
Some users are reluctant to change to a new technology. The need for information
technology (IT) professionals to develop and implement wireless applications and
provide support is skyrocketing.
■Once a business has decided to invest in wireless technology, it faces the task of
building a new wireless infrastructure. The first step is to evaluate the need for wireless
technology by examining the entire organization. Another important step is to look at
444
Chapter 12

how the organization uses its current network. If the current network cannot support
the anticipated future growth of the organization or there is a clear indication that
wireless technology can help the organization grow, then investing in it may be the
answer. After the organization and the current network have been evaluated and it is
determined that wireless technology can fit into the current business strategy, the
organization must gather information, then perform a wireless site survey, which can
answer critical questions, such as the number of APs required, types of antennas,
interference, and security needs.
■Security needs may increase the cost of the project significantly, given that many other
devices, such as additional switches and authentication servers, may be required. Security
is always a work-in-progress and must be continually reviewed. New security policies
may have to be created and implemented as the result of adding a wireless network.
■There are many sophisticated tools on the market to assist and produce comprehensive
site survey reports. Although these reports can be created manually, site surveys can be
very time consuming and cost a lot of money. Using the right tools for the job saves
both time and money.
■An organization may send out a request for information (RFI). After evaluating the
potential solutions suggested by vendor RFIs and independent research, the organiza-
tion determines the costs of the project. The organization should balance the total cost
of implementing a wireless network against the benefits that the project will provide.
Determining the cost in relationship to the benefits is referred to as the return on
investment (ROI).
■Once it has been determined that there is a real need that can be solved by implementing
wireless technology, and if the ROI projection is positive, the next step is to create an
implementation plan. Planning should include the IT staff, users, and consultants.
Once a plan has been designed, the organization submits a request for proposal (RFP).
■After the RFPs have been received and the vendor has been selected, the company
performs a limited trial or pilot project involving a range of users and circumstances.
It is usually possible to borrow sample hardware and software from the vendor who
won the bid. The IT staff should be thoroughly involved in the trial, along with a
select group of users.
■Once the technology has been tested thoroughly, the next step is to begin training.
Training provides users as well as support specialists with the knowledge to operate
and support the new wireless technology effectively.
■As the training nears completion, the business rolls out the technology to all users in
phases.
■After the training is completed, support continues as users’ questions are answered.
User-support functions can be carried out in a variety of ways, an internal help desk
being one of the most effective ways.

Hands-On Project
Project 12-1
In this project, you will perform a limited 802.11 site survey. It is assumed
that you already know how to install software and configure both a laptop
WLAN NIC and an AP to set up a basic WLAN. To complete the project, you
will need the following:
●
An existing WLAN at your school or an AP or Wireless Residential Gateway.
●
A laptop computer equipped with a wireless NIC. You can perform the site
survey either using 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n technology at 2.4 GHz or
using 802.11a or 802.11n technology at 5 GHz, depending on the equipment
available.
●
A floor plan or some type of tool for measuring distances. Depending on the size
of the facility (this project covers only a single floor), you may use a long tape
measure, a measuring wheel, or a laser-measuring device. If the floor is covered
with linoleum tiles or carpet tiles, you can also measure the distances by the
number of tiles. This will be used to create a drawing of the floor, in case one
is not available.
●
A copy of Ekahau HeatMapper. This is free software, although it requires
you to register on the Web site. Ekahau HeatMapper is not capable of producing
detailed reports. However, it will produce a graphic representation of the
Wi-Fi signal coverage, and you can do a screen capture on your laptop
to save the graph. (Go to www.ekahau.com, click Products, and then click
HeatMapper.)
To complete this project:
1. Obtain a floor plan or create your own using the measurement tools. Keep it simple, but
be sure to record the measurements you take of the surrounding rooms and hallways as
well as the location of any metal cabinets or machinery, such as a photocopier or micro-
wave oven.
2. Download and install Ekahau HeatMapper. On the main HeatMapper page, read the
information on how to use the program. You will need a JPEG file of the floor plan to
load it into HeatMapper. Start the program and, at the top-right of the splash screen,
click I have a map image on.
3. In the Choose Image dialog box, select the file location of the floor plan, and then click
Choose Image. HeatMapper will open with the floor map loaded and will quickly dis-
play on the left side of the window any information about nearby APs and Wireless
Residential Gateways. Figure 12-4 shows a screen capture after the floor plan has
loaded. Note that this is a floor plan of a small office, where a site survey would hardly
be necessary. However, this office is located in a residential neighborhood and there are
a lot of interfering networks around. Your floor plan and results will, of course, be very
different.

4. To begin your site survey, hover the mouse cursor over your current position on the
floor plan and click the left mouse button. Then walk around the office and click the
left mouse button every 2 to 3 meters at each location. Note that a dashed line extends
from your last location to the new one and that a dot shows up at each location where
the mouse was left-clicked.
5. When you finish the walk-around, click the right mouse button to display the heat map.
You should be able to see all the APs and Wireless Residential Gateways that have
been detected. Hover the mouse cursor above each of the APs or Wireless Residential
Gateways in the graphic to see the heat map for each one. When you do this, you will
also see a Help bubble showing the current signal strength detected at your current loca-
tion. Do not close HeatMapper yet, as you may have to perform another site survey,
depending on whether you are using an existing network or using an AP or Wireless
Residential Gateway that you can move around in. Figure 12-5 shows an example of
a completed site survey for the small office. The top area of the heat map appears in
yellow, indicating a marginal but acceptable signal level. The bottom area appears in
a lighter green because it is closer to the location of the AP in the basement. The
small, darker area on the right, in the middle, appears in a darker green color, indicating
a good signal closer to the opening for the stairs leading to the basement.
Note the APs and Wireless Residential Gateways that have been detected. HeatMapper
does not allow you to move the icons for these devices. The full version of Ekahau’s Site
Survey software allows you to move the AP icons to their actual locations, whereas
HeatMapper only guesses the locations of the radios.

6. Hover the mouse cursor over your AP or Residential Gateway and click the Take
Screenshot button on the top-left corner of the HeatMapper window.
7. If you are using Windows 7 or Windows Vista, click the Start button on the taskbar,
click All Programs, click Accessories, and click Windows Paint to open the application.
In Windows Paint, click the Paste button to view a copy of your screen capture. If you
wish, you can now save this image for later analysis and comparison.
8. After you have finished saving your file, go back to HeatMapper and click the Undo
Survey button to clear the heat map.
9. Click the first tab on the top-left column of the Paint window, and then click Save as.
Save the screen capture in JPEG format.
10. If you did not get the results you expected from your site survey and you are able to
move the AP, do so and then redo the site survey starting with Step 4 on this project.
You may also wish to compare your results with those of other students.
Real-World Exercises
The Baypoint Group (TBG) needs your help with a WLAN proposal. GHS is a chain of sport-
ing good stores that specialize in the sport of soccer. Because GHS has grown in popularity, it
now has nine stores in the area. GHS is considering implementing a wireless technology that
will link all its stores through wireless broadband service. The chain would install a WLAN

in each store and provide its employees with tablet computers for better customer service.
GHS is unsure how to start this process. The company has asked TBG for help, and TBG
has turned to you.
Exercise 12-1
Create a presentation for GHS that explains the steps necessary to implement a wireless
technology infrastructure, beginning with evaluating the needs and ending with providing
support. Your presentation should last 20 to 25 minutes. Use PowerPoint to create your slides.
Exercise 12-2
After hearing your presentation, GHS is ready to start the process. The company feels that
one of the barriers it must overcome is providing support for its users. It does not have a
centralized help desk; instead, employees help each other and the IT staff does a limited
amount of instruction (just enough to get the user through his or her problem). GHS would
like your opinion on how to set up a help desk and what services it should provide. Create a
short PowerPoint presentation about what a help desk does, its advantages and disadvantages,
its challenges, and some tips on using a help desk for GHS.
Challenge Case Project
Form a three-person team and, using the Internet, locate news articles and com-
pany press releases about each of the following wireless implementations: LAN,
MAN, and WAN. Review the challenges that were encountered and some of
the expected or resulting benefits of the project. If possible, contact the organi-
zations or vendors and obtain additional information on the challenges and
benefits. Your team should then write a one-page report for each implementation and present
your analysis to the rest of the class. Allow at least 5 to 10 minutes for the class to ask questions
at the end of your presentation and be prepared to answer questions about ROI, technical
support, what process and criteria were used to select the vendor, and whether the entire
project was handled by internal staff. Your team’s report should also include your own
conclusions about the project’s benefits.

History of Wireless Communications
Studying the history of a topic does not always evoke thrills and excitement. In fact, the
question “Who cares about the past?” is often asked when studying history is even men-
tioned. However, there are several benefits to studying the history of a technology such as
wireless communications. First, our current technology wasn’t discovered overnight, like
stumbling upon a previously unknown island in the ocean. There are always several smaller
steps that take place to lead up to the development of the new technology. Tracing the
development of these earlier discoveries can help us better understand how the final technol-
ogy actually functions. Being able to see how a technology was created piece-by-piece, just
as the early inventors did, can help us see how each piece fits with the next development
and to understand how the technology actually works.
Another advantage of studying the historical development of technology is that it reveals
how the device was accepted and used by society. This shows what value society placed on
that technology and is a good predictor of how it will be used in the future. In short, studying
the past helps us understand where we are headed.
Finally, historical study helps us better appreciate the technology. Some of today’s great
technological marvels were the result of years of painstaking trial and effort by some of the
great minds of earlier days. How they persevered as early trailblazers without knowing
exactly where they would end up is a testimony to their character and helps us better
appreciate what we have before us today.
Early Developments
The word telegraphy comes from a Greek word that means “writing in distance.” Telegraphy
is a system of communication that is able to transmit signals that represent coded letters and
numbers or other signs of writing over long distances. Telegraphy can be divided in acoustic
(sound), optical (sight), and electrical transmissions.
Acoustic telegraphy has very ancient origins. Greek historians tell how the Persian king
Darius I in 500 BC could send news from the capital city to the outlying provinces of the
empire by means of a line of shouting men positioned on hills. This kind of transmission
was determined to be 30 times faster than normal couriers carrying the information. Julius
Caesar in 50 BC said that the nation of the Gauls could call to war its entire army in only
three days just by using the human voice.
453

Early optical telegraphy consisted of fire at night and smoke or reflections from shiny objects
during the day to transmit signals. A device called a hydraulic telegraph was used by the
Caraginese around 500 BC. It consisted of two large vases placed on distant hills. The vases
were filled with water and had a floating vertical pole at the center with coded letters
attached to it. Messages were sent by rising or lowering the pole (by emptying or adding
water to the vases) to move the coded letter to a certain point.
An optical telegraph was developed by Claude Chappe in 1792. Coded signals were based
on the different positions of three wooden interlinked arms that rotated at the top of a
fixed vertical pole. The central arm (called a regulator) was longer than the other two arms
(called indicators). The indicator arms could rotate freely around a center and be positioned
at 45 degree angles. A book 92 pages long contained 92 different words on each page (for a
total of almost 8,500 words). The arms of the optical telegraph were moved to indicate the
page number and the word number of the particular word that was to be transmitted.
The optical telegraph was officially adopted by the French government and several other
European states.
The discovery of electrical current led to the introduction of electrical telegraphy in the early
1880s. Samuel Morse toured Italy in 1830 as a well-known painter. When he was sailing
back to the United States, the concept of a telegraph based on electromagnetism came to
him. Electromagnetism is a magnetic force created by a current of electricity. Morse’s first
telegraph-receiving instrument was constructed from a wooden clock motor that provided
the power to move a paper tape under a pen. The pen was moved by an electromagnet that
was driven from a telegraph line. A canvas stretcher from his painting supplies was used as a
frame to support the device. Morse received a patent for his telegraph invention in 1838, the
same year he completed his last two paintings. In 1844, Morse sent the famous words from
the Bible, “What hath God wrought!” on his telegraph from the U.S. Capitol Building in
Washington, DC, to Baltimore.
Morse tried without success to obtain European patents for his tele-
graph. In addition, he invented a code now known as the Morse
code for use with his telegraph instrument.
James Maxwell, a Scottish physicist, was also very interested in electromagnetism.
In 1861, he developed a mathematical model for a hypothetical medium that consisted
of a fluid that could carry electric and magnetic effects. Maxwell theorized that if the
fluid became elastic and a charge was applied to it, this would set up a disturbance
in the fluid, which would produce waves that would travel through the medium. It was
calculated that these waves would travel at the speed of light. Maxwell published his
work in 1873.
In 1888, the German physicist Heinrich Hertz made the discovery of radio waves, which
are a form of electromagnetic radiation. This confirmed Maxwell’s theory. He devised a
transmitter that radiated radio waves and then detected them across the length of his
laboratory using a metal loop with a gap at one side. When the loop was placed within
the transmitter’s electromagnetic field, sparks were produced across the gap. This proved
that electromagnetic waves could be sent out into space and could be remotely detected.
Although people had seen the effects of radio waves before, nobody had realized what
they were.

Radio waves were originally called “Hertzian waves.”
Radio
Guglielmo Marconi was born in Bologna, Italy, in 1874. By age 21, he had already per-
formed simple experiments that had convinced him it was possible to send signals by using
electromagnetic waves. His first successes were at short distances, only about 330 feet (100
meters) between his house and the end of the garden.
Scientists and other experts at that time believed that electromagnetic waves could only be
transmitted in a straight line, and then only if there was nothing in the way. They thought
that the main obstacle to radio transmission was the curvature of the earth’s surface.
Marconi was convinced that transmission was possible between two distant points even if
they were separated by an obstacle. He placed his transmitter near his house and the receiver
almost 2 miles (3 kilometers) away, behind a hill. Overseeing the receiver was Marconi’s
servant, Mignani, who was holding a rifle. Mignani’s responsibility was to fire a rifle shot
when the signal was received. From his house, Marconi pushed the key of the transmitter
three times and then heard the answer of a distant gunshot. His experiment proved that
electromagnetic waves had traveled a distance and overcome an obstacle. With the comple-
tion of his experiment in 1895, Marconi had demonstrated that wireless telegraphy, also
known as radio communications, was possible.
The word radio comes from the term radiated energy.
Marconi found little enthusiasm for his invention in Italy. He presented his device to the
Italian government, only to be told by an Italian minister that it was “not suitable for tele-
communications”! However, in England, where his mother was born, Marconi received sup-
port and financial backing and was able to patent his invention. In 1897, the British Ministry
of Posts gave him money and technicians to continue his experiments, and the transmission
distances gradually became longer, up to 60 miles (100 kilometers).
In 1901, Marconi set up a transmitting station in England, and a receiving station was built
on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean on the island of Newfoundland. For three hours every
day, a signal was transmitted while Marconi experimented with newer and larger types
of antennas suspended from light kites. On December 12, 1901, a signal was received at
Newfoundland. For the first time, electromagnetic waves had crossed the Atlantic Ocean,
traveling a distance of 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers). Although Marconi did not know it at
the time, the success of his experiment was due to the presence of the ionosphere. The iono-
sphere, a layer of the upper atmosphere (between 40 and 310 miles, or 60 and 500 kilometers),
plays a fundamental role in all radio communications. The ionosphere reflects electromagnetic
waves like a mirror and allows a radio signal to travel far distances.

The ionosphere was discovered by an English physicist in 1924.
Marconi quickly put his work on wireless telegraphy to practical use. In 1899, for the first
time, a distress signal was sent from a shipwrecked boat to a station on land using wireless
telegraphy, enabling the passengers to be rescued. Marconi also visited the United States and
helped the U.S. Navy set up communications between its cruisers. In 1903, while sailing from
England to the U.S., Marconi established the first press agency. News information was
flashed to the ship via wireless transmissions. This information was then printed on board
the ship as part of a newspaper.
Marconi continued to refine his wireless telegraphy devices. In 1904, he built a rotating
device that led to the development of horizontal antennas, which permitted a tremendous
increase in the strength of received signals. He later patented this device. In 1934, he demon-
strated how a ship, lost in fog, could safely find the entrance of a harbor using wireless
signals. In 1935, he performed distant-search experiments that would eventually lead to the
invention of radar.
Marconi also studied microwaves, early television technology, and
started research on the therapeutic use of radio waves, called
Marconitherapy.
Marconi died in Rome in 1937. To remember his great contribution to wireless telegraphy,
radios all around the world observed a minute of silence.
In 1909, Marconi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics.
Television
The idea of transmitting pictures and sound over distance occupied the minds of dreamers for
centuries. Yet unlike radio, television was not created by one individual at one specific point
in time. Instead, television evolved over a period of 50 years, based on the discoveries and
efforts of many scientists and visionaries.
The basic process of television involves transmitting images by converting light to electrical
signals. This is known as photoelectric technology. Early attempts to send still images
down a telegraph wire, in the mid 1800s, were based on electrochemical technology. In 1842,
Alexander Bain proposed a facsimile telegraph transmission system based on electrochemical
technology. Bain proposed that metallic letters of the alphabet could be transmitted chemically.
Electrified metal letters could be scanned by a pendulum device and reproduced at the other end
of the telegraph wire by a synchronized pendulum contacting a piece of chemical paper.

Historians normally associate Bain’s ideas with the modern day fac-
simile (fax) machine.
Bain’s proposal was improved upon in 1847 when F. Bakewell of Great Britain patented a
chemical telegraph. Bakewell replaced the pendulums with synchronized rotating cylinders.
By 1861, handwritten messages and photographs could be sent over telegraph lines.
In 1873, Louis May, a British telegrapher, discovered the basics of photoconductivity. He
found that selenium bars, when exposed to light, were a strong conductor of electricity.
He also found that the conduction of electrical current would vary depending on the amount
of light hitting the bars. A later discovery revealed that changes in electrical voltage produced
by selenium when scanning a document could magnetically control a pencil at the receiving
end of the transmission. By 1881, Shelford Bidwell successfully transmitted silhouettes using
both selenium and a scanning system. He called the device the scanning phototelegraph.
The first working device for analyzing a scene to generate electrical signals suitable for trans-
mission was a scanning system proposed and built by Paul Nipkow in 1884. The scanner
consisted of a rotating disc with a number of small holes (apertures) arranged in a spiral in
front of light-sensitive selenium. As the disc rotated, the spiral of 18 holes swept across the
image of the scene from top to bottom in a pattern of 18 parallel horizontal lines. This had
the effect of dividing the picture into 18 lines of dots or picture elements (pixels). For repro-
duction of the scene, a light source, controlled in intensity by the detected electrical signal,
was projected on a screen through a similar Nipkow disc that rotated in synch with the
pickup disc.
The Nipkow disc device was capable of transmitting about 4,000 pix-
els per second.
This was known as the world’s first electromechanical television system. However, Nipkow
could not build a reliable working system because he was unable to amplify the electric cur-
rent created by the selenium to drive a receiver. Nevertheless, Nipkow demonstrated a scan-
ning process for the analysis of images by dissecting a complete scene into an orderly pattern
of pixels that could be transmitted by an electrical signal and reproduced as a visual image.
This became the basis for present-day television.
With improvements in technology, mechanical television later became practical. In 1928, tele-
vision signals were being sent from London to New York. By 1932, the first home mechanical
television sets were available, and over 10,000 sets were sold. These first sets delivered a crude
picture consisting of a cloudy 40-line image (compared to 525 lines on today’s televisions) on
a 6-inch-square mirror. The sets cost between $85 and $135.
North America’s first television station, W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland,
was started in the 1930s.

Most historians credit Vladimir Zworykin as the “father of television.” A Russian immigrant,
Zworykin came to the United States after World War I and went to work for Westinghouse.
From 1920 until 1929, Zworykin performed some of his early experiments in television.
He developed the first practical TV camera tube, known as the iconoscope, in 1923.
Zworkin’s iconoscope (from the Greek for “image” and “to see”) consisted of a thin film
coated with a photosensitive layer of potassium hydride. His kinescope picture tube formed
the basis for subsequent advances in the field. With this crude camera tube and a kinescope
as the picture reproducer, Zworkin had the essential elements for electronic television. By
1931, with the iconoscope and kinescope well developed, electronic television was ready to
be launched.
A lesser-known early electronic television pioneer was Philo Farnsworth. At age 19, Farnsworth
persuaded an investor to fund an all-electronic television system. Farnsworth established
his laboratory first in Los Angeles and later in San Francisco. It was in San Francisco, in
1927, that Farnsworth gave the first public demonstration of the television system he had
dreamed of for six years. He was not yet 21 years old. Farnsworth was quick to develop several
of the basic concepts of an electronic television system and was granted many patents.
By 1939, widespread commercial electronic television broadcasting began in the United States
when the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) started regularly scheduled broadcasts in
the New York area to only 400 sets. In 1941, the American Federal Communications
Authority set the standards for broadcast television. With the start of World War II, how-
ever, television production stopped in the United States.
At the end of the war, there was a two-year delay in the development of television as the
Federal Communications Authority considered proposals for color television systems. In
1947, all proposals for color television were rejected. Black and white sets, however, were
manufactured in large quantities. In 1946, there were only 7,000 televisions in the United
States By 1950, there were over 10 million sets.
It took until 1954 for the National Television System Committee (NTSC) to set the standard
for color broadcast television. It settled on a system that was compatible with existing black
and white TV sets. Color was achieved by inserting the color information inside the
black and white signal. The color standard specified 625 lines at 25 frames per second.
By 1970, television had become the primary information and entertainment medium in the
world. Today it is estimated that there are 605 million television sets worldwide. However,
the standards for television broadcasting are not universal. There are 15 different variations
of broadcasting standards used around the world.
Radar
Radar has been hailed as one of the greatest scientific developments of the first half of the
20th century. Although radar is usually associated with detecting airplanes in the sky or
ships on the ocean, it actually is used in a variety of different ways. Some of these include:
●
Radar is used extensively in weather forecasting and to provide early warning for
severe weather. A radar system known as NEXRAD (NEXt Generation Weather

RADar) can gauge the size, intensity, wind speed, and direction of storms, the amount
of water vapor in clouds, and can detect high-level circular wind patterns that cause
tornadoes.
●
Radar is used to help archaeologists excavate ancient sites. Radar can be used from
space satellites and airplanes to scan entire regions for possible archaeological sites.
The radar waves can penetrate earth, sand, and volcanic ash that cover ancient sites.
When the waves strike rock or metal, the echo is reflected back. This helps
archeologists determine the best location to dig.
●
Radar helps engineers study highway tunnels for potential hidden dangers. Radar
can be mounted on a truck and driven through a tunnel that is built under a body
of water. Radar can quickly and accurately scan the tunnel for any leaks.
●
Located on a space shuttle, radar can be used to locate stagnant pools of water in
areas of dense foliage on earth. With this information, the stagnant water, which can
harbor insects carrying disease, can be located and drained.
●
Radar has also helped provide information about the universe. It is used to
locate comets, map stars, and probe planets that cannot be seen with a regular
telescope.
“Radar” is an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging.
Radar is an active remote sensing system that operates on the principle of echoes. When a
person in a room yells out, her voice is sent out as sound waves and is reflected back by the
walls to the ears of the listener. Instead of sound waves, radars use radio waves because
radio waves travel faster, further, and are reflected better than sound waves. Radio waves
travel at the speed of light (186,000 miles or 300,000 kilometers per second).
Radar performs three primary functions:
●
It transmits microwave signals (called the pulse) toward a target.
●
After reaching an object, it is reflected back, and the radar receives a return portion of
the transmitted signal (called the backscatter), as seen in Figure A-1.
●
It observes the strength, behavior, and the time delay of the returned signals and
produces a “blip” on a screen, as seen in Figure A-2.
A radar display shows a map-like picture of the area being scanned.
The center of the picture responds to the radar antenna, and the
radar echoes are shown as bright spots on the screen. The distance
of the spot from the center of the screen indicates how far away
the object is.
The “blips” produced on a screen will vary depending upon the object reflecting the waves.
Sophisticated radar can identify not only an airplane in the sky but also its type, manufac-
turer, and whether it is friend or foe.

A special type of radar known as Doppler radar is frequently used today by meteorologists to
locate tornados and microbursts, which are downdrafts of air traveling at very high speeds.
Doppler radar takes advantage of the Doppler Effect. The Doppler Effect is when the
frequency of an electromagnetic wave is changed as the wave hits a moving object. Unlike
regular radar, Doppler radar sends out waves at multiple sets of frequencies. Upon striking
the target, the wave is reflected back at a different frequency than the transmitted wave. The

radar compares the frequency of the returned echo with that of the transmitted wave. When
the difference is calculated, the speed of the object, which caused the shift in frequency,
can be calculated. Wind patterns are shown on the radar display in different colors. The
faster a wind is moving, the brighter its color.
Doppler radar is also used by law enforcement agencies to locate
speeding motorists. Most police radar guns have a split-screen dis-
play window, which shows both the speed of the target and the
speed of the patrol vehicle.
The development of radar dates back to the discoveries of the 1860s and 1870s, when
James Maxwell developed the equations that outlined the behavior of electromagnetic waves
and Heinrich Hertz discovered radio waves. Several years later, a German engineer named
Christian Huelsmeyer proposed the use of radio echoes to avoid collisions in marine naviga-
tion. The first successful radio range-finding experiment occurred in 1924, when the British
scientist Edward Appleton used radio echoes to determine the height of the ionosphere.
The first practical radar system was produced in 1935 by the British physicist Robert
Watson-Watt. By 1939, England had established a chain of radar stations along its southern
and eastern coasts to detect aggressors in the air or on the sea. About the same time, two
British scientists were responsible for the most important advance made in the technology of
radar during World War II. Henry Boot and John Randall invented an electron tube that was
capable of generating high-frequency radio pulses with large amounts of power.
Satellites
A satellite is any object that orbits or revolves around another object. For example, the moon
is a satellite of the earth, and the earth is a satellite of the sun. Man-made satellites provide
communications capabilities around the world, transmitting television signals, telephone
calls, faxes, computer communications, and weather information. Satellites can be sent into
space through a variety of launch vehicles.
The theory of satellites dates back to 325 years before the first man-made satellite was ever
launched. In the 1720s, Sir Isaac Newton was probably the first person to conceive the idea
of a satellite. Newton illustrated how an artificial satellite could be launched from the earth.
He pictured the earth with a high mountain and a cannon on top of the mountain firing
shots parallel to the ground. Each time the cannon was fired, more gunpowder was used
and the shot went farther before striking the ground. Because the earth is round, the shots
would curve around it. According to Newton’s theory, with enough gunpowder, a shot could
eventually go fast enough to circle the earth completely and come back to the mountaintop.
During the Second World War, the German military made great strides in the development of
rocket technology. However, even the best rocket technology of that day could not achieve
an earth orbit. In 1945, Arthur C. Clarke, a science fiction author, wrote an article that envi-
sioned a network of communications satellites. Three satellites could be placed into space at
22,000 miles (35,400 kilometers) so as to orbit the planet every 24 hours. These satellites
would be able to transmit signals around the world by transmitting in a “line of sight” with
other orbiting satellites. At the time of Clarke’s writing, the idea was not well received.

Satellites of today that follow this same orbit are said to reside in the
“Clarke Belt.”
The economic feasibility of satellites in the early days was hotly
debated. At a cost of over one billion dollars for a satellite, there
were serious questions regarding its return on investment.
On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. Sputnik 1 was described as “a
radio transmitter in a 23-inch polished aluminum ball.” Sputnik was equipped with transmit-
ters to broadcast on two different frequencies, and it circled the globe every 90 minutes. After
18 days, its battery was exhausted and the transmitting ceased; and almost three months
later, Sputnik 1 was incinerated as it fell from orbit back into earth’s atmosphere. A month
after Sputnik 1, the Soviets launched Sputnik 2 and its passenger, Laika, a dog who has the
distinction of being the first living creature to enter outer space.
The United States followed with its own launch of Explorer 1 in early 1958. The first commu-
nications satellite was launched later that same year. The Signal Communication by Orbital
Relay (SCORE) satellite broadcasted a Christmas message from President Dwight Eisenhower
of “Peace on earth, good will toward men” as the satellite orbited the earth for 12 days until
its batteries failed. A succession of Soviet and American launches resulted in larger and more
sophisticated satellites reaching orbit. In 1961, Yuri Gegarin became the first man in orbit.
The United States and Soviet Union launched six satellites in 1958,
14 in 1959, 19 in 1960, and 35 in 1961. In 1962, the United Kingdom
and Canada launched satellites of their own, along with the
70 satellites launched by the United States and Soviet Union.
After the initial launches, the benefits and prestige associated with satellite communications
made satellites a popular item. The National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA)
confined itself to experiments with “mirrors” or passive communications satellites while
the U.S. Department of Defense was responsible for “repeater” or active satellites, which
amplified the received signal at the satellite and provided a much higher quality of communi-
cations. In 1960, NASA launched Echo 1, a passive reflector satellite with no amplification
possibilities. The Echo satellites were basically large metallicized balloons that served as pas-
sive reflectors of radio signals. At the time of its launch, it was thought that passive reflector
satellites could serve a purpose in communications, but the technology was soon abandoned
because the reflected signal was so weak.
In 1960, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) filed a request with the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for permission to launch an experimental com-
munications satellite. The U.S. government reacted with surprise because there had never
been such a request and there was no policy in place to regulate satellites. AT&T designed,
built, and even paid for the launches with its own funds, reimbursing NASA for its use of
the rockets. The Telstar I and II spacecraft were prototypes for a constellation of 50 medium
earth orbit (MEO) satellites that AT&T was working to put in place. Telstar was the first
modern communications satellite to be placed in orbit. However, when the U.S. government

later decided to give the monopoly on satellite communications to a consortium, AT&T’s
satellite project was halted.
The first words transmitted over satellite were not as memorable as
Alexander Bell’s “Watson, come here I need you!” or Samuel Morse’s
“What hath God wrought?” The first transmitted words were “Will
everybody please get off this line?” So many people were trying to be
the first to hear the transmission that the circuit was being overloaded!
In 1964, an international organization known as INTELSAT (INternational TELecommunica-
tions SATellite Organization) was formed. A consortium of over 130 governments and organi-
zations. Intelsat launched a series of satellites with the goal of providing total earth coverage
(excluding the North and South Poles) by satellite transmission. This was achieved by 1969.
Today, Intelsat has 19 satellites in orbit that are open to use by all nations. Intelsat owns the
satellites, but each nation owns its own earth receiving stations.
INTELSAT completed its global coverage just days before the first
men walked on the moon in 1969, enabling one half billion people
around the world to watch the landmark event.
NASA led the next wave of communications satellite technology with the launch of
Advanced Communications Technology Satellites (ACTS) in 1993. ACTS pioneered the use
of several new developments, such as on-board storage and processing and all-digital trans-
mission, which make satellite transmission more reliable.
The explosive popularity of cellular telephones advanced the idea of always being connected,
no matter where you were located on earth. Several companies committed themselves to pro-
viding a solution by using satellites in low earth orbit (LEO). The most ambitious of these
companies was Iridium, sponsored by Motorola. Iridium planned to launch 66 satellites into
polar orbit at altitudes of about 400 miles (650 kilometers). Iridium’s goal was to provide
communications services to hand-held telephones around the world in 1998. However, Irid-
ium declared bankruptcy in 1999. The total cost of the Iridium system was in excess of
three billion dollars.
Iridium originally planned to have 77 satellites and thus was named
after the 77th element in the periodic charts. However, when the
plans were scaled back to only 66 satellites, the name Iridium contin-
ued to be used because Element 66 has the less pleasant name
Dysprosium.
Cellular Telephones
In the 1930s and 1940s, two-way car radios were installed and used by police, utility compa-
nies, government agencies, and emergency services. However, these two-way car radios had
several disadvantages and were not very convenient to use. In 1946, in St. Louis, AT&T
and Southwestern Bell introduced the first American commercial mobile radio-telephone
service to private customers.“Mobiles,” as they were called, used the newly issued vehicle

radio-telephone licenses granted to Southwestern Bell by the FCC. They operated on six
channels. However, interference soon forced Bell to use only three channels.
In a rare exception to the Bell System common practice, subscribers
to this first system could actually buy their own radio sets and not
use AT&T’s equipment.
With two-way car radios, a central transmitter with one antenna could serve a wide area.
This is illustrated in Figure A-3. However, this system could not be used with mobiles. The
reason is that car-mounted transmitters were not as powerful as the central antenna, and
thus their signals could not always be transmitted all the way back. To overcome this limita-
tion, smaller receivers with antennas were placed on the tops of buildings and on poles
around the city, creating smaller cells, or ranges of service areas. When people were using
their mobiles, the conversations, that they heard were transmitted on one frequency by the
central transmitter to their moving cars. When they spoke on their mobiles, however, that
transmission was sent on a separate frequency that the nearest receiver antenna picked up.
In other words, messages were received on one frequency from the central transmitter but
messages were sent to the nearest receiver on a separate frequency. When the car moved
from one cell to another that was served by a different receiver, the switch between cells
was known as a handoff. This is illustrated in Figure A-4.
As innovative as mobiles were, there were still several serious limitations. The first limitation
was a lack of available frequencies. Mobiles required two frequencies to make a transmis-
sion, one frequency to transmit on and one to receive. A single radio-telephone call took up
as much frequency space as a radio broadcast station. In the late 1940s, there was very little
unused transmission space available. And because the FCC gave priority to emergency ser-
vices, government agencies, utility companies, and services it thought helped the most people,
this left only a tiny amount of frequencies available for mobiles. Most mobile telephone sys-
tems could not accommodate more than a total of 250 users, with only a handful actually
being able to transmit at one time.

At this time, the technology for the mobiles was not refined, and
they actually required six times the amount of frequency that would
be needed today.
The second limitation was that waves at lower frequencies travel great distances (sometimes
hundreds of miles) when they skip across the atmosphere. Although high-powered transmit-
ters gave mobiles a wide operating range, the signals could also be detected in adjacent cities.
Telephone companies could not reuse their channels in nearby cities due to this potential
interference; they required at least 75 miles between mobile systems.
Despite the limitations, mobile service was highly desired. Every city that offered mobiles had
lengthy waiting lists. By 1976, only 545 customers in New York City had Bell System mobiles
but 3,700 customers were on the waiting list. Some individuals were on waiting lists for up to
10 years. Although allocating more frequency would have solved the problem, the FCC did
not do so. Even as late as 1978, all mobile carriers nationwide had just 54 channels.
The first modern cellular telephone systems, in the early 1980s, used
666 channels.
Although mobiles had limitations and were used by very few people, they nevertheless
launched the basic concept of cellular phones. Designers realized that by using small cells
they could use lower-powered transmitters. They also determined that if they could have
each cell use a different frequency, then by reusing these frequencies they could substantially
increase the traffic capacity of mobile phones. At that time, however, the technology to do so
did not exist. Nevertheless, the concepts of using cells and of frequency reuse laid the founda-
tion for cellular telephones 50 years later.
In 1969, the Bell System developed a commercial cellular radio operation using frequency
reuse. The unusual setting for this venture was on trains running from New York City to
Washington, DC, using pay telephones. Passengers could make telephone calls onboard
while the trains were moving at 100 miles an hour. Six channels were reused in nine zones
along the 225-mile route. A computerized control center in Philadelphia managed the system.
Thus the first cellular phone was a pay phone.

In July of 1978, AT&T and Illinois Bell started a pilot project in Chicago of analog-based
cellular telephone service. Ten cells covering 21,000 square miles made up the Chicago sys-
tem. This first equipment test began using 90 Bell System employees, and after six months it
was opened to the general public. This early cellular telephone proved that a large cellular
system could work.
Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) began setting up analog cellular telephone opera-
tions in other parts of the world. An 88-cell system in Tokyo began in December 1979, and
a system in Mexico City with one cell started in August 1981. Europe saw cellular service
introduced in 1981, when the Nordic Mobile Telephone System began operating in
Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. This was the first multinational cellular system.
Initially U.S. cellular telephone development did not keep up with the rest of the world. The
most significant reason was the breakup of the Bell System by the U.S. federal court system
and the FCC’s 1981 regulations that required the Bell System or a regional operating com-
pany, such as Bell Atlantic, to have competition in every cellular market. However, the popu-
larity of cellular soon began to spread across the nation, along with the development of an
analog cellular infrastructure.
Roaming from one city or state in the United States was easy because the U.S. system was
based on an analog cellular system. In contrast, it was almost impossible to roam in Europe.
During the 1980s, a plan was launched to create a single Europe-wide digital mobile service
with advanced features and easy roaming. This network started operating in 1991. In the
United States, there was no such movement because the analog system was working well.
Today cellular telephone deployment is worldwide, but development remains concentrated
in three areas: Scandinavia, the United States, and Japan. As of this writing, there are
approximately 6 billion cellular phone subscriptions worldwide, creating about $1 trillion
in annual revenues.
