Auto Start Extensibility Points

Auto Start Extensibility Points (ASEPs)
ASEPs are places that allow a program to 
run automatically, without user 
interaction
2

Types of ASEPs
SYSTEM BEHAVIOR ABUSE
Windows features
SYSTEM PERSISTENCE 
MECHANISMS
mechanisms by Windows 
that are meant to run user 
programs
PROGRAM LOADER ABUSE
abusing the Windows loader 
process
APPLICATION ABUSE
abusing extensions of 
legitimate programs

System Persistence Mechanisms
SERVICES
background programs with no user 
interaction
managed by Service Control Manager (SCM)
RUN KEYS
Run
RunOnce
RunOnceEx
STARTUP FOLDER
Microsoft\Windows\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup
SCHEDULED TASKS
periodic execution of programs via Windows 
Task Scheduler
every task has XML file in 
%Systemroot%\System32\Tasks
4

Program Loader Abuse
SHIM DATABASES
apply program patches before execution
databases stored in C:\Windows\AppPatch
COM HIJACKING
modify path of associated COM object DLLs to 
malware DLL
IMAGE FILE EXECUTION OPTIONS (IFEO)
feature to launch programs with debugger
malware can register as debugger
EXTENSION HIJACKING
change default program associated with 
extension
SHORTCUTS MANIPULATION
modify shortcuts to also launch malware
5

Application Abuse
TROJANIZED SYSTEM 
BINARIES
modification of legitimate 
binary, e.g., by inserting code
OFFICE ADD-INS
extend MS Office 
applications
BROWSER HELPER OBJECTS 
(BHO)
plugins for Internet Explorer
only < Windows 11
6

System Behavior Abuse
ACTIVE SETUP
Windows feature
can launch programs when user signs in
WINLOGON
can change desktop and file manager 
(explorer.exe) 
can change system program after login 
(userinit.exe)
can change Winlogon notification package 
(DLL)
DLL HIJACKING
abuse Windows' DLL search order so that 
malware DLL is loaded
APPINIT DLLS
load DLL into address space of every 
application with user interface
But: disabled if secure boot is enabled (>= Win 
8)

ASEP Examination Tools
SYSINTERNALS AUTORUNS
dynamic malware analysis
WINESAP (VOLATILITY PLUGIN)
forensic investigations
FARBAR RECOVERY SCAN TOOL (FRST)
system disinfection
