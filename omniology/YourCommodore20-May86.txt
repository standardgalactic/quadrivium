Soft in the Head
The software scene this month is as
crowded and diverse as ever.
Plunging straight in at the deep end
with the serious stuff we have four new
productivity programs from Ariolasoft, all
brought in from across the Atlantic.
PaperClip, H o m e Pak a n d  T h e
Consultant are all from the Canadian
software house, Batteries Included.
PaperClip is a word processor and it's a
former number one piece of software in
the States. Ariolasoft describes i t  as
professional and comprehensive and it
features full screen editing. It's available
on disk an d  side tw o contains an
enhanced C128 version.
HomePak is a three module package
and includes: H o m e Text a  w o rd
processor; Homerind, a data manager;
and HomeTerm a telecommunications
program which communicates with
databases and other computers.
The Consultant i s  a  database
management system designed to organise,
sort and retrieve records, ﬁnd exact items
and execute a  variety of search and
analysis procedures.
The ﬁnal package in the latest batch of
launches from Ariolasoft is called Cut and
Paste. It's an easy to use word processor
from Electronic Arts and its features
include automatic word wrap, dynamic
menus and full cut and paste editing.
Ariolasoft's Ashley G ray said:
"Ariolasoft has taken great care to ensure
that these new productivity titles are
exactly right for the home and small
business user, both in terms of program
quality, p rice a n d  distinctive U K
packaging."
Commodore is also launching new
products for the serious user. Two new
music systems were due to be launched at
the Ideal Home Exhibition as we went to
press. They are a complete Music System
including a Commodore 64 for under
030 and a Music Expansion system for
under E150.
Staying with the more serious aspects
of a Commodore user's life, Medstat, a
Nottingham based software house, is
promoting its range of exam revision
software as we come around once more

STATEM
Nick Alexander oi Virgin cleans up soccer
to the time of ' 0 '  and 'A' Levels. The
revision aid programs cover French,
German, Spanish and Italian CSE, '0' and
'A' level examinations and concentrate on
verb and vocabulary learning, Prices start
at £13.95 and they are all available on the
C64_
Now to games. Fans of the Rocky
Horror Show who also own a C128 will be
pleased to hear that CRL is to bring out an
all new version of its Rocky Horror game
specially for the 128. Redeﬁned graphics,
brand new sprites, new animation and
even mo re locations are promised
together with some stunning effects. No
price has yet been announced for the
game but it should be available in May.
There's also good news from CRL for
C-16 and Plus/4 owners. The Berks trilogy
is now available on one cassette priced at
16.95. It features the original game, Berks
plus Major Blink (Berks 2) and Berks 3 an
arcade adventure in which you ﬁnally
penetrate the Berks city and steal their
treasure.
Virgin has recently launched t he
ofﬁcial Football Association soccer game
— FA Cup Football. The game is mainly
text based and places you in the difﬁcult
position of managing your teams through
all the rounds of the FA Cup.
Tony Williams, author of the League
Club Directory, upon whose extensive
research t he game is based, said: "The FA
Cup i s  football's m o st  exciting
competition and this game reﬂects that
excitement. We've had a great deal of fun

N e w s
putting it together and I'm sure people
will have as much fun playing it." It cost
£7.95 on the C64.
Imagine has entered the Kung Fu
games market with a new release called
Vie Ar Kung Fu — a very violent game by
the sound of lit Set in Japan, you take the
part of Oolong who is attempting to
become a Kung hi grandmaster in order
to honour the memory of his late, dear-
departed father. Success depends on
mastering the technique of  the 16
different kicks and punches. You've got
10 opponents to beat and when you've
knocked out  Blues, the  resident
Grandmaster then the title is yours.
There are two imminent CM releases
from Oc e a n. Gr e e n B e r e t, a
contemporary war drama from Konami —
makers of coin-op arcade games — is due
for release in May at 0.95. There is also to
be a computer game based on that good
ol superhero Batman which is scheduled
for a May launch and will retail again at
£8.95.
For those who would rather have the
satisfaction o f  creating their own
programs without a lot of sweat, there is a
new Graphic Adventre Creator for the
C64/128 from Incentive Software. It is an
adventure generator with a  built in
graphics editor and Incentive claims that
it allows you to produce professional
adventures with ease and does not
require any knowledge of computer
programming. It's due for release on 1
May.
In the shops now should be Micro
Power's Doctor Who game, which has
been in the pipeline for many months.
The game contains about 130 screens and
has three different tunes to keep you
amused while you tackle the problems it
represents. One of these is, of course the
classic Doctor Who theme, the price —
01.95. Oh, and look out for the
programmable droid cat. The what?
If you want to be king of the gnomes,
or you just want to ﬁnd out a bit about the
intricacies of gnome culture then US
Gold's Time Tunnel might be the game for
you. You have been chosen as the next
gnome king but you need to complete the
inevitable tasks to prove your worth. An
ancient gnome manuscript has been
ripped up and scattered through the ages
by an evil cyclops — a weird mix of
Scandinavian and Greek folklore! When
you've got the seven pieces you can
perform the magic spell which will free all
the gnomes in the forests of Scandinavia
and allow you to become their supreme
leader. It's £6.95 on cassette and £14.95 on
disk.
Yet another well known hero has been
transferred to the big screen and thence
to the computer monitor. This time it's
Biggles and Mirrorsoft has acquired the
rights to produce the game of the ﬁlm
of the books. It should be out at the
beginning of May so budding air aces
watch Out for it.
Mind Games joins the Force
Moving from the air right down to
earth into the realms of the ludicrous you
come to a new release from Imagine
called Comic Bakery. You are Joe the
baker in charge of your high tech loaf
producing plant, and you must stop the
scavenging raccoon dogs eating all the
loaves. It's in the shops now at 0,95 on
cassette.
If you've always wanted to ﬁnd out
what it's like to be one of the boys in blue
in a city police force then maybe Mind
Games latest offering will give you some
idea of what it's like. Allegedly produced
in consultation with some of "Britain's top
policemen" it's a  complicatOI game
which requires you to keep law and order
without losing your popularity.
Impossible? Try it and see. It's £9.95 and
patrolling the streets now.
For C-16 owners there is now a version
of Elite's very popular title Commando.
Originally an arcade coin-op game it has
been available for the CM for some time.
Now C-16 users can have a taste of
excitement themselves.

Generally Speaking
A plug-in adaptor to get rid of mains
interference is now available from
Duraplug. It ﬁts directly into a standard
socket and provides a  continuous
laundering of the electrical supply to a
plugged in appliance.
Computers are apt to suffer from
voltage surges and the adaptor will clean
this up so that your printer won't print
weird gobbledegook.
It's available from high street shops for
E17.90.
Another o f  the smaller software
houses in this country has joined together
with one of the big boys to make
distribution faster and more reliable.
English Software has signed a n
agreement with US Gold to make the
American ﬁrm and sole distributor of
English Software's new products. If you've
ever had any trouble getting hold of the
latest English Software then perhaps it will
be easier from now on.
If you live in London or you come to
town to do the occasional bit of shopping
or business then you might like to pay a
visit t o  the Commodore centre a t
Gultronic in Tottenham Court Road.
Gultronic decided to open the centre
to meet a  growing demand f or
Commodore products. Gultronic's Sam
Tulsiani said: "The Christmas season was
very buoyant this year and our major
problems were supply and not demand.
Commodore products are of a  high
standard with a  good range and the
company is stable, that is why we decided
to invest in the centre,"
The Commodore holiday otter
He continued: " W e  are convinced
there is  a  g o o d  fu tu re  i n  t h e  h o me
computer market as long as people put
themselves behind the products.
Following last month's mention of
CRCs new label we now have some more
information on the subject. A company
spokesman said: "Nu Wave has been
developed for the computer user who has
grown tired of the traditional arcade
game and adventure game and is looking
for a  refrotshing altenative, We  are
conﬁdent that Nu Wave will make a great
impact on the software market in 19136."
There are no Commodore programs
available on the Nu Wave label at the
moment but look out for it in the near
future.

Miracle Technology has just launched the

The cost of the new modem is 198.50
(1116.15 including VAT and UK delivery).
Commodore is  running another
holiday offer with purchases of new
computers. The  Commodore 64
compendium and the new 128 are just two
products which come complete with up
to E250 off a holiday for two.
The offer is valid on a full range of
Commodore peripherals including the 64
Compendium, Commodore 128, disk
drives, monitors and printers.
Each product contains ﬁve B O
vouchers which are redeemable against a
variety of holiday from leading tour
operators from Club 18-30 to CTC cruises.
Commodore's Chris Kaday said: "Our
unique holiday offer last year was an
enormous success, s o 'Passport t o
Pleasure' is really a variation on a proven
theme. Our  retailers are absolutely
delighted and so, we believe, are our
customers. It just goes to show what a little
imagination and creativity can do in a so-
called shrinking market."
The vouchers are valid on any holiday
taken before the end of October 1987.

When you are designing a game one of the longest jobs is de-
signing the sprites. If you are good at art then ﬁne, if not your
next monster will probably end up looking like a square box
with legs,
Now, Your Commodore comes to the rescue once again
with Sprite Ideas. If you have designed any sprites for games
and you don't mind other people seeing your masterworks
then why not send them into us. Each month we will be offering
CIO for the best entries.
Your sprites can be anything at all (within reason), if you've
designed a series of animated characters then send in the lot.
We'd love to have a look at them.
So, next time you are after an Ogre to put in your new game,
have a look in this section of the magazine and you may ﬁnd
just what you are looking for.

OF.-
'Alien Webb comes to]
the rescue of buddingi
l
programmers.
IN N O  SHORT ADVENTURE
series last year. I suggested a
number o f  ways o f  saving
memor y  w h e n  w r i t i n g
adventures. in this article, I will
describe some machine code
routines which will actually do
the job for you. Since each
routine requires a set of data
tables. I  have written three
editors in Bask which will allow
you t o  create the necessary
data bases.
There are three areas for
real saving:
1. The interpretor
2. The storage of text
3, The storage of objects
In order to offer the largest
possible portion of RAM for
Basic, I  have used the area
behind t h e  Ftarvis. T h e
memory map of the system,
assuming that you use an three
routines, is:
$8600-$95FF O b j e c t

SE000-SFFFF H i g h  text area.
Using this system, you have
the following capabilities and
limitations:
32255 bytes for Basic useage.
1536 bytes (SC500-SCAFFl for
other purposes_
Up to:
255 verbs
255 nouns
63 link words
255 objects i n  any  o f  255
locations
16382 bytes for use for up to 512
messages or descriptions
Whilst this may not be up to
the Q u ilr s  standards, it's
enough for quite a signiﬁcant
adventure.
The editor s  u s e  t hr ee
machine code routines for the
loading and saving o f  data
blocks. These ar e included
with the other machine code in
Loader 1. I'v e k ept the six
blocks of code separate so that
you can omit the utilities at a
later date. If you choose to use
them in your ﬁnal adventure
(certainly SAVE and LOAD),
they oc c upy  s pare space
between the ROMs which is
low in memory so that they
don't interfere with the main
code. d is c u s s  these utilities
later.
The interpretor is similar to
the one in my earlier series but
has been rewritten so as to be
more compact. It is called by a
simple SYS 49152,X,Y_ The
prompt for input will start at
co-ordinates X  and Y.  The
interpretor will accept up to 79
characters a n d  d e le t e  i s
available to correct your input.
The text is scanned to extract

the ﬁrst, second and last words.
The ﬁrst is called the verb, the
second the link word and the
last the noun. Here are some
examples:
These words are checked in
the vocabulary and you are told
if any are not recognised. The
positions of found words in the
vocabulary ar e returned i n
three registers and an error
register tells you if the search
has s hown a n y  unk now n
words. These registers are:
Verb register —40711
Noun register —40712
Link word register — 40713
Error register — 40714 ( n o
error, 2 5 5 -
When using the interpretor,
the error register allows you to
loop back for a new command
if the last one is not under-
stood. The example program
given later shows this.
In o r d e r  t o  ﬁt  t h e
interpretor in t o  y our  o w n
colour scheme, location 40705
holds the colour of the prompt
and 40706 holds the colour of
the input command.
Listing 1 gives an editor for
the creation of a vocabulary.
The editor is menu driven and
the functions allow y ou t o
create, alter, load and save the
vocabulary. There is also an
option which allows you to test
the interpretor and get to know
its operation. The main thing to
remember is to erase the tables
if you plan t o create a new
vocabulary. Whilst the editor
will accept words of any length,
only the ﬁrst four characters
are used. Words shorter than
four letters are padded with
spaces.
One o f  t h e  b ig g e s t
consumers of memory is text.
Clever companies such as Level
9 use data compression to ﬁt
more in. I will content myself
with simply using "unused"
RAM. The code provides two
commands:
SYS 51456,MN
prints message number M N
from the area behind the Basic
ROM (the lower text area).

performsa similar function on
text stored behind the Kernal
ROM (the upper text area).
The start addresses of the
messages are kept i n  t w o
tables. The function o f  the
editor in Listing 2 allows you to
create the text and sets up the
tables accordingly.
In order to allow you to
store messages of any length,
up t o  a  maximum o f  255
characters, the editor does not
allow you to edit text that has
been entered. I  therefore
strongly recommend that you
write down your text before
creating the text data base. And
enter it with carel
Again, menus are used to
aid editing. The editor acts
mainly on the lower text area, if
you wish to create a database in
the upper text area, commands
are provided which convert a
lower area ﬁle to an upper area
ﬁle. Again, you may save and
load text but in this case two
tiles are saved: The text ﬁle and
the table ﬁle
The table ﬁle has the same
name as the text ﬁle but is
sufﬁxed by .T. For example:
Textﬁle name -- WOMBAT
Tableﬁle name VVC)MBKI.T
Obviously t h e ﬁles are
loaded to different addresses.
If you use the loader provided,
the start addresses are:
Low area - -  text address =
40960, table address = 51968.
High area - -  text address =
57344, table address = 52480.
You can include colour
changes or control codes into
text by pressing the corres-
ponding CTRL or ClillsA key
combinations when entering
text Before creation of new
text ﬁles, don't forget to use the
erase option.
Finally , what do we do with
objects? In any adventure you
need to know where objects
are kept so you can take, drop
or look at them. Two setS of
data are saved by the editor in
Listing 3.
First there is a  table of
object names. Each can be up
to 16 characters long. A second
table keeps a record of the
location of  the objects (this
table starts at 50176).
The machine code lists the
items held at a speciﬁc location
and has the syntax:
SYS 49920,10
where L O  i s  t h e location
concerned. Each  i t e m  i s

10 PRINT "YOU CAN SEE:"
20 SYS 49920,LO
printed on a new line so you
must allow for  this in  your
screen format. This option can
equally be used for inventory
or look commands.
To perform Inventory, you
then use:
10 PRINT "YOU'RE CARRYING:
20 SYS 49920,255
I have assumed that location
255 refers to possessed objects_
To perform Look, use:
Here, L O  i s  t h e  loc ation
number.
To check whether an object
is a v a ila b le  f o r  t a k in g ,
dropping, ex amining e t c ,
simply PEEK the relevant entry
for the object in the position
table.
As with the text editor, the
object data base is saved as two
ﬁles: the object table and the
position table. As before, the
position table has the same
name, albeit sufﬁxed by .T.
The Save and Load routines
given earlier may well be of
value in your own programs.
The Save transfers the block of
memory fr om SA t o  FA t o
device DE and has the syntax:
SYS 50688 Filename,DE,2,SA,FA
The L o a d  r o u t i n e  i s
extemely handy. You will know
that if you use LOAD with a
secondary address of one (to
force a relocated load) that the
program reruns. T h e  Load
allows you to load a block of
data to any speciﬁed address
SA and does not try to rerun
your program, The syntax is:
SYS 679,File name,DE,SA
Study the example program
which shows the use of the
three sets of routines.
The routine assumes the
following:
1. The verbs Take, Look, Inven-
tory and Drop occupy the ﬁrst
four positions in the verb table
i.e. Take = 1, Look = 2 etc.
2. There is an object e.g. a
sword, in the noun table.
3. The object speciﬁed in 2 is in
location 1.
4, The location descriptions
start at message 0 in the lower
text area.
5. All possessed items are in
location 255,

The important features of
the example are:
Line 10 -  protects the data
bases.
Lines 20-46 -  Load the data
bases.
Line 50 -  Sets up the colours
and the location number (L0).
Line 55 - Tells you where you
are i.e. performs LOOK.
Line 60 - Requests a command
Line 70 - Checks for an unrec-
ognised command and clears
ihe command area o f  t h e
screen prior to requesting a
new command.
Line 80- Extracts the key words.
Note that the noun number
must be decremented to be
compatible w ith t h e  object
routine. (Nouns are numbered
from 1 to 255 and objects from 0
to 254)
Line 90 - Performs verb
Note how  the Take and
Drop c ommands  s i m p l y
change t h e  objec t position
table. Location 50163 is an error
ﬂag for the object routine. If it
contains 255, then it means that
nothing was found (see lines
170 and 210).
I hope this example will
show h o w  s im p le  t h e s e
routines are to use and how
compact routines become.

1. Before starting work with an
editor and after using another
editor:
Save your latest database
Reset the machine with SYS
64738
Load the machine code
2. Regularly save your data
base.
3. Work out what the database
will contain before starting
work.
If y ou have any queries,
study the editors, you should
be able to sort them out. If you
have any real problems, you

Joe •choist
continues h cr ies
with a Sound
Synthesiser for the C-
16 and Pius/4.
SOME TIME AGO, IN MY ART-
icle on sound, I promised to
explain how to simulate the
attack, decay, sustain a n d
release functions of a sound
synthesiser. At  last, tweeked
and tuned up to perfection, I
proudly present The Sound
Synthesiser which incorporates
not only these functions, but
also a host of other facilities
including a  second channel,
rests, hand claps, a sound com-
piler and a waveform editor.
I shall start by explaining the
similarities t o  t h e  PLAY
command presented i n  t he
article o n  sound (December
1985.) Like the PLAY command
it is interrupt driven, meaning
that the tune can be playing
while the computer is engaged
in some other task, playing a
game or editing a waveform for
instance. It plays the tune by
reading along a list of numbers
held in memory which contain
the pitch and duration of each
note, in the sequence that the
notes will follow. Commands
such as volume, go to chorus,
return and turn tune off can
also be included in the list.
Pitch values for  a  range o f
musical notes are given i n
Appendix D of the C-16 User
Manual on page 173.
Now for  the differences.
The main feature is  WAVE-
FORM SOUND. I t  works by
continuously alter ing t h e
volume of the note once every
1/50th of a second from a list
stored in memory. When each
new note is played, the synth-
esiser starts at the beginning of
the table setting the volume to
the ﬁrst number. A 1/50th of a
second later the synthesiser
reads the next byte along the
list and adjusts the volume to
that number . T he process
continues for the duration of
the note until a new note is
played, changing the volume
of the note from t he very
beginning all the way through
until it  dies away; when the
process repeats itself. The list
lirogramming
The C
can b e  stored anywhere in
memory, although the table
must begin at an address which
is a multiple of 256 and must be
256 bytes long.
As the volume is  in the
range zero to eight, only nine
different volume settings are
allowed. I t  is  still possible,
however, t o  mak e a  very
convincing env elope w it h
attack, dec ay  sustain a n d
release as shown in the diagram
below. The attack part of the
waveform covers the rise in
volume f r om z ero t o  peak
value. The fall in volume after
the peak is called the decay.
The midrange volume is called
the sustain level and the ﬁnal
fall in vblume from sustain to
zero is called the release.
The parameters attack,
decay, sustain and release can
be applied to any sound. Con-
17
sider the sound of a piano for
instance. When the string is
ﬁrst struck by the hammer, the
volume o f  the note quickly
rises to peak level, therefore its
attack rate is quite high. The
volume then quickly falls to a
lower value signifying a high
decay rate and then sustains at
this level for a while before
dying away fairly slowly, which
means it has a low release rate.
The sound of a clarinet or other
woodwind instrument is very
different however. In this case
the volume of the note rises
slowly to peak value meaning it
has a  low  attack rate. The
volume then sustains for the
remainder of the note and is
followed by a rapid release.
The Sound Synthesiser
allows more than one wave-
form to be in memory at the
same time and also has the
facility t o  switch fr om one
waveform to another while the
tune is being played thus sim-
ulating different instruments.
Memory has been set aside for
two waveforms, although more
can b e  accommodated b y
raising the start of the Basic
area or lowering the top of this
area to create extra space for
waveform sound (as explained
in the September 1985 issue of
Your Commodore). Lowering
the top of Basic by 1K would
reserve enough space for four
more waveforms. A waveform
editor program and a demon-
stration waveform have also
been included.
The other main difference
between this program and the
PLAY command is the facility to
play tunes using both channels,
This enables harmonies and
backings t o  be put into the

tune, ,uong with such sounds as
hand claps and steam trains if
channel two is set to noise!
Channel one still sets the pace
of the tune, with the backing
note i n  channel t w o  being
changed a t  various points
along the tune. This will be
demonstrated in a tune called
Joe's theme (I) later on.
As well as playing backing
notes channel two can add a
chorus effect to the sound. This
is done by taking the pitch of
the note in channel one and
playing exactly the same pitch
in channel two but with a small
constant value added t o the
pitch. This has the effect of two
notes in 'harmony' by using an
effect known as beating. This
effect was used to play God
Save the Queen in demo one of
my article on graphics modes
published in the March 1986
issue. A command to create this
effect i s  prov ided i n  t h e
synthesiser. Channel two also
has the facility for turning itself
off automatically a preset time
after it is turned on instead of
carrying o n  indeﬁnitely  -
useful for hand claps, etc.
The other addition to the
PLAY command is the facility
for rests and pauses. In the
PLAY c ommand a l l  notes
tended to merge together and
there was no facility for pausing
the tune for  rests etc. The
Synthesiser allows the tune to
pause for 1/50th second right
up to 20 minutes. It also allows
the second (backing) channel
to either continue while the
ﬁrst channel pauses or for both
channels to be turned off for
the duration of the pause with
the backing being turned on
again after the pause.
The Synthesiser
The new assembly language is
shown in Figure 2, If you wish
to type it straight in use my
'C-16 Assembler' published in
the June 1985 issue of Your
Commodore. To date this is the
only text assembler available
for the C-16. If you don't have
the assembler, the machine
code is shown in DATA state-
ments in  Figure 3  complete
with a  suitable loader. The
synthesiser c o d e  starts a t
address 4096 ($1000 hex) and
occupies 512 bytes. The start of
Basic s hould therefore b e
moved up before loading the
assembler o r  t h e  machine
code. If the start of Basic is

compiler eliminates the need
for any of this. GOSUBs and
GOTOs are made much easier
by the use of labels. The letters
LA signify that a  label is to
follow and the label follows
directly after  a  separating
comma. Up to 50 labels can be
used, which should be enough
for even the longest tune. If
more are required however,
change the number inside the
DIM statement in line 45010 to
the desired value. Also, instead
of having to quote the number
of the command you want, e.g.
252 for volume, you simply
write V O  followed b y  t he
volume number. The compiler,
when run, will translate the VO
into 252. Finally there should
be an END instruction. A n

demonstrations include such
immortal classics as the Saints,

in fact these tunes do to music
what R o lf  Harris's Picture

shift/P will start the synthesiser
playing a t  t h e  beginning,
assuming the synthesiser and
tune are stored at the normal
positions. I f  t h e y  a r e  a t

values of the ﬁrst two POKEs

accordingly.
If a tune is stored which
turns on waveform sound, but
does not select a  particular
waveform, the synthesiser will
use the waveform which is
being edited at the time -
hence any  change i n  t h e
waveform will have an immed-
iate effect and you can set it up
by ear!

Other Commands
Pressing shift/X at any time will
turn off the tune.
Pressing shift/R will restart the
program enabling y o u  t o
change waveforms.
Pressing Q will quit the editor
when you are satisﬁed with the
waveform. This also sets the last
16 bytes of the waveform to the
last value at the end of page
three.
Shift W  (wipe) w ill set the
volume of all values to the right

use the same format. When you
log on to a particular Board, it
will tell you if this function is
available and in what format.
Getting it all in
There are nine different parts
to the Telecom program. Enter
all parts separately and save on
to disk or tape. If you are using
tape then you do not need the
boot generator program also, if
you are using tape make sure
that you make all the changes
as indicated i n  t h e  R EM
statements. Cassette users
should save t h e programs
COMMS GEN1 t o  5 on the
same cassette one after the
other.
When you have entered
and SAVEd all parts then LOAD
and RUN the BASIC MOVE
program.
Now L O A D  ' C O M M S
GEN1' and RUN. This will auto-
matically LOAD in parts 2 to 5 as
needed. I f  you a re  using
cassette then place a  new
cassette in the unit as soon as
part 5  has ﬁnished loading.
When 'COMMS GEN5' has
ﬁnished LOADing it will SAVE
1TELCOM/v1' to tape or disk.
Next switch off and on your
machine and LOAD 'COMMS
GEN6' and RUN. This will
LOAD part 7 when needed.
Cassette users should place the
cassette t h a t  co n t ai n s
1TELCOM/V1 in the unit as
soon as part 7 has loaded. Part 7
will SAVE '2TELCOM/v1 t o
tape or disk when ﬁnished.
You should now have two
programs 1TELCOM/V1' and
'2TELCOM/V1' these are the
complete program. In future if
you want to use the program
simply type:
LOAD "1TELCOM/V1",8,1
LOAD "2TELCOM/V1",8,1
SYS 52224
and the program will start. If
you are using tape then change
the ,8,1 in the above lines to
Disk users have the added
advantage o f  an auto boot
program. LOAD and RUN the
BOOT GENERATOR program
and COMMS BOOT will be
saved to your disk. In future to
use the program type LOAD
"COMMS B O O T
program will auto run.

AS PROMISED, THIS MONTHS
exiting installment concerns
the FLY and BIRD. These two
routines are very similar and
therefore it will sufﬁce to ex-
plain just one in  detail. As
usual, the ﬁrst step is to insert
calls to the routines in the main
loop at the start. Lines 1540 and
12550 do this.
The ﬁrst two lines check
whether the ﬂy has started to
move yet. If not (FLYMOVE = 0)
a branch is made to GETFLY,
which we will come to later.
FLYXL0 the ﬂy's X position (low
byte), is stored in S I N K  (X
position of sprite number six).
The next nine lines check
LYXHI, the X position's high
bit, and either set or reset bit six
of SD010 (most signiﬁcant bit ot
the sprite's X co-ordinate).
Stored at $DOOD is 108, the
ﬂy's Y co-ordinate, which does
not alter (our ﬂy hasn't heard of
wind currents yet!).
The ﬂy has two frames of
animation stored a t  sprite
deﬁnitions 2 1 9  a n d  220.
WINGF1Y is a variable which
alternates i n  value between
zero and one. Depending on
this value either 219 or 220 is
stored in $07FE (sprite six deﬁn-
ition pointer). Following this,
WINGFLY is 'Exclusive Or'ed
with one to reverse the value.
The nex t 1 5  lines  a r e
concerned w it h  t h e  ﬂy's
movements. FLYDEL, as its
name suggests, i s  a  delay
counter. When it reaches zero,
the ﬂy's speed, FLYSPD, is
restored into FLYDEL ready for
the next time. Next the X co-
ordinate is reduced by one. If it
is equal to 255 then the ﬂy has
either just come o n  t o  the
screen or gone off it. The high
bit o f  the X  co-ordinate is
decreased and if the value is
not negative then the ﬂy is on
the right side of the screen and
nothing needs to be done. If,
however, it is negative, then
the ﬂy has gone off the left side
of the screen and so the high
bit is increased up to one again,
ready for its next appearance,
and FLYMOVE is reset to zero.
Daryl Bowers adds I
birds and ﬂies to the
hazards which our
little frog must face.

The latest section is only
called if  the ﬂy has not yet

contains the position of  the
current value in the random
number table RANDTAB, and if
FLYDEL has reached zero then
this value is checked to see if it
is positive o r  negative. A
negative number indicates that

If the value is one, however, we
store a one in FLYMOVE to start
the ﬂy moving again.

W e e k e n d  B r e a k
We sent our roving reporter,
Marie Curry, on a
Commodore computer
weekend. Here's her reaction.
AS ONE O F  THOSE UNFORTUNATE
people whos e education was woefully
lacking when it comes to the computer
revolution, I reached the stage where I
began to feel that I should not let the
march of technology just stompt right
over me. I then heard about computer
weekends r un b y  a  company called
Ardmore Adventure — better known for
its involvement i n  children's activity
camps. I signed up for a weekend at the
Crest Hotel in High Wycombe and it was
with no small amount of trepidation that I
set off to attend on a freezing cold Friday
in February.
The actual course begins on Saturday
morning, but I decided to go on the Friday
in order to get my bearings and to meet
some o f  the people w ho have the
mammoth task of organising the weekend
breaks. All the equipment must be set up
in advance and, of course, it has to be
shipped i n  since Crest Hotels aren't
normally p r o v id e d  w i t h  e n o u g h
Commodore computers to keep 50 micro
enthusiasts happy for 48 hours.
The aims of the course are simple. You
should attend with the intention of doing
exactly as you please as long as it's
connected with computers. If you want to
tackle adv anc ed m a c h i n e  c o d e
programming then there'll be somebody
there to help you. Alternatively, if you're
completely computer illiterate, like me,
then you can start on the absolute basics
of Basic and work your way up.
The whole weekend package includes
accommodation and meals but if  you
don't want to stay at the hotel and mix
with your fellow victims outside of study
hours then you can go somewhere else
and pay only the tuition fee.
I decided tog° for the all-singing, all-
dancing, meals and microchips inclusive
version — and I wasn't disappointed.
The Surroundings
I spent a very pleasant two days in the
Crest Hotel i n  High Wycombe. The
ac c ommodation w a s  c l e a n  a n d
comfortable and the service was fast and
efﬁcient, executed with a lavish amount
of goodwill. During a sub-zero February
weekend (you remember those!) there
wasn't so much as a hint of a draught.
The course was exceedingly hard work
and after a whole days brain drain it was
nice to know that there was a decent meal
waiting and a good night's sleep.
Two sizeable rooms had been set aside
to accommodate the huge amounts of
BASIC TRAINING
electronic equipment which had been
bought in to cope with the large numbers
of 'students' who were attending that
weekend. One room was allocated to the
under 14s and the other was for the more
mature students. By Saturday morning the
jumble of wires, polystyrene cardboard
and plastic which had infested the rooms
on Friday evening had been transformed
into a very spruce looking set-up with
Commodore 64s and 128s adorning tables
around the walls.
In the lobby  outside there was a
plentiful supply of tea, coffee, biscuits and
orange squash for those who fell by the
wayside and had to have a break for
resuscitation. There was a morning break
for coffee and an afternoon break for tea,
just lik e those long ago playtimes at
school. These were quite productive in
themselves as everyone was able to get to
know each other and compare notes.
The Mentors
You may possibly have heard of Ardmore
Adventure befor e reading this article,
since for some time the company has
been involved i n  running children's
adventure holidays.
The ﬁrst computer weekend was held
in April 1955 and more have been run at
regular intervals since then. Ardmore had
realised — through contact with parents
— that many adults were uneasy with
computers and suffered from that disease
which is common among those of us who
are no longer teenagers— tech nophobia.
It must be very frustrating for parents with
school age children to realise that there is
one homework subject on which they can
give absolutely no useful advice at all.
The weekend I attended was graced
with six exceptionally gifted Ardmore
staff who come from a variety of walks of
life and dedicate their weekends to the
alleviation of the sufferings of those who
are less hi-tech than themselves.
Doug Gregory, who is a teacher by
trade, oversees operations, and he is ably
assisted b y  Eric Doy le —  computer
jo u r n a lis t ,  p h o t o g r a p h e r  a n d
experienced programmer. Paul and
Keith, both college students studying
computer related subjects, take the junior
class (commonly referred to by Ardmore
staff as the advanced group!). Beginners,
like myself, are assisted by Lee, who i5 also
involved in education in his other life and
John who claims to be an estate agent
from Monday to Friday. As I said, a mixed
bunch but a very well chosen and able
group of advisors. The course was running
at maximum the weekend I attended but
no matter how few pupils sign up there
will never be less than two staff.
As I  mentioned earlier, when the
course begins you are told that you can
really do as you please. This is the only
rule which must be adhered to at all times.
With such a  diverse mixture o f  staff
available, there is always someone who
can advise you on any subject under the
Commodore sun. I began on Saturday
morning as an absolute beginner and I
like to think that by Sunday evening I was
no longer exactly that.
The Enthusiasts
The weekends attract a n  incredible
variety of people and the one which I
attended was especially diverse since
many of those present had actually won
their weekend break in a Commodore

W e e k e n d  B r e a k
spot the ball competition (yes, people do
actually win them!).
What I found most surprising was that
there were people present who had never
even touched a computer in their lives
before — even I have a certain amount of
hands-on experience.
These particular individuals were
usually those who wanted to ﬁnd out a bit
about c omputer s  b e f o r e  ac tually
investing their hard earned money in one.
It seems to me an eminently sensible idea
since if you don't know the difference
between hardware and software and
you've never even seen a disk drive then
the task o f  choosing and purchasing a
computer from the enormous variety at
present available o n  t h e  market is
daunting at best and terrifying at worst.
At the other end of the spectrum were
those who owned CFAs, knew their way
around the keyboard fairly well, had a
The Curriculum
The course has  n o  strictly for mal
structure. Probably the best way to give
you some sort o f  idea about what is
available is if I detail how my teaching was
arranged and what I was able to get out of
It.
It would be impossible to have an
inﬂexible curriculum since the organisers
have no idea what sort of span of abilities
they wil be dealing with, in terms of
micro-knowledge, until everyone turns
up on the ﬁrst day.
The initial task for  everyone is t o
declare themselves an absolute beginner
or otherwise. I was the former and so I was
treated to a well planned and instructive
two hour tutorial on Basic. I was sharing a
C64 with a brilliant fellow illiterate called
Letty and together w e  managed t o
progress through our tutorial sheets in
leaps and bounds.
grasp of Basic, possibly a smattering of
machine code and had come to a sort of
halt in their self-teaching programme. The
weekend for these types, regarded by
myself as t h e  bofﬁns o f  the group,
provided t h e  consolidation o f  their
knowledge and the pointers they needed
to set them leaping ahead once more.
I have been involved in the computer
industry f o r  s o me  t i m e  a n d  t h e
individuality of those I come into contact
with has never ceased to amaze me. A
policeman, a lady who runs an aquatic
garden centre and an animal nutritionist
were just three of the people who were
thrown together for  a  weekend with
nothing in common bar an interest in
computers. If you were to deal with the
weekend merely i n  human terms, i t
provided a chance to associate with some
very interesting and intelligent people
but of course there was much more to it
than that. The most important part is still
to come.
These sheets were compiled by Doug
Gregory and are concise and very well
structured. They deal with Basic in simple
steps giv ing practical exercises f o r
illustration. Fundamentally, the sheets are
designed to make you feel at home with
the computer and also with very simple
Basic. They also serve to enable you to
become familiar with the 64 which is very
important when so many people feel
nervous w h e n  c onfr onted w i t h  a
computer keyboard.
After about 90 minutes my partner and
I had managed to write and run a simple
maths program for  testing arithmetic.
When we typed it in and it ran ﬁrst time
we felt like geniuses. The greatest asset of
the course is that if you do get stuck then
there is always someone within shouting
distance who will be at your elbow in a
few seconds to sort out your problems.
This saves mu c h  por ing ov er  h o t
keyboards a n d  muc h sweating ov er

After a sumptuous lunch we returned
for more intellectual stimulus and found
that we were about to be introduced to
Logo.
Logo is a language which is often used
in schools to teach young children the
type of logical thought which is necessary
when working with computers. Logo is
very simple to learn as a concept and I
found that I was soon guiding my turtle
around the screen and happily deﬁning
my own commands. I began to feel very
self-conﬁdent about using it  and for
someone who has very little experience, it
is a useful tool, although after about an
hour I began to feel rightly or wrongly —
that its uses are very limited. My fellow
sufferers also seemed to be getting the
hang of it fairly well, although whether
this was due to the graphic human turtle
demonstration w it h  whic h t h e  class
kicked off will probably never be known!
When you felt that things were getting
perhaps just a little bit tedious, one word
would s ee y o u  whis k ed away  t o
something d if f e r e n t  b u t  e q u a lly
instructive. During the afternoon period
my fellow students became re-involved in
Basic, learnt t h e  wonders o f  music
programs on the 64 of just had a quick go
at Impossible Mission for some not so
light relief.
While I was becoming immersed in
Basic and Logo, the two other groups
were in session. The children's section of
the course was held in a next door room
and I presume that it was sound-proofed
in some way as hardly a murmur was
heard from that vicinity all weekend.
Most of the under 14s had a vast amount
more experience of computers than their
adult counterparts and were perfectly at
home with the electronic beasties. They
too could come and go as they pleased to
a certain extent although supervision was
such that parents had no worries about
the welfare of their offspring.
The advanced gr oup, under  t h e
guidance of Eric Doyle, were learning
more about machine code and having a
look a t  s o m e  m o r e  c omplic ated
programs. Many of them bought their
own programming problems with them
and these were dealt with in due course so
that they were able to go home at the end
of t h e  weekend w it h t h e  necessary
knowledge t o continue their machine
code masterpieces.
Sunday was not a day of rest It was
dedicated t o  the teaching —  in  the
beginners group — of the use of Easy
Script, Commodore's word processing
package. This may sound a little odd, to
devote a whole day to the use of a word
processor, but I think there was a lot of
sense behind this. Many of those present
were looking into the possibility of buying
a computer to help them with either their
own small businesses or  merely their
domestic administration. Using a word
processor shows you very quickly and
simply what can be done with very little

knowledge and illustrates the power of
the many  software utilities packages
which are available at the moment for the
64 and hopefully in the fairly near future
for the CUB.
By the time we ﬁnished for tea on
Sunday evening I knew that I would be
able to return to the ofﬁce and impress
everyone with my technical knowledge
which h a d  deﬁnitely increased o n e
hundredfold s inc e I  le f t  o n  Friday
afternoon.

To he honest, it is very difﬁcult to ﬁnd
any speciﬁc criticisms about the weekend.
Perhaps a  little t oo muc h time was
devoted to Logo but then I could have
stopped doing that and gone on to an
alternative occupation if I had been really
bored. I would have liked to improve my
handling of Basic a little more but it was
only lack of time that prevented me from
doing so.
As a weekend with a difference, it's
very enjoyable. A n d  as  a  course i n
computing it's very instructive. I f  you
have a couple of days to spare and you
want t o  us e them constructively. I
thoroughly recommend a  computer
weekend. Mind you, I'd used my brain so
much that I had a lot of difﬁculty getting
back to the grind on Monday!

YET ANOTHER PRINCESS IS IN NEED OF
rescue. Using all your Kung Fu skills, you
must battle your way through ﬁve ﬂoors
of the wizard's temple in order to rescue
her. As is only to be expected, the wizard
has arranged a welcoming committee for
you to try and ensure that you don't
succeed in your quest.
Control of your character is simplicity
itself. Leaving the joystick button alone,
you can move left and right, jump and
duck. Holding the ﬁre button down puts
you into an offensive mode and you can
now aim kicks left and right as well as
performing a  jumping kick and a
squatting kick. If you press the space bar
this toggles the action between kicking
and punching left and right, jumping and
squatting punches.
Timing is the essence of successful
squat. Judging your punch or kick cor-
rectly and your opponent will crumple
instantly, to the accompanying sound of a
very realistic "thwack
nice things about this game is that you can
get away with mistiming a few blows. If
that happens, an opponent will attempt to
grapple with you. You can break his
yrasp by waggling your joystick furiously.
There is of course a price to be paid for
your error of timing. This is in the form of
loss of energy. In the top left hand corner
of the screen are two bars representing
energy levels for you and your adversary.
Should your energy drop to zero, you lose
one of the three lives.
Each level must be completed within a
certain time limit. A clock starts off at two
thousand and quickly counts down
towards zero. Failure to reach the stairs at
the end of the time limit again results in
the loss of a life. If you do reach the stairs
in time, you receive a bonus based on the
amount of time you. had left and the
amount of energy. Score 40,000 points
and you gain an extra life. II you lose a life,
you must start that particular level from
scratch again but your clock and energy
bar are restored to full values.
Most of your opponents on the ﬁrst
level are henchmen who can be easily
despatched with a single kick or punch.
Occasionally, you will come across a man
throwing knives at you. These you must
duck under or jump over and then move
in close to dispose of your enemy. who
requires two blows to defeat him. At the
end of each level is a guardian. He may be
armed or simply vicious but one thing you
can b r e  of is that he is tough to beat
-

and it requires several blows before you
can get his energy level down to zero. If
you have killed all the baddies on a
particular level and then beaten the
guardian, you can reach the stairs and so
gain access to the next level. Starting a
new level gives you a chance to get your
breath back as well as resetting your clock
and energy bar.
Points are only awarded if you dispose
of your opponent cleanly i.e. you don't
have to wrestle to get him off. How much
you score depends on how many blows it
takes to kill them and what move you
used. Punches and ﬂying kicks score more
than ordinary kicks.
Your opponents on the second level
are of a totally different nature. Falling
balls and vases contain snakes and
dragons and mystic globes explode
around you. Falling objects can be
destroyed with jumping kicks or you may
prefer to run out of the way of the
dragon's ﬁery breath. Snakes can't be
killed but must be jumped over. Dwarves
also appear who, given the chance, like to
somersault on to your back and sap your
energy.
The next levels introduce the only
other kind of nasty to be met in the game -
killer bees. These can be killed with a
single kick or punch. The baddies start to
appear in combinations now and you will
need very fast reactions if you are to
succeed.
Kung-Fu Master is  a n addictive,
enjoyable game to play. A lot of this is due
to the fact that it's easy to get into and I
can see it as the sort of game people will
load in for a quick half hour of mindless
violence. The graphics are colourful
although quite chunky. All this to the
accompaniment of a relentless tune and
good sound effects.

HELLO AGAIN, READY FOR YOUR NEXT
dose o f  ecstasy? Well, last month's
homework was pretty simple, wasn't it?
Question one really followed on from
the simple example in the last part. It
simply writes CAT in white letters in the
top left hand corner of the screen. It won't
take much looking, however, for you to
notice that it's a rather poorly written
routine. By  the end o f  this month's
episode you'll be able to write it in a much
slicker way.
Listing 1  shows the routine again
written using the format of the HYPA
Basic assembler (see Your Commodore
March issue). Lines 110 to 160 put the
"POKE" values of C, A and T on to the
screen. Lines 170 to 200 colour the letters
white.

notice any effect except for the border
turning purple. This is simply due to the
speed of the routine. If you repeatedly
call the routine as with the Basic line:
You will see a purple border with inter-
mittent lines.
Again, this is a messy bit of program-
ming. Let us consider a simple loop. In
Basic, you loop by testing a variable and
branching to a speciﬁed line. Machine
code uses a similar approach. Consider
Listing 4:

line 110 sets the Y register to the initial
value. Line 120 sets the border colour.
Line 130 increments the Y register and line
140 compares the Y register to four. If
thevalue of the Y register is not equal to
four then the code jumps to the label
LOOP and contirtues execution. When
the Y register contains four, the routine
ends. This is a much better routine than
40

assembles to two bytes. The ﬁrst byte is
the code for  CPY (ComPare Y). The
second byte holds the number of bytes
through which the program counter must
be adjusted to jump back to the label
LOOP (offset). I don't intend to go into
how the offset is calculated since most
assemblers and disassemblers deal with
the problem for you. CPY can be used in
three addressing modes:
Absolute, for example CPY $100
Immediate, for example CPY 2
Zero Page, for example CPY SEE
Naturally, there is  an equivalnent
command for the X register:
You will still ﬁnd that the routine is still
pretty fas t As is the case with many
applications, you may ﬁnd it necessary to
slow dow n machine code. A  crude
method is to use the NOP (No Operation)
instruction. T h is  ins tr uc tion does
absolutely nothing! Surprisingly enough,
it has some uses:
1) T o  deliberately introduce minute
delays to ﬁne tune timing.
2) To eliminate unnecessary code without
reassembling your code.
Perverts who write using an assembler
based in a machine code monitor will use
NOPs often since it's an easy way of
leaving space for additions to code. Try
stufﬁng a few NOPs in listing 4 between
lines 120 and 130 and see what happens.
last month I described the simplest
addressing modes. Whilst they are inval-
uable, their versatility is limited. The next
mode uses a simple indexing with the X or
Y register. Depending on the memory
locations position, this  acts in  either
absolute or zero page modes. Here are
some examples:
Absolute Y indexing LDA $1000,Y
Zero Page X indexing STA $0D,X
This m o d e  i s  q u it e  s imple t o
understand. The Y or X register acts as a
counter specifying an offset from the
speciﬁed address. The microprocessor
adds t h e  offset t o  t he address and
1

C 5 4
performs the instruction on the resulting
address. Consider the instruction:
STA 1024,Y
If the Y register contains 0, then the
accumulator will be stored in location
1024 (1024-1024). I f  t he Y  register
contains 1, the accumulator will be stored
in location 1025 and so on. It therefore
follows that we have a simple way of
performing actions on a row of locations
of up to 255 characters length (Y and X are
8 bit registers — remember?). This can be
used t o  rewrite program one o f  last
month's homework. Consider listing 5:
Listing 5

160 REM CPY E3
170 REM BNE LOOP
180 REM RTS
190 REM .TABLE: EB:3,1,20
200 REM I
Line 190 holds the "POKE" values of
CAT as a table of three bytes. We enter the
routine with Y containing zero. Durin
the ﬁrst pass, the accumulator is loaded
with the ﬁrst byte in the table (line 110)
and this is put in the top left hand corner
(line 120). The colour screen is set to white
(lines 130 and 140). The Y register is incre-
mented and loops back to process the
second letter, if its value is not equal to
three (line 160).
This, I hope you'll agree, is neater than
the original version. Whilst the size is not
greatly reduced, once you start writing
large routines you'll see the difference.
Before I move on to the next form of
addressing, how about a small diversion?
It won't take a lot of thought to spot that
Listing 5, or something similar, can be
used to print blocks of text. There are two
ways of printing text:
a) Direct moving of text as in Listing 5, or
b) Printing it in the same way as printing a
string in BASIC.
In the C64's ROMs are two useful
routines which can be readily used. First
we have a routine starting at location
SFED2. This acts in the same way as PRINT
CHRS(X). To use it you simply load the
Accumulator with the character to be
printed and call the routine. Rewriting
Listing 5, we get:
Listing 5
10 ASSEMBLE 90,1
90 REM *=$C000
100 REM LDY £0
HO REM .LOOP: LDA TABLE,Y
120 REM JSR SEID2
130 REM INY
140 REM CPY 13
150 REM BNE LOOP
160 REM RTS
170 REM .TABLE;SCAT
180 REM
This prints CAT at the current cursor
position in the current cursor colour. The
text is stored in line 170as ASCII codes and
we don't need to worry about updating
the c olour  matrix. T he JSR (Jump
SubRoutine) is the same as C O R A in
Basic.
We can simplify matters further, by
using a routine in the Basic ROM at
SAB1E. This prints a whole sentence for
you. Two requirements must be fulﬁlled:
i) The sentence must end with a zero byte.
ii) Before calling the routine, you must
load the Y register with the most signiﬁ-
cant byte of the start address of the
sentence, and the Accumulator with the
least signiﬁcant byte. Do I hear grunts of
confusion. OK, here's a quick tutorial.
Assume that the sentence starts at the
address SC010. This is stored as two bytes,
$CO and $10. The high byte, $CO, is called
the most signiﬁcant byte and the low byte,
$10, is the least signiﬁcant byte.
Here is our example again:
Listing 6
10 ASSEMBLE 90,1
90 REMs4C000
100 REM LDA f< TABLE
110 REM LDY E> TABLE
120 REM JSR SAME
130 REM WES
140 REM .MESSAGE: SCAT
150 REM fB:0
Lines 100 and 110 take care of loading
the message start address. f < means the
least signiﬁcant byte and f  t h e  most
signiﬁcant byte. Line 150 holds  t he
terminating zero byte. (try omitting it and
see what happensl)
We now have a very short, but rather
slow, routine. It's slow because it uses the
rather lengthy print routine in ROM. If
you want to write an adventure, use the
approach used in Listing 6. If you want to
write a fast game with ﬂicker free graphics
41
changes, direct data movement will be
necessary.
The ma in  drawback w it h  s imple
indexing is  that you specify the start
address in the object code and this can
only be changed by directly altering the
object code when the code is running. In
otherword, like rewriting a Basic program
while it's running. Whilst this is a perfectly
acceptable technique. I'm not that keen
on it. A better approach is to use an alter-
native indexed mode called Post-Indexed
Indirect Addressing. This is rather a grand
name for a fairly simple idea. In simple
indexed addressing, you will recall that
we speciﬁed the address concerned in the
mnemonics. eg:
LDA $1000Y
In Post-Indexed Indirect Addressing, we
store the address in a zero page location
and s pec ify  t h a t  address i n  t h e
mnemonics. Note that we use brackets to
signify this mode:
LDA ($EB),Y
The action of this instruction is to add
the offset kept in the Y register to the
address stored in the byte pair $FB and
load the accumulator with the contents of
the resulting address. The address is
stored with the low byte ﬁrst as usual.
Here is an example:
The equivalent instructions for:
LDA SC010,Y are:
LDA 1510
STA SEE]
LDA iSCO
STA SEC
LDA ($EB),Y
If Y contains live, the instruction adds
ﬁve t o  the address in  $FB, SEC giving
5C015. The accumulator is then loaded
with the contents of $C015.
Consider:
Listing 7
10 ASSEMBLE 90,1

Compare this to Listing 5. Lines 150 to
210 correspond exactly to lines 100 to 180
in Listing 5  (except for  the different
addressing of course). Lines 100 to 130 put
the start address of the message into the
zero page locations $FB and SEC.
Whilst this routine is more complex
than t he earlier versions, it  has one
powerful virtue - it is easier to change the
address processed. You should also notice
that this addressing mode uses the Y
register only.
I'm sorry that this may appear a little
complex, things should be clearer as we
deal with further examples in later parts of
the series. Here is a summary of  the
addressing modes described this time.

OK, agony time. Two problems for you
to consider.
1. Write a routine which draws a line of
stars along the top of the screen.
2. Wr ite a  routine whic h puts  t he
character set on the screen.
Next month I'll deal with one more
addressing mode and we'll move on to
more on looping and other mysteries.

Mastertronic is extremely well
known for production of cut
price software. N ot a  week
goes by without a large number
of Mastertronic's releases
being q u it e  h i g h  i n  t h e
s oftwar e c h a r t s .  W e l l .
Mastertronic is about to do it
again with a range of cut price
application software.
The ﬁrst venture into this
market is  the launch o f  Ski
Writer. This is a wordprocessor
that has been available in the
good old US of A for quite a
while and has received a large
amount o f  good public ity
becaue of its ease of use. The
price for this package over here
is a meagre 04.99.
So what does Ski Writer
offer? Well it's a full imple-
mentation of a wordprocessor
with enough features to suit
most p e o p le .  T h e r e  a r e
however a few items missing
that would have made this
package superb, but more of
this later.
Documentation
The manual for this package
could almost be described as
non-existent. I t  consists o f
three pages of  very small
printed instructions, the aim of
which is simply to tell you how
to load the package and what
keys do what.
Mastertronic says t h e
reason f o r  t h e  la c k  o f
documentation i s  that t h e
package is so easy to use that a
manual is not necessary. After
using the package for some
while I'm afraid that I  must
agree with them.
In Use
Upon loading the program you
are pr es ent ed w i t h  t h e
programs main menu. From
here you can select Edit, this
allows you to enter and alter
text. Preview allows you to see
how your text is going to look
on printed paper before you
attempt to print. Print will allow
you to check dot lines — more
about that later — change the
printer ty pe, change paper
type and print your document.
File gives you all of the ﬁle
manipulation commands such
as LOAD. SAVE and MERGE
together w it h  a  f e w  dis k
commands such as FORMAT.
Facilities to use disk or 'ape for
your documents is included.
One of the main reasons for
the ease of use of this program
is the very comprehensive help
function. Whenever you are in
text m o d e  h e l p  c a n  b e
obtained on all of the following
subjects;
New Users
Typing/editing
Formatting
Previewing
Printing
Cassette ﬁling
Disk ﬁling
All subjects are covered in
quite close detail so if you have
any confusion about a subject
then one o f  the help ﬁles
should make things clear.

example, when editing text the
bottom of the screen reads:
El HELP, F3 Edit Menu, STOP
Main Menu.
Selecting one o f  these w ill
move you on to another sub
menu. For example pressing F3
will display the following:
Find, Replace, Format, Mark
Copy and Cut.
As you can see everything is
always easy to ﬁnd and you
don't have to remember a lot of
functions. Anyway, back to the
dot commands.
The d o t  c o m m a n d s
available allow you to set up
the following:
The line spacing

serious omissions, one of these
is a word count and another is
the provision of headers and

number of words, as you would
when w r iting a  magazine

this cannot be done.
Verdict
Despite a small number of ﬂaws
you c an't really knock Ski
Writer at a price of £14.99 it is an
excellent buy. Not only is it
adequate for most tasks it is also
very easy to use, this is very
important.
If you are looking for your

is easy t o use you won't go

YOUR SPACECRAFT HAS BEEN
forced to crash land on the
planet Targ. Unfortunately you
soon ﬁnd out that the inhabi-
tants of the planet, the Palyars
and the Mechanoids, are at war
with each other. You are on
your own, apart from your
trusty computer, whatever you
do from now on is your choice,
though if you are lucky your
computer may advise you.
The main aim of the game is
to get yourself enough money
and experience to get another
spaceship and off the planet.
Mind you if you were feeling
up to it you could help one of
the waring factions out and
earn some money a s  a
mercenary. In fact when you
start you are given the option
of spending some of the money
that you have in your posses-
sion on a craft that belongs to a
player, they even offer you the

THE GNOME KING IS LOOK-
ing for a successor. In order to
opportunity of some work. Of
course it is up to you if you buy
the craft or not but it is a very
long walk around the planet if
you don't.
Most of the action in this
strange combination o f
adventure program and ﬂight
simulator, takes place over a
very large 3 D  landscape.
Buildings, bridges and other
craft are all extremely well
deﬁned using vector graphics,
as used on the arcade battle
zone game.
If you accept the Palyar's
offer of  employment as a
mercenary, you must ﬁnd
your way t o their brieﬁng

location so you should not
have too many problems
getting there. Did I  say no
problem? It took me quite a
few hours and many games to
ﬁnd the lift that would take me

prove yourself worthy, you
must travel through seven time
down into the Palyars complex.
The ﬂight simulation
element of the game comes
into play once you are in the
ship. The ﬂight simulation is
not exactly difﬁcult, you only
have a  speed indicator,
altimeter and compass, but it is
great fun especially if you ﬂy
close to the ground as you can
see the 3D buildings getting
larger as they come towards
you.Not all of the action for this
game takes place on the
surface of the planet. Some-
where in the city is a lift that will
take you down into an under-
ground complex. This section
of the game offers nothing
really thrilling. In fact it is really
just an extension of the old 3D
maze type games. Even so,
careful exploration of  this
extension to the city is vital as
you will ﬁnd many useful items
scattered around in the many
underground rooms, including
some cross hairs that can be
added to your craft to help you
shoot down enemy craft.
Not only will you come
across objects that will help you
but you'll also ﬁnd a great
number of puzzles. Locked
doors stop you from getting
around the complex too easily,
you'll need to ﬁnd a key to get
through these. T o  make
matters even worse there are
rooms which will move you
great distances around the
complex, this really helps in
getting you lost.

script in each. I f  you can
decipher the ﬁnal message you
will be able to set free many
gnome spirits and be elected
king.
Starting off in the gnome
mansion, you soon discover
how to select a time zone and
operate the time machine that
will transport you to the year of
your choice. Amongst your
options are the stone age,
ancient Green, the California
gold rush and an intergalactic
spaceship.
You can only hold one
object at a time but can access a
storeroom which will hold up
to four items. Pressing the ﬁre

you are the one that controls
the action. If you want to go
around shooting things up
then that's up to you. However,
don't be surprised if you ﬁnd
yourself been blown out of the
air by enemy gun ships.
Mercenary is certainly a
strange game to play as there
are no set rules. Some people
may like this but if you are just
after a good shoot 'em up then
you probably won't. I t  is
possible to spend quite a lot of
time feeling that you are
getting nowhere, but explora-
tiocn is important and it is
worth mapping out as much of
the city and the underground
complex as possible, this will
make it a lot easier to ﬁnd your
way around in a hurry, or even
your way out of the complex
and back to your ship. As
mentioned, it's very easy to get
lost and you can spend hours
just going backwards and for-
wards in your search for the
exit.
Mercenary is an extremely
time consuming game and isn't
one that you will load up for a
quick ﬁve minutes. There is
however a save game option so
you don't have to worry about
getting killed. If you do get
killed you will ﬁnd yourself by a
new ship anyway.
If you are looking for a
challenge and something to
keep you occupied for a
number of hours then take a
look at Mercenary, it's great
fun.

actions according to a list of
priorities. It  may operate a
mechanism e.g. open a door,
drop something, pick up an
object or ﬁre a lightning bolt.
You can always return from
a time zone to the mansion but
sometimes time holes appear
that transport you to another
year. This will generally be
useful, though, and you will
probably be able to ﬁnd some-
thing in the new zone to help
you in the old one.
Time Tunnel is an enjoyable
arcade adventure. The graphics
are pleasant and there are
some jolly tunes and enough
puzzles to keep you quiet for a
reasonable length of time.

1 HIS IS A VERY SIMPLE AND game which bears a vague
quite addictive little arcade resemblance to Pac-man.
You control a little charac-
ter called Captain Kidd (in
reality he's just a head who
rushes around the board, I
don't know what happened to
his body!) This poor little dis-
membered cranium dashes
around defusing bombs to stop
himself getting blown t o
kingdom come.
There are of course adver-
saries t o  avoid and i n  this
particular game they take the
form of boots which are ready
and willing to stomp on you at
any given moment. A t  ﬁrst
they're not too difﬁcult t o
avoid but as you reach the
higher levels they multiply
drastically as do the bombs.
There a re  also numerous
„
squares on the board which are
marked w it h  a  skull an d
crossbones and if you touch
these then you dissolve instant-
aneously.
• All the screens are identical
except that you get a different
background colour each time
and of course more skulls and
more boots. There are also lots
of little marker ﬂags which can
gain you extra points.
It's a very simple and a verb
old idea. You've probably got a
lot of games like it at home.
Having said that. I don't think
you'll be wasting your money
and you g et  a  nice little
rendering of The Entertainer in
the background.

THE FAMOUS MUPPET CHAR- mission t o  save his friend
acler, The Great Gonzo, is on a Camilla the chicken from being
the main ingredient in  the
Swedish chef's coq au vin. It's
probably an idea to include a
warning with this adventure:
it's a chock-a-block with the
most appalling puns in true
Muppet style.
It's a joystick operated text
adventure in which Gonzo is
given a  series of options in
choosing a  vehicle for the
particular terrain in which he
ﬁnds himself. You can have a
rbiling horn blower, a diving
light maker or even a walking
bumper. There are several
options and you must make
sure you pick the correct one
for your present location.
The locations have chicken
ﬂavoured names for instance
-
the Egglantic Ocean, New York
City and the Egg-yptian Desert
You need to amass a mini-
mum of 75 points to reach the
castle where Camilla is being
held captive. You score points
for successfully negotiating
hazards and also f o r con-
quering the foes you meet on
the way, like sharks, eagles and
even wild goats.
Some of the screens involve
dodging ﬂying birds an d
bouncing eggs while others are
maze type settings.
It's very entertaining and the
instruction b o o klet  also
contains a  Mu p p et  story.

EVERY SO OFTEN •A GAME
appears thta ﬁrst impressions
would leave you to think that it
was a load of rubbish, the only
thing is that a few hours later
you ﬁnd yourself still playing it
and going back to play it time
and time again. Desert Fox
from US Gold is one of those
games.
Desert Fox is a combination
of both arcade and strategy
games. You play the part of the
Allied forces and must save all
your depots before they are
take over by Rommel's army.
Lose one depot and the game is
over.
Upon loading yo u  a re
presented with a map of the
area in question,depending on
the level of play a varying num-
ber of ﬂags are present, these
represent the bases that you
must rescue from the clutches
of the evil Rommel. A number
of icons -  small pictures
- represent the options that are
available to you.
Selecting the Zoom icon
allows you to ﬁnd out infor-
mation on a selected base. The
information given is; t h e
number o f  en emy tanks
present, the number of your
tanks present. how much fuel
and supplies are there and,
perhaps the most important.
the number of hours before
the depot is over run. The
number of hours of freedom
remaining for the selected site
is also shown on an indicator at
the bottom of the screen, this
gives you an indication of just
how long you have got to get
there and rescue your troops.
The Radio icon turns on
your tank's radio. This can be
directed where you want,
pressing the ﬁre button gives
you a  surprisingly easy t o
understand r adio message
about what lies in this direc-
tion.
The move icon will move
your tank, known as Lone Wolf.
in the direction that the radio
beacon is facing. Careful use of
this icon together with the
radio icon will allow you to
travel around the map avoiding
the enemy as much as possible.
If you are unlucky enough
to fall for one of the enemy's
little traps then you will enter
the arcade sequence of the
game_ In all of the sequences
the graphics and sound can
only be described as adequate
but are fairly realistic and
surprisingly quick.
If you meet u p  with a
convoy you have to protect it
from enemy planes that are
trying to blow it up. Your job,
shoot down the planes. avoid
the allied ones or you will lose
points. The cross hairs for your
two sights automatically move
to the position of any planes.
simply move the joystick left or
right to ﬁre the gun.
Tiger ﬁnds you under attack
from enemy tanks, you can
spot them on your radar and
hear their missiles screaming
towards you. With careful aim
you can shoot t h e enemy
shells, if you shoot the lank
then their shells disappear as
well Yo u r missiles can b e
guided so even if the tank is
moving you stand a  good
chance o f  blowing him t o
pieces, not before he has had a
good go at you, though. Each
hit by the enemy will cause
some damage to your tank, this
can be repaired at one of the
depots.
In mineﬁeld you suddenly
ﬁnd your tank completely
surrounded by mines. Your aim
is to get out of there alive. You
can shoot mines that are in
front of you so this helps to
clear a path. If you do hit a mine
then o f  course yo u  are
damaged and you also get
stuck i n  t h e sand wasting
valuable time.
Ambush is reminiscent of
the section in the Star Wars
arcade game, the bit where you
are ﬂying down canyon being
shot at from the sides. Here
your tank is going through a
canyon, the enemy has gun
emplacement o n  both cliff
faces. You must destroy them
before they pass your tank, if
you don't then you will suffer
damage.
In Stuka Lone Wolf is being
attacked b y enemy ﬁghters.
This section of the game is very
similar t o  t h e  Tiger tank
section. shoot the enemy with
your guided missiles before
they hit you.
Desert Fox offers enough
variation throughout its play to
keep you interested for a long
time. The different levels offer
such a  varying degree o f
competition that you start to
take the attitude that as soon as
one level is ﬁnished you must
have a crack at the next one.
you're alter a good shoot them
up then have a goat Desert Fox.

what's going on. You must also
keep your eye on the numbei
of shots you have left although
you do regain them in time.
Points are scored for stunning

switching the machines bads

get a bonus for each loaf baked

the game is far too easy to play
and lacks any lasting appeal.

manufactured t h e i r  w a r

story goes on.
Now there are two types of
Zolds, red ones and blue ones.
You play the part of Earthman,
a man from no guesses where,
who is going to merge minds
with the blue zoids ultimate
weapon. Zoidzilla, and take on
the evil red zoids from within
their own complex.
However., as you descend

Zoidzilla disperse across the

Red Patrols ﬁn d  thes e
pieces of Zoidzilla and carry
them off to eight of their city
domes. Your task now is to ﬁnd
the eight pieces and then

equipment. Tank Zold (what
really exciting names!), y ou

become as one.
All of the action in Zoids
takes place within the area
surrounding the Red Zoids'
cities. Your position within this
city is depicted upon a small
map of the area around your
tank, in  the middle of your
screen. You don't see anything
as it really is as you are seeing
everything through the eyes of
Tank Zoid. If you ask me this is a

111,
ARCADE ADVENTURES ARE A bet oming extremely common
type o f  g a m e  t h a t  a r e  a t  the moment.
Around the map you will
ﬁnd a number of icons. These
show all o f  the equipment
available to you and its status.
Above the map is your pulse,
below is  that o f  t h e  zold.
Careful monitoring o f  these
will show you what state both
are in.
Next you have the Mode or
Weapon icons. The Railgun
propels electromagnetic pulses
at your enemy. You can ﬁre
normal missiles and attempt to
jam the enemy's signals.
Lastly you have information
about y o u r  z o id ,  damage
reports and that sort of thing.
Moving your pointer over
the map allows you to specify a
direction in which you want
your Tank Zoid to move. It will
continue moving in the speci-
ﬁed direction until it can go no
further. This allows y ou t o
watch the map for lurking Red
Zoids as they are bound to take
a few pot shots at you as you
drive past.
Combat in Zoids is a little
strange and not that exciting. If
you are using the railgun you
are presented with a diamond
shaped sight, y ou hav e t o
centre the enemy, represented
by another diamond., in your
sights and ﬁre. This may sound
graphically boring but to be fair
it isn't. Martech has done a
good job o f  making all the
graphics look pretty even if
they are a little basic.
Firing missiles is a lot more
c o m p lic a t e d .  Y o u  a r e
presented with two map grids.
One showing your enemy from
above the other from the side.
You have to select how much
fuel to put in your missile, ﬁre it
and then g u i d e  it  t o your
target. You control the missile
on one map at a time, press the
button to move between the
maps. Action here is a little fast
and I  found it  took quite a
while befor e I  was  us ed
enough to the controls to hit
anything. A g a i n  n o t h i n g
stunning but good enough.
An exciting musical piece
by Rob Hubbard helps to set
the s c ene f o r  t h e  game,
Thought get the feeling that he
sets it too well and the game
doesn't quite live up to it. To be
fair though, even though Zoids
is probably  n o t  t h e  mos t
visually stunning game around,
there is a lot to it and it will
probably take a long time to
master.
The ac tion i s  fast a n d
furious, get three or four Red
Zoids on your tail and the only
option open to you is to run. Of
course you don't have to but I
bet you'll end up starting the
game f r o m  t h e  beginning
again.
Zoids is very different to any
other game and must be played
for quite a while before you get
the hang of it and really start to
enjoy i t .  I f  y o u  c an't b e
bothered to spend a long time
on a game then Zoids probably
isn't for you. If, on the other
hand, you enjoy a challenge
then the Red Zoids are waiting.

As w i t h  a n y  n o r m a l
adventure the game must have
an aim. In Ark Pandora you
must retrieve the sacred scroll
which is hidden on the island.
While travelling in your search
for this mysterious scroll you
will meet both friends and
enemies. Friends  c a n  b e
persuaded to help you in your
task while the enemy will do
his best to kill you off.
Nothing unusual her e I
,here you say, well no there isn't.
The main difference between
this and many other arcade
adventures is its presentation.
Firstly all of the graphics are
extremely colourful and very
well animated, the running and
jumping action of characters
being one example. Secondly,
most o f  the action is  ic on
controlled. Pointing t o  t h e
icons allows you to use objects,
pick them up and put them
down, select which way you
wish to go once you reach the
edge of the screen and that sort
of thing.
When you get fed up with
the game, which will take a
long t ime  as some o f  the
puz z les  a r e  e x t r e m e l y
complex, you don't have to put
this game in the box with all
your other 'dead' programs.
Simply break out the screen
designer that comes with the
packages and create your own
new screens.

IT'S QUITE SURPRISING THAT
nobody's ever done an ofﬁcial
FA C u p  program, however
Virgin has now rectiﬁed that
situation with this new text
only game.
As a football manager, you
are in charge of 10 teams (it's
hard work these days in the
soccer business). The aim of the
game is, of course, to get one of
your teams t o  t he ﬁnal a t
Wembley and then thrash the
opposition.
One of the game's strongest
points, in my opinion, is that it
can be played by up to eight
people at once. I've never had
a game against the computer
alone but I think that would
become a little tedious. When
there a r e  several p e o p le
competing it's pretty exciting

idea to pick a few non-league
teams since they can surprise
you with occasional ﬂashes of
brilliance although I've never
succeeded in taking one past
the fourth round. The league
clubs have all been given a real
home and away rating based on
their performance in the FA
Cup over the last few years and
also on their current league
form. From the little I know
about soccer it seems to be
fairly accurate, although there
is always room for surprises.
Non-league clubs have a rating
based on FA Cup history and
not a racing game like Pitstop
or Pole Position.

Once you've chosen your
sides then you watch the draw.
Two little tokens roll on to the
top o f  the screen and t he
names o f  t h e  sides drawn
against each other appear at
the bottom and scroll upwards.
In case y ou haven't kept a
record o f  your teams, don't
worry because each manager's
initials appear nex t t o  t h e
names of his sides.
Once you've found o u t
who you're playing, a screen
appears on which you must

only opportunity you have to
guide your teams' progress in a
particular match. Later when
the big boys join in, you are
given more opportunities t o
decide tactics, a n d  thes e
increase as you get nearer the
ﬁnal. Eventually you reach the
stage where you can advise
your team four times during a
match and you are even given
the option of bringing on the

There are also news ﬂashes
about various events which can
affect your teams' morale. Your
star player is  having dodgy
dealings with a ticket tout. Your

times, you'll probably ﬁnd that

them a miss.
There is  a  state o f  play
screen which shows how all the
teams are doing in their current
matches. Ninety  minutes is
clocked up in an equivalent
number o f  seconds and you
can speed this up if you like. It's
amazing how many goals seem
to be scored in the ﬁnal minute
of the game. I  was leading
Chelsea t o  a  c up ﬁnal win
against Manchester United and
was two nil up. In the ﬁnal
minute my worthy opponents
managed to score a staggering
three goals! This circumstance
detracts a  lit t le  f r o m t h e
authenticity but certainly adds
to the excitement. You can
never be sure of a win until the
ﬁnal whistle blows.
When you reach the ﬁnal
you are forced to make quite a
few skillful decisions. Whether
to agree to transfers for your
best players, how to prepare
them for the match etc. These
all affect the team's perfor-
mance so choose your answers
carefully.
One last point -  you don't

to enjoy this game. I'm not. Get
a few friends together and go

of deep thought will convince
you otherwise, Imagine the

the dogmatic approach but this

SOON '0' LEVEL AND CSE EXAM TIME
will be with us again. Mock exams will
have been taken and any areas needing
extra work highlighted. Therefore it
seems a good time to look at some of the
software available and to discuss their
various attributes. Several of the leading
publishing/software houses have
produced revision packs which are all
very individual so I shall deal with each
ﬁrm in turn by looking at what they are
offering and how it is presented.
Commodore Software
Commodore has a  range of revision
software which includes: English
language (the only one I've seen); Geo-
graphy -  dealing with relief, climate,
farming, industry etc; '0' level French -
general practice of  tenses, verbs,
pronouns etc; Computer Studies - logic,
operational procedures, programming,
data storage; Physics; Chemistry - basic
techniques, reactions, periodic tables;
Biology; Maths.
The maths package consists of two
ieparate units. Maths 1 covers arithmetic,
algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and
problems. Maths 2  covers arithmetic,
equations, progressions, functions,
calculus and trigonometry. I n  both
programs three types of question are
used. These are true or false questions,
multiple choice, in which there are up to
four choices and a series of questions in
which the answer must be typed in. A
booklet accompanying the programs
doubles as running instructions and
revision notes.
All these retail at £9.99.
Penguin Study Software
Penguin has a  long association with
English literature study guides and these
programs are a natural progression. They
are purely revision aids and should be
used in conjunction with the students
own notes and a copy of the play being
revised. The program takes the form of a
database with excellent cross reference
capabilities. If an essay is required on a
given subject or image the program will
search out all the references on that sub-
ject and list them, thus saving the user
countless hours thumbing through the
text. Titles in the range include Romeo
and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice,
Twelfth Night, Julius Caesar and Henry IV.

Longmans is another publisher which has
used its expertise in writing textbooks to
good effect in the ﬁeld of computer soft-
ware. Each package contains a cassette
and a  12 page booklet and revision
planner.
Titles available are: French -  a 2000
word vocabulary list, revision on regular
and irregular verbs, comprehension
practice and a section all about France, its
regions and specialities; Biology - class-
iﬁcation of animal and plant kingdoms,
genetics and inheritance, food composi-
tion and a test of terms referring to the
body; Computer Studies -  how logic
circuits work, ﬁle handling and useful
Basic routines, Visicode low level
languages; Mathematics -  transforma-
tions, statistics, probability and odds,
trigonometry; Physics -  key formulae,
light, machines and pulleys, circuits and
Ohm's Law; Chemistry -  the elements,
molecular weight, preparation in the lab,
Reactivity. All these packages cost £7.95.
Collins Gem Revision Software
These are packages costing £8.95 each
which extend the Gem Basic Facts books
with the addition of a cassette. Each
cassette contains four different programs.
The ﬁrst is a random tester which helps
determine any problem areas. The next
two sections deal with helping the student
to learn through a diagram with ordinary
questions or multiple choice. The ﬁnal
section tests the student by means of a
game against the computer. Four titles are
available -  Biology, Chemistry, Physics
and Computer Studies.
Pan Course Tutors
At ﬁrst glance the asking price of E14.95 a
package seems a lot but on closer examin-
ation they represent a bargain not to be
missed. They are the product of an amal-
gamation between - book publishers.
Heinemann and Pan, and software house
Hill MacGibbon. A meaty combination
especially when you add Collinsoft.
Each package consists of two cassettes,
a student guide and a copy of the approp-
riate Pan Study Aid. These books have
been around for many years and cover all
essential parts of the syllabus. They
explain how to tackle exam questions by
giving examples and indicating which
areas carry more marks. The books are
very detailed and are labelled 'The
complete guide to exam success'.
As if to contradict this the cassettes in
this package are used in conjunction with
the book. Cassette 1 has a series of
diagnostic tests. From these you can assess
your performance in one of three ways: A
full analysis of your answers; a  time
analysis; a written report showing any
weak areas and suggestions for further
work.
Side two of tape one and both sides of
tape two are detailed teaching programs
designed to help the student as much as
possible. Subjects covered are French.
Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Biology.
By the time this article reaches you the
long running teacher's pay dispute will
hopefully be resolved. Should it not be so
then the revision packages will hold even
more importance. If it is sorted out, they
are still a valuable resource and may make
the difference between a pass or a Grade
As exam time draws near
Margaret Webb takes you
through the latest in revision
software.

IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
You sit at the computer keyboard having
just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one o f  the superb programs
from Your Commodore. Your ﬁngers
reach for the keyboard and press the
letters R ,  U  and N I .  You s it back
expectantly and.. nothing happens.
Well, I'm sure that we have all had
problem before now. When i t  does
happen it's a matter of spending hours
searching through the program for any
typing mistakes. No matter how long you
look or how many people help you, you
can usually guarantee that at least one
little bug slips through unnoticed.
Here, at Your Commodore, we pride
ourselves on the quality of listing that we
print. Unfortunately, this usually means
that they are also very long, thus taking
longer to type in and leaving more room
for errors. All o f  the listings in Your
Commodore are taken straight from a
printout o f  working programs, i t  is
therefore very unusual for  errors t o
appear in the magazine.
Because of the length of our programs
we do get a large number of requests from
readers who would like us to put speciﬁc

programs o n  tape o r  disk for  them.
Obviously this is very time consuming and
means that we can't spend as much time
working on the magazine as we would
like.
We are therefore proud to announce
the start of the Your Commodore Soft-
ware Service'. Most of the programs from
each issue of the magazine will now be
available on a single cassette for a price of
just 14.00. We will not be making disks
available since they would have to be a lot
more expensive and more difﬁcult to
post. This  shouldn't cause y ou any

problems though as none of the programs
will be protected and it will be a simple
matter t o  save the programs t o  disk
yourselves.
All programs on the cassette will be
saved us ing a  tape tur bo routine.
However, we cannot guarantee that all
programs will work correctly with this
turbo routine present. W e  therefore
recommend that before you use any of
the programs you make a copy of the
programs on your own cassette or disk
and use this version of the program not
the original.

Alien Webb puts 3D
graphics in focus.
UP TO NOW, I'VE TRIED TO
give routines which will be of
use t o  t h e  widest possible
range of readers. I now plan to
give a few which will be of use
mainly t o  game writers. The
idea is to try to remove the
problem of graphics from the
user leav ing h i m  t im e  t o
concentrate o n  t h e  lo g ic
behind the game.
I've always been keen on 3D
games so it's with this area that I
wish to start. The use of 3D
effects t o  depict movement
down corridors o r  mazes is
frequently us ed i n  arcade
adventure ty pe games. I f
you've s een Ar iolas oft's
Scarabaeus o r  Supersoft's
Super Cooper, you'll k now
what I mean.
The idea behind the routine
is that you deﬁne the maze as a
two dimensional array in RAM.
You call the routine specifying
the c o-ordinates o f  y o u r
position a n d  t h e  direction
you're looking and the routine
shows the view through the
maze.
The maze is considered as
an array of square cells. Each
cell can have exits in any one of
the four cardinal directions. If
we assign a bit to each direction
such that north uses bit zero,
each uses bit one etc. we can
calculate a number between
zero and 15 which deﬁnes the
cell. These are summarised in
Table 1.

lup a few useful t i p s
ry
WE OFTEN GET LETTERS ASK-
ing how two Basic programs
can be merged together into a
single program. This is useful
for entering old and loved sub-
routines which can take hours
to type in.
The problem w it h mos t
simple merge routines is that
they d o n ' t  c ater  f o r  t h e
situation w h e n  t h e  t w o
programs share the same line
numbers so I have included a
routine which does a simple
renumber.

understand i t ,  a ll w i l l  b e
revealed later.
The address of the start of
Basic is stored in the two bytes
starting at location 43 (hex 28)
and the end of a Basic program
in the two bytes at location 45
ihex 2D). Normal loading of a
program leaves the pointer at
location 45 pointing at the last
of the three zero bytes with
which every Basic program
ends. T o  merge a  second
program o n  t o  the one in
memory we have to fool the
computer into believing that
the start of Basic is now at the
end of that program.
This simply means that the
pointer a t  loc ation 4 3  i s
changed to the same value as
the pointer i n  location 45.
Unfortunately, that is not quite
right because we have to lose
the last two zero bytes from our

With l a i n  Murray's
word processor, there's
no need for shabby
letters and scraggy
documents.
WORDPROK IS A DISK-BASED
word processing pac k age
offering a full multi-function
machine code screen editor
and high-speed p r in t  O u t
routine, along with a  Basic
main program equipped with a
number of other facilities. It
also allows you to "customise"
it easily if required.
A w o r d  processor i s  a
program which turns a com-
puter i n t o  a n  "elec tronic
typewriter". It allows you to
enter tex t, correcting a n y
mistakes as you go, and lets you
add, delete, o r  change any
sections as required before the
ﬁnal printout is produced. Thus
the ﬁnal draft is all that needs to
be printed on paper, and it
should be error-free, saving a
lot of waste paper.
The listing comprises two
programs: the ﬁrst is a Basic
loader p r o g r a m  f o r  t h e
machine c ode section. This
loads the machine code (in a
series of DATA statements) into
memory starting at 49152, and
when the data is correct and
loaded, t h e  machine c ode
section (just over 3K) is saved as
a machine code ﬁle to disk. The
main program can then load
this program ﬁle, and t h e
loader with the machine code
data need only be used once,
hence saving time when it is in
use. The second program is the
word processor itself, a n d
provides easy access to the
machine code routines used.
Although the machine code
would be difﬁcult to modify,
the Basic program could be
adapted t o  s uit y our  o w n
requirements.
Wordprok Manual
On running the program, the
machine code section is auto-
matically loaded from disk if it
is n o t  already present i n
memory. A menu is then pre-
sented, w it h  t h e  following
options.

margin is aligned, but the right
margin is ragged. This is similar
to the output from a normal

line is thrown, and subsequent
text is printed right justiﬁed i.e.
the right margin is aligned, but
the left margin is ragged.
CTRL I: Right and left justify. A

justiﬁed i.e. both margins are
aligned. This is  the default
justiﬁcation setting.

CTRL C: Centralise text on line.
A line is  thrown, and sub-
sequent lines are printed with
the text centralised on the line.
This would normally be used to
print headings etc.
CTRL B :  Beginning marker.
This sets the beginning of the
block for saving, printing and
word counting. More than one
begin marker may be used, but
only  t h e  ﬁr s t  w i l l  b e
recognised.
CTRL E: End marker. This sets
the end of the block for saving,
printing, and word counting.
More than one end marker
may be used, but only the ﬁrst
will be recognised. If no end
marker is used, the action will
continue until the end of the
text marker ( )  is reached.
2. SAVE DOCUMENT
This option allows you to save
any or all of the text currently in
the memory to disk. The text
saved is from the ﬁrst begin-
ning marker (B) to the ﬁrst end
marker (E or X), and the save
routine gives an exit option if
these markers have not been
set up. A  ﬁlename is  then
requested, which can be up to
12 characters long. Wild card
ﬁlenames (i.e. those containing
the characters *, ? or .) are not
acceptable. O n  saving, t he
sufﬁx .TXT is added to the disk
ﬁle name to assist in identi-
ﬁcation o f  text ﬁles. I f  the
markers are incorrectly set, if
the disk drive is not available,
or if the ﬁle exists, an error
message is printed, otherwise a
successful save message is dis-
played, and pressing SPACE
causes a return to the main
menu.
3. LOAD DOCUMENT
This option allows you to load a
text ﬁle from disk into memory
for editing or printing. Loading
will start f r om t he current
cursor position, and an exit
option is given if this has not
been set up. A ﬁlename is then
requested, which can be up to
12 characters long. Wild card
ﬁlenames are not acceptable.
The routine will then search for
a ﬁle of this name with the
sufﬁx .TXT, and if a load error
occurs, an error message is dis-
played, otherwise a successful
load message is displayed and
pressi
to the main menu. As loading
commences from the cursor
position, several ﬁles may be
chained into one in memory.
When loading is complete, the
cursor is set to the start of the
text memory.

4. PRINT DOCUMENT
This option allows you to print
the c ur r ent doc ument i n
memory to a printer (device
# 4). The text is printed from
the ﬁrst beginning marker (B)
to the ﬁrst end marker (E o r ) .
The text is automatically for-
matted and lin e  spaced as
required during printing, with
page throws generated when a
page is ﬁlled, Formatting and
page feed instructions are con-
tained i n  control characters
within t h e  tex t (see editor
functions above), and other
information about the printout
format is requested before the
document i s  printed. T h e
prompts given are as follows:
Left and right margins: The
normal printer width o f  80
characters is assumed, but by
selecting margins, borders for
binding the document, etc. can
be set up, as well as moving the
text column across the page as
required.
Page hold: This allows a pause
for convenience, or to insert a
new sheet o f  paper i n  a
friction-feed printer after the
printing of each page is com-
pleted. Pressing SPACE w ill
continue t h e  p r i n t ,  a n d
pressing F7 will terminate the
print.
Page numbers: Pages can be
un-numbered, numbered a t
the top, or numbered at the
bottom, and the type required
is selected from the menu. If
numbers ar e required, t h e
number o f  the ﬁrst page is
requested, and this should be
in the range 0-900.
Page length: The number of
lines p e r  p a g e  w i l l  v ar y
depending on the size of paper

restart printing, and pressing F7
will terminate it. A message will

will cause a return to the main

5. DISK FILE HANDLING
This option allows you t o
perform some extra operations
on the current disk. These are
as follows:
1. Disk Directory: A directory
of the current disk is printed on
the screen. Pressing SHIFT will
pause t h e  list in g . T h e
document in memory is not
affected.
2. File Rename: A disk ﬁle may
be renamed. The current and
new ﬁlenames are requested,
arid the renaming procedure is
carried out. Filenames may be
up to 16 characters long.
3. File Delete: A disk ﬁle may be
scratched from the disk. The
ﬁlename is requested, and the
delete procedure is carried
out. The ﬁlename may be up to
16 characters long, and wild
card ﬁlenames are acceptable.
4. Exit: This causes a return to
the main menu.
6. WORD COUNT
This allows the number o f
words in the current document
to be  counted. Words are
counted from the ﬁrst begin-
ning marker (B) to the ﬁrst end
marker (E or ) ,  and an exit
option is given if these have not
been set up. The number of
words in this block is then dis-
played, and pressing SPACE
will cause a return to the main
menu.
7. RESTART
This option causes a restart, and
the document currently i n
memory is lost. A  return is
made to the main menu.
8. EXIT
This option causesexit from the
program, and returns to Basic
control.
Limitations of the
Program
a) Editor: T h e word split/
unsplit option works by forcing
a line feed i f  a  space is
encountered i n  the last 10
columns of the screen width.
Thus if a long word occurs at
the end of a line, it may be split
between lines.
b) Device availability trapping:

entered, a n d  t h e  required
device is not present, an error
message w i l l  appear  a n d
pressing SPACE will cause a
return to the main menu. If ﬁle
deleting o r  renaming is  at-
tempted without a disk drive
available, t h e  program w ill
break and return to Basic. Re-
entry to the program is possible
by typing GOTO 500_
c) Printing: As  each line is
formatted for printing, single
or d o u b le  spaces a t  t h e
beginning or end of lines are
removed to assist in keeping
straight margins_ Thus if an in-
dentation to indicate the start
of a paragraph etc. is required,
it should b e  at  least three
spaces long.
d) Word count: This routine
increments the word counter
each time it encounters a non-
space/space combination i n
the t e x t .  T hus  hy phens ,
commas, full stops etc. will be
counted as words unless there
is no space between them and a
word, and t he wor d count
should only  be taken as an
approximate ﬁgure o f  t h e
number of actual words.
e) STOP and RESTORE: Whilst
in the editor, the STOP key is
disabled, but holding down
STOP and pressing RESTORE
will reset t he computer as
usual. Re-entry is not possible.
But with the editor, STOP and
RESTORE behave as usual.
f) Memory usage: The Basic
program is about 10K long, and
resets the top of Basic memory
to 19968 ($4E00). The text is
stored from 120000 ($4E20) up
to a maximum of 40959 ($9EFF).
The machine code issituated in
the 4K RAM space starting at
49152 ($C000) and is just over
3K in length. The remaining 1K
is used for data storage by the
machine code routines.
Notes on Typing the
Programs
Typing in the program should
pose few difﬁculties, though
care should be taken with the
data, and some of  the print
statements. A  checksum i s
included in  the data loader,
and this will detect most errors
in the data. If an error occurs,
check variables A  and C  t o
assist in debugging the data.
While ty ping t h e  data, a
running check of line length
comparisons should be made
e.g. if line 1300 is two characters
longer than line 1290 in the

PROGRAMMER
OF THE
YEAR
C
Polar problems with this
Imonth's entry from Ian Potts.
POLAR PETE IS THE LATEST GAME TO BE
featured in the Programmer of the Year
competition. The game doesn't feature
really fast, super smooth graphics, but
instead Ian Potts has taken a simple idea,
added some extremely 'cute' graphics
and produced an excellent game. A good
game isn't always complicated.
The Game
Your aim is to guide Polar Pete around his
local ice-pack collecting the blocks of ice
so that he can build his igloo. Of course
life isn't made easy as Pete has to avoid the
penguins and polar bears which always
seem to be in his way.
Pete is controlled by a joystick in Port
2. To pick up a block of ice you must
position Pete just to the right of a block of
ice and press the button. Positioning is
important and it has been found that it is
best to position Pete so that his nose is just
above and right of the ice block.
-
Once the ice block is collected Pete
must drag the block back to his pad on the
right hand side o f  the screen. Again
position Pete to the right and press ﬁre to
deposit the block.
After all of  the blocks have been
collected Pete will build his igloo and go
on to the next screen.
The music can b e  turned o f f  by
pressing any key on the keyboard.
Oh, by the way, don't let Pete fall into
the water as it's very cold!
Getting It In
Polar Pete will work on a C64 with either
tape or disk.
There are ﬁve parts to be entered
(PETE LOAD 1-5). Each of the ﬁve parts
must b e  ty ped i n t o  y our  machine
separately and saved on to tape or disk. If
you are using tape do make sure that the
you make changes where indicated in the
REM statements. Do make sure that you
save the programs with the same names as
in the magazine or they will not work.
Once all parts have been saved turn
your machine off and on and enter the
following line:
POKE 16483,0:POKE44,64:NEW
Now load 'PETE LOAD 1' into your
machine and type RUN. Th;s will load in
each of the parts as required and save
them into memory. If you have made any
errors while typing in any of the data
statements you will now be told which
line the error is in. Make the changes
needed, SAVE the part again and start
again from the POKE instructions above.
When all of the information has been
saved into memory the program will auto-
matically save itself as 'POLAR PETE', If

you are using cassette then do make sure
that you put a clean cassette into the
recorder after part ﬁve has loaded. If you
don't then 'POLAR PETE w ill be saved
after all of the other parts which are no
longer needed.
All you need to do to play POLAR PETE
is turn your machine off and on and type
LOAD "POLAR PETE",8,1 fo disk or
LOAD "POLAR PETE',1,1 for tape
Once t h e  program has  ﬁnished
loading type RUN and play the game.

LAS El
Stuart Cooke has been
experimenting with two Laser
programs from Ocean.
HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO WRITE
your own arcade game but have been put
off because o f  t h e  complexities o f
machine code? Have you ever wished that
the Basic on the C64 allowed you to do
more with graphics? Or, have you always
found it easy to write programs in Basic
but always found them too slow? Well.
two new packages from Ocean IQ will
solve all of your problems.
The ﬁrst of the two programs is Laser
Basic. Essentially this  is  jus t a  Basic
extension like many others available on
the market. What makes it different from
all of the rest is its plethora of graphics
commands. I n  fact, nearly all o f  the
commands in this Basic are geared to
making the task of graphics programming
easier. Not all o f  the commands are
graphics based, though. There are also
many advanced programming commands
such as procedures and quite a formid-
able array of 'toolkit' commands such as
Renumber.
The second package's the one that will
be of great interest to anyone who has
found their latest version of Space Invaders
just a little slow when written in Basic. The
program is the Laser Compiler. The com-
piler will change standard Commodore
Basic and Laser Basic programs into mach-
ine code. Obviously this will give any pro-
programs a signiﬁcant increase in speed.
Laser Basic is an extension of an earlier
program called Basic Lightning which has
been around for some time. If you alread
have Basic Lightning then you will be
pleased to know that the Laser Compiler
will compile most programs written with
this package. But more of this later.
Laser Basic
As previously mentioned, this is essen-
tially a  Basic Extension, b u t  a  very
powerful one. One very nice feature is the
inclusion of a tape turbo save option. This
will undoubtedly please cassette users
who are totally fed up with the slowness of
the Commodore cassette deck. In use the
turbo proved itself to be both very fast
an very reliable. Even trying turbo saved
programs on different cassette recorders
presented no problems.
Documentation
A large manual is  supplied with the
package which deals with all o f  the
commands in detail. Some sections are a
little difﬁcult t o  understand a t  ﬁrst
reading but numerous example programs
do make things a little clearer. Beginners
would be well advised to try all examples
and make sure that they understand how
they work before they attempt to write
any fantastic games program.
In Use
Programming with Laser Basic is a joy,
though, when y ou get o n  t o  using
graphics, it  is  a  little complicated t o
understand a t  ﬁrst. T h e  numerous
structured programming commands
make the Basic great to use. If you've ever
82
written programs in Pascal or other struc-
tured languages you'll know just how
valuable are Procedures, Labels and other
programming aids. For those who have
never come across these commands let's
take a closer look.
With a normal GOSUB statement in
Basic y ou would use something lik e
GOSUB 1000. L in e  1000 c ould, f o r
example, be the subroutine that updates
the score. Unfortunately the line number
1000 doesn't tell you this. With Laser
Basic you could re-write the GOSUB
command like this:
GOSUB update
and line 1000 would become
1000 LABEL update•
This makes it much easier to follow the
ﬂow of a program.
Procedures take the use o f  labels
much further. With a  procedure it is
possible to have a program that uses a

C 6 4  R e v i e w
vaiable, for example VAR1. The proce-
dure, which is similar to a subroutine
can also use the same variable name
however, the two can be treated as com-
pletely separate items the value of one not
affecting the value of the other.
Other structured programming
commands are REPEAT... UNTIL loops,
IF. .THEN. .ELSE and WHILE. MEND. All of
which lead to much clearer and easier
programming.
Identity Crisis
Before we take a look at the graphics
commands it is worth taking a close look
at what is a new idea.
No doubt you will have already heard
about the sprites that are available on the
C64. In  Laser Basic these have been
renamed Hardware Sprites and a new
type of sprite has been added, the Soft-
ware Sprite. A software sprite, unlike a
hardware sprite, is of dimensions that are
set by the user up to a maximum of 255
character blocks by 255 character blocks.
All graphic commands are operated
on Sprites, this may make you wonder
how you get things on to the screen until
you realise tht the hi-res screen is treated
as sprite number z ero  w it h  ﬁxed
dimensions and that the text screen is
treated as sprite number 255 also with
ﬁxed dimensions.
A sprite designer package is included
with Laser Basic, using this it is easy to
design extremely large sprites.
Numerous commands are available for
sprite drawing. It is possible to plot points
on a sprite, draw boxes, draw lines. With
the POLY command it is also possible to
draw polygons and circles. Blank areas,
such as those created with the BOX and
POLY commands can be coloured in with
the FILL command.
Moving it Around
Sprites can be manipulated in numerous
ways. The PUTBLK command is used to
place a sprite at a speciﬁc place on the hi-
res screen. It is possible to OR, AND or
XOR the sprite with whatever is already
on the screen. With careful use of these
commands the software sprites can be
made to appear in front of, or behind,
other items on the screen.
Commands also exist f or copying
sprites, or parts of sprites, into other
sprites.
Commands exist for moving sprites
around the screen and scrolling them. It is
even possible to make a sprite follow the
path of another.
Scrolling backdrops are now ext-
remely easy. All that you need to do is to
deﬁne your background as a sprite, don't
forget that this can be up to 255 characters
wide. Place this on the screen o n ly part
of it will show a n d  then scroll the
background sprite with o n e o f  t he
numerous scroll commands. It's as simple
as that. It was never as easy as this to write
Defender before.
83
And There's More
Obviously it is only possible to give a taste
of some of the commands available. There
are many that I haven't even mentioned.
If you are interested in playing around
with graphics o r  just interested i n
programming then you should rush out
and buy a copy of the program. You
should be creating works of art in no time
at all.
Speeding Things Up
Its no good writing the world's best inter-
galactic space ﬂight simulator only to ﬁnd
out that Brian the snail can beat your
space ship at full speed. Nonetheless, that
is exactly what will happen if you write
your programs in Basic. The only way to
write fast programs is to use machine code
like all of the top programmers. Or is it
The Laser Basic compiler will take
programs that have been written using
Laser Basic (and normal Basic) and turn
them into machine code. Obviously the
program generated by a compiler is not as
compact or as fast as one written entirely
in machine code but it will be many times
faster than normal.
As can b e  seen, the Laser Basic
compiler provides Commodore 6 4
owners with an excellent programming
aid. No longer do you have to study
machine code. Simply write your program
in Basic and off you go.
Ocean I Q  will also let you freely
market any program that is written using
Laser Basic and Laser Compiler as long as
you put a mention on the packaging that
these programs were used. Perhaps these
packages could bring out the budding
Minters and Crowthers in many people.
The Manual supplied with Laser Com-
piler is very small, only seven pages, but all
necessary information is there. It explains
how to compile a program including how
to save it. A turbo option is included for
tape users, Disk users shouldn't feel left
out either as they are provided with a
routine that will make programs auto
start.
For the many users of Basic lightening,
a small section is included that explains
the differences in some of the commands,
though most of these are only minor. For
example the CUTOFF command now uses
numbers in the range zero to 65535
instead of zero to 2047.
A quick glance at the demo program
supplied with these packages shows just
what is possible with these two excellent
programming tools. When t h e Basic
version of the demo is run it is surprising
enough what is being done from within
Basic. But when you see the speed of the
compiled version it looks even better.
If you want to get into graphics pro-
gramming but don't fancy getting into
machine code then take a look at both of
these packages they are well worth it.

L_Eric Doyle guides you
h r o u f
Pli
ANsi PROGRAMMER WHO IS PLANN-
ing a game for the C-16 always meets the
problem of  ﬁtting the game into the
limited memory space. This does not
mean that the quality of the game will
suffer, as Commodore proved with the
3.5K Vic 20. Unfortunately, the compres-
sion of and economical use of memory is
not every software house's forte and the
consequence is a plethora of  unsatis-
factory games. As I have shown there are
several houses whic h tak e t h e  C16
seriously and this months  collection
shows the range of games which have
impressed me and the reasons why.
Watching my colleagues in the ofﬁce
engrossed in yet another game of Break-
out (and loving every minute) made me
realise that complexity is not always the
secret of a truly addictive game and to illu-
strate this I include Pacmania from Mr
Chip Software. Pacman was one of the few
arcade games  t o  tr ans c end t h e
boundaries of the amusement arcade and
capture public interest. The game is not
very complex and even a satisfactory Basic
game can be written or copied from a
magazine. The added speed of machine
code allows many more complications to
be added and the animation is a lot
smoother. Mr Chip has taken full advan-
tage of these beneﬁts to create a game
which is recognisably the same as the
arcade game, but different enough to give
it added excitement,
Pacmania's h e r o  i s  t h e  familiar
gobbling disc who is directed around a
selection of eight mazes eating up all the
dots that litter every passageway. Ghosts
emanate from the centre of the maze and
set o f f  i n  hot pursuit o f  y our little
muncher. In most versions of this game
that I have seen the ghosts quite often
wander about aimlessly until they come
within sight of Pacman, but not so in
Pacmania. The ghosts in this game go
straight for the jugular running like crazy
after your slower moving little man. Relief
from this relentless pursuit can only be
gained by either using the hyper-maze
ports or by eating power pills.
Hypersports are a bit of a gamble
because you can never be surewhere you
will reappear after using them. Assuming
you don't end up on top of another ghost,
it is an effective way of escaping a hot
pursuit but the power pills are more pre-
dictable because they mean that the
ghosts become vulnerable for a while.
This allows Pacman to gain more points by
eating the ghosts or a safe period to eat
the pills without any interference. The
speed of the action increases as you work
your way through each level of eight
84

mazes, creating a game which can never
be mastered fully and should hold the
interest for quite some time.
Cyborg on the Budgie budget priced
label, from the Alligata pool of  com-
panies, is a simple game in programming
terms but almost impossible to play unless
you are the persevering type. Only ardent
shoot 'em up fanatics should consider
buying this one because it makes Pacman
look like a senior citizen's picnic.
The rules are simple: blast all the
moving aliens and save the diminutive
Cyborgs before the enemy kills them. As
always the reality is not so simple. In fact it
took several attempts to start the ﬁrst
screen; every time my ship appeared an
alien would collide with it and zap me
back to the title screen minus another life.
Eventually I managed to hang on long
enough to survive and worry about using
smart bombs. The instructions state that
clearing
essential
the screen in one fell swoop is
to your survival. What they don't
tell you is how to detonate a smart bomb
to achieve this but I found the space bar
had the desired effect.
What happens is  this , y our  s hip
appears and then a random number of
aliens appear all over the screen and
immediately home in on you. Praying as
you grasp the ﬁre button, you blast wildly
and try t o  wipe them all out before
another group appears. This goes on until
you clear the ﬁrst wave and then the next
onslaught begins. Occasionally, several
Cyborgs appear and you must collect as
many as possible, avoiding all of  the
assorted enemy craft. Not much to the
game r eally  b u t  it ' s  maddeningly
addictive.
Another game from Alligata should
satisfy any platform game devotees with
its 20 screens to puzzle over. Forward
planning and exceptional hand to eye co-
ordination are all that is required t o
85
complete Wagger.
little by little, Roger the Dodger must
learn the secrets of each room as he
collects the golden keys which unlock the
safes. Banks, shops and houses, nothing
can stop a master thief but it could be a
long apprenticeship.
For the earthbound warrior there is US
Gold's Beach head. The limited memory
does not allow for all of  the screens
contained in the C64 version but you do
get the aircraft attack, battleship bom-
bardment and the ﬁnal fortress. Despite
the dubious claim t o 'amazing sound'
emblazoned o n  t he cassette in  bold
capitals, the game displays something of
what c an b e  done w ith t he C-16's
graphics.
In glorious 3D graphics, your ship must
bring down the enemy planes which zero
in from the horizon and then bring the big
guns to bear on the ﬂeet of warships
which block your way. In both cases it is
essential to gauge the correct inclination
for the guns to hit each target before they
land enough shots tct ﬁnish your ships off.
The ﬁnal battle brings you in conﬂict
with t h e  enemy's largest and mos t
accurate cannon. There are 10 targets on
the fortress beneath the cannon and each
target must be hit when it turns white.
When all have been destroyed the large
cannon begins to rotate towards your ship
and you must score a direct hit on the
weapon before it ﬁres because it never
misses. One hit destroys another of your
ships so speed and accuracy is of the
essence to succeed. This game lacks the
addictive qualities  o f  t h e  other s
mentioned so far but the quality of the
graphic displays is so cleverly achieved
that i t  deserves a  place in  any C-16
collection.
Sports fanatics are also catered for with
the C-16• Ocean has converted Daley
Thompson's Star Events for the joystick
waggling armchair athletes_ The game
comes in two parts, side one contains four
track events and side two has three ﬁeld
competitions. The track events are the
most frantic, partly because they last
longer than the ﬁeld events and therefore
require a degree of stamina for success.
The events comprise of the 100 metres,
110 metres hurdles, the gruelling 400
metres, with the 200 metres hurdles
following close on its heels. The animated
graphics are also cleverly done but this is
not the sort of game where you spend
your time admiring the scenery! Provision
has not been made to carry your results
through to the events on side two which is
a pity. On my tape this side wouldn't load
but I'll accept Ocean's word that the long
jump, shot-put and javelin events are just
as enjoyably challenging.
For s ophis tic ation I  pr efer r ed
Imagine's World Series Baseball_ Not only
do you get a 3D image of the diamond but
there is also a giant video screen in the
background which shows a close up view
of the action.

Control is complex with all of the
joystick positions having a bearing on
various nuances of the gameplay. The
animation is outstanding and with a little
practice any novice can be hitting home
runs, stealing bases and pitching fast balls
with the best o f  them. Perhaps after
learning the basics by playing this game,
baseball c o u ld  c hallenge American
Football as a new spectator sport in this
country.
So far none of these games has been
particularly demanding on the old grey
matter. Rushing in to ﬁll this gap is an
adventure game from Bug Byte.
Although Twin Kingdom Valley has
been available for the C64 for quite some
time now, this C-16 version is pretty new.
The game has been condensed by
removing the graphics and some of the
less important locations of the original.
I've always felt that the graphics in an
adventure limit a  player's imagination
(though I admit that this criticism is often
cited in defence of radio drama over
television!), so I'd rather play a complex
text adventure than a limited multi-image
game.
A nice touch is that the arrow and
function keys are fully utilised to reduce
the amount o f  typing necessary. The
vocabulary is  a  little limited, action
commands being selected from a list of 33
words. Not bad considering.
The idea is to wander about the Valley
amassing as much treasure as possible.
The pathways and caverns are patrolled
by a variety of creatures who may turn out
to be good or evil. As in life, the only way
you can divide the wolves from the sheep
86
is to cautiously try to befriend everyone
you meet. Unlike life, if you die you can
always try again.
There is no SAVE facility which means
that you must start again each time you
begin a session. This is a deﬁnite irritation
but you can't have everything.
For me the ultimate brain stretcher is
chess and my selection here would be
Audiogenic's Grand Master. Playing
against the computer is possible at a wide
range of skill levels from novice to Grand
Master.
The board is shown in plan view only
and you can get the computer to suggest a
move if you get really stuck. You can even
leave the computer to play itself if you
prefer but there isn't a two player option.
This is true of most chess simulations
based on the acceptable argument that
the two player game is best played on a
real board.
If the publicity blurb is to be believed,
Grand Master claims to be the best chess
game around. Whether you believe this
or not is immaterial to me, whatever the
truth my brain is well and truly taxed by
this game. Well worth checking out.
The ﬁnal game in this round up is by far
the most impressive game I have seen on
the C-16. ACE is a ﬂight simulator (Air
Combat Emulator) with stunningly fast-
acting graphics.
As a ﬁghter pilot, you ﬁnd yourself
already zipping through the ether at the
beginning of the simulation. The control
panel has all the necessary indicators to
give you a fair chance to stay in the air
and t h e  radar displays the enemies'
positions.
The aim is to seek out and destroy the
enemy planes using the radar at ﬁrst
followed by visual tracking through the
cockpit window. Trying to keep a plane in
your sights as he dodges and ﬁres at you is
not very easy to do and low altitude aero-
batics must only  b e  indulged i n  by
experts.
Full control over the jet is possible;
climbing, diving, rolling and looping are
all catered for and keeping track of the
jet's orientation can be extremely difﬁcult
in the heat of battle. No collection can be
considered complete without ACE.
It's not often tha,t we have good news
for Plus/4 owner's but Cascade have just
brought out a specially expanded and
improved version o f  ACE f o r  these
machines (reviewed in this issue of Your
Commodore.). Buy  it, it's money well
spent.
Well that ends this little round up,
next month I'll be looking at more serious
applications software for the C-16. In the
meantime why not drop me a line at the

you particular favourite game on the
good old C-16. If enough people disagree
with my selection I'll give your games a
whizz and see if I agree. You can reach me

It's easy to complain
about advertisements.
But which ones?
Every week millions of advertisements appear in print, on posters or
in the cinema.
Most of them comply with the rules contained in the British Code of
Advertising Practice.
But some of them break the rules and warrant your complaints.
If you're not sure about which ones they are, however, drop us a line
and we'll send you an abridged copy of the Advertising Code.
Then, if an advertisement bothers you, you'll be justiﬁed in
bothering us.
The Advertising Standards Authority
If an advertisement is wrong,wre here to put it right.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start --- but can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT were very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works, Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a space ﬂight
simulator, Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!
SUPERSOFT, Winchester House. Canning Road,
Wealdstone, Harrow, Middlesex HA3 75J
Telephone: 01-861 1166
Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICIREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands, or
on disk there's MASTER EA, a really corn-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIX, ()LANK
and KAMIKAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders, But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
