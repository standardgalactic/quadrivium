Dedication
From Greg: To my family, to Tarsah, and to the mentors, colleagues, and stu-
dents who have shared their insights, their enthusiasm, and their friendship.
And to everyone who’s ever wondered what evolution really is and to anyone
who’s ever been struck by the beautiful and amazing diversity of life on Earth. 
Acknowledgments
From Greg: I’d like to thank my friends and colleagues who were always telling
me, “Greg, you should write more” and who encouraged me throughout the
project. It turns out that I did have a book in me, but it definitely took a village
to help me find my voice. To say that I got by with a little help from my friends
doesn’t begin to describe my gratitude for the both the general encouragement
and the numerous specific helpful suggestions I was so fortunate to receive.
I would also like to give thanks for the limitless amount of patience that has
been shown me in the face of an ever-changing and over extended schedule,
late nights, canceled plans, and the various unexpected challenges inherent
in such a project. A special thanks goes to Stacy Kennedy and the other folks
at Wiley who were instrumental in bringing this book to life.
Finally I’d like to acknowledge the many conversations about evolution I’ve
had with random strangers I’ve met on airplanes, in coffee shops, and at
cocktail parties — everywhere from the top of a cold mountain in New
Hampshire to a toasty warm pub in New Zealand. I learned a lot from those
conversations about what people want to know about evolution and where
things get confusing, and I’ve tried to address these areas in this book.

Introduction
E
volution is the process by which populations and species change over
time. The principles of evolution explain why life on Earth is so varied
and why organisms are the way they are. The study of evolution is not only
interesting for its own sake, but it’s also a fundamental part of the biological
sciences. You can’t understand (or combat) disease, can’t understand the
history of species (or the world, for that matter) — can’t do a lot of things,
in fact, without understanding evolution.
Simply put, evolution is the key scientific principle behind every substantive
thing we know about biology, the study of living things. And its main points
are remarkably easy to understand.
So why did I write a whole book about evolution? Because a lot of people are
confused about exactly what evolution is, what it does, how it works, and
why it’s important. This book helps you sort everything out.
About This Book
You may have the sense that only the super-smart can understand any
branch of science. If you didn’t see the point of being able to identify the
parts of a cell, or you didn’t like memorizing the periodic table of elements,
your experience confirms that sense. And you’ve probably figured out that
you’re no Einstein, but — here’s a secret — most scientists (including yours
truly) aren’t Einsteins either.
In fact, the smart money says that Einstein was so smart that most of the rest
of us aren’t smart enough even to know how smart he was. A possible excep-
tion may be someone like Stephen Hawking, but none of us is smart enough to
know how smart he is, either. But I digress. The point is that you don’t have
to be an Einstein or a Hawking to “get” science. As I’m fond of saying to my
students, evolution isn’t rocket science — and for that matter, rocket science
isn’t rocket science either.
I wrote this book to help you overcome whatever natural reluctance you may
have about reading an evolution book and to clear away the confusion
caused by all the bad info out there. To that end, I’ve divided each chapter

into sections that contain information about some component of evolution or
one of the many hot topics that evolutionary biology helps people under-
stand, such as:
 What natural selection is and how it works
 How to trace the evolutionary history of organisms
 The evolutionary component of social systems
 Where modern man came from
 How diseases evolve, and what scientists are doing to fight them
If there’s one thing I want you to take away from this book, it’s this: The lion’s
share of science, if explained clearly, is accessible to everyone. Sure, you
have to be an expert in the field to fully grasp the importance of the details.
But the broad strokes should be accessible to everyone, and that is certainly
the case for evolutionary biology.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate easily, this book uses a few standard conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are
defined.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
 You’ll also see quite a bit of we in this book. Sometimes, we refers to me
and other experts in the field of evolution. At other times, we refers to
me and you. Just like you, I am constantly amazed by and in awe of the
beauty of evolution.
What You’re Not to Read
I love everything about evolution: the big points, the little points, the so-eso-
teric-that-no-one-but-other-evolutionary-biologists-will-find-them-even-
remotely-interesting points. I’d love to think that you’re just as enamored of
evolution as I am, but being a realist (and scientist), I have to face facts: You
probably aren’t. So to meet my need (to include as much information as pos-
sible) and yours (to get to the key points quickly), I’ve made it easy for you to
identify material that you can safely skip:
2

 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear here
and there. They aren’t necessary reading.
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached: This information is
interesting but not critical to your understanding of evolution.
Foolish Assumptions
Every book is written with a particular reader in mind, and this one is no dif-
ferent. As I wrote this book, I made a few assumptions about you:
 You’ve heard about Charles Darwin but aren’t quite clear about what he
actually said or why it was so revolutionary.
 You’re confused by all the contradictory claims you hear about evolu-
tion and want to know what the science actually says.
 You’re curious about the evolution of species, both in general — where
do they come from, for example — and more close to home, such as the
evolution of our own species and the diseases that plague us and which
seem to grow more dangerous with every new generation.
 You’ve seen the 1960 film Inherit the Wind, and beyond noting that Darrin
Stephens is the defendant, you want to know the science behind the
events depicted.
 Even though you know that 99.9999 percent of scientists accept the
theory of evolution, you need proof that these 99.9999 percent aren’t
wrong.
How This Book Is Organized
To help you find information that you’re looking for, this book is divided into
five parts. Each part covers a particular aspect of evolution and contains
chapters relating to that part.
Part I: What Evolution Is
Look up the word evolution in a dictionary, and you’ll come across a definition
that says something about change or maybe change through time. That’s good
as far as it goes. But in the context of biology, evolution refers to specific
3
Introduction

changes — genetic changes — in a group of organisms through time. That con-
cept isn’t so hard to grasp, but you may be surprised by how revolutionary
the idea of evolution was in the mid-1800s, when Darwin came up with his
theory explaining what could cause such changes (natural selection).
Back then, the concept that species could change over time — even the con-
cept of vast time spans — was foreign and frightening to most people. But
facts are facts, evidence has a way of piling up, and the science of evolution-
ary biology has progressed in the century and a half since Darwin’s major
insight.
This part introduces the key principles of evolution by natural selection. And
because to grasp the main idea, you need to know a bit about genetics, the
part includes a brief discussion of that topic, too. If it makes you feel any
better (and it should), reading this short discussion of genetics puts you in
the position of knowing more about genetics and heredity than Darwin him-
self did.
Part II: How Evolution Works
Sometimes, evolution is the result of natural selection. Other times, it’s the
result of random factors (genetic drift). Populations have variability; not all
the individuals are the same, and sometimes individuals with particular
genetic traits leave more descendant than others. That’s evolution in a nut
shell: The next generation is genetically different from the last one because
not everybody’s genes made it! These changes can have big effects on popu-
lations. Sometimes they end up with altered proportions of different variants
(more fast cheetahs than slow ones, for example). Sometimes, they lose
genetic variation, and sometimes, just sometimes, populations speciate (that
is, form a new species). 
You can consider this part to be the nuts-and-bolts section of the book,
because it explains that biological variation exists, where this variation
comes from, and the different ways it can change through time. Plus this is
the part where I explain how scientists can watch evolution happen both in
laboratory experiments and in nature, as well as how they can use data about
species today to come up with strong hypothesis about evolution in the past. 
Part III: What Evolution Does
Evolution is no more complicated than genetic changes accumulating
through time. Sounds almost boring, yet it’s anything but boring. Because all
those changes in the DNA, which you can’t even see (outside a biology lab)
influence all the things about living creatures that you cannot only see, but
4
Evolution For Dummies 

also be amazed by. Look out the window at nature’s diversity: Evolution did
that! Evolution has a pretty big impact on lots of things you can observe
about life, such as: 
 Physical characteristics (petal color, length of tail, eye color, and so on)
 Body shape (number of fins, fingers, limbs, and heads, for example)
 Sexual selection (who mates with whom, how, and why)
 Life histories (reproduction and life spans)
 Social behaviors (competitive, altruistic, and so on)
This part covers ’em all.
Part IV: Evolution and Your World
Two things hold folks’ attention better than anything else: themselves and
things that affect them. This part covers both topics, beginning with human
evolution to explain where we came from (out of Africa), whether we’re
unique among all the animals in creation (it turns out that we aren’t; quite a
few other hominid species preceded us, and a couple even shared the Earth
with us for a while), and how we continue to evolve.
The remainder of the part delves into antibiotic resistance and the evolution
of two scourges: HIV and influenza. Why the shift from the exalted Us to the
microbial Them? Because these buggers can and do wreak havoc on humans
by evolving so quickly and in response to the very medications we use to
fight them. Perhaps you’ve seen on the news that bacteria have “acquired” or
“developed” antibiotic resistance. Those are just other ways of saying that
these bacteria have evolved resistance to our antibiotics — a problem that
we need to stay on top of.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Throughout the book, I spend a lot of time talking about the fossil record and
adaptations, explaining what they are and why they’re important to evolu-
tionary study. But in this part, I list the fossils and adaptations that are par-
ticularly fun or revealing.
I also include the only response you’re going to find to the challenges people
throw at evolution. The purpose of these challenges isn’t to clarify the sci-
ence of evolution but to promote a particular theology. Unfortunately, the
challengers do this by misstating scientific facts, which I clear up in this part.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book help you find particular kinds of information that may
be of use to you.
Sometimes, you can understand a scientific point by looking at it a little dif-
ferently or comparing it to something similar, and this icon appears next to
material that helps you do that.
This icon points out evolutionary principles that you want to remember
because they’re important to the topic at hand or because they’re fundamen-
tal to understanding evolutionary biology.
This icon appears beside information that is interesting but not necessary to
know. In fact, feel free to skip the info here, if you want. Doing so won’t impair
your understanding of evolution.
Sure, I could just tell you what evolutionary biologists say about evolution,
but I prefer to show you how they know. This icon appears next to sections
about scientific experiments designed to test evolutionary processes. And
because the whole point of experiments is to test an idea, not to build up
proof that the idea is right, some of these case studies end up revealing
things that the researchers didn’t necessarily expect.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so that you can go wherever you want to find com-
plete information. Want to know about the role natural selection plays in evo-
lution? Head to Chapter 5. If you’re interested in the link between individual
fitness and how certain social systems develop, go to Chapter 11. You can
use the table of contents to find broad categories of information or the index
to look up more specific things.
If you’re just beginning to learn about evolution, I suggest that you start with
Part I. It gives you all the basic information about evolutionary principles and
points to places where you can find more detailed information.

volution is the process that explains how organisms
change over time. It’s really as simple — and as 
profound — as that. And in this part, I begin with the very
basics: key evolutionary principles, from Darwin’s day to
today. You’ll also find a very brief discussion of genetics.
Why? Because the only changes that are important to 
evolutionary study are genetic ones.

volution. You’ve no doubt heard about it, and you’ve probably seen
a show or two about it on TV, but its significance likely escapes you.
Watching a bunch of scientists on the Discovery Channel dig in the dirt with
little toothbrushes and get really excited about some little bit of bone or a
tooth may leave you thinking, “Well, yes, those do look like teeth, and they
certainly do seem old, but . . .” A tooth, you say to yourself, is hardly reason
to trade high fives and uncork champagne bottles. At times like these, evolu-
tion can seem pretty slippery. After all, there’s got to be more to it than a
stray fossilized tooth or bone fragment. 
Well, there is. Evolution explains how we (and I’m using we collectively to
mean all living organisms: you, me, and all other animals; moss, trees, and
the roses in your garden; viruses, amoebas, bacteria, and all the other little
critters) came to be in all our complexity and variation. The reason scientists
get excited about fossilized teeth is because findings like these are consistent
with what scientists understand about the evolution of life on Earth. That
single tooth is just one piece of the evolutionary puzzle; thousands more
pieces exist. All together, those pieces form a picture of our genetic past and
a road map that leads from a common ancestor to who, and what, we are
today. It’s a journey over billions of years.
This chapter gives you an overview of evolution in all its glory: what it is,
how it works, and what it does. By the end, you may begin to understand
what the great evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky meant when
he wrote, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.”

Biological Evolution at a Glance
Evolution can be defined simply as change through time, and it can refer to
anything that changes. Languages evolve; tastes evolve; cultures, art forms,
and football offense strategy all evolve. This book isn’t about evolution in
general, though, but about biological evolution: the changes, over time, in
organisms.
Biological evolution deals with a very specific type of change through time  —
changes in the frequencies of different genes  —  throughout an entire species,
or within a single population of that species, from generation to generation.
Evolutionary biologists —  scientists who study evolution  —  just love that
stuff. Their mission? To understand how evolution works (by figuring out what
causes changes in gene frequencies) and what evolution does (by figuring out
what sorts of things happen when gene frequencies change).
The following sections offer a general overview of how evolution works and
what it does. Parts II and III delve into these topics in a great deal more detail.
Gene defined
Back in Charles Darwin’s day, a gene was defined simply as the unit of hered-
ity. People knew that specific traits, such as blue eyes or red hair, were
passed from parent to child, but they didn’t know exactly what a gene was or
how the process worked. Today, we know a lot more:
 We know about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is what gets passed
from parent to offspring.
 We know that DNA is a long molecule made up of a string of four subunits
(four letters); that the order of these letters, commonly called the DNA
sequence, stores genetic information; and that a gene is a particular
sequence of a particular piece of an organism’s DNA.
 We’ve developed the chemical techniques that allow researchers to
determine the exact sequence of an organism’s DNA. As a result of this
ability to work with DNA, scientists have a much better handle on the
details of the evolutionary process.
What this means — and why it’s important enough to include here — is that
by being able to identify the DNA sequence of a particular gene, scientists
can measure exactly what genetic changes occur across generations. Being
able to measure things, especially things like DNA strands, gets evolutionary
biologists all goose-pimply. (For more information about genes and DNA,
head to Chapter 3.)
10
Part I: What Evolution Is 

What’s the (gene) frequency, Kenneth?
Simply put, the frequency of a particular gene is how often it appears in a pop-
ulation. When researchers examine the DNA sequence at a particular location
in a species’ DNA in different individuals, they sometimes find that all the
individuals have the same sequence. In this case, because only one gene (or
one DNA sequence) exists at this location, its frequency is 100 percent. At
other times, different sequences are present in different individuals. In this
case, when more than one gene is present at this location, scientists speak
of the frequencies of the different genes.
Suppose that you’ve discovered three different DNA sequences; call them
genes A, B, and, C. If half the individuals you examine have gene A, one
quarter have gene B, and one quarter have gene C, the frequencies of
the three genes are 50 percent gene A, 25 percent gene B, and 25 percent
gene C.
By identifying changes in the frequency of particular genes through the
passing of generations, you can determine whether the organism has
evolved. Using the example of genes A, B, and C from the preceding section,
if you came back generations later to measure the frequency of these three
genes again, and you found that the frequencies had changed, evolution has
happened.
Here’s an example: Suppose that you collect a bunch of a particular kind
of bacteria and measure the frequency of the gene that makes the bacteria
resistant to a new type of antibiotic. In your initial count, you find that the
frequency of this gene is extremely low: Less than 1 percent of the bacteria
have the gene that makes them antibiotic resistant. You come back in a
few years. Your original bacteria are gone, but in their place are their great-
great-great-great-etcetera grandkids, and you repeat the analysis. This time,
you find that 30 percent of the bacteria have the antibiotic-resistant gene.
Although you haven’t actually witnessed evolution, you’re looking at its
result: the change in the frequency of particular genes over time. The
antibiotic-resistant gene appeared in less than 1 percent of the original
bacteria; it appears in 30 percent of the descendents. (Go to Chapter 17
for an in-depth discussion of the evolution of antibiotic resistance in
bacteria.)
In a nutshell, biological evolution is simply a change in the frequency of
one or more genes through time. Scientists collect this sort of data about
the occurrence of evolution all the time  —  not only for bacteria, but also
for all sorts of organisms, both simple and complex.
11
Chapter 1: What Evolution Is and Why You Need to Know 

The timescales of evolution
Although the changes in gene frequencies happen gradually through time, the
rate of evolution isn’t constant. Gene frequencies can remain constant for long
periods of time and then change in response to changes in the environment.
The rate of change can increase or decrease, but the basic process — gene fre-
quencies changing over time — continues. To differentiate between these time
scales of the evolutionary process, scientists use the terms microevolution
and macroevolution:
 Microevolution refers to the results of the evolutionary process over
short time scales and small changes. An example is a bacterium in a lab-
oratory beaker experiencing a mutation that creates a gene that confers
higher growth and division rates relative to the other bacteria and
beaker. Microevolution, because it happens on a time scale that we’re
able to observe, tends to be a bit easier for us to wrap our brains around
than macroevolution.
 Macroevolution refers to the results of the evolutionary process typi-
cally among species (or above the species level; see Chapter 11) over
long periods. Nothing is different about the process; nothing special is
happening. Macroevolution simply refers to the larger changes
researchers can observe when evolution has been going on for a longer
time and involves processes such as extinction, which may have little to
do with microevolution. Speciation, the process whereby one species
gives rise to two, is an example of macroevolution. Speciation isn’t all
that complicated, and scientists are getting a pretty good idea about
how it works; you can find out more in Chapter 8.
Other than the time frame, no difference exists between micro- and
macroevolution. The process isn’t any different from what scientists can
observe in a test tube in the laboratory (an example of microevolution);
there’s just been a lot more of it.
Gene extremes: Mutation and extinction
Genes can go to extremes. At one extreme is the disappearing gene. Suppose
that you measure the frequency of the three different genes at a particular site
in a species’ DNA and then return some years later to find that one of the genes
is no longer present. That gene’s frequency has dropped to zero. It’s gone. It’s
extinct. When a gene goes extinct, the species that had the gene is still around,
but at least at this particular location in its DNA, it’s not as diverse.
At the other extreme, new genes can appear. The process by which the
sequence of a parent’s DNA is copied and passed on to the next generation is
remarkably accurate. If it weren’t, none of us would be here. But no process
12
Part I: What Evolution Is 

is perfect, and mistakes happen. These mistakes are called mutations, and
they can result in a DNA sequence different from the original — in other
words, a new, different gene. These new genes can affect the functioning of
the organism in several ways:
 They can have no effect at all. Because there’s a certain amount of
redundancy in the code of the DNA sequence (go to Chapter 3 for the
details), it’s possible to change a letter here and there with no effect
whatsoever. Even if the mutation does create a change, that change may
not affect how the gene product functions. In both cases, the new genes
don’t have an impact — either positive or negative — on whether an
organism survives.
 They can result in a change that’s harmful to the organism. Most muta-
tions that cause a change fall into this category. Even the simplest organ-
isms are really quite complicated. If you change something randomly,
most often the outcome is bad. Genes of this sort vanish as rapidly as
they appear.
Occasionally, bad mutations  —  which typically are destined for a short
run before becoming extinct  —  actually increase in frequency. Here’s
how it could happen: If a gene with negative effects is present in the
same critter as a gene with positive effects, the frequency of the bad
gene can increase as it rides the evolutionary coattails of the really great
new gene. Suppose that two mutations occur simultaneously in different
locations on an organism’s DNA: one resulting in a gene that is slightly
harmful and another resulting in a gene that is advantageous. The
slightly harmful gene may increase in frequency simply because it’s
along for the ride.
 They can result in a change that’s advantageous to the organism. This
class of mutations is by far the rarest, but beneficial mutations do occur.
These mutations, although rare, can increase in frequency. Ultimately,
they’re the source of all the variation upon which evolution by natural
selection acts. (Skip to Chapter 4 for more detail about the role variation
plays in evolution.)
All the different genes in all the organisms on earth started out as mutations
that, though initially rare, ended up increasing in frequency. As the source of
new genes, mutations are a key part of the evolutionary process. A gene can’t
increase or decrease in frequency until it first appears, and mutations are
how that happens.
Darwin and His Big Ideas
You can’t talk about evolution without talking about Charles Darwin
(1809–1882), a would-be physician and theologian whose fascination with
natural history and geography led him to accept a position as gentleman’s
13
Chapter 1: What Evolution Is and Why You Need to Know 

companion to the captain of the HMS Beagle, a ship bound for South America
with the purpose of mapping the area and sending plant, animal, and fossil
specimens back to England. The voyage lasted five years, from 1831 to 1836.
Several things led Darwin to speculate about the changes that might occur in
species over time: the diversity of life he observed on his voyage, the geo-
graphical patterns whereby different yet obviously related species were
found in close proximity to one another, and the fossils he collected that
made it clear present-day species weren’t the ones that had been present in
the past.
Darwin returned to England in 1836, already well known in the scientific com-
munity for the specimens and detailed notes that he had sent back. By 1838,
Darwin had developed in more detail his theory of how gradual changes
resulting from natural selection could result in changes in existing species as
well as the formation of new ones. Over roughly the next 20 years, Darwin
continued to develop and refine his ideas. In 1859, he published his seminal
work, On the Origin of Species, which laid out the foundations of evolutionary
theory. The following sections hit the highlights of Darwin’s ideas. His other
works include The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871) and
The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872).
Find the title On the Origin of Species a bit cryptic? Roll the full title around
your mouth for a while: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection,
or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. The shorter ver-
sion may not be as descriptive, but it certainly is easier to remember  —
and say! You can read it (and all of Darwin’s other works) at http://
darwin-online.org.uk/.
Darwin didn’t use the word gene; instead, in his work, he referred to charac-
ters. Yet because his ideas focused on heritable characters (that is, those that
can be passed from parent to offspring), his “characters” are directly linked
to genes.
Natural selection
One of Darwin’s big ideas was what he called natural selection, the mechanism
that he proposed to explain what he called “descent with modification” —
that is, changes in an organism through subsequent generations. (Today,
we’d say that natural selection explains how gene frequencies could change
over generations.) This big idea, explained in depth in Chapter 5, is both
remarkably insightful and remarkably simple, which explains why it’s stood
the test of time.
14
Part I: What Evolution Is 

Basically, Darwin recognized that some characters get passed from one
generation to the next and others don’t. What he wanted to understand
was how descent with modification could have occurred. What was the
underlying driving force? He concluded that the driving force was the
process of natural selection: Not all individuals in a given generation have an
equal chance of contributing to the next generation. Some are selectively
favored; some are selected against.
Darwin surmised that natural selection worked the same way as the process
of artificial selection used in animal husbandry and agriculture:
 Artificial selection: Since before Darwin’s time, people have been selec-
tively breeding animals and plants: chickens that lay more eggs, cows
that make more milk, pansies that are brighter and last longer . . . and the
list goes on. Essentially, humans have been pretty apt hands at spurring
evolution in agriculturally important plants and animals. We decide
which genes are more likely to make into the next generation. The cows
that produce more milk are the ones that we selectively breed to produce
better dairy cows; the ones that make less milk, we eat. As a result of the
choices we humans make as selecting agents, we can dramatically alter in
a relatively short period the characteristics of the organisms we breed.
 Natural selection: Darwin realized that if humans, by the process of arti-
ficial selection, could create such major differences over the extremely
short period of time, then the natural environment, acting over a much
longer time scale, could have produced much larger changes. Darwin
called his process natural selection because the natural environment, not
humans, was the selecting agent.
In artificial selection, farmers and breeders determine which characters they
like and work to propagate in their produce and livestock. In natural selection,
the same type of selection occurs, but the selecting factor isn’t man, but
nature, or the environment in which the organism exists. To help you under-
stand the difference between artificial and natural selection, consider the cow.
In the barnyard, farmers selectively favor the cow that makes the most milk; in
the wild, natural selection favors the cow that can make enough milk to feed its
calf and still do all the other things the cow needs to do to survive on its own.
Whether natural selection favors an individual is a function of the individual’s
particular heritable characters. Some heritable characters increase the prob-
ability that the individuals containing them will contribute to the next genera-
tion; some characters decrease the probability that individuals will
contribute to the next generation. What all this means is that organisms in
the first category reproduce more than do the organisms in the second cate-
gory. That’s what makes one generation different from the next, the next dif-
ferent from the one that follows it, and the one that follows it different from
the one that comes later . . . and so on and so forth, ad infinitum.
15
Chapter 1: What Evolution Is and Why You Need to Know 

Here’s an example: Imagine a population of lions. Half the lions have the
work-hard-run-fast-and-catch-lots-of-gazelles character. The other half have
the sit-around-and-be-lazy character. It’s tough in the Serengeti, and only the
lions with the work-hard-run-fast character manage to store up enough
energy to reproduce and raise offspring successfully. If you reanalyze this
population after a few generations have passed and find fewer lions with the
lazy character, that’s evolution driven by natural selection!
Speciation
Darwin realized that because individuals differ in the characters they have,
and because these differences affect their chances of survival and reproduc-
tion, some characters are more likely to get into the next generation than
others. He also realized that as a result of this process, the frequency of char-
acters changes over generations. Pass through enough generations, and the
sum of all the little evolutionary changes may result in an organism that’s
evolved into an entirely different species.
Here’s a quick example: Imagine you have two populations of the same animal.
Each population lives in a different place, and the populations rarely inter-
breed. The selective forces in those two places — the combination of things we
16
Part I: What Evolution Is 
In case you’re curious: Survival of the fittest
Although he didn’t coin the phrase survival of
the fittest, Darwin did make it a household term.
Many people assume (erroneously) that it
means the natural order mandates that the
strong survive and the weak die away. But to
Darwin and other evolutionists, survival of the
fittest is simply synonymous with natural selec-
tion. In other words, those organisms that pos-
sess selectively favored heritable characters
are the ones that pass their genes into the
future with the most success. 
This sidebar marks the first and the last time
you’ll see this phrase in this book. Why?
 It’s problematic. The phrase doesn’t clarify
the concept Darwin was trying to explain
(although he no doubt thought it did; other-
wise, he wouldn’t have used it). To express
the concept more clearly, Darwin could
have used the term survival and differential
reproduction of the fittest, but that’s just not
as sexy.
 It doesn’t make much sense semantically. In
beginning a study of evolution, students
often say, “Well, if evolution is survival of the
fittest, and the fittest are the ones that sur-
vive, that seems pretty circular.” Indeed, it is.
 Even evolutionary biologists never use it.
They use natural selection instead. 
Don’t let any of this get in the way of your devel-
oping an understanding of the term fitness,
however; that word is crucially important to
understanding evolution. Head to the section
“How ‘fitness’ fits in with natural selection” for
details.

call the environment — is different. In one environment, it’s good to have a long
beak; in the other environment, a short beak is better. Other significant envi-
ronmental differences exist as well. It’s very wet on one side of the mountain
range and very dry on the other, for example. In two such different environ-
ments, gene frequencies change in one way in the first location and another
way in the second. Over a long period, the two populations become so different
that they can no longer interbreed. They have become different species.
Today, scientists can identify all the stages of speciation in the natural world.
They can find pairs of species that seem to have diverged from a single
species very recently, and they can find pairs of populations that appear to
be on the verge of becoming separate species. In some cases, the two popula-
tions are so close to becoming different species that all it would take is some
minor habitat change to push them that last little bit and turn one species
into two. For more detailed information about speciation, head to Chapter 8.
The idea of speciation got Darwin into a lot of hot water, and it’s a hot-button
issue today because it links organisms to common ancestors, which is all well
and good for things like fish, oak trees, and invertebrates. But when you
throw humans into the mix  —  whoa, Nelly. To read more about the conflict
between evolutionary science and those who deny it, head to Chapter 22.
How “fitness” fits in with natural selection
The process of evolution by natural selection is driven by differences in fit-
ness, or how successful an organism is at getting its genes (or characters)
into the next generation. In short, fitness is all about how well an organism
reproduces. Characters (or genes) that increase an individual’s fitness are
more likely to be passed to the next generation than genes that don’t. This
process is how the frequency of genes changes through time.
In the evolutionary process, fitness has nothing to do with how buff you are.
It’s purely a measure of the differential reproductive success among different
individuals, which is a fancy way of saying that it refers to how successful an
individual is at producing offspring. If one individual produces twice as many
offspring as the next individual, all other things being equal, it’s twice as fit.
Understanding adaptive characters
Some evolutionary changes are adaptive, meaning that a character has
changed as a result of natural selection in a way that makes that character
better suited to perform its function. Here’s an example of the process of
adaptation: Gazelles run away from cheetahs. The slow gazelles get eaten,
leaving the faster gazelles to reproduce. In the next generation, the gazelles
are faster on average than those in the past generation, because the run-
away-from-cheetahs character has evolved. Being able to run really, really
fast is an adaptation.
17
Chapter 1: What Evolution Is and Why You Need to Know 

It’s not always easy to tell whether a particular character is an adaptation
because sometimes things that appear to be adaptive characters aren’t.
Suppose that you have a cat and decide to put its food outside. At some
point, you notice that birds eat the cat food. Knowing a bit about evolution,
you think that eating from the cat dish may well be good for the birds; they
probably have more energy to sing songs, build nests, and raise baby birds. If
you observe such successful foraging behavior in a different environment,
you might conclude that the birds are foraging in your cat dish as the result
of natural selection. But eating cat food isn’t an adaptation (the birds haven’t
evolved to eat out of cat dishes); it’s opportunistic. The food’s available, and
the cat . . . well, he’s probably trapped behind a patio door. For more about
adaptive characters, go to Chapter 5.
The Study of Evolution, Post-Darwin
Darwin had only a vague idea of what genes were and didn’t know squat
about DNA, but he hit the evolutionary nail on the head. Today, scientists
know that the process of evolution by natural selection occurs pretty much
the way Darwin first proposed it: Natural selection results in changes over
time in any given population, and good genes (those that make the organism
more fit — that is, more successful at surviving long enough to reproduce)
become more frequent over time. Still, scientists’ understanding of evolution
has continued to evolve as they expand the theory of evolution to include
some elements Darwin was unable to address:
 Many DNA mutations are selectively neutral. The DNA code contains a
certain amount of redundancy, which means that many changes in the
DNA don’t result in a fitness advantage or a fitness cost. The extent to
which these genes increase or decrease in a population has entirely to
do with chance.
 Chance can be an important factor contributing to the change in gene
frequencies through time. Imagine that half the deer in the forest have
blue eyes, and half have brown eyes. Now suppose that a couple of trees
fall over and accidentally crush a couple of deer with blue eyes. All
other things being equal, the next generation will have a higher propor-
tion of the brown-eyed gene than the previous generation. Evolution has
happened, but not as a result of natural selection. (Yes, I know that deer
don’t have blue eyes; it’s just an example.) For more information on how
chance factors into the evolutionary process, head to Chapter 6.
I can imagine what you must be thinking: Two deer more or less are
hardly going to make much of a difference. In a large population, you’d
be right, but in a small population, a few deer more or less can make a
difference that would be noticed in the future. When the population is
large, chance events aren’t as important, but when the population is
small, random events can have larger repercussions. 
18
Part I: What Evolution Is 

 Not all the characteristics of any particular organism are positively
correlated with fitness. This idea stems from scientists’ understanding
that not all evolutionary change is the result of natural selection.
Sometimes, it’s the result of chance; sometimes, it’s the result of bad
genes hitching a ride into the future with the good genes that made the
organism more fit. 
 The environment affects fitness. Populations in different places experi-
ence different selective forces. A gene for being able to survive a long
time without water, for example, may offer a fitness advantage in the
desert, but it may have rather negative consequences in a rain forest.
Interaction between the gene and its environment is important in deter-
mining whether a given gene increases or decreases fitness. 
Sickle cell anemia is an example of how the environment determines whether
a particular gene increases or decreases fitness. The gene that causes sickle
cell anemia produces a slightly different form of hemoglobin. The most extreme
case occurs when someone has two copies of the sickle cell gene: one from 
the mother and one from the father. But even having just one sickle cell gene
causes illness. At first glance, it seems obvious that this gene wouldn’t increase
anyone’s fitness, yet it’s present in high frequencies in certain areas of Africa.
By examining the system from an evolutionary perspective, scientists learned
an interesting thing about the sickle cell gene: Having a copy of this gene helps
protect against malaria, which is present in those areas of Africa where the
gene occurs at high frequency. So yes, it’s bad to have this gene in the current
era in the United States. But in the days before antimalaria drugs, it was a good
gene to have in parts of Africa.
Applying Evolution Today
Evolution is interesting purely for its own sake, but of course, I would think
that, having devoted years to studying, teaching, and writing about it. But
evolution is good for more than just student lectures and small talk in acade-
mic circles: Understanding what evolution is and how it works makes all
sorts of things possible. The following sections give a small sampling of how
scientists apply aspects of evolutionary biology. You can find many more
examples throughout this book.
Conservation
Understanding evolution helps conservationists in their efforts to protect
endangered species. When resources are limited, as they often are, scientists
have to make choices about which natural areas to protect and which popu-
lations of species to focus on. Understanding evolution can help them decide
where to devote resources. 
19
Chapter 1: What Evolution Is and Why You Need to Know 

For example, many people think that the key to protecting endangered
species is to conserve the maximum number of individuals possible. But
understanding evolutionary biology and the patterns of variation present in
natural populations helps us recognize that the real key is conserving genetic
variability. If two populations are genetically different, part of a viable conver-
sation management plan is maintaining this diversity, for two reasons:
 This diversity is a characteristic of the species that the scientists are
trying to protect.
 The naturally existing variation allows the species to respond to future
changes in the environment.
Another thing that evolution teaches — specifically, evolution by random
events — is that we can’t allow endangered populations to reach critically
low numbers. In small populations, the variations scientists are trying to con-
serve — the very essence of what makes a particular species unique — are at
risk of being lost due to random events that would be insignificant in a larger
population. (For more information on the role chance plays in small popula-
tions, go to Chapter 6.)
Agriculture
Although humans have been breeding plants and animals for thousands of
years, recent understanding of the evolutionary process lets us attack this
task in a more scientific fashion. Following are some highlights in the field of
agriculture, courtesy of our understanding of the evolutionary process and
principles:
 Advancements in breeding: Understanding the detail of the evolutionary
process can help us devise new breeding strategies. Head to Chapter 11,
which explores in detail a breeding program that successfully bred chick-
ens that produced more eggs by selecting for chickens that got along well
together in chicken coops — definitely not the normal situation and
something that had been a serious problem in chicken farming before
these developments.
 Crop variation: The presence of genetic variation allows populations to
respond to environmental changes; in the absence of such variation, pop-
ulations can be destroyed by a sudden environmental change. Plant genet-
ically similar crops over wide areas, and you run the risk of an agricultural
disaster. Case in point? The Irish potato famine. Across Ireland, genetically
identical potato plants were cultivated; a disease that attacked one potato
turned out to be able to destroy them all, with horrific results.
20
Part I: What Evolution Is 

 Crop history: Evolutionary biology allows scientists to understand the
history of crop plants. Corn, for example, was domesticated by Native
Americans, but for the longest time, biologists had no idea what wild
plant it was derived from. Now, detailed studies of the evolutionary rela-
tionships of plants allow scientists to identify the wild plant from which
corn was artificially selected. Having found the parent plant, scientists
can study the genetics of how this plant survives in the presence of
insects and microbial pests, which can only help in the quest to develop
even better corn.
Medicine
The field of evolutionary biology affects the medical profession in three key
ways: figuring out what has happened, understanding what is happening now,
and trying to predict what will happen in the future to human disease. All
three help researchers devise strategies for prevention and treatment of
health problems big and small. 
One area of particular medical importance is the evolution of microbes — the
viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic critters that cause infection — that
are increasingly resistant to antibiotics. The more researchers know about
how and why microbes evolve as they do, the better they’ll be able to coun-
teract the effect of those microbes. Consider, for example, the virus that
causes AIDS. Reconstructing evolutionary history has allowed researchers to
trace the spread of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) across the globe,
as well as to determine the relationships among human viruses and the
immunodeficiency viruses of other animals. From these studies, scientists
know that these viruses don’t always cause disease in their hosts. By study-
ing related harmless viruses, researchers may be better able to understand
exactly why HIV is so dangerous in humans. 
The study of evolutionary biology also guides treatment of diseases. The
highly successful triple drug therapy that’s been amazingly beneficial to HIV-
positive individuals is the direct result of scientists’ knowledge of how antibi-
otic resistance works in microbes: Even though mutations in the HIV virus
render it resistant to medications, it’s more difficult for the virus to evolve
resistance to all the drugs at the same time. Finally, by examining how HIV
evolves resistance to medicines, scientists hope not only to design better
medicines, but also to identify how best to design a vaccine. 
Chapters 17, 18, and 19 are chock full of information about the role of evolu-
tionary biology in the fight against disease.

Chapter 1: What Evolution Is and Why You Need to Know 

One Final Point: Just 
How Evolved Are You?
Evolution isn’t a race to some cosmic finish line. No species is more evolved
than the next. Every living thing is descended from the same common ances-
tor. All the different lineages have been evolving for exactly the same length
of time. True, humans are better than pine trees at doing the things humans
do, but we can’t stand outside in the sun and soak up energy — something
that pine trees do very well. The reason life is so different is that different
environments select for different outcomes.
Neither is evolution a climb to the top of some life-form ladder on which the
“higher” orders take over the top rungs (we humans are at the tippy-tippy
top) and the “lowlier” creatures hang around the base. In fact, not all evolu-
tion results in more complex life forms. This point may seem like a small one,
but it’s actually quite important and is easily lost when most people think of
evolution in terms of the “monkey-to-man” graphic — the one that shows the
evolution of man in a series of stages, from monkey to ape to caveman to
investment banker. Although you can make an argument that the caveman
gave way to the investment banker and therefore forms a valid time series,
other primates are still around and are just as evolved as humans are.
Evolution can lead to greater complexity, but it doesn’t always. Over the his-
tory of the earth, since the first single-celled life forms, there was really
nowhere to go but up in terms of size and obvious physical complexity. But
as soon as larger, more complex critters evolved, the possibility existed that
some would evolve simpler forms. Parasites, for example, have lost many of
the functions that they can scam off their hosts. The eyes of cave-dwelling
organisms constitute another example. Absent the need for the complex
structure of the eye, mutations that cause a reduction in the eye can pile up. 
P.S: Just between you and me, I do sometimes think of myself as being a bit
more evolved than a bacterium — but then I think of the incredible biochemi-
cal diversity that bacteria are capable of, and I realize the error of my ways.

The Science — Past and
Present — of Evolution
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with the language of science
 Digging into fossils and rocks
 Comparing Darwin’s knowledge with ours
T
oday, scientists know a lot more about fossils than they did back in
Charles Darwin’s day. They understand the molecular mechanisms of
genetics and heredity. They can conduct experiments in the laboratory that
allow them actually to observe the evolutionary process. In essence, science
has come a long way since Darwin, whose investigations focused primarily
on the process of natural selection. As this book explains, there’s more to
evolution than just the process of natural selection, but evolution by natural
selection is an extremely important evolutionary force.
When it comes to natural selection, Darwin got the basics right, even though
he had to speculate about the things that researchers can just measure
today. Scientists since Darwin, in test after test and experiment after experi-
ment, haven’t been able to refute Darwin’s theory. In fact, their work has pro-
vided copious evidence that the evolutionary process works almost exactly
the way Darwin speculated it did.
This chapter looks at the information Darwin had when he formulated his
theory of evolution via natural selection and at the things scientists have
learned since then. The chapter also helps you understand exactly what sci-
entists mean when they say fact and when they say theory, which, believe it
or not, isn’t code for “pulled out of thin air.”

Evolution: A Fact and a Theory
One of the most common sources of confusion for people trying to understand
evolution is the question of whether it’s a fact or a theory. Here’s the answer:
It’s both. The fact of evolution refers to the things scientists can see and mea-
sure. The theory of evolution refers to the intellectual framework science has
developed to explain the underlying processes that account for those facts.
To help you understand how evolution can be both a fact and a theory, I talk
about another natural process that is both fact and theory: gravity. And
because a key to understanding anything you hear or read about evolution
requires being familiar with scientific principles, I also offer a short and sweet
explanation of how scientists think.
Evolution and gravity: Two peas 
in a scientific pod
The fact of gravity is beyond dispute. When you drop something, it falls — a
fact that most (dare I say all?) of us have personally established, either inten-
tionally or accidentally. We not only know that things fall, but we also know a
few details about the falling process. We know that whatever we drop falls
toward the Earth, and we can measure the downward acceleration. We know
that the pull of gravity is different away from Earth. On a smaller body such
as the moon, things don’t fall as fast. In deep space, far from the Earth and
the moon, things don’t fall at all; they just float. The strength of this attractive
force (a fancy way of saying gravity) has to do with the mass of the attractive
body and the other object’s distance from it. The moon, for example, which is
smaller than Earth, has less gravity.
Humans know all these things about gravity, but it turns out that we’re not
exactly sure what gravity is or how it works. Why, for example, does a
dropped object go down rather than up? Scientists in the field of physics
called gravitational theory are trying to figure these things out, and they con-
tinually fine-tune their theories as more information becomes available. But
just because they can’t say definitively what gravity is doesn’t mean that
gravity is any less real.
Just because you and I don’t understand gravitational theory doesn’t affect
how we interact with gravity on a daily basis. We know it happens even if we
don’t know why, and we take it into consideration when we launch things into
space, skateboard, land an airplane, or try to get that nine-iron shot onto the
green. The same is true of evolution: We have the facts of evolution (the
aspects of heritable changes in living organisms that we can see and measure),
24
Part I: What Evolution Is 

and we have the processes that evolutionary biologists theorize are responsi-
ble for these facts. As it turns out, compared with their theories about gravity,
scientists have an excellent understanding of the basic process of evolution.
How to think like a scientist
Science is by definition a very conservative discipline, and scientists are
extremely hesitant to say that they are certain about anything. In fact, one of
the rules of science is that you must always allow for the possibility that addi-
tional data will force you to let go of an idea that you were really sure about
and quite possibly very fond of. Scientists take this rule very seriously — so
seriously, in fact, that before they get their diplomas and lab coats, they have
to pinky-swear that they’ll follow it.
Suppose that you want to know whether a particular coin is a fair coin, that is,
as likely to come up heads as tails when you flip it. So you flip the coin a few
times, and it always comes up heads. The fact that you got heads in your first
few flips may lead you to suspect that the coin isn’t fair, but because you
flipped it only a few times, you can’t say for sure. What you have is a suspicion.
What you need is more information. So you proceed to flip the coin all day
long, and the next couple thousand times you toss it, the coin always comes up
heads. With a few thousand flips under your belt and a head coming up each
time, you conclude that the coin isn’t fair. This process seems straightforward,
and the conclusion seems obvious — to anyone who isn’t a scientist.
But a scientist in the exact same position and with the exact same data would
not say that the coin isn’t fair. She would cite a very, very, very low probabil-
ity that it’s a fair coin, or she’d say that she’s 99.99999 percent sure that the
coin isn’t fair. The reason for the difference is the precision with which scien-
tists state what they know. After all, it is possible that a fair coin could come
up heads that many times in a row; that possibility just isn’t very big.
To which the layperson may reasonably respond, “So you’re not really sure!”
What the scientist is really saying is that she is sure — within a reasonable
doubt. (If that explanation’s not good enough for you, consider the shaky
ground on which it puts the entire American justice system, which also relies
on the standard of reasonable doubt.)
You say toMAYto; I say toMAHto: The language of science
Do scientists ever seem as though they speak their own language? In a way,
they do. You probably recognize some words as scientific terms — words like
nucleotide, paedomorphosis, heterozygosity, and others, which seem to be
little more than Latin and Greek roots randomly strung together. But other
terms — ones that mean one thing to laypeople and something else to 
scientists — are a bit trickier. The subtle differences in the way scientists 
and nonscientists use the same words are often sources of confusion.
25
Chapter 2: The Science — Past and Present — of Evolution

You won’t find a better example of this situation than the word theory. In sci-
entific terms, a theory is a hypothesis that has overwhelming support — in
essence, an idea that’s been proved. In layman’s terms, theory typically
means best guess. See the problem?
To help you understand the scientific meanings of science’s three most
important words (the fourth is funding), I offer these definitions:
 Fact: Something you can observe or measure.
 Hypothesis: A working idea or set of ideas resulting from observations
and measurements. The hypothesis serves to guide future investiga-
tions. It gives scientists suggestions about what facts they should try to
collect next.
 Theory: A conceptual framework, tested repeatedly but not rejected,
that explains the facts, observations, and measurements, and makes
accurate predictions of how the system will behave in the future.
The facts of evolution, as I show throughout this book, are clearly estab-
lished. The current theories of how evolution functions are solidly supported
as well. But the linguistic difficulties in communication are such that people
continue to ask scientists, “But it’s just a theory, right?”
Scientific investigation
Scientists don’t start talking about something as a theory until it has over-
whelming support. How do they get that support? Through scientific investi-
gation. A coin toss is a good example of the process of scientific
investigation:
1. Start with some observations about the natural world.
In the example of the coin toss, you observe that the first few tosses
always end up heads.
2. Formulate a hypothesis.
Your hypothesis after flipping head after head? That the coin isn’t fair.
The hypothesis serves as the scientist’s starting point; maybe it’s right,
and maybe it’s wrong. They key is to do enough testing to find out.
3. Gather additional data to test this hypothesis.
In the coin example, you gather additional data by tossing the coin sev-
eral thousand more times.
Repeating one type of test ad infinitum — exhaustively flipping a coin, for
example — and getting a particular result isn’t good enough. First, you
have to address and eliminate any other factors that could affect the test
results. Maybe the coin is fine, but something about the person flipping it
isn’t quite right. Or maybe the coin is fine, but some other factor — like an
26
Part I: What Evolution Is 

air vent blowing air over the researcher’s head — keeps it from landing
heads or tails half of the time. You need to have the coin flipped by a
bunch of other researchers in other parts of the room to make sure they
get the same result.
4. As your data accumulates, it either supports your hypothesis, or it
forces you to revise or abandon the hypothesis.
In the coin-toss example, heads continue to come up, thus lending sup-
port to the original hypothesis that the coin isn’t fair.
5. At the point where an overwhelming amount of information starts to
accumulate in support of the hypothesis, the hypothesis is elevated to
a theory.
The hypothesis must get tested and tested to the best of everyone’s ability
before it arrives in the exalted land of theory. And even a theory is only one
good experiment away from being rejected, which is one of the fundamental
components of the scientific method: that the ideas scientists come up with
must be falsifiable. That is, scientists must be able to imagine some set of
results that would cause them to reject the theory; then they must see that
over and over again, they never get the expected results. This process always
sounds somewhat backward to nonscientists, but that’s just the way scien-
tists do things. We scientists never say that an idea is true; what we say is
that, even after our best efforts, we’ve been unable to show that it is false.
Then it’s high fives all around, and we go grab a beer.
The Evidence of Evolution
Evolution is simply the change over time in the frequencies of different herita-
ble traits (that is, the frequencies of different genes) in a group of organisms.
One year, half the birds have blue eyes and the other half have brown. Some
years later, two thirds of the birds have blue eyes. If eye color is a heritable
trait, that is, one that is passed from parent to offspring, then that change is
evolution.
Darwin’s big idea was coming up with a process that could cause these
changes. This theory of natural selection is simply a process in which herita-
ble traits that help an organism survive in its current environment occur
more frequently in subsequent generations. In other words, genes (the herita-
ble traits) that are favored (help survival) increase over time. Evolution by
natural selection really is that simple, regardless of what you may have heard
to the contrary.
Darwin, the father of evolutionary theory (refer to Chapter 1), did a phenom-
enally good job of piecing this part of evolutionary process together, but he
could only hypothesize about the underlying details of what he called descent
with modification. What he didn’t understand was the underlying genetic
mechanism that was responsible.
27
Chapter 2: The Science — Past and Present — of Evolution

Knowledge about DNA and genetics
Making out heritable traits just requires knowing a little bit about DNA,
genes, and the genetic code — topics covered in more detail in Chapter 3.
This knowledge of genetics allows researchers to measure gene frequencies.
Today, scientists can do more than just observe that evolution has happened;
instead, they can determine the specific genes involved and measure the
rates at which the genes’ frequencies change in populations where different
selective forces are at play. Scientists’ knowledge of exactly what is going on
gives them a much richer understanding of the process and allows them to
ask far more detailed questions than Darwin could.
Experimental evidence
Darwin saw evidence that the process of natural selection had occurred in
nature, but he was unable to watch it happen. Scientists today, however, can
actually observe the evolutionary process in action. Using organisms that
reproduce rapidly and can be kept in laboratories in large numbers (such as
fruit flies and bacteria), and employing modern tools and techniques (such as
DNA sequencing), evolutionary biologists can conduct actual evolution
experiments and watch the results.
Scientists don’t pick fruit flies because anything about that species is special;
they pick fruit flies for expediency. Experiments conducted with fruit flies go a
lot faster than experiments with other organisms (such as dogs or sea turtles)
because the generation time of the flies is much, much shorter. A fruit fly is
born, reproduces, and dies within a couple of weeks. This short life span gives
scientists more opportunity to examine changes in heritable traits.
Measurement of the rates of change
Scientists can measure the rates at which evolutionary changes happen. By
measuring changes in the frequencies of existing genes and observing muta-
tions, they can describe the evolutionary process exactly. They can see in the
laboratory how selection can result in changes in gene frequencies.
Here’s a favorite example of mine to show how witnessing evolution in action is
possible: antibiotic resistance. Scientists can observe how the frequencies of
genes that make a microbe resistant to antibiotics increase when the environ-
ment changes to include an antibiotic. They take a beaker full of microbes and
add some antibiotics. Then — big drumroll here — they come back the next
day and find that the frequency of genes conferring resistance to antibiotics is
much higher than it was before the antibiotics were added. Why? Because all
the bacteria that didn’t have antibiotic-resistance genes died and the ones that
28
Part I: What Evolution Is 

did have antibiotic resistant genes reproduced a lot! Hence, the favored trait —
resistance to antibiotics — increased over time. You can read more about
antibiotic resistance in Chapter 17.
Mutations don’t occur in response to environmental change. Instead, the muta-
tions already exist and are favored in the new environment. Beakers full of
bacteria tend to contain mutants that are resistant to antibiotics even when
no antibiotics are around. Toss an antibiotic into the mix, and the mutation
gets its chance to shine by enabling the bacteria to survive in the presence of
the antibiotic.
The Scientific Foundation of Evolution
by Natural Selection
Charles Darwin observed that the offspring of a particular parent, although
they resembled the parent, tended to differ from the parent in various ways.
That is, the offspring were variable. Based on his observations, Darwin
hypothesized that, because of their inherent differences, some of the offspring
would be better than others at doing whatever it is they needed to do to sur-
vive and reproduce. Further, he surmised that if the differences that resulted in
increased survival and reproduction were heritable (that is, passed from parent
to offspring), they would be passed disproportionately to the next generation,
and through time, this process would lead to changes in the species. 
Darwin didn’t pull his ideas out of thin air. He developed his theory of evolu-
tion during the period when rapid advances were being made in a variety of
fields, including geology, selective breeding in agriculture, and biogeography
(the study of the locations of different species).
Not surprising, scientists have learned a fair bit more about the natural world
in the hundred-plus years since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution by
natural selection. What is surprising is how well most of what researchers
have learned since Darwin has been in agreement with his hypothesis. As
scientists have developed a more complex understanding of the details of
the evolutionary process, their confidence has only increased that the mech-
anism Darwin first proposed is correct. This section outlines what Darwin
knew and some of the things scientists have learned about the evolutionary
process since Darwin.
Gradualism: Changes over time
Although people now take for granted the idea that gradual processes acting
over long periods can have dramatic effects — think, for example, of the slow
29
Chapter 2: The Science — Past and Present — of Evolution

erosion by the Colorado River that led to the formation of the Grand Canyon —
this idea was at odds with the prevailing view in the 1800s that the Earth was
very young. Then along came the field of stratigraphy, which deals with the
horizontal banding patterns that you can observe in the faces of cliffs or when
a highway is cut through deep rock.
By Darwin’s day, detailed geological mapping of Europe had revealed that a
reproducible sequence of bands was spread across a large geographical area
and that these bands contained fossils. Even in the absence of detailed infor-
mation about the absolute ages of the different bands, scientists concluded
that the ones on the bottom were typically older than the ones on the top.
The very existence of these bands and the fossils that were found within
them hinted at a process of gradual change.
If the new geological views about gradualism were correct — that is, that
the Earth formed over long periods, as indicated by the banding patterns of
different geological eras — scientists could imagine that the changes in the
biological community were also the result of small changes occurring over
a large period. Turns out that they were right on both counts.
The age of the Earth
Although earlier scientists didn’t have the tools to date the age of the Earth as
we do today, they understood that the lower bands (and the fossils in them)
were older than the higher bands and their fossils. Still, Darwin had no idea
how immensely old the Earth was or how long the evolutionary process had
been going on. Even when people began to understand that the world was
quite a bit older than previously thought, they couldn’t give an exact age to it.

Part I: What Evolution Is 
Dating the age of the Earth: Radioisotope dating
Scientists know that the Earth is about 4.5 bil-
lion years old by using radioisotope dating tech-
niques. To understand how this process works,
you need to know a little bit about atoms and
isotopes. For those who need little refresher
course on basic chemistry, think of water, or
H2O. The H and the O refer to hydrogen and
oxygen, the two atoms that make up water. As
the notation indicates, water consists of one
molecule of oxygen and two molecules of
hydrogen.
Often, any one atom has several different forms,
which are referred to as isotopes. Atoms are
made up of electrons, protons, and neutrons,
and the number of electrons and protons 

31
Chapter 2: The Science — Past and Present — of Evolution
determines the type of atom. Hydrogen, for
example, has one electron and one proton.
Sometimes, it also has a neutron. The term
heavy water refers to water in which each
hydrogen atom has a neutron. This isotope of
hydrogen is also called deuterium.
Some isotopes, like deuterium, are stable,
which means that they’re perfectly happy with
the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons
they have. Other isotopes are unstable because
the different number of neutrons interacts with
the other atomic components in such a way that
some of the bits go flying off and, over a period
of time, the isotope changes into some other
atom. When these unstable isotopes change to
a different atom, they emit radioactivity. For that
reason, they’re called radioisotopes.
An important property of radioactive isotopes is
that scientists can describe very accurately the
average probability of the transition’s happen-
ing and express that probability as a number
called the half-life — the time it takes for half of
the atoms to undergo this transition. In the first
half-life, half of the atoms transition. In the
second half-life, half of the remaining atoms
transition, leaving one quarter of the original
parent material. In the third half-life, half again
transition, leaving one eighth, and so on.
(Remember: Just because half the isotopes
decay in the first half-life doesn’t mean that the
other half decay in the second half-life—you’d
be surprised at the number of students who
make this assumption. Only half decay every
half-life.) 
To determine the age of material, researchers
compare the ratio of the parent and daughter
products that were initially in the sample with
the ratio of these products at the current time.
By doing so, they can calculate how much time
has passed. The atomic clock is a very accurate
national timekeeping apparatus calibrated by
the precise regularity of radioactive decay.
Numerous radioactive isotopes exist. One
system that has been very successful in dating
the ages of fossils is potassium-argon dating.
Potassium is an extremely common element.
Although most potassium isotopes aren’t
radioactive, one of them is, and one of its decay
products is the gas argon.
Potassium–argon dating relies on the fact that
although potassium is a solid, argon is a gas.
When rock is melted (think lava), all the argon
in the rock escapes, and when the rock solidi-
fies again, only potassium is left. The melting of
the rock and releasing of any argon present set
the potassium–argon clock at zero. As time
passes, argon accumulates in the rock as a
result of radioactive potassium decay. When
scientists analyze these rocks and compute the
ratio of argon to potassium, they’re able to
determine how long it’s been since the lava
cooled. When scientists date rocks from our
solar system this way, the oldest dates they find
are 4.5 billion years.
No fossils are present in lava, obviously; any-
thing that was there melted along with the rock.
But by dating the lava flows above and below a
fossil find, scientists can put exact boundaries
on the maximum and minimum age of that fossil.
In this case, the variation in possible ages of the
fossil simply reflects the fact that the fossil
exists between the dated lava flows.
Radioactive dating has been perfected to the
extent that scientists can get within a few per-
centage points of the actual date. They know
this because they’re able to date lava flows that
happened recently enough for their dates to be
known historically. Potassium–argon dating has
been used to date accurately the age of the
eruption of Mount Vesuvius at Pompeii, for
example. The scientists knew that the tech-
nique worked because the age their equipment
indicated matched the age noted in historical
Roman records.

Today, scientists know quite a bit more. First, through radioactive dating, a
painfully complex process whose details you don’t need to worry about, they
know that the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. Scientists also know that
life has existed on Earth for at least 3.5 billion years — a number that keeps
changing as older and older fossils are found.
Although the age of the Earth may seem to be somewhat unrelated to evolu-
tion (rock, stone, and tectonic plates aren’t living organisms and, therefore,
don’t “evolve”), it’s actually very important to the theory of evolution because
biological evolution needs time to happen. By knowing the actual age of the
Earth and how long life has been present, scientists can ask whether enough
time has passed for simple creatures such as the ones they see in the oldest
rocks to evolve into more complex creatures, such as the ones that can write
and edit books. The quick answer: Yes. 
The fossil record
Fossils are the preserved remains of the bodies of dead organisms or the
remains of the organism’s actions — things such as footprints or burrows.
The total of all fossils is called the fossil record. The fossil record informs sci-
entists about evolution in several important ways:
32
Part I: What Evolution Is 
Types of rocks and fossils
Geologists in Darwin’s day were familiar with
the diversity of types of rocks, but they were
only beginning to appreciate the vast time
scales over which geological events occurred.
They had yet to understand the dynamic nature
of the Earth’s crust, and they lacked modern
understanding of how these types of rocks
formed:
 Igneous: Igneous rocks are of volcanic
origin. They form when molten lava from
volcanoes cools and solidifies. Basalt and
obsidian are examples of igneous rocks.
 Sedimentary: Sedimentary rocks are formed
by the gradual deposits of sediments.
Sandstone is an example of sedimentary
rock. 
 Metamorphic: Metamorphic rocks are
rocks of any origin that have been sub-
jected to the extreme stresses and temper-
atures caused by the folding and crushing
of the Earth’s crust.
Understanding these rock types helps biologists
understand the fossil record. Fossils are found
only in sedimentary rocks. The molten lava that
bubbles up from beneath the Earth’s crust during
a volcanic eruption doesn’t contain any fossils
(whatever had been there would have melted in
the molten rock). Metamorphic rocks — even
those of sedimentary-rock origin — don’t contain
fossils, because the extreme temperatures and
pressures that converted the rock from sedi-
mentary to metamorphic would have destroyed
whatever fossils may have been there.

 In the past, creatures that we don’t find today lived on the planet.
 Not all creatures alive today are represented in the past.
 Through time, the physical complexity of organisms has increased. The
earliest organisms that scientists can identify were single celled; now
complex creatures exist.
 The earliest forms of life were aquatic; terrestrial forms appeared later.
The fossil record, incomplete though it may be, is a record of change through
time. This record gives us clues to the progression of the development of life
on Earth: Small single-celled organisms evolved into more complex ones; life
started in the oceans and only later moved onto dry land. The fossil record
provides a rough draft of the tree of life. (Head to Chapter 9 for a detailed
explanation of the role that the tree of life — code word phyolgenetics —
plays in evolution.)
A few things about the fossil record stymied Darwin and others in his day,
however:
 They seemed to find a lot of older rock that had no fossils and newer
rock that had complex life forms, making it seem as though complex life
forms appeared suddenly.
 It wasn’t clear why certain fossils were found in the locations where they
were found — marine fossils on mountaintops, for example.
 Darwin was puzzled by the sudden changes from one type of fossil to the
next, when there seemed to be very few, if any, transitional life forms.
The following sections explain what modern science says about these issues.
Conundrum 1: The seemingly sudden appearance of complex life forms
In studying the fossil record, scientists in Darwin’s day were limited in a
couple of ways that scientists today aren’t:
 Their fossil record was even more incomplete than ours today. They
didn’t have any fossils older than 500 million years. 
 They lacked the technology to find microscopic fossils. What Darwin
and others perceived as gaps in the fossil record actually weren’t gaps at
all. Today, scientists have the advantage of a much more thorough
search of the planet for older fossils and, more important, far more
sophisticated techniques for identifying microscopic fossils in rocks.
The earliest fossils that scientists find are single-celled organisms, which
Darwin lacked the ability to see physically. Today, scientists know that life
has existed continuously on Earth for about the past 3.5 billion to 4 billion
years, and they see the same increase in complexity through time that scien-
tists observed in Darwin’s day.
33
Chapter 2: The Science — Past and Present — of Evolution

Conundrum 2: Marine fossils on mountaintops
Today, scientists understand the process of plate tectonics — the moving
around of large chunks of the Earth’s surface. The idea that the continents
may not be fixed in place was greeted with skepticism as recently as 50 years
ago, yet now we know that Earth’s crust is composed of a series of plates that
move relative to one another, fuse, and break apart, resulting in earthquakes
and volcanoes. 
What seemed like science fiction a little while ago is now something that sci-
ence can routinely observe and measure. Submarines can dive to the depths
of the ocean where plates are separating so researchers can measure the
process. Very accurate markers can be placed in different locations across
fault lines and their relative movements can be tracked with satellites and
lasers. Scientists know, for example, the rate at which parts of California are
moving apart and mountain ranges are pushing higher.
The fact that continents move explains why fossils turn up in the unlikeliest
places: tropical fossils in Antarctica, for example (biologists have every reason
to believe that Antarctica was once in the tropics), or seashell fossils on moun-
taintops (rocks that were once at sea level can be pushed upward over long
periods to form mountain ranges). By understanding more about geological
processes and time scales, the fossil record is more comprehensible.
34
Part I: What Evolution Is 
Fossils: Not just rock anymore
Back in Darwin’s day, everyone knew that what
was so cool about fossils was that biological
material had been turned to stone through a
process of mineralization. But today, people
know something even cooler: Some of the bio-
logical material can survive this process and
persist for a very long time. Scientists have
been able to isolate DNA from organisms, like
mammoths and cave bears, that died tens of
thousands of years ago.
In retrospect, this feat is not as surprising as it
first sounds. DNA is awfully tough stuff; your
survival depends on it, after all. Also, techniques
for isolating DNA are becoming more and more
precise, allowing scientists to work with smaller
and smaller quantities.
Even more amazing, scientists recently showed
that soft tissue can survive for at least 68 million
years inside fossilized Tyrannosaurus rex bone.
It hasn’t been possible (yet) to isolate DNA from
such material, but it has been possible to deter-
mine the amino acid sequences of some of the
remaining proteins. Tyrannosaurus rex proteins
show considerable similarity to the proteins of
modern birds — it turns out that T. rex might’ve
tasted a lot like chicken — not surprising, given
the close relationship suggested between
dinosaurs and birds by the fossils of
Archaeopteryx and other feathered dinosaurs.
Now scientists have biochemical evidence sup-
porting the same connection.

Conundrum 3: The seeming lack of transitional forms
Darwin wondered where to find the transitional life forms (consider them the
in-between-this-and-that forms). Although we’ve had more success in finding
transitional life forms, today’s scientists feel his pain. They are better at
knowing where to look and they have more people looking, but they still
struggle to find them.
Scientists hypothesize that evolution doesn’t occur at a constant rate: It can
occur in bursts separated by long periods when not much happens. If the
transitional period was brief, the chance that such forms would have been
fossilized is even more dicey.
When you think about it, it’s really quite amazing that people find fossils at all
because the events leading to the fossilization of those wonderfully complete
skeletons you read about in the news are quite rare. Conditions have to be
just right — leave something in your vegetable crisper for sixty million years,
and it’s not likely to be enough material to do any sort of analysis on! The
organism not only has to die, but it also has to be buried intact and remain
undisturbed in conditions hospitable to the mineralization process that pre-
serves the remains. Then, possibly millions of years later, someone stumbles
across it and calls in the news cameras. 
Biogeographic patterns, or location,
location, location
Darwin carefully studied the biogeographical patterns of existing species.
(Biogeography is the study of the locations of different species through
space.) Biogeography reveals that species that appear to be closely related
tend to be geographically close as well, as though groups of species had a
common origin at a particular geographic location and radiated out from
there. Darwin was especially interested in the study of species on islands,
and he observed that they seemed to be most closely related to species
found on the nearest mainland. Darwin was interested in what, if anything,
these biogeographical patterns revealed about evolutionary history.
In developing his ideas, Darwin focused on finches that lived on the Galapagos
Islands, an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean off South America. Several species
of finches live on the Galapagos, each species inhabiting a different island.
The species seemed quite similar to one another and to a species on the main-
land, leading Darwin to hypothesize that the different species of Galapagos
finches were descended from individuals in the mainland species that had
reached the islands sometime in the past. Because conditions on the islands
differed from conditions on the mainland, the selective pressures acting
on the finches also differed, resulting in new traits being favored in the new
environment.
35
Chapter 2: The Science — Past and Present — of Evolution

As a result of the different evolutionary tracks between the mainland finches
and island finches, the gradual changes accumulated to the point where the
island finches were different enough from the mainland finches to be consid-
ered a new species. The concept of speciation, in which one species gives rise
to a new species, can seem a bit slippery at first, but it’s really not. Head to
Chapter 8 for the details.
This process occurred on the various Galapagos Islands, which are far enough
apart that travel among them by finches is uncommon. After those rare events
when finches did make it to a new island — perhaps as a result of being blown
there by a storm — they evolved separately from the population on the island
from which they came, in response to whatever novel environmental factors
were present in their new home.
When Darwin proposed that the Galapagos Islands had become inhabited by
so many different but apparently related species of finches through the process
of evolution, he had only his observations of existing variation to rely on.
Today’s scientists, by analyzing DNA, have confirmed these relationships, and
detailed studies support Darwin’s hypotheses about the existence of different
selective pressures on different islands.
Natural selection and speciation
As the preceding section explains, Darwin hypothesized that natural selection
operating over a long period accumulates enough small changes in a popula-
tion to make that population so different that it would be its own species,
no longer able to interbreed with other populations of the species it had
previously been a member of. Once again, Darwin turns out to have been
right. Scientists have evidence that such small changes can have such large
consequences over time.
36
Part I: What Evolution Is 
Archaeopteryx and Tiktaalik
Archaeopteryx is one of the few transitional life
forms that was known in Darwin’s time. This
early birdlike creature had many characteristics
in common with some dinosaurs, yet it also had
wings and feathers. Most obvious to the casual
observer, Archaeopteryx had jaws full of sharp
teeth, rather than the beak structure of birds.
Archaeopteryx was clearly more toward the bird
end of the transition to flight. Recently, paleon-
tologists have discovered feathered dinosaurs
that did not have wings.
Another interesting creature, Tiktaalik, had a
skeletal structure intermediate between fish
and tetrapods (critters with four legs) and had
both gills and lungs. This skeletal structure was
sufficient to have allowed the organism to sup-
port itself, at least briefly, out of water. When the
first creatures crawled onto the land, they might
have looked like Tiktaalik. You can read more
about these and other fossil finds in Chapter 20.

What constitutes a species? The answer depends on the type of organisms
you’re talking about. Scientists have a reasonably good handle on what con-
stitutes an animal species; determining what differentiates plant and micro-
bial species (such as viruses and bacteria) is a bit slipperier. For animals,
though, differentiating one species from another is fairly clear cut. A species
is a group of organisms that can breed with one another but not with organ-
isms in different species. In other words, reproductive isolation is the key to
differentiating species.
Given the way evolution works (small changes over time produce enough
changes to create a different species), researchers should be able to find all
intermediate forms in nature. Ring species, species in which two populations
of a particular species can’t interbreed with each other (usually because of
geographical distance) even though both can breed with other populations of
that species, allow scientists to observe how the gradual changes can result
in reproductive isolation. In addition to the ring species, scientists have
numerous examples of intermediary species: those that have recently
diverged and are very similar to one another yet unable to interbreed, and
those that are in the process of diverging, in which case they’ve already dif-
ferentiated to the point where reproduction is less successful or less
common. You can find out more about these patterns in Chapter 8.
37
Chapter 2: The Science — Past and Present — of Evolution
Origin of life
This book concerns itself with the evolution of
organisms that are already present, not with the
question — fascinating as it is — of where
organisms came from in the first place. The
question of how life arose on Earth really isn’t a
question for evolutionary biology. It’s a question
for chemistry, because in asking about the tran-
sition from nonliving to living systems, you must
ask questions about the chemical environment
that existed on Earth at the time when life
appeared. Although no one has succeeded yet
with an experiment that involves mixing a bunch
of things in a beaker and waiting for something
to crawl out, some very clever experiments
have been conducted that show how complex
biochemicals can arise spontaneously out of
simple mixtures under conditions thought to be
present on Earth more than 3 billion years ago.
Darwin imagined that such things might happen
in a warm pond. Chemists Harold C. Urey (who
won the Nobel Prize for discovering heavy
water) and Stanley L. Miller actually made the
pond. They combined water hydrogen, methane,
and ammonia in a sterile glass system; heated
the flask to produce a humid atmosphere; and
then sent electrical shocks though the mixture to
simulate lightning. They repeated this procedure
for a week and then analyzed the contents of the
flask. By using this simple procedure, they were
able to produce DNA, RNA, amino acids, sugars,
and lipids — all the building blocks of life from
four very simple molecules.

T
he study of genetics is pretty fascinating, and the language of genetics is
cropping up in a growing number of places. It’s often in the news and
even makes periodic appearances in movies and TV shows. You’ve probably
heard references to DNA and genes; perhaps you’ve even heard of the Human
Genome Project or of specific genes for human diseases. All this aside, you
may be wondering why I’ve included a chapter on genetics in a book about
evolution. The answer is simple. Evolution involves genetic changes over
time, so to understand evolution, you need to know a little bit about genetics:
what it is, how it works, and what parts are particularly important to the
study of evolution.
What Is Genetics?
Genetics is the science of investigating the relationship between parental and
offspring characteristics; in other words, it’s the study of heredity. For most
of human history, people have understood that offspring tend to resemble
their parents. Only relatively recently, beginning in the late 1800s, have we
begun to understand how the genetic process works.
An easy way to think about genetics is to think about it in terms of informa-
tion. In every cell of your body is a complete instruction manual for making a
person, and somehow, these instructions get passed on to your offspring.
The instruction manual is your DNA — basically a repository for all the
instructions that make you, you.

As our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of genetics has
increased, the field of genetics has expanded to include several new areas:
 Molecular genetics is concerned with the biochemistry of DNA and
genes, helping scientists understand exactly how DNA is replicated and
transcribed. Molecular genetics is important to evolution because it
helps clarify the process of mutation — that is, the errors that occur
when something in the replication process goes awry. Most of these
mutations are bad, but every so often, one of them results in something
good. Mutations are the initial sources of the variations on which natural
selection can act.
 Genomics, a new branch of genetics, is concerned with the properties
and information content of whole genomes. Comparing the genomes of
different organisms gives us a better idea of how, for example, humans
can be so different from chimps when they have most of the same DNA
sequences. Looking at major genome-wide differences between people
can help us understand the health implications of these differences.
 Population genetics is the study of how the genetic variation that
exists within groups of organisms changes over time. By studying large
groups rather than individuals, scientists can observe the evolutionary
process — some genes become more common, and others go extinct —
to determine whether natural selection is involved.
Population geneticists can’t use elephants or any other creature that has
a long lifespan. Instead, they perform these studies with critters that
don’t live as long, such as bacteria. Sure, it takes some of the glamour out
of the headlines, but the findings are still pretty amazing (to geneticists,
anyway).
It’s not always necessary to understand a process completely to make use of
it. Although humans have only recently come to understand the details of
how heredity works, we’ve been selectively breeding agriculturally important
plant and animal types for thousands of years. For his part, Charles Darwin
didn’t understand exactly how it was that offspring resemble their parents;
he just knew that they did. In the short span of this chapter, you’ll discover
more about genetics than Darwin ever knew! Because we now have a better
understanding of the nuts and bolts of genetics and heredity, we are able
to understand the evolutionary process in ways that Darwin could only
dream of.
DNA: A Molecule for Storing
Genetic Information
DNA, otherwise known as deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that stores
your genetic information. As you might imagine, the instruction manual for
40
Part I: What Evolution Is 

making you (or any other type of critter) can be very large, so it’s not too sur-
prising that a single molecule of DNA can be enormous — so big, in fact, that
under the right circumstances you can see a DNA molecule with the naked eye.
(To find out how, see the sidebar “A DNA cocktail: Extracting DNA at home.”)
Chromosomes: Where your DNA is
An organism’s DNA is found in a cellular structure called a chromosome.
Some organisms have all their DNA on one chromosome, while other organ-
isms have their DNA spread across several chromosomes. The DNA of sexu-
ally reproducing organisms, like animals and humans, is arranged on pairs of
chromosomes. When these organisms make offspring, the offspring get one
set of chromosomes from each parent. Humans, for example, have 23 pairs of
chromosomes. Each of us got a set from each parent, meaning we each have
half of Mom’s genes and half of Dad’s.
DNA isn’t an abstract concept. It’s an actual thing that appears in a particular
place (the chromosomes) in each of your cells. And every cell has a copy of
the chromosomes.
DNA’s four-letter alphabet
Although DNA can be a huge molecule, it’s actually a simple one. DNA is
made up of just four different building blocks that are called nucleotides, or
bases. The four nucleotides are
 Adenine, abbreviated as A
 Cytosine, abbreviated as C
 Thymine, abbreviated as T
 Guanine, abbreviated as G
The function of DNA is information storage, which is what’s so cool about it.
All the instructions needed to make you can be written with just four letters!
The structure of DNA is a double helix consisting of two strands winding
around each other (see Figure 3-1). Each strand can contain up to thousands
of the four nucleotides, and the two strands are joined in a very specific way:
 A always pairs with T.
 C always pairs with G.
 T always pairs with A.
 G always pairs with C.
41
Chapter 3: Getting into Your Genes: (Very) Basic Genetics

One strand is an inverted version of the other, so if you know the sequence of
one strand, you know the sequence of both strands. To give you an oversim-
plified example, if you have one strand of CATG, you know that the other
strand is GTAC.
You may wonder how four nucleotides could possibly be the basis of all life
in all its complexity. Well, you wouldn’t be the first. What scientists discov-
ered is that these four letters actually appear in groups of three, called
codons. It turns out there are 64 codons. (You can read more about codons
and the genetic code in the section “Protein-coding RNA and the genetic
code” later in this chapter).
The double-helix structure of DNA has two properties that make it an excel-
lent molecule for information storage:
 It’s an incredibly tough molecule. DNA is so tough, in fact, that scien-
tists have been able to isolate intact DNA from extinct mammoths found
buried in Siberian ice and even, in some cases, from fossilized bones.
 The double-stranded arrangement provides a very easy way to make
accurate copies. During DNA replication, the two strands of the double
helix separate, and an enzyme (a protein that’s involved in facilitating a
chemical reaction) called DNA polymerase makes two new strands by
using the original strands as guides. This produces two double helix
molecules. Each is an exact copy of the original.

Reading the Instructions: From DNA
to RNA to Proteins
The four-letter alphabet of DNA is where an organism’s instruction manual is
stored, but when it comes time to actually make an organism, you need pro-
teins. Proteins comprise most of the basic machinery that makes an organism
work. Your muscles are made of proteins, your antibodies are proteins, your
digestive enzymes are proteins — you just wouldn’t be who you are without
proteins.

Chapter 3: Getting into Your Genes: (Very) Basic Genetics
A DNA cocktail: Extracting DNA at home
DNA tends to strike people as being somewhat
mysterious, but really, it’s just a very long mole-
cule. Although it’s certainly amazing how organ-
isms use DNA for information storage, it’s not
magic — just chemistry. If you want to see DNA
rather than just read about it, the following
recipe for a DNA cocktail shows you how to do
so. The chemistry is simple.
Ingredients
8 strawberries
1⁄3 ounce blue Curaçao liqueur
2⁄3 ounce gin
2 ounces fresh pineapple juice
Instructions:
1. Freeze the strawberries.
2. Chill the Curaçao, the gin, and a glass.
A tall narrow glass works best. A test tube
would work too, but make sure it’s a clean
one!
3. When the glass (or test tube) is cold, add
the Curaçao.
4. Tilt the glass or tube with great care; then
pour the chilled gin down the side to form
a layer above the Curaçao.
5. Purée the frozen strawberries with the
pineapple juice for 10 seconds.
Strawberries contain DNA. Blending them
with pineapple juice allows the enzymatic
activity in the juice to free the DNA from all
the other bits of the strawberry that it hangs
onto. The fresher the pineapple juice, the
more enzymatic activity it will have, allow-
ing the experiment to work even better.
6. Layer the strawberry-pineapple mixture on
top of the gin.
When the now-dissolved DNA comes into
contact with the cold gin, it precipitates out
of solution (that is, turns into a solid due to
the chemical reaction), and you see little
white wisps floating in the gin layer. Those
white wisps are the actual DNA molecules,
and they contain all the information that
makes the strawberry plant what it is. The
Curaçao doesn’t serve any high-tech chem-
ical function; it’s just there to make the final
product a nice red, white, and blue — and
to make it taste nice!

To make proteins, you need RNA. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is similar to DNA
but has a couple of important differences:
 RNA is usually a single-stranded molecule, whereas DNA is a double-
stranded molecule.
 Although both RNA and DNA are made of four nucleotides, RNA uses
uracil instead of thymine. Specifically, RNA uses the nucleotides ade-
nine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine, which are abbreviated A, U, C, and G.
Transcription: Producing RNA
The process in which a single-stranded RNA molecule is produced from a
double-stranded DNA molecule is called transcription. The details of the tran-
scription process aren’t important for the purposes of this discussion (you
can thank me later for sparing you), but the gist of it is that the double-
stranded DNA molecule unwinds a bit, and a single-stranded RNA molecule
is produced by copying one of the strands.
The four nucleotides that make up RNA line up to match the order of the DNA
nucleotides, as follows:
 A (from RNA) lines up with T (from DNA).
 C (from RNA) lines up with G (from DNA).
 G (from RNA) lines up with C (from DNA).
 U (from RNA) lines up with A (from DNA).
In this way, the four-letter alphabet of DNA is transcribed into the four-letter
alphabet of RNA.
Different regions of DNA produce RNA transcripts with different functions.
Some of the RNA transcripts code directly for the production of proteins, and
other types of RNA transcripts don’t code for proteins themselves, they just
help the process along.
Protein-coding RNA and the genetic code
The RNA transcripts that code for the production of proteins are called mes-
senger RNA (abbreviated mRNA). Messenger RNA’s job is to transfer the
information regarding what proteins need to be made from the DNA to the
protein-producing machinery where proteins are assembled: the ribosomes
(see the next section, “Non-protein-coding RNA”).
RNA and DNA are each composed of four subunits (their four respective
nucleotides). The DNA nucleotides appear in groups of three (the 64 codons,
44
Part I: What Evolution Is 

discussed in “DNA: A Molecule for Storing Genetic Information” earlier in this
chapter). Proteins are composed of 20 subunits, called amino acids. The
exact translation from codons to the amino acids is called the genetic code.
Back before anyone knew that DNA is the molecule where genetic information
is stored, many people argued that DNA just wasn’t complicated enough. They
wondered how something with only four different letters could code for all the
complexity of an organism. Thus, at one point, proteins were considered to be
good candidates for the material used for information storage because they
had 20 amino acids — or 20 different letters available in their alphabet. The
breakthrough in understanding came when scientists determined that the 4
nucleotides were read in groups of 3, meaning that instead of containing 4
individual letters, DNA has an alphabet of 64 triplet letters, called codons.
That discovery raised another question. Instead of wondering how to code for
20 amino acids with only 4 letters, people questioned how you would code
for only 20 amino acids when you have 64 codons. The answer is that there is
some redundancy in the translation of DNA into proteins.
Figure 3-2 shows all 64 codons of the genetic code. Most of the amino acids
correspond to multiple codons, as you can see from the figure (the notations
Phe, Leu, and so on). Some codons, though, don’t code for amino acids at all;
instead, they signal that protein synthesis should stop. These codons are
called stop codons. They tell the protein-producing machinery to stop adding
amino acids to a growing protein, and their presence indicates that the pro-
tein is finished.

Non-protein-coding RNA
In addition to the protein-coding transcripts, an organism’s DNA produces
other RNA transcripts that assist with the production of proteins. These
other RNAs fall into several categories. For purposes of this book, I won’t
bore you by listing them. All you need to remember is that the most impor-
tant category for evolution is ribosomal RNA.
Ribosomal RNA (abbreviated rRNA) is the class of RNA molecules that makes
up the ribosomes, the cellular factories that produce proteins.
Ribosomal RNA is of special interest to evolutionary biologists because all
organisms need ribosomes for protein production; therefore, ribosomal RNA
can be used for a couple key evolutionary tasks:
 Understanding relationships between different organisms: Ribosomes
provide a character that can be compared across all branches of life.
Most characteristics aren’t shared across all branches of life. Take eyes,
for example. Few things have eyes. As a result, comparing a human with,
say, a stalk of broccoli and a mushroom based on similarities and differ-
ences in the structure of the eye is impossible. But humans, mushrooms,
and stalks of broccoli do all have ribosomal RNA. (In case you’re curi-
ous, you and the mushroom are a fair bit more similar to each other at
the ribosomal level than either of you is to the broccoli!)
 Determining historical relationships between species: Beyond explain-
ing the level at which people and fungi share similarities, the really fasci-
nating thing about ribosomal RNA is that evolutionists can use
nucleotide sequences to determine the historical relationships among
species. In other words, it can help clarify which branch of the tree of
life an organism belongs to. You can read more about the tree of life in
Chapter 9.
Ribosomal RNA isn’t important just as a tool for evolutionary biology. It’s also
important to the proper functioning of the cell — so much so that 80 percent
of the RNA in a given cell can be ribosomal RNA. The other categories of non-
coding RNA are transfer RNA (abbreviated tRNA), which is involved in assem-
bling the amino acids that make a protein, and a growing collection of small
RNA molecules (we keep discovering new ones) that seem to be involved
with the regulation of gene expression — a fancy way of referring to the
process of deciding which genes get turned on and off in any given cell.
(Think about it: All your cells have all your genes, but the genes needed to
make your eyes aren’t expressed in your fingers, or vice versa.)
46
Part I: What Evolution Is 

Getting Specific about Genes
Oh, the poor gene. It has fallen mightily from its halcyon days of being defined
as the fundamental unit of heredity. Back then, it was clear that somehow,
some way, specific bits of information were passed from parent to offspring.
No one had any idea exactly what these bits were, but it was clear that they
existed, and we called them genes. Now that we understand genetic informa-
tion is contained in an organism’s DNA, we’ve booted . . . er, defined what we
mean by gene more precisely. 
Of alleles and loci
When most people think about heritable traits, they think about genes.
Unfortunately, the term gene is a little too general for a discussion of evolu-
tion. Instead, you need to know a little more about how the DNA strand is put
together. As I state earlier in this chapter, DNA is simply long strings of
nucleotides, abbreviated A, C, T, and G. That’s good for starters, but you need
to know a bit more. 
The word gene is commonly used in a couple of different but related ways:
 To refer to a specific place in an organism’s genome: An organism’s
DNA contains a lot of information, including all the instructions for build-
ing and maintaining that particular life form. The different instructions
for different genes are located in different places along the DNA
sequence. A specific location of a gene in an organism’s DNA is called
a locus (plural loci, pronounced low-sigh).
 To refer to the exact sequence of the DNA at a specific place (or locus)
in the genome: The sequence of nucleotides at a specific locus can
differ among organisms. These different sequences are called alleles.
Take the locus that stores the information to make the blood type pro-
tein. When scientists examine this locus in several individuals, they find
variations; some alleles code for type O blood, some for type A blood,
and so on. The exact sequence of the ACTG alphabet is different, and
this is why people have different blood types.
Using the first, you might refer to a gene for “blood type,” but using the second,
you’d refer to a gene for “type O blood” — the specific DNA sequence that
results in a particular blood type. Both definitions are workable as long as you
keep track of which one you’re using. In this book, when I talk about genes, I’m
referring in most instances to the loci. And when I’m referring to alleles, I let
you know.
47
Chapter 3: Getting into Your Genes: (Very) Basic Genetics

At any given place (locus) on the DNA strand, the sequence of nucleotides
(the alleles) that appears can be the same or different, with each particular
sequence representing a different manifestation of a particular trait. At the
locus where the eye-color trait resides, for example, you find alleles repre-
senting the different colors: blue, green, brown, and so on.
Imagine a single locus with two alleles, A and a, each representing a different
manifestation of a particular trait. Because the locus has only two options,
you can figure out pretty easily what individual combinations you may find in
the population. In this case, some people would have AA (having received A
from both parents), Aa (having received A from one parent and a from the
other), and aa (having received a from both parents).
Here are a couple of other facts about alleles to keep in mind:
 As is the case with eye color (or blood type or a number of other traits,
for that matter), you can have more than two alleles at a given locus in the
population, but any particular individual can have at most only two alleles:
one that came from the mother and one that came from the father.
 When two alleles at a particular locus are the same, they’re said to be
homozygous. When the alleles are different, they’re heterozygous. I don’t
throw these terms in just for kicks. Whether the alleles are different or
the same is an important factor in how, when, or even whether the heri-
table trait manifests itself, as the following sections explain.
Dominant, recessive, or passive-aggressive?
You probably won’t be surprised that the genes you (or any other sexually
reproducing organism) inherited from your parents can determine outward
characteristics — hence the idiom “chip off the old block.” The scientific way
of stating this rather obvious point is “Genotype (genes) translates into phe-
notype (physical traits).” Here are the possibilities:
 Each different genotype has different phenotypes. Maybe AA makes
red flowers, aa makes white flowers, and Aa makes pink flowers — an
easy-to-understand example if you know that the A allele codes for a red-
pigment protein, and the more of that protein the individual makes, the
redder the pigment is.
 The genes interact as dominant (represented by a capital letter) and
recessive (represented by a small letter). When a recessive allele is
paired with a dominant allele, the phenotype is the same as for an indi-
vidual with two dominant alleles. So in the AA, Aa, and aa example, AA
and Aa have one phenotype, and aa has another. 
To read more about genotype and phenotype — two key terms in evolution-
ary biology — go the later section “Genotype and phenotype.”

Part I: What Evolution Is 

Summing It All Up: Genomes
The sum of all the DNA in an organism is called the organism’s genome.
Studying the genome can reveal quite a bit. Scientists know, for example, that
a gene exists for a trait like eye color. But sequence an entire genome, and
they see that a lot of genes whose purpose isn’t clear. They scratch their
heads and say “I wonder what this one does?” or “Wow, the sequence of that
gene looks a lot like a particular fish gene whose function we do know.” Having
a whole genome lets scientists asked questions about genes in a completely
different way. 
From an evolutionary point of view, the genome is intriguing because it pre-
sents evolutionary scientists with a bunch of deep questions to ponder like,
if genome sizes are different for different organisms (and some in ways that
make no obvious sense), then how did that happen? Or why does so much of
the genome seem to be junk (and why is this the case in some species but not
others)? Any why are similar genes in different places on the genomes of dif-
ferent species? 
Size isn’t everything: Sizing up the genome
Different organisms have radically different genome sizes, but not necessarily
in the way you might expect. You have a much bigger genome than a bac-
terium or a mushroom does, and at first, that seems to make a lot of sense.
After all, humans certainly appear to be more complex than bacteria or
mushrooms. We have a lot more parts — arms, eyes, complicated nervous
systems, and so on — so it seems reasonable that our genome would be
bigger. Right? Well . . . maybe, and maybe not.
The range of genome sizes varies among several major groups of organisms.
Your genome is much bigger than the genome of yeast or Escherichia coli
(E. coli) bacteria, for example, yet many plants have more DNA that people
do. And just in case your ego hasn’t taken enough of a hit, you should be
aware that some plants don’t just have more DNA than we do, but more genes
as well. Poplars, for example, have twice as many genes as people do. 
For details about genome size and coding and non-coding DNA, head to
Chapter 15.
Base pairs
The unit of genome size is the number of base pairs (abbreviated bp). Why
base pairs? It’s simple math, really — and understanding how the DNA
sequence works. Think about the size of the human genome, which contains
49
Chapter 3: Getting into Your Genes: (Very) Basic Genetics

about 12 billion nucleotides. Because of the paired structure of DNA (A
always pairs with T, C always pairs with G, and so on), when you know the
6 billion on one strand, you automatically know the 6 billion on the other
strand. From an information standpoint, only 6 billion independent bits of
information exist. As a result, scientists refer to the size of the human
genome as 6 billion bp.
Junk DNA
Some DNA doesn’t seem to contain much information; it’s what scientists call
junk DNA. Some junk DNA consists of long sections in which short sequences
of nucleotides repeat over and over and over. Both plants and mammals have
lots of junk DNA, but plants seem to have more (which explains why the fern
hanging in your kitchen has more DNA than you do). That’s quite a feat, con-
sidering that we humans have a lot of junk ourselves. And just how much junk
do we have? As a matter of fact, it appears that more than 95 percent of
human DNA doesn’t contain any information about how to make a person!
Researchers are still trying to figure out why so much of human DNA is junk —
a problem that I discuss in Chapter 15.
Number of genes
Scientists have determined the DNA sequence of the entire human genome (a
fact you may already know from the various news stories that accompanied
the completion of the Human Genome Project). So it may come as a surprise
that scientists still don’t know exactly how many genes humans have. Are
they lazy or just unmotivated? As it turns out, neither.
It’s sometimes tricky to tell exactly when a sequence at some particular locus
in human genome contains instructions used for making a person and when it
contains junk. And because the human genome is more than 95 percent junk,
small variations in how scientists go about deciding what is a gene and what
isn’t can make a big difference in the total number of genes they think humans
have.
As researchers keep refining their techniques for identifying genes in this big
sea of DNA, they end up revising their numbers progressively downward.
Currently, they think they have a good handle on the situation and are rea-
sonably certain that the human genome contains about 25,000 genes. Is that a
lot? “A lot” is a relative thing. Common intestinal bacteria have about 5,000
genes; yeast has about 6,000; the common laboratory roundworm has around
18,000; and the fruit fly Drosophila has 14,000. And many plants seem to have
as many genes as human do, and some have far more.
50
Part I: What Evolution Is 

When scientists look at a sequence of DNA and identify genes, they have
techniques for determining that a particular piece of DNA makes something
and can use the genetic code to determine the amino-acid sequence of the
protein that piece of DNA makes. But they still don’t have a very good way of
looking at a protein sequence and figuring out what the protein actually does.
If the protein looks like something else whose function scientists understand,
they have some clues. But if the protein isn’t similar to something scientists
already know about, they’re often in the dark about what particular genes do.
Thus, researchers don’t yet understand exactly why organisms have the num-
bers of genes that they have.
Genome organization: Nuclear,
mitochondrial, or free floating?
Where in the world is your genome, anyway? In two different places within
your cells: the nucleus and the mitochondria. 
 In the nucleus: Your body is made of cells that have a structure in the
middle called the nucleus. This is where most of your genetic material
resides. The nucleus isn’t just one long piece of DNA, but an arranged
series of individual pieces called chromosomes (refer to the earlier sec-
tion “Chromosomes: Where your DNA is” for information on what chro-
mosomes do). 
51
Chapter 3: Getting into Your Genes: (Very) Basic Genetics
What’s up with all this junk?
The human genome is not the only one that sci-
entists have sequenced in its entirety. Initial
genome sequencing projects concentrated on
smaller creatures, such as bacteria, and it turns
out that very little of those genomes is junk.
Although researchers can’t say with certainty
why humans have so much junk DNA, it’s not hard
for them to come up with reasons why smaller,
rapidly dividing organisms do not. For example:
 They’re little, so all that junk DNA won’t fit.
 They’re in a hurry, because competing bac-
teria are sucking up nutrients and repro-
ducing as fast as they can. They don’t have
time to replicate an enormous genome
that’s mostly junk without falling behind and
being overrun by all the other bacteria.
Humans, however, are not in such a hurry all the
time, and the energy it takes to copy human
DNA is a very small part of our total energy
budget.

 In the mitochondria: Another structure in your cells contains DNA. This
structure is called mitochondria, and each of your cells contains several
dozens to hundreds of these structures. Mitochondria serve as the power
plants of the cell; they’re involved in metabolism and energy production.
Mitochondrial DNA doesn’t contain many genes, but it’s fascinating that
mitochondria have any DNA at all. Why do these small things inside
your cells have their own genome, and how did they get there? In later
chapters, I get back to mitochondria, examining how they evolved and
looking at what various studies of mitochondrial DNA tell scientists
about human history. For now, just remember that you have some mito-
chondria and that your mitochondria have some DNA.
Not all organisms have cells with nuclei. In bacteria, the genetic material is
happy to float around inside the cell, hanging out with everything else, and
doesn’t need its own special home. Furthermore, bacteria tend to keep their
genome in one piece. It probably would be biochemically complicated for
humans to have their entire genome in one segment, as the DNA would be
extremely long. Bacteria can get away with keeping their genome together
only because their genomes are much smaller. But small things don’t neces-
sarily have genomes that are just one piece; many viruses store their genomes
in sections.
How many copies?
Some organisms have more copies of their genome than others do. At first,
you may think it would be good to have extra copies of your own personal
blueprints, just in case you lose one of the instructions. Although having an
extra copy has obvious advantages, it also may have some costs, including
the additional time it takes to replicate two copies of your genome before cell
division. Biologists think that these costs must outweigh the benefits for
most bacteria, which is why many bacteria have only a single copy of their
genome.
Sometimes, when the benefits of having a backup copy outweigh the costs of
growing more slowly, an organism has an extra copy of its genome. These
cases include organisms that really need multiple spare genomes to fix
errors. One such organism is the bacteria species Deinococcus radiodurans.
This little critter has not one extra copy of its genome, but several copies,
probably due to the fact that it lives in extremely harsh environments where
DNA damage is more likely to occur from such factors as extreme drying. As
a result of having these extra copies of its genetic material, Deinococcus
radiodurans is the most radiation-resistant organism known. This little fellow
can handle 500 times more radiation than you can. 
52
Part I: What Evolution Is 

Passing It On: Sexual Reproduction
and the Genome
Diploid organisms — those with two sets of genetic information — don’t have
two copies of one genome. Instead, each locus on the genome is comprised of
two sets of alleles. 
When a sexually reproducing organism — such as a person — produces off-
spring, it first must make gametes (in the case of a human, eggs or sperm).
Each of the gametes gets one copy of the DNA segments. This gamete com-
bines with a gamete from the organism’s mate to produce an individual with
two sets of DNA.
When one set comes from Mom and one set comes from Dad, the sets may be
slightly different. This situation makes for some interesting genetic questions.
One example: How do our bodies read the instructions if the two copies
aren’t the same? That depends on the particular alleles: what trait or charac-
teristic they’re coding for and whether either is dominant.
Dominating issues
Consider the snapdragons. Snapdragons are diploid, just like you are, though
they make ovules and pollen rather than eggs or sperm. At a particular place
in their genome is a locus that’s responsible for flower color. Two possible
alleles appear at this locus; call these alleles W and R. (Alleles are often
referred to by letters.) Plants with two copies of the W allele are white; plants
with two copies of the R allele are red. How about plants that have one copy
of each allele? In the case of snapdragons, the plants with one W allele and
one R allele are pink, which seems to make sense.
But it doesn’t always work that way. Sometimes one of the alleles is dominant,
explained in the earlier section “Dominant, recessive, or passive aggressive.”
If a plant has only one copy of that allele, that allele determines the organ-
ism’s characteristics. In the pea plants that the famous geneticist Gregor
Mendel worked with, there are two possible alleles at the locus responsible
for flower color: one that codes for purple flowers (P) and one that codes for
white flowers (w). In Mendel’s peas, the purple allele is dominant (hence the
capital rather than lowercase letter). If a plant has two alleles that code for
purple, then it has purple flowers. If it has two alleles that code for white,
then it has white flowers. But because the purple allele is dominant, a plant
with one purple and one white allele turns out just as purple as a plant with
two purple alleles. 
53
Chapter 3: Getting into Your Genes: (Very) Basic Genetics

In this case, knowing the color of the organism doesn’t give you perfect infor-
mation about the underlying genetics. If the pea flour is white, you know that
it has two of white alleles (ww). But if the pea flour is purple, it may have two
purple alleles (PP) or one purple allele and one white allele (Pw). This situa-
tion leads to the topic of genotype and phenotype, which very conveniently
comes next.
Genotype and phenotype
Genotype refers to the alleles that a particular organism has — the actual
sequences of DNA in its genome, such as a gene for growth hormone.
Phenotype refers to the physical characteristics of the organism, such as the
organism’s height.
Genotype and phenotype are often connected, but the important thing to
remember is that the connection is not always absolute. Organisms with the
same phenotypes may have different genotypes; similarly, organizations with
the same genotypes may have different phenotypes. What this means is that
you can’t always determine what DNA sequences are at play simply by identi-
fying outward characteristics; neither can you always know whether an
organism’s characteristics are the result of genetics or of something else.
Different phenotypes, same genotype
An organism’s phenotype — its physical characteristics — is not always deter-
mined by its genes alone. Grasping this concept is especially important when
you think about evolution by natural selection. Environmental factors — like
how much food we get or how big our pond is — interact with genotype to
produce an organism’s phenotype.
Imagine a pack of cheetahs chasing a gazelle across the African plains. One
by one, the cheetahs get tired and give up. But one cheetah keeps at it and
eventually catches the gazelle. It’s a tough year out there in the Serengeti,
and the mere difference of a single gazelle can determine whether a cheetah
is able to reproduce.
Why this cheetah captured the gazelle while the others fell away, I have
absolutely no idea. Are her genes especially good? Does she have different
genes that make her go extra fast? Perhaps . . . but perhaps not. It could be
that all the cheetahs have the same genes, but this particular cheetah was
lucky enough to have been very well fed when she was a cub and, as a result,
grew up to be faster and stronger. If that’s the case, all these cheetahs have
the same genotype, but the phenotype — in the successful cheetah’s case,
the strength and stamina to continue the chase — differs.
54
Part I: What Evolution Is 

Same phenotype, different genotypes
Occasionally, organisms have the same phenotype (characteristics) but dif-
ferent genotypes (gene sequences). Consider the human blood-type alleles A,
B, and O. Each of us has two of these alleles, receiving one from each parent.
Six pairs of alleles are possible: AA, AO, BB, BO, AB, and OO. Yet only four
blood types exist: A, B, AB, and O. How does that work?
Well, in one way, it’s similar to the snapdragon with a red, white, and pink
flower. Whether you have A, B, or AB blood depends on the genotype:
 The AA genotype (you got an A allele from each parent) gives you type A
blood.
 The BB genotype (you got a B allele from each parent) gives you type B
blood.
 The AB genotype (you got an A allele from one parent and a B from the
other) gives you type AB blood.
To understand the others, you need to know that A and B are dominant over
O, but neither is dominant over the other. Therefore:
 The AO genotype gives you type A blood.
 The BO genotype gives you type B blood.
 The OO genotype gives you type O blood.
Knowing the phenotype sometimes gives you complete information about the
genotype, such as the phenotypes for type O blood and type AB blood. But in
the cases of blood type A and blood type B, two possible genotypes could
bring about each phenotype.
What this has to do with natural selection
Natural selection — the process by which organisms with favorable traits are
more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes (see Chapter 5 for more in-
depth info) — acts on phenotype, not genotype. Think about it. No matter
how great an organism’s genes are, they can be reproduced in subsequent
generations only if that organism reproduces — and that depends on outward
characteristics (phenotypes). 
In the earlier cheetah example, you expect that faster cheetahs will leave
more descendents in future generations than the slow ones that couldn’t
catch dinner. Some phenotypic variation existed in the cheetah population,
and as a result, some cheetahs did better than others. That’s natural selec-
tion. But is it evolution? Depends.
55
Chapter 3: Getting into Your Genes: (Very) Basic Genetics

Selection results in evolution only if there are genetic differences between the
cheetahs of different speeds. The difference in speed has to be a heritable
one — one that can be passed on genetically from parent to offspring. If the
faster cheetahs have different genes than the slower cheetahs, then the next
generation will have a higher proportion of those genes because the cheetahs
that had them eat more antelope and made more baby cheetahs. But if the
faster cheetahs aren’t any different genetically than the slower ones, then
there won’t be any evolutionary change from one generation to the next.

How Evolution
Works

In this part . . .
E
volution by natural selection requires mutations. 
Now, there aren’t many times when you hear the word
“mutation” and think it’s a good thing. Even in evolution-
ary terms, most mutations are bad. But some mutations
give an organism a fitness advantage resulting in its being
able to survive and reproduce. The result? More of the
genetically advantaged organisms in future populations.
But selection isn’t the only evolutionary force. Genetic
drift (a fancy way of saying random events) can affect
gene frequencies, too. If a mudslide wipes out a large por-
tion of a wildflower that just happens to bloom pink in a
particular area, then there will be fewer pink-flowering
plants in later generations. 
This part tackles the mechanisms of evolutionary 
change (variation, mutation, selection — both natural and
artificial — genetic drift, and so on); their results (loss of
genetic variation, change in genetic variation, and specia-
tion); and how to retrace past evolutionary events and see
the relationships among species (through phylogenetic
trees).

volution can’t happen without variation, but not just any type of variation
will do. It must be heritable variation — that is, variation that gets passed
genetically from parent to offspring. But some evolutionary forces, such as
natural selection and genetic drift (covered in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively),
actually cause a reduction in genetic variation over time. Fortunately, 
mutations — random errors in the genetic code — generate the very kind 
of variation that evolution needs. Despite the fact that most of the specific
mutations aren’t good for any organisms, mutations in general are absolutely
necessary.
Variation and mutation go hand in hand, so this chapter examines both
topics. And because it’s always fun to see how the genes you get affect who
you are, I also discuss how many of the traits you exhibit are determined by
the genes you have.
Understanding Variation
In evolutionary terms, variation simply refers to the differences you see among
individuals. In other words, individuals from any species aren’t all the same.
Look around a room full of people, and you notice that all of them look different.
That’s variation. You can see how heritable changes — hair color, eye color,
facial structure, height, and so on — manifest themselves outwardly. But these
changes also manifest themselves in ways that aren’t so easy to see, such as
propensity for certain illnesses or blood type. And if those differences are a
result of genes, that’s heritable, or genetic, variation.

Even though variation is a simple concept to grasp, it’s a crucial component
of evolution. Without heritable variation, evolution couldn’t occur, because
change couldn’t occur from generation to generation. If every individual in
one generation were the same, every individual in the next generation would
be the same. Variation has to be present before natural selection occurs; you
can’t have the sorting-out process if nothing’s available to sort.
You’re most aware of small differences in things you spend a lot of time inter-
acting with. Just because all hyenas (or wild dogs, ducks, or any other nonhu-
man organism) seem to you to look the same, act the same, and do the same
things doesn’t mean that those species lack variation.
Key concepts in variation
As stated previously, for evolution to occur, the variation has to be heritable.
If all the individuals in a population are genetically identical, and they produce
offspring that are genetically identical, evolution hasn’t occurred, because the
next generation is the same genetically as the current generation.
Variation exists in natural populations, and there’s often a lot of it: 
 Variation within a species: All species have variation. Just thinking of
the variations within our own species is a good place to start. It would take
at least 100 books this size to list all the ways that people are genetically
different from one another. An important thing to remember, though, is
that the variation within a species doesn’t need to be uniformly distributed
across all population in that species. The different populations will all
have genetic variability, but they all won’t always have the same genetic
patterns. For example, a species may contain individuals of many different
heights, but not all populations within that species will have individuals of
all heights; some populations may be made up of, on average, taller
individuals than others. 
 Variation within populations: It’s the variability within a population that
allows the population to respond to natural selection. Take the finches
in the Galapagos. Within one finch population that was studied, there was
existing variation in beak size. When other birds arrived on the island
and began eating the food these finches relied on, this existing variation
allowed that species to evolve to better utilize a smaller seed resource.
 Variations between populations: It’s the variation between populations
that tells us that two populations have evolved in different ways. The
populations are genetically different from one another, meaning that
gene flow between the populations hasn’t been able to overwhelm the
different evolutionary forces they experience. That different alleles have
60
Part II: How Evolution Works  

increased or decreased in the different populations could be the result
of natural selection (discussed in Chapter 5), random factors (the topic
in Chapter 6), of both. If two populations continue to become genetically
different, they can become too different to interbreed, a topic addressed
in Chapter 8.
In evolution, the relevant variation occurs at the group or species level. You
cannot talk about variation unless you have more than one individual. If 
you have variation in the genetic composition of the group or species, the
next generation can be different. That’s evolution.
A variety of mechanisms can cause the genetic makeup of the next generation
to differ from the genetic makeup of the current generation. Natural selection
(Chapter 5) and random factors (Chapter 6) are two immediate examples. These
mechanisms change the genetic makeup of a population from one generation
to the next: natural selection, because some genetic types have better repro-
ductive success than others, and genetic drift, just because sometimes stuff
happens — a fire kills many blue-eyed deer, leaving fewer blue-eyed deer to
make more blue-eyed deer.
Two kinds of variation: Phenotypic 
and genotypic
The two kinds of variation are phenotypic (changes in outward physical traits)
and genotypic (changes in the organism’s underlying genetic makeup — basically,
the DNA sequence of its genes).
Individuals with the same phenotype can have different genotypes, and indi-
viduals with the same genotype can have different phenotypes. Height, for
example, has both a genetic component and an environmental component.
You’d think that two people with identical genetic makeup (such as identical
twins) would be the same height, but if only one received a healthy diet, the
result could be two adults of different heights. In this example, two people
with the same genotype have different phenotypes. Conversely, two people
with different genetic make-ups can be the same height. In this case, the two
individuals have different genotypes but the same phenotypes.
Keeping this distinction in mind is important when you think about how natural
selection can cause evolutionary change. Because natural selection doesn’t
“see” the different genotypes, it acts only on the phenotypes — the physical
features of the organism that can influence its survival and reproduction. But
evolution can occur only if phenotypic differences are correlated with genotypic
differences.
61
Chapter 4: Variation: A Key Requirement for Evolution 

Imagine that being taller carries a selective advantage — that is, taller folks
are better at surviving and reproducing. In the case of the identical twins
with different heights, the taller of the two identical twins would be more
likely to contribute genes to the next generation, but because the height
difference was due to environmental factors and not genetic makeup, the
genetic composition of the next generation doesn’t change. In the case of the
two unrelated people of the same height, the two individuals have different
genotypes, but because natural selection acts only on phenotypes, both
individuals are the same height, so they have an equal chance of contributing
genes to the next generation.
Variation that’s important to evolution
You can partition variation by whether it’s heritable (or not) or has fitness
consequences (or not): 
 Heritable variation: This type of variation is genetic; these are the
differences at the DNA level that are passed from parent to offspring. 
 Non-heritable variation: This type of variation is the result of the envi-
ronment factors, things like diet, amount of sunlight, and so on — not
genes. 
 Variations that have fitness consequences: These variations impact, for
better or worse, how well an organism is able to survive and reproduce.
 Variations that don’t have fitness consequences: These variations don’t
impact either positively or negatively an organism’s ability to survive
and reproduce.
The type of variation determines in what manner (or even whether) it has an
impact on the genetic makeup of future generations: 
 If a variation has a fitness consequences but the variation isn’t heritable,
it won’t lead to evolution. For example, people with really cute tattoos
may be more likely to pass along their genes, but there’s no genetic
component to getting a tattoo. Their genes are, on average, no different
from anyone else’s genes. Remember: Without heritable variation, there
is no evolution (or evolution books, for that matter). 
 If a variation is heritable but it doesn’t cause any fitness differences,
then the frequencies of these differences in a population will change
only as a result of genetic drift, not natural selection.
 If variation is both heritable and has fitness consequences, well then,
evolution by natural selection can occur.
62
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Population structure and gene flow
Species are not uniformly mixed. All the people in the human population, for
example, are completely capable of mating, but we’re not totally genetically
mixed, hence, the existence of regional heritable differences. The reason for
this lack of mixing is remarkably simple: It’s a matter of gene flow, which
means the movement of genes in space. 
The reason the genes within the human population (and the populations of
many other species) aren’t completely mixed is because we’re more likely to
mate with others who are nearby. Populations that are close together in
space are more likely to exchange genes with each other than populations
that are farther away.
Gene flow, the idea that genes can move from one population to another, is a
key concept in evolution. You move to Sweden, find a nice, blue-eyed, blond
spouse and raise a family. Your children are Swedish, but maybe they’ve got
your eyes — that’s gene flow.
Where Variation Comes From: Mutations
The process of evolution (via natural selection, drift, or both) eliminates
heritable variation. If not all the alleles make it into the next generation —
because some are selected against or disappear due to random forces —
heritable variation eventually goes away. That scenario leads to the subject
of mutation, which is the ultimate source of genetic variation.
Mutations are changes in an organism’s DNA. If all the deer in the forest have
only genes to produce normal noses and one deer is born with a blinking red
nose (a heritable trait), a mutation must have occurred in one of the gametes
(either the sperm or the egg) that led to that red-nosed baby deer.
DNA is an extremely stable molecule; that’s what makes it so good for storing
your genetic information. But mutations still occur:
 DNA is tough, but it’s not indestructible. It can be damaged, and
although your cells try to repair the damage, they don’t always get it
right, resulting in mutations. Agents that have this damaging effect are
referred to as mutagens. Examples of mutagens include the ionizing radi-
ation associated with nuclear material, ultraviolet radiation from the
sun, and many chemicals. 
 The process of DNA replication that occurs in all cell division — be it in
the gametes (egg and sperm) or in somatic tissue (everything else) — is
another source of mutations. DNA replication is an error-prone process —
sometimes the copying isn’t exact, and that also results in mutations.
(To find out more about DNA replication, refer to Chapter 3.)
63
Chapter 4: Variation: A Key Requirement for Evolution 

Sometimes, mutations are selectively advantageous. (Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer did save Christmas, after all.) But most of the time, they’re not.
Mutations are either selectively neutral (they have no effect on fitness) or
deleterious (they decrease fitness). Regardless, without mutation, there’d be
no variation on which natural selection can act. Yet a number of forces can
reduce variation from generation to generation. Variations that are selectively
disadvantageous would be eliminated from the population over time, and the
random forces of genetic drift (see Chapter 6) eventually would purge diver-
sity from the population.
Important mutations
Mutations occur all the time, but only certain mutations are important for
evolution: those that are heritable. For single-celled organisms like bacteria,
all mutations are heritable. A bacterium reproduces by dividing, and any
changes that occur in the organism’s DNA before division are passed on to
the daughter cells. That’s not the case with animals. Most of the cells in the
human body, for example, don’t contribute directly to the next generation.
Only the germ line (eggs and sperm) do, so only mutations in those tissues
can be passed to offspring.
Which comes first — the mutant 
chicken or the selective agent?
Here’s a major stumbling block many people have in understanding how
mutations are involved in the process of evolution. Many people think that
64
Part II: How Evolution Works  
Mutations leading to cancer
When you hear the term mutation, the first thing
that may spring to mind are mutations that cause
diseases such as cancer. Stay out in the sun too
long, and ultraviolet radiation bombards your
skin cells. This radiation causes changes in your
DNA that affect the regulation of cell division,
and all of a sudden, one of your cells doesn’t play
nice with the rest of your body. These types of
mutations certainly are important medically, but
they don’t affect the genetic composition of your
offspring.
Cancer and other such mutations can be impor-
tant in evolution if there are differences in the
mutation rate between individuals, for example,
with some individuals being much more likely to
die of cancer than others and, therefore, less
likely to have descendants in the next genera-
tion. In such a scenario, the characteristic of
having a higher mutation rate would be the char-
acter under selection, not the cancer itself.

selectively advantageous mutations occur in response to environmental
factors that make them advantageous. The thinking goes this way: All these
short-necked creatures are running around on the plains in Africa; their main
food supply is the vegetation on the ground, but they eat so much, not
enough ground vegetation is left to feed the population. What do they do?
They evolve to have longer necks so that they can eat the leaves off the trees.
Voilà! Giraffes evolve, and the problem is solved. But this scenario is
absolutely not how evolution works. 
Mutations don’t occur in response to environmental factors; they already
exist in the population. In the presence of some new environmental factor
that makes the mutation beneficial, the organism with that mutation is more
likely to survive. In the example of the short-necked creatures in Africa,
suppose that a few random mutations result in a few long-necked individuals.
The long-necked ones and the short-necked ones still eat the rapidly diminishing
grass supply, but the long-necked ones have an advantage because, in addition
to grass, they can eat the leaves off trees. Being better fed, they are more
likely to survive and reproduce.
This principle — that the mutation already exists in the population — is crystal
clear when you witness evolution in progress, which is possible with organisms
that have short generational time spans. Take a flask of bacteria, for example;
put in some penicillin; and you’re left with a flask that contains only a few
surviving bacteria, all of which are penicillin resistant. What happened? Some
of the bacteria in the flask already had slightly different DNA sequences that
made them resistant to penicillin. Examples illustrating the evolution of
antibiotic resistance come up several times in this book because they so
beautifully illustrates how organisms — both simple and complex — evolve.
Variation needs to exist in a population before the evolutionary forces can
select for it. Once the new selective force (climate change, new disease, and
so on) appears, it’s too late for any new mutations to be beneficial. Only indi-
viduals that already have characteristics that are beneficial in the presence of
the new selective force will have an advantage.
Different kinds of mutations
A mutation is simply any change in the DNA sequence. As you can imagine,
more than one type of change is possible. At each position in the DNA sequence,
there are one of four possible nucleotides (A, C, T, and G). The simplest change
to imagine is a change where the original nucleotide in a particular position is
replaced by one of the other three possibilities. An A is changed to either G,
T, or C, for example. Mutations of this type involving just a single point in the
DNA sequence are called point mutations. More complicated changes are also
possible. Whole sections of DNA can be removed, moved from one place to the
65
Chapter 4: Variation: A Key Requirement for Evolution 

next, or duplicated. The following sections explain these types of mutations in
more detail (head to Chapter 15 for information on the significance of gene
duplication). 
DNA is a long string of four different nucleotides that thread off in groups of
three. The different three-base sequences instruct the cell to assemble differ-
ent amino acids into a protein. Some three-base sequences instruct the cell
where to start along the DNA sequence and where to stop. Not all sections of
an organism’s DNA are used to code for proteins, but for the purposes of this
discussion the important sections are those that do code for proteins. (Refer
to Chapter 3 for more detail about how the sequence of the DNA is used to
code for the specific amino acids needed to make a given protein and Chapter 15
if you want to know more about non-coding DNA.)
Point mutations
In a point mutation, a single nucleotide in the DNA is replaced by some other
nucleotide, resulting in a particular three-letter sequence of DNA that’s differ-
ent. Because of the redundancy of the genetic code, point mutations don’t
always result in a change in the amino acid and, therefore, don’t affect the
organism’s phenotype, making this particular mutation selectively neutral.
There is no change in fitness between the original type and the mutant type.
Sometimes, though, a point mutation results in a different amino acid being
used in the production of a protein. In this type of mutation, the protein may
have a different structure and may behave differently. If the organism’s phe-
notype is changed, this type of mutation may have fitness consequences. Or
it may not — there are many examples where an amino acid change results in
the production of a slightly different protein but one that works exactly as
well. Changes of this sort may have fitness consequences, or they may be
selectively neutral.
At other times, a point mutation could replace a three-letter sequence coding
for an amino acid with a sequence that starts or stops protein production.
Stopping production of a protein when only part of the amino acid sequence
has been assembled is likely to result in a protein with a very different struc-
ture and is likely to have a negative affect an organism’s phenotype. More
often than not, making just half of a protein will be less advantageous than
making the whole thing.
Insertion and deletion mutations
Larger changes also can occur in an organism’s DNA. Sections of DNA can be
lost or inserted into other sections. These sorts of changes are referred to as
deletions and insertions, and although they don’t always have a large effect,
it’s easy to see how they can. 
66
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Deleting a section of an organism’s instructions set is not likely to be advanta-
geous. Whatever information is eliminated may prove to be extremely impor-
tant. Obviously the larger the deletion, the larger the potential problem, but
even small deletions can cause major effect. 
Preventing bad mutations
Mutations tend to be bad, so (not surprisingly) mechanisms exist within cells
to reduce the probability of mutation. Biochemical mechanisms repair dam-
aged DNA; proofreading mechanisms catch errors that occur during DNA
replication. (Yes, each and every one of us has spell check built in!)
So if mutations can be fixed, why do they exist? For a few reasons.
Mistakes happen
No repair or proofreading system is perfect. I hope, for example, that this
book has no typos; it’s gone through several editing and proofreading checks.
But every once in a while, you find a typo in a book; maybe you’ll find one in
this book. No matter how hard you try, being prefect isn’t possible, and the
same is true of cellular biochemistry.
Trade-offs
A trade-off may occur between speed of DNA replication and accuracy of 
DNA replication. Although mutations tend to be deleterious, slowing down
reproduction is also bad for fitness. Genes responsible for a phenotype that 
reproduces slowly but accurately would be at a disadvantage against genes
that generate a phenotype that reproduces more rapidly and is almost as
accurate. Each of the individual descendants of the rapid (but sloppy) organism
would be more likely to have a couple of extra deleterious mutations, but many
more of them would be around, and the overall reproductive success of less
error-prone individuals would be lower.
This argument suggests that the mutation rate itself is a character affected by
natural selection. And it is. We know from laboratory experiments that mutation
rate is a variable heritable character. 
It’s easy to see how too much mutation would be disadvantageous, so we
know that natural selection will keep the mutation rate from getting too high.
It’s a bit harder to see how natural selection would favor any mutation rate,
but there may be a couple of reasons: the short-term trade-offs such as the
one described earlier between speed and accuracy, and long-term effects
67
Chapter 4: Variation: A Key Requirement for Evolution 

whereby lineages with low mutation rates are eventually eliminated by lineages
with slightly higher mutation rates because the slightly higher mutation rate
results in at least some favorable mutations. Perhaps the best mutation rate
is not too much, but not too little. Consider this the Goldilocks principle: You
don’t want too many or too few mutations, but just the right amount: 
 Some mutations are advantageous. Mutation is the ultimate source of the
variation on which natural selection acts. Natural selection acts to eliminate
deleterious mutations and increases the frequency of advantageous ones.
 Maybe a too-low mutation rate is deleterious: Some scientists speculate
that over the long run, a very low mutation rate, while advantageous for
individuals in the short-term (because most mutations are bad and you
don’t want to make mutated kids), may be disadvantageous for the species
as a whole. Over long time periods, the selective forces acting on a species are
likely to change (climate changes, species move to different habitats, and
so on). Without sufficient variation, the species would be unable to respond
evolutionarily to these challenges. Such a species could be outcompeted
by a species with some higher level of mutation. 
This scenario is speculation and involves the tricky subject of selection
acting a level other than that of the individual (a topic you can read more
about in Chapter 11). Scientists lack a clear understanding of what sets a
lower limit for mutation rate — maybe all the biochemistry involved in
DNA replication eliminates the possibility of a zero mutation rate — still,
the concept is an interesting one. 
Bottom line: Mutations tend to be bad, and in the short term, not having any
would be good relative to having some. Thinking that a mutation rate is a
good thing because you could end up with descendants that are more fit is
like thinking that sinking all your retirement funds into the lottery is a good
idea because you could end up a millionaire. True, you could get that result,
but chances are that you’ll end up broke instead. 
Gene Frequency and the Hardy-
Weinberg Equilibrium 
For asexually reproducing creatures (those with just one parent), reproduc-
tion is extremely simple: Make a copy of your DNA and divide. If no mutations
occur, parent and offspring are identical. 
For organisms that have two parents (called diploid organisms), reproduction
is a bit more complicated. Each individual has two copies of DNA, one from
each parent, and will pass on a single copy to each offspring (the other
parent contributes the other copy). At each location in the genome, a diploid
organism has two alleles, and one or the other will randomly end up in each
68
Part II: How Evolution Works  

gamete. When offspring are produced, the relative frequency of different
genotypes produced will be a function of the frequency of the different alleles
in the population. 
Heritable variation is necessary for evolution by natural selection. The pattern
of the existing variation (something that can be measured) can tell scientists
about whether evolution is occurring. 
To understand how allele and genotypic frequencies change under various
evolutionary forces, scientists study what happens when none of these forces
is at work. Under such conditions, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium states that
allele frequencies don’t change and predicts what the frequency of genotypes
should be in a population. This equilibrium states that if you know the frequency
of the alleles in a population, you can figure out the frequency of the genotypes
in the next generation if (1) mating is random and (2) no evolutionary forces
are changing the allele frequencies in the next generation. 
To help you understand the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the following infor-
mation focuses on how allele frequencies correspond to genotype frequencies
at a locus where, among all the individuals in the population, there are only
two different alleles.
What’s the big idea?
The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium helps scientists determine when natural
selection or genetic drift is at work. If the results deviate from the prediction,
you know that one of the following situations has occurred, because any of
them would cause a deviation:
 Gene flow: Gene flow is one of the factors that can lead to a deviation
from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. If one genotype rather than another
moves into or out of a population, the genotype frequencies can’t be
predicted from the allele frequencies. 
Suppose that all the individuals with the aa genotype fly away. You’re left
with a population that consists only of AA and Aa individuals, and you
can’t predict the frequency of genotypes accurately from the frequency
of the alleles. What’s important is not just that movement of individuals
into or out of the population is occurring, but that this movement is
related to the genotypes of the individuals.
 Selection: Imagine that individuals with the aa allele die without repro-
ducing (which would be the case with lethal recessive alleles). In such a
case, only AA and Aa individuals would be left in the population. Again, the
frequency of genotypes can’t be accurately predicted by the frequency of
the alleles. A deviation from expectations under Hardy-Weinberg indicates
that some evolutionary force is at play.
69
Chapter 4: Variation: A Key Requirement for Evolution 

It’s been estimated that the average human has perhaps a few lethal
recessive alleles. But these alleles are rare in the population and express
themselves only if a person happens to have children with someone who
has the same lethal recessive gene.
 Nonrandom mating: The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumes that indi-
viduals mate randomly. If that’s not the case — if AA individuals prefer
other AA individuals, for example — after one generation of such mating,
the proportion of individuals that is heterozygous will decrease. (Only
matings between heterozygous individuals can produce more
heterozygous individuals, but not all their offspring will be heterozygotes;
some will be AA and aa.) Matings between homozygous individuals
always produce homozygous offspring.
 Random events (that is, genetic drift): When population sizes are small,
random events can cause a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg. For example,
while each allele in an individual has an equal chance of getting into a
gamete, when only a small number of offspring are produced, just by
chance one or another allele might be over (or under) represented, leading
to yet another deviation from the expected genotype frequencies. Head to
Chapter 6 for more information on genetic drift. 
Using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
Scientists use the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium when they know the propor-
tions of the different alleles in the population and want to predict the 
proportions of the different genotypes in the population. Here’s a simple
example using one locus with two alleles.
70
Part II: How Evolution Works  
Inbreeding: An example of nonrandom mating
Inbreeding, which is a special case of nonran-
dom mating, occurs when individuals mate with
relatives. Because related individuals are more
likely to have similar genes, they’re also more
likely to have similar deleterious recessive genes
(which is why the offspring of close relatives
tend to have reduced fitness). If these individu-
als mate, chances increase that two individuals
with the recessive trait will get together and
produce offspring that end up with two copies
of the recessive genes and the condition that
the recessive genes cause.

Suppose that you decide to measure the proportion of the alleles A and a in a
population. Call these proportions p and q, where p is the proportion of A
alleles and q is the proportion of a alleles. Because of the way proportions
work (they represent portions of 100 percent), you know that p + q = 1. If 70
percent of the alleles are A, 30 percent are a, and p = 0.7 and q = 0.3.
So now you’ve got the proportion of A and a, and you want the proportion of
AA, Aa, and aa. Here’s how you do it:
p2+ 2pq + q2
Plug in the numbers you got for p and q, and you get
0.49 + 0.42 + 0.09
Translation: If 70 percent of the gametes are A, 49 percent of the offspring will
be AA (0.7 x 0.7 = 0.49). If you don’t find that result, you know that other
forces are at play in this population.
Imagine that the a allele is a lethal recessive gene. Anyone unlucky enough to
get two copies of this gene dies, which means that you won’t find any individ-
uals in the population that are aa. That result is a deviation from the Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium. In this particular example, this deviation is the result
of natural selection selecting against people with the aa allele.

volution is nothing more — or less — than changes in the relative
frequencies of heritable traits in a group of organisms (whether particular
populations or whole species) over time. Simple enough.
But what causes traits to change over time? Often, it’s natural selection, the
process whereby some individuals, as a result of possessing specific traits
(keener eyes, bigger leaves, etc.) leave more descendants than other individuals
that lack these traits. If these advantageous traits are heritable (and thus are
passed on to offspring), then over time, as some traits are favored and others
are selected against, populations change — they evolve. Eyesight gets keener
because the individuals with weaker eyes are not passing the genes for weaker
eyes to future generations. Changes that are the result of natural selection are
adaptations. In this example, keener eyes is an adaptation, as are bigger leaves.
Natural selection is not a difficult concept, but many people get all confused
about it — particularly when it comes to differentiating between the process
of selection (how it works) and the results of selection (the adaptations).
This chapter helps you sort everything out.
Natural selection is only one of the mechanisms that cause evolution.
Another mechanism — genetic drift — is the topic of the next chapter.

Natural versus Artificial Selection
As Darwin was formulating his theory of evolution by natural selection, he was
influenced by the vast body of knowledge on the domestication of plants and
animals. Artificial selection refers to the selective process when humans are
acting as a selective agent. Darwin was aware of the power of artificial selection
to affect genetic changes in domestic animals over a relatively short period of
time. Imagine, he perhaps exclaimed, what sort of changes might occur over
the history of life on Earth! 
Charles Darwin wrote On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection,
or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. In this book, one
of his key insights was to recognize that the struggle for life had winners and
losers, and that it would result in changes in populations through time as the
winners contributed their genes to the next generation but the losers didn’t. 
Darwin saw that the process of natural selection, where the environment in
which a population lived could impact what genes made it into subsequent
generations, was very similar the process used in animal breeding. The key
difference is that in husbandry, humans — and not nature — decide who the
winners and losers are. 
When nature is the selective agent, the process is called natural selection. When
humans are the selective agent, the process is called artificial selection. We can
use artificial selection to examine the process of evolution in the laboratory,
and we can observe natural selection occurring in the wild.
The process of artificial selection isn’t exactly identical to what happens in
the natural environment because humans can get pretty creative in their
animal and plant breeding. A particular breeding endeavor, for example,
could require a cocktail of approaches: perhaps a little directional selection,
just a touch of genetic drift, and a dash of in-breeding followed by some more
selection. The result is that allele frequencies of the domestic population
change, but it’s not strictly identical to the natural process. 
Evolution by natural selection (or any other mechanism) is a property of
groups, not individuals. Have you ever seen that cartoon of the fish that grew
legs and crawled up onto the land? If that seemed confusing, it’s because it is.
No one fish grows legs. It lives and dies with the same fins it always had. But if,
in a population of fish, there is heritable variation in fin structure (and remember,
there is heritable variation for pretty much everything) and fish with stiffer,
stubblier fins leave more offspring, then the population at some future time
will have, on average, stiffer fins. If mutations that results in even stiffer fins
are selectively favored, the process keeps going until you have fish that
waddle around in the mud (such fish exist), and up up up we go from there. 
The following sections tease apart in more detail some of the different ways
that selection can act.
74
Part II: How Evolution Works 

Directional selection
In directional selection, natural selection favors an extreme phenotype — for
example, the fastest individuals. If selection for the extreme phenotype con-
tinues through time, the population will become faster and faster so long as
sufficient heritable variation in speed is present on which natural selection
can act. 
Think about a cheetah and its prey. All other things being equal, faster is always
better, so natural selection acts to increase the speed of both the predator
and the prey from one generation to the next. (Some physical limits exist on
how fast animals can run, of course, but this process has generated some
very fast creatures on the plains of the Serengeti!) 
Stabilizing selection
Stabilizing selection (also called balancing selection) favors the middle ground —
that is, traits that aren’t too hot or too cold, but just right, when just right
means comfortably in the middle between two extremes. Think of this form
as the Goldilocks of selection.
In stabilizing selection, the most-fit trait is intermediate with respect to whatever
characteristic selection is acting on. An example is the birth weight of babies.
Very small babies have a lower probability of survival, but very large 
babies are more likely to suffer complications during birth. Babies of 
intermediate size, however, are most likely to survive to reproduce.
Adaptation: Changes Resulting 
from Natural Selection
An adaptation is a trait that has resulted from evolution by natural selection.
In the example of the cheetahs earlier in this chapter, the ability to run faster
is an example of an adaptation. Antibiotic resistance (see Chapter 17) is
another example of an adaptation. This trait appears in a bacterial population
because of random mutations that made some bacteria better able to survive
and reproduce in the presence of antibiotics.
Some folks quibble over whether the evolution of antibiotic resistance is
truly the result of natural selection since people are hosing down the world
with tons of antibiotics and thus exerting selective pressure of their own.
Others say that it is natural rather than artificial selection because even
75
Chapter 5: Natural Selection and Adaptations in Action

though people altered the environment in this instance, the bacteria
responded (naturally!) to that change. (Also, antibiotics occur naturally —
lots of microbes make them — and bacteria evolve in response to those.
Many microorganisms produce antibiotics to inhibit the growth of other
microorganisms. Penicillin, for example, is a natural antibiotic that gets its
name from the mold that produces it, Penicillium chrysogenum.) 
If the whole concept of adaptation seems to be ridiculously straightforward,
that’s because overall it is. The following sections explain why recognizing an
adaptation isn’t not always easy though. 
Is it an adaptation—or not?
Distinguishing adaptive from non-adaptive traits isn’t easy. Identifying an
adaptation and the selective force that caused it is pretty clear cut when it
comes to something like antibiotic resistance because we’ve been around to
observe the whole process. The situation gets a bit dicier when you talk
about adaptations we haven’t observed, because in nature, it’s not always
crystal clear whether a particular trait is an adaptation. 
76
Part II: How Evolution Works 
Acclimatization
Adaptation, the result of evolution by natural
selection, works at the species level, not at the
individual level. Acclimatization, on the other
hand, occurs within individuals.
Suppose that you decide to visit Denver, which
is a mile above sea level and has less oxygen
than lower-lying areas of the country. On your
first day in the city, you decide to go jogging and
find the activity much more difficult than usual.
After a few days, however, you begin to feel like
your old self and can jog just as you used to.
Why? Because your body reacted to the lower
levels of oxygen by producing additional red
blood cells. Although most people in this situa-
tion would say that they’ve adapted to the alti-
tude, they’d be more accurate if they said that
they’ve acclimatized. This kind of distinction is
exactly the idiosyncratic type of parsing that
scientists (and English teachers) love.
While you won’t be doing any adapting on your
trip to Denver, there is evidence to suggest that
human populations that have lived for long peri-
ods at high altitude show genetic changes that
could be adaptations to the lower oxygen con-
centrations at altitude. When you acclimate in
Denver, you make more red blood cells which
are the same as the red blood cells you had
before. The Sherpas living at high altitude in the
Himalayas, however, have differences in blood
chemistry that result in their red blood cells
having higher affinity for oxygen than others.

There are limits
Some limits exist to what natural selection can accomplish. If natural 
selection always favors more-fit genes, all species would be on the road to
super-organism — forever getting faster, glowier, taller, whatever. And there’d
be no limit in numbers of limbs, eyes, hearts, tails, and fins, if having more 
of these things means being more fit. But that’s not what happens. 
 Some things may just not be physically possible: Mammals will never
run at the speed of sound. 
 Others may not be biologically possible: The mammal lineage seems
limited to four limbs — variation in limb number is absent. 
 Some adaptations may preclude others: A bird can have wings that
function like a penguin or a hummingbird, but not both. This idea is
explained in more detail in the later section “You can’t get there from
here: Constraints and trade-offs.” 
Exaptation: Selecting for one trait, 
ending up with another
An exaptation is a trait that resulted from selection for something other than
the trait’s current function. Think about feathers. Scientists know from the fossil
record that the earliest creatures with feathers didn’t fly. So what was the
purpose of feathers on these early flightless animals? Maybe they served as
insulation (as feathers today do), or maybe they served some other function.
Regardless of their actual purpose, what scientists do know is that the feathers
didn’t have anything to do with flight — which they can tell from the skeletal
structure of the fossils (these creatures didn’t have wings!).
So although feathers subsequently evolved to be used in flight, the benefit of
flight wasn’t the selective force responsible for their origin. It just so happened
that feathers — an adaptation selected by some fitness advantage unrelated
to flight — subsequently became something that natural selection shaped into
a wing.
Occasionally, you hear the term preadaptation, which means the same thing
as exaptation. The problem with preadaptation is that folks tend to misinter-
pret the word, thinking that it implies premeditation in the process of selection.
But selection isn’t premeditated, of course, so the preferred term is exaptation.
Truth to tell, however, most evolutionary biologists are likely to say preadapta-
tion instead of exaptation when they’re sitting around talking science over a few
beers. But that’s when happens when scientists get sloppy drunk.
77
Chapter 5: Natural Selection and Adaptations in Action

One of the beauties of the evolutionary process is the way that existing struc-
tures are altered for new uses. For that reason, scientists always need to be
cautious with any specific example in which they state that a particular trait
evolved for a particular reason. Why? If you’re trying to understand the process
of natural selection, you need to make sure that the traits you’re examining
were actually the result of natural selection.
Chromosomes in action: Linkage 
and hitchhikers
The human genome (and the genomes of most sexually reproducing organisms)
consists of several pieces of DNA called chromosomes. Parents make copies
of their chromosomes and pass one copy of each chromosome to their off-
spring (refer to Chapter 3 for more info on chromosomes). How the genome
is put together sometimes has consequences for how natural selection
results in changes in gene frequencies over generations. 
Imagine that loci are on the same chromosome. One codes for hair color (its
alleles are A and a); the other codes for eye color (its alleles are B and b).
Suppose the parent has the AaBb genotype. This parent could have the allele
combination Ab and aB (or the combination ab and AB) on each chromosome.
Because the loci are linked, the transmission of one allele determines the
transmission of the other. 
If the hair color locus and the eye color locus are on different chromosomes,
their alleles sort independently; if they’re on the same chromosome, they
may be transmitted together. Note that I say may. Here’s where things get
more complicated. 
The chromosomes can break and rejoin, so even if two genes are on the same
chromosome, they aren’t necessarily inherited together. What that means is that
 Even if the parent had the AB and ab allele combinations on its chromo-
somes, there’s still some possibility of producing aB and Ab gametes —
and this possibility is greater the farther apart the two loci are on the
chromosome.
 The closer two genes are, the more likely they are to be inherited together.
If the eye color gene is right next to the hair color gene, it’s more likely
that when you passed on these traits to your children, they got whatever
combination of alleles were found together on one of your chromosomes.
Now suppose that a beneficial mutation occurs at the eye color locus, and
selection acts on that allele. Because the mutation is beneficial, the person
who carries it will be more likely to leave descendants; hence, this particular
allele will increase through time. As a result of the close link between the eye
78
Part II: How Evolution Works 

color gene and the hair color gene, whatever hair color allele happens to be
next to it on the chromosome will also increase in frequency, even though it
may not have any significance.
Why is this example important? Because if you don’t know that a ho-hum allele
can increase in frequency simply because it’s next to a wham-bang allele, you
may misinterpret the increasing frequency of the ho-hum allele as being evidence
of strong selection for that allele. In this case, you may think that something
about the hair color gene itself is important evolution-wise, when what really
happened is that it hitchhiked a ride because of its proximity to the eye color.
In hitchhiking, changes through time in the allele frequencies at one locus
can be caused by selection acting on a different locus.
But wait — not all traits are adaptations
Some traits are obviously adaptive, such as antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
Because scientists understand the selective force — humans added the
antibiotics — they know that the evolutionary change they observe is a
response to that selection. The increase in frequency in the population of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria is an adaptation to the presence of antibiotics.
Other traits are obviously not adaptations. An example is a change at the level
of the DNA that doesn’t result in a change in the way a gene works or is
expressed. Traits of this type are selectively neutral: They don’t change the
fitness of the organisms that carry them, so their frequency increases or
decreases based solely on random factors (see Chapter 6 for details). And any
change caused by random factors rather than selection isn’t an adaptation.
79
Chapter 5: Natural Selection and Adaptations in Action
The spandrels of San Marco
Some traits that may seem to be adaptive aren’t
necessarily adaptations. Maybe the traits exist
for reasons that we don’t understand — devel-
opmental constraints, past events, whatever.
The point is that although the traits appear to
serve some purposeful function, that function
had nothing to do with their evolution. In a paper
written in 1979, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard
C. Lewontin warn evolutionary biologists not to
confuse current purpose with past adaptations.
To make this point, they wrote about the span-
drels of St. Mark’s Cathedral in Venice.
A spandrel is a structure connecting the dome
to the rest of the roof in a particular type of
architecture. And in St. Mark’s, the spandrels
have been painted so amazingly, you’d think that
they exist solely for the purpose of bearing the
remarkable images. Wrong! The spandrels are
just necessary consequences of how the rest of
the structure is put together, meaning their pur-
pose is solely architectural, not artistic. But that
doesn’t mean they didn’t make a decent canvas
for the artists who added the pictures later. 

Unfortunately, the distinction between adaptive and non-adaptive traits isn’t
always obvious. Some traits appear to be adaptations but aren’t. Why is
knowing the difference important? Because you don’t want to be fooled.
Stating that things are adaptations that actually aren’t can lead to errors in
the way you interpret data. 
You can’t get there from here: 
Constraints and trade-offs
Constraints are problems that natural selection can’t seem to solve. As a
result of how an organism is put together, some types of variation just aren’t
expected to appear. All vertebrates, for example, have (at most) four limbs.
Think about it: You never see mice with six legs. And based on human under-
standing of mammalian development, it’s pretty unlikely that Pegasus, with
his four legs and two wings, would ever evolve. Being a mammal and having
six limbs is just not a variant you ever see. So even if having a few extra limbs
conferred a fitness advantage, natural selection can’t get there because there
is no heritable variation for extra limbs.
Trade-offs, the balance between fitness benefits and fitness costs, represent
another key concept in evolutionary biology. You can think of trade-offs as
being the “jack of all trades, master of none” phenomenon. Consider all the
different kinds of birds in nature. Why isn’t there a superbird with the talons
of an eagle, the webbed feet of a duck, and all the other avian parts you can
think of rolled up into one bird? Well, you can start to see the problem right
away: It would be hard for an eagle to sink its talons into a poor little bunny if
the eagle had webbed feet. A pretty obvious trade-off exists between swim-
ming feet and grasping feet. The evolution of life histories is rife with exam-
ples of trade-offs; head to Chapter 10 for details.
Run, Mouse, Run 
Throughout this book, I occasionally bring up the cheetah’s running speed as
an example of an adaptation. I’ve always thought cheetahs were fascinating
creatures and looked forward to seeing them on the Nature Channel. The nice
story that I tell you is that there was variation for running speed, that chee-
tahs that ran faster left more descendents, and that, as a result, the cheetah
population got really good at running. It’s a good story, but science is more
than just a good story.

Chapter 5: Natural Selection and Adaptations in Action
The ghost of evolution past
When they’re talking about adaptations, scien-
tists have to be careful not to identify as an
adaptation to current phenomena a trait that’s
really an adaptation to past phenomena that are
no longer active.
Until fairly recently (not much more than 10,000
years ago), for example, North America and
South America were home to a diverse group of
large mammals such as gomphotheres (four-
tusked, elephant-like creatures) that would have
eaten a lot of the local vegetation and may have
been potential seed-dispersers. As a result,
these large herbivores would have been a key
factor in the evolution of the local vegetation —
that is, the plants would have evolved in concert
with the herbivores that ate them and dispersed
their seeds. Probably, the plants evolved
defenses against herbivory (the eating of plants)
and also evolved traits that led to increased seed
dispersal. (This idea that two organisms evolve
in response to each other is called co-evolution.
You can read about it in Chapter 13.)
One of the main reasons plants produce fruit is
to get their seeds dispersed. Animals eat the
fruit; the seeds pass out of the animals’ guts and
land in new environments where they germi-
nate and produce new plants (if the environ-
ment is suitable). One obvious benefit of such a
system is that the seed ends up in a pile of fer-
tilizer. A disadvantage is that the animal may eat
the seed as well. So seeds need adaptations to
prevent them from being digested on their jour-
ney through the digestive tract — hence, the hard
coatings that many seeds have. Yet a coating
hard enough to pass through an animal
unscathed may actually make it more difficult
for the seed to break through the shell and ger-
minate. A seed with a coating that allows it to
survive passage through an animal’s gut may
now need to go through the gut before it can
germinate. And indeed, the Americas have
plants that seem to require passage through a
large herbivore for optimum germination.
Then humans arrived in the New World, spotted
the giant herbivores, thought, “Dinner!” and
gobbled them all up. (Well, not necessarily.
Some controversy exists about the exact role
that humans played in the extinction of these
large animals. But the current thinking is that
our species did play a significant role — and
spent the next few centuries trying to come up
with a suitable antacid.) Regardless of how the
gomphotheres disappeared, disappear they did,
leaving plants without the herbivores needed to
facilitate germination of their seeds. In fact,
some species of plants in the tropics may have
been undergoing a gradual decline in popula-
tion as a result of an absence of these seed-dis-
persal agents.
Then along came horses, which aren’t native to
the Americas. As it turned out, horses also serve
as excellent seed dispersers for some American
flora, and in some cases, they are the only ani-
mals able to facilitate the germination of native
plants. But the plants didn’t evolve in the pres-
ence of horses, which only just got to the New
World a few hundred years ago.

Scientists can examine selection for increased running in the laboratory. Of
course, it’s tough to do experiments with big cats in the laboratory: You need
a lot of room for them to run, feeding them is expensive, and if you’re not
careful, you could end up on the dinner menu. But cats are not the only
things that run. Mice run, too. And they’re a lot cheaper to keep and a lot less
likely to turn on you. And the best part? They’re happy to run in those little
wheels, so with a minimum of analytical equipment, you can keep track of
how far they’re running. 
Theodore Garland, Jr., and coworkers set up a long-term evolution study
looking at the consequences of artificially selecting for mice that like to run.
They got a bunch of mice, gave them all a chance to run, and then founded
the next generation by selected the ones that just plain liked to run more.
They’ve continued this selective regime for almost 15 years, continuing to
selectively favor the mice than most like to run. 
The results: Mice lineages selected for increased voluntary running now run
everyday several times farther than the original mice, and they do it by run-
ning for just as long but several times faster. These fast running mice have
undergone other changes as well as a result of this artificial selection:
 They have larger hearts.
 Their muscle fibers are different from the original unselected mice. 
 Their hind limbs or more symmetrical. 
There was plenty of variation for characters associated with running on
which artificial selection could act. It didn’t take long to produce evolved
mice that like nothing more than to go to the gym for a workout.
Oh — one last thing: The hearts of the mice that ran farther aged better, so
when you’re done with this book, go take a walk or jog. It’ll be good for you. 
Darwin’s and Grants’ Finches 
When Darwin was visiting the Galapagos Islands, he came across a strange
assortment of birds which subsequent investigation revealed to be an assort-
ment of different kinds of finches. These finches were so different from the
finches found on the mainland that Darwin didn’t even recognize them as
finches and, while on the Galapagos Islands, didn’t pay that much attention
to them. It was only when he returned to England and shared his collection
with fellow scientists that he realized what he’d missed. But it didn’t take him
long to realize the significance of the little beasties. 
82
Part II: How Evolution Works 

The finches on different islands have different morphological characteristics —
things like the size and shape of the beak — that might reasonably be thought
to have something to do with feeding. Darwin hypothesized that different
selective pressures on the different islands had led the birds to diverge from
each other morphologically. Specifically, he surmised that natural selection
was at work (refer to Chapter 2).
Darwin hasn’t been the only scientist interested in finches. Rosemary and
Peter Grant of Princeton University are, too. And what’s more, they set out to
watch natural selection happen, and they’ve been doing it successfully for
about thirty years. 
In one particularly nice example, one of the larger finches which had not
previously been present on the island where the Grants work took up resi-
dence there and began to compete for food with the smaller finch that was
already there. 
To grasp the significance of what happened next, you need to know a little bit
about the structure of finches’ beaks. A finch’s beak structure determines
what the bird can most efficiently eat: A bird can’t crack large seeds with the
tiny beak, and it can’t pick up tiny seeds with a large beak. Both the larger
and smaller finches had a preference for some large, yummy seeds found on
the island. And both have bills of sufficient size to crack and eat these seeds. 
Prior to the arrival of the larger finch on the island, the small finches had all
the big nuts to themselves. When the larger finches arrived, they took over
the prime feeding areas as a result of bigger beak size and hogged all the
good food. This led to tough times for the smaller birds, especially during
periods of low food availability; they weren’t getting enough of the big seeds,
and they couldn’t easily forge on the smaller seeds. Tough times, and a lot of
the smaller birds didn’t make it, but some of the smaller birds had an easier
time of it than others. 
Which of the smaller birds were most successful? The ones with slightly
smaller beaks. There was variation in beak size, and in the absence of the
large seed food resource, the small finches with smaller beaks were able to
get more food because they could more efficiently forage on smaller size
seeds. As a result of this selective pressure, the big size of the smaller finch
decreased. And that’s natural selection in action!

Random Evolution and Genetic
Drift: Sometimes It’s All 
about Chance
In This Chapter
 Understanding genetic drift: What it is and when it’s important
 Seeing how genetic drift reduces variation
 Navigating the adaptive landscape
C
harles Darwin (see Chapter 1) had natural selection nailed, even though
he didn’t have the tools to test his ideas that evolutionary biologists have
today. A great deal of modern evolutionary biology has been about confirming
and refining Darwin’s hypotheses. Since Darwin, one of the most important
advances has been the recognition of the role of genetic drift as an evolutionary
force. Genetic drift refers to the power random events can have in influencing
whether genes increase or decrease in future populations.
Here’s the take-home message of this chapter: Genetic drift can result in
evolution, even in the absence of natural selection. If two critters are equally
well suited to their environment, only chance determines which one leaves
more descendants. Genetic drift also can work in the presence of natural
selection. Even when some individuals are potentially better than others,
chance events still occur. If lightning strikes the fastest cheetah, it won’t be
contributing its genes to the next generation. 
Genetic Drift Defined
A main principle of evolution by natural selection is that the environment
favors traits that make individual organisms more fit (better able to get their
genes into the next generation). More-fit parents produce offspring who, by
virtue of having inherited traits from their parents, are more fit. The most fit

86
Part II: How Evolution Works  
of these offspring produce offspring who are even more fit than they, and so
on and so forth until . . . well, you get the picture. These changes are not
random. More-fit characteristics increase in frequency in subsequent generations
at the expense of less fit characteristics. 
Here’s the rub: Natural selection isn’t the only force that determines what
genes get into the next generation. It can be doing its thing, stacking the cards
in favor of certain characteristics, and then — bam! — a tree falls on the
genetically favored organism. In the words of the philosopher Dylan, blame it
on a simple twist of fate. If that tree happens to fall on a fast cheetah, there’ll
be just a few more gazelles for the slower cheetahs to eat and they may leave
more descendents than they otherwise would have. 
When random processes affect the probability of different traits being present
in the next generation, you’ve got what evolutionary biologists call genetic
drift. And it’s one of the two major driving forces changing the frequencies of
existing genes through time (natural selection being the other). As such, it can
 Affect whether the frequencies of different alleles increase or decrease
in subsequent generations.
 Result in the frequencies of all but one allele at a given locus decreasing
to the point that they are eliminated. When only a single allele is found
at a given locus, that allele is fixed; its frequency has gone to a hundred
percent and all the other alleles are gone. Until such time as a mutation
happens to generate a new allele at this locus, all individuals in the
population will be genetically identical at this point in their DNA. No fur-
ther evolution is possible because, until such a mutation occurs, there is
no variation. 
The key to understanding genetic drift is to understand what could possibly
be random in evolution (quite a bit, actually) and when these random events
are evolutionarily significant (sometimes).
Natural selection and genetic drift aren’t either/or processes. Think of the
processes as happening simultaneously and the circumstances (such as pop-
ulation size or the neutrality of a mutation, as explained in later sections)
determining which process holds more sway. 
Wrapping Your Head 
Around Randomness
Random, as you no doubt are aware, means out of the blue, without rhyme or
reason, hit or miss — in a word, arbitrary. Random events, by their very
randomness, exhibit no discernible pattern, even if they look like a pattern;
hint at a pattern; or, gosh darn it, must form a pattern if you could just figure

out what the pattern is. That’s precisely the part about randomness that trips
us humans up: We’re always looking for a pattern, and if we don’t see one, we
expect it to emerge eventually.
Well, randomness doesn’t work that way. Random is random, and that means:
 The absence of a pattern or the unpredictability of an outcome
 No correlation between the outcome of one event and the outcome of
another
A coin toss is an example of a random event. You toss a coin in the air (assume
it’s a fair coin), and it’s going to come down either heads or tails. So say you
toss this coin, and it lands heads. What’s the chance that it’ll land heads the
next time you toss it? The right answer is 50 percent. But a fair number of
people think (incorrectly) that it is more likely to land tails the second time
because it landed heads the first time. This sort of thinking is the same kind
that makes gambling so dangerous.
Imagine yourself, flush with coins, sitting at a slot machine and feeling lucky.
You drop in your first coin, pull the lever, and . . . nothing happens. You put in
the next coin. Again, nothing happens. And again. And again. Why do you keep
playing? Probably at some level, you think that all these losses are leading up
to a big win, even though you may be fully aware that a slot machine generates
numbers or patterns randomly. 
The important thing about the coin toss (or the slot machines) is that, as a
random process, the previous outcomes don’t have any bearing on the
upcoming results. Just because a coin lands heads one time doesn’t mean
that it’s less — or more — likely to land heads the next time.
Random is just plain slippery to think about so following are a couple of
examples of how it can be important in biology.
At the level of the individual
Any environmental factor that affects an individual’s ability to reproduce
regardless of its genes can cause genetic drift. Consider a lightening strike:
There’s probably no genetic component that determines whether one deer or
another is hit by lightning. But when a deer is hit by lightning, it won’t be
reproducing. Because that deer’s genes won’t be represented in the next
generation, this random event changes the relative representation of genes
in the later generation.
87
Chapter 6: Random Evolution and Genetic Drift: Sometimes It’s All about Chance 

Essentially, these are cases of being in the wrong (or right) place at the wrong
(or right) time. Examples would be a lumberjack who fells a tree on a Nobel
laureate who’s walking through the forest pondering his acceptance speech
or the bug that crashes into your windshield. If you’re not around to repro-
duce, or if you don’t reproduce (because you prefer a neat house and travel
to children, for example), natural selection can’t be the driving force behind
the increases or decreases in gene frequencies.
Random variations also occur in the number of offspring that different indi-
viduals have. For the minute, ignore the fact that there might be a genetic
component to wanting fewer children because you prefer not stepping on
those little plastic farm animals with the sharp ears. Random variation still
occurs in the number of offspring that different people produce. A hundred
couples all trying to have three children won’t each end up with three chil-
dren. On average, they’ll end up with more children than couples who prefer
not to have children (a matter of choice, not random factors), but they won’t
all end up having exactly three. That’s where the random factors come in.
At the level of the gametes 
As a diploid individual, you have two copies of DNA: one that you got from
your father and one that you got from your mother (refer to Chapter 3). Your
children will also have two copies of DNA: one copy that they got from you
and one copy that they got from the other parent. That means that each of
your offspring got only half of your genes and half of their other parent’s genes.
You’re diploid, your partner is diploid, and the only way to make sure your off-
spring are diploid is for your gametes (the egg and sperm) to be haploid —
that is, to contain only half of your DNA.
Which half? This is where genetic randomness kicks in. At some locations of
your genome, both copies are the same. Or in science-speak, both alleles at
that locus are identical. In this case each of your gametes (be that sperm or
egg) will have the same allele at that locus; there’s only one to choose from.
But other times, you have two different alleles at that locus because the one
you got from your mother and the one you got from your father weren’t the
same. Any given gamete you produce will get one or the other. 
You’ve been successful: You’ve survived (you looked both ways before you
crossed the street), you found food (maybe that was why you crossed the
street), and now you’re about to pass your genes on to the next generation,
but it’s a matter of chance which of the two different alleles you carry will
make it into any particular gamete. On average, each allele will end up in half
of your gametes. While you produce a huge number of gametes and the two
alleles are equally represented, only a paltry number of offspring are likely to
result from them. 
88
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Women have about 400,000 eggs; men produce even more sperm. But women
don’t have 400,000 offspring. For that reason, which particular genes your off-
spring have are up for grabs. In other words, the production of any one child
involves an element of chance, and the kids you end up with are the result of
random pairings, as it were.
Situations in Which Drift Is Important 
Genetic drift is an important evolutionary force — some of the time. When?
When populations are small, for example, or with the subset of genetic differ-
ences that don’t result in fitness differences. 
When a population is small
Genetic drift plays a bigger role in evolutionary change when a population is
small. In larger populations, the forces of genetic drift are muted. In a popula-
tion of 1 million, one extra fast cheetah more or less isn’t going to make much
difference in the grand scheme of gene frequencies. In a population of 20,
however, that single cheetah does make a difference — at least in terms of 
her genes — if she does (or doesn’t) reproduce.
Consider the coin toss again. If you throw up a bunch of coins — say, 400 —
the outcome would be lots of heads and lots of tails — about half of each, in
fact. Although you’d be willing to accept a few more or less than half either
way, you know that only a very small chance exists that all 400 coins will end
up falling on the same side. Now imagine that you’re tossing a small handful
of coins — say, four. The possible outcomes are fairly limited: You could get
two of each, three of one and one of the other, or four of either heads or tails.
Although you’re not likely to see the coins come up four of a kind, that result
is still within the realm of possibility. In fact, if you compute the actual proba-
bility, you realize that, on average, one of every eight times you throw four
coins in the air, they’ll end up on the same side.
The point? That even though a handful of coins will on average land half heads
and half tails, that’s just the average result. Individual tosses will vary randomly,
and the smaller the handful, the more likely the chance that the results will
be much different from 50-50.
Now think about allele frequencies rather than head-tail frequencies. A popu-
lation may have two alleles in equal proportion, 50 percent each, at one point
in time. And then, at some later point in time, the frequencies are drastically
different. The smaller the population, the more likely that this change is simply
the result of random factors affecting which individuals did and didn’t leave
more descendents. 
89
Chapter 6: Random Evolution and Genetic Drift: Sometimes It’s All about Chance 

When genetically different individuals
have the same fitness
The degree to which a new mutation is neutral affects how important a role
genetic drift plays in the evolutionary process. As Chapter 4 explains, mutations,
which add genetic diversity to populations and come in three categories
(advantageous, deleterious, and neutral), are always occurring.
For mutations that are advantageous or deleterious, and when population size
is large, natural selection is the primary driving force that determines whether
the frequency of particular alleles increase or decrease in subsequent genera-
tions. If mutations are deleterious, natural selection removes them; if they’re
advantageous, natural selection favors them, and they increase in frequency. 
But if the particular new mutant is neutral, neither advantageous nor disad-
vantageous compared to the original, natural selection can’t be responsible for
changes in its frequency through time. In this case, genetic drift is the driving
force. 
Drift or selection? When it’s hard to tell
Genetic drift is always occurring, even when an allele is advantageous or
disadvantageous. Randomness is still at work — lightning is still hitting the
occasional deer, for example — but these random events don’t make much
difference to the outcome. The slow deer will get eaten by wolves, and the
fast deer will pass their genes on to the next generation. If a lightning bolt
happens to hit one of the fast deer, the outcome won’t change. But sometimes,
it’s not so clear cut when natural selection is the main force and when genetic
drift is. 
The effect of population size
In a small population, the weakly advantageous allele could be eliminated by
random genetic drift before it could be fixed by natural selection, or a weakly
deleterious allele could increase to fixation. For example, a cheetah with a
mutation that made it just a tiny bit faster might be expected to catch a few more
antelope and have a slightly better chance at leaving more descendents 
than its neighbor. This new mutant would tend to increase in frequency in the
population through time, but it would increase very slowly because the
difference between the mutant gene and the other cheetahs is miniscule. 
It might also increase or decrease in the population purely as a result of chance
events. It’s possible that even though it’s selectively advantageous (you get to
catch a couple more antelope, just not very many more), it might be eliminated
by chance events before it could sweep through the population. 
90
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Whether a particular neutral allele increases to fixation is a function of popu-
lation size. In small populations, random factors can be of greater importance.
But — and this is a big but — the probability that there will be a neutral muta-
tion that will increase to fixation is independent of population size. The key is
that larger populations have more individuals and, as a result, more errors in
DNA replication (errors by the mutations). So although it’s true that any
particular mutation has a much lower chance of increasing to fixation in a large
population, that population has proportionally more mutations. Mathematically,
everything pretty much cancels out. The effect of large population size on
slowing fixation as a result of genetic drift is balanced out by the fact that a
large population also has more mutations. 
Here’s why this little tidbit is important: Knowing that the overall rate of
accumulation of neutral mutations doesn’t have anything to do with popula-
tion size lets scientists estimate the time since two lineages diverged. Neutral
mutations in particular genes sometimes accumulate at a relatively constant
rate. Therefore, the differences between two lineages can be used to determine
the time since their divergence — a subject covered in more detail in Chapter 15.
The strength of selection
Natural selection doesn’t operate at the same strength at all times. Imagine a
gene that allows an organism to survive extremely dry conditions. Natural
selection will result in an increase in the frequency of this gene in environ-
ments with very dry conditions. Now imagine that those conditions occur
only once every ten generations. During the other nine generations, changes
in the frequency of that particular gene from generation to generation will be
due entirely to drift.
If a new allele is neutral, random forces determine its future frequency. It may
disappear, or it may increase in frequency. Consider the gene that determines
which of your thumbs is on top when you interlace your fingers. As it turns
out, you always put the same thumb on top. Try interlacing your fingers so
that the other thumb is on top. Feels weird, doesn’t it? Yep, a locus with two
alleles actually determines your thumb preference.
Assuming that both alleles have always been identical with respect to fitness
(scientists can’t be certain, but neither can they think of the slightest reason
why they wouldn’t be), both alleles exist in the human population because of
random events — an initial mutant increasing in frequency as a result of chance
in the absence of any effects of natural selection. The relative frequency of
the two genes is still subject to the process of genetic drift, but human popu-
lations are so large that both alleles will persist in the population for the
foreseeable future.

Genetic Drift in Action: When Big
Populations Get Little
Understanding the importance of population size is fundamental to under-
standing genetic drift (see the earlier section “Situations in which drift is
important” for details). But population sizes don’t remain constant; they fluc-
tuate over time, sometimes growing larger and sometimes smaller. To under-
stand how genetic drift is operating in nature, it helps to understand the
factors that result in a small population. Here are a couple:
 Fluctuations in population size: The mere fact that a population is large
today doesn’t mean that it wasn’t small at some other time or that it won’t
decrease someday. The populations of many organisms that need water
may drop to low levels during a drought, for example. When a population
is or becomes exceedingly small, the phenomenon is called a population
bottleneck (discussed later in this chapter).
 Founder effects: Founder effects refers to those chance events that
occur when a population is founded in a new location by a small number
of individuals from a population somewhere else.
As a population shrinks (which can happen for a variety of reasons), it begins
to feel the effects of genetic drift more acutely, mainly because while it’s growing
smaller, it’s losing diversity. This loss is a bad thing, because diversity can
protect a species or a group of individuals from the vagaries of fate. This
discussion is important for a couple of reasons, one of which may appeal to
folks in general (tree-huggers and animal-lovers in particular), and the other
may appeal primarily to scientists (but is cool anyway):
 It informs conservation efforts. Numbers aren’t enough when it comes
to saving animals from extinction. Diversity in the endangered population
is key, and genetic drift undermines diversity.
 It lets scientists figure out when one group diverged from another. I
know — this reason lacks the pizzazz of saving cute little furry creatures,
but it’s still important.
The following sections go into more details.
Population bottlenecks
Population bottleneck simply refers to a period when the population of a par-
ticular organism grows smaller. If, as the population decreases, it also loses
genetic variation through genetic drift, it doesn’t get that variation back right
away when (or if) it gets bigger again.
92
Part II: How Evolution Works  

For an example of a population bottleneck, consider the plight of the north-
ern elephant seal. This seal was hunted almost to extinction in the late 1800s.
On a couple of occasions, folks thought that the species had actually gone
extinct, but a few seals occasionally turned up on an island off Baja California.
Most of these seals were killed as well (sometimes by biologists collecting
them for museum specimens!). Obviously, things weren’t going well for the
northern elephant seal; at the species’ low point, the population was estimated
to be between 20 and 100 individuals.
In the early 1900s, the Mexican government made the seals’ last breeding ground
a protected area, and the species began to rebound. Today, the species numbers
over 100,000, and elephant seals appear to be out of immediate danger of
extinction. This example is a nice success story of species conservation in a
world that has too many unhappy endings.
Before you get out the party hats, however, remember that genetic variation
is necessary for evolution by natural selection. If the species we humans
conserve are going to respond to future environmental changes, those species
require genetic variability. The world may have 30,000 elephant seals now,
but those 30,000 seals are descended from the few that survived hunting.
That means they’re very closely related to one other and, as a result, are
genetically very similar, so they are still at risk from events such as diseases.
In a genetically uniform population, a disease that can attack one of the
individuals is likely to attack them all. 
The southern elephant seal was also extensively hunted, but its population
was not driven as low at that of the northern elephant seal. As a result, the
southern species has more genetic diversity than the northern species. 
The genetic diversity of a species is a fundamental part of what is unique about
that species. Yet the forces of genetic drift can eliminate genetic diversity in
small populations, and small populations are often characteristic of species
that humans are trying to prevent from going extinct. Therefore, counteracting
the effects of genetic drift — and not inadvertently creating more population
bottlenecks by using too few individuals for breeding in captive breeding
programs — is important in species-conservation efforts. Genetic diversity
(heritable variation) is what allows species to respond to selective events (such
as novel diseases or environmental change). Conservationists want not just to
conserve a few individuals of a species but also to conserve the genetic variation
that will allow the species to survive events it may encounter in the future. 
93
Chapter 6: Random Evolution and Genetic Drift: Sometimes It’s All about Chance 

Founder effects
Periodically, a few individuals decide to strike out on their own and set up a
community away from kith and kin. The founders of this new community —
be they rats, bats, bears, or humans — determine the genetic makeup of the
new population. Founder effects refers to their influence in this regard.
Understanding founder effects helps scientists understand how the genetic
makeup of original members of the new community affects the gene frequencies
in subsequent generations.
Every time a few individuals separate themselves from their original population
and move to a novel environment, you can see how founder effects can be
important in determining allele frequencies. Quite a bit of variation in human
blood type occurs across different geographical regions, for example. Some
areas have a preponderance of one blood type; other areas have a preponder-
ance of another type. Founder effects, spurred by human migration patterns
that often involve small groups founding new populations, can explain these
differences, as the following sections explain.
Crossing the Bering Strait
Ten thousand years ago, a small group of humans crossed the Bering Strait
and colonized North America (and subsequently South America). Genetic
drift probably is the cause of the very low frequency of the type B blood allele
in Native Americans (4 percent), even though it is much more frequent in
people from Asia — the presumed source of the Native American colonists.
Amish immigration to America
The Amish population was founded by a small group of Europeans in the
early 16th century. In the 18th century, the first Amish migrated to the
Pennsylvania colony in the New World. 
The Amish, who remain almost entirely reproductively isolated from the rest of
America, have a distribution of blood types different from those in the rest of the
United States or in Europe. Additionally one of the original couples carried
the allele for polydactily (extra fingers or toes) which has increased in frequency
in the small Amish population by chance; they just happen to have more than
the average number of descendants. 
Colonization of planet Beta
Okay, this example isn’t for real. But if you’ve seen the 1950s-era sci-fi flick
When Worlds Collide, you can imagine founder effects in action. In the film,
Earth is doomed by the approach of a runaway planet. Humanity is saved when
94
Part II: How Evolution Works  

a group of scientists and engineers (including the requisite cynic-turned-true-
believing hero, the brilliant-and-self-sacrificing old scientist, his beautiful-but-
prone-to-melodramatic-emotional-displays daughter, and the steady-but-
dull-as-dishwater-and-soon-to-be-spurned boyfriend) gets together to build a
spaceship large enough to carry a few humans, a few head of livestock, a few
plants, and one adorable dog to another planet to begin life again. Think of
the genes this bunch has to work with! Their blood type — given that they
left the riffraff on Earth to perish — definitely would be blue.
The Shifting-Balance Hypothesis: 
It’s What’s Wright
Sewell Wright (1889–1988) was a key founder of the science of population
genetics, and his shifting-balance hypothesis is one of the coolest hypotheses
about how evolution might work in certain circumstances. This hypothesis
says natural selection and genetic drift can work together to allow popula-
tions to reach higher fitness. 
To help visualize how this might work, you need to get cozy with an especially
slippery concept called the adaptive landscape (or fitness landscape). It’s slip-
pery even for professional evolutionary biologists, but of course that’s part
of the fun!
The adaptive landscape: 
A 3-D fitness map
In any giving species, there are a huge number of different possible geno-
types, and we can’t possibly know the fitness of each different genotype —
we just know that each genotype has a fitness. In order to think about all that
information, scientists use the adaptive landscape. The adaptive landscape is
a three-dimensional imaginary structure that gives us a way of talking and
thinking about how differences in genotype affect fitness. Figure 6-1 is an
example of a fitness landscape. The letter A represents a mutation that’s ben-
eficial (moving the species up the hill to greater fitness); the letter B repre-
sents a mutation that decreases a species’ fitness.
95
Chapter 6: Random Evolution and Genetic Drift: Sometimes It’s All about Chance 

This landscape is like a 3-D relief map that you can set down on your coffee
table. A relief map indicates, through the height of the bumps, the altitude of
any region — such a map of the U.S. would show the Rockies and the Sierra
Nevadas, the Midwestern plains, the small mountains of Appalachia, and so
on. The adaptive landscape has the same bumps, but here, the bumps don’t
show altitude; instead, they correspond to increased fitness. 
Here are some things to know about the adaptive landscape:
 Each location on the adaptive landscape can be though of as a genotype.
Neighboring points are very similar genetically, distant point less so. 
 The adaptive landscape deals with one species at a time and in one set
of conditions. Imagine the adaptive landscape for chickens on an island
in the Pacific, for example. For this particular population, some geno-
types confer greater fitness and other genotypes confer lower fitness. 
 The top of each bump on the adaptive landscape represents a genotype
more fit than those just a little different from it. The different heights
of these bumps indicate relative fitness. Higher bumps equal higher fitness
levels; lower bumps equal lower fitness levels. 
Any particular adaptive landscape represents the fitness of a single species in
a particular set of conditions. Move to a different island and the fitness land-
scape might change. Genotypes that were great on the first island might be
hopeless on the next, and therefore, the peaks and valleys would be in different
places.

The
adaptive
landscape.

Part II: How Evolution Works  

It’s impossible to measure the fitness of every genotype of the species being
studied. But you can think about how mutations change fitness. A mutation
that switches an amino acid from one kind to another, for example, nudges
you a little bit on the adaptive landscape. Maybe the protein works better
(you move up the hill); maybe it doesn’t work as well (you move down the
hill); or maybe it works exactly the same way (you move sideways on the hill,
meaning that you’re in a different place — you have a different genotype —
but you have the same fitness. Your genome could change in millions of ways
as a result of mutation; it’s a big genome. Each of those changes moves you
around somewhere in the fitness landscape.
Being the best you can be — 
on your own peak
You expect that natural selection will favor the genotypes that make an
organism more fit and select against those that make it less fit. For example,
plants with better roots get more water and make more seeds, and natural
selection drives the population to have better roots from one generation to
the next. But maybe there are different ways to make a good root (or anything
else in the biological world). 
The adaptive landscape is a way of thinking about the fact that several peaks
of high fitness may exist, each peak corresponding to a different genotype.
Natural selection will drive a population to the top of whatever peak it’s already
on, whether or not that peak is the highest one in the adaptive landscape. 
What natural selection won’t do is move the population to an even higher
peak if that move means crossing a valley of lower fitness. Why? Because natural
selection won’t backtrack by favoring individuals with lower reproductive
success. Individuals with lower fitness arise all the time (remember that most
mutations are bad), but they don’t increase in frequency as a result of selection. 
You just can’t get there from here 
Sewell Wright’s key insight (one of his many key insights — he’s one of the
hot shots of post-Darwinian evolutionary biology) was suggesting that
genetic drift is the mechanism that lets a population move from one fitness
peak (one really great genotype) to another because, unlike natural selection,
genetic drift lets populations wander around low-fitness parts of the adaptive
space. In his hypothesis, a small population could descend (genetically speaking)
into an adaptive valley (an area of low fitness) and then climb a different,
higher, adaptive peak as a result of natural selection. Essentially, a small pop-
ulation has a chance of hitting the genetic jackpot and ending up on a high
adaptive peak. 
97
Chapter 6: Random Evolution and Genetic Drift: Sometimes It’s All about Chance 

Genetic drift is like a lottery; no guarantee exists that genetic drift is going to
make it possible for a species to wander over to another peak. Wright’s argument
is just that it can do so some of the time. The low part of the fitness landscape
means that those are genotypes that have a lower chance of leaving descendants.
But they might get lucky once in a while.
When a small population does hit the genetic jackpot and gets to the slope of
a higher peak, natural selection will kick in again and the population will
climb up the new higher peak. 
With a really fit combination of alleles, the population can spread through the
actual physical landscape. Because the individuals have higher fitness
(they’re at the top of a really high fitness peak), they increase in frequency
and can migrate in the physical landscape, spreading their selectively advan-
tageous genetic combination far and wide. In other words, one small popula-
tion hits the fitness jackpot; then these individuals sow their oats in other
populations.

any of the traits scientists are interested in aren’t the result of a single
gene, but of multiple genes. As discussed in previous chapters, some
traits are controlled by one gene (or by a known few genes). In contrast, quanti-
tative (or multigenetic) traits are determined by multiple (more than two) genes. 
When multiple genes and environmental factors, which can have a big impact
on how traits are expressed, both play significant roles in the phenotype,
how much of the phenotype depends on the genes (and therefore is herita-
ble), and how much depends on the environment (and is not heritable)? 
If you expect that the next question is “Why in the world would anyone care?”
remember that in evolution, only heritable variation is important. Many of the
traits scientists, agriculturalists, and medical professionals care about turn
out to be quantitative traits. The field of quantitative genetics deals with
determining what proportion of the variation is due to genetic factors when
multiple genes and the environment play a role. 
Geneticists in this field use all sorts of mathematical formulas and statistical
techniques to figure out all this information, none of which you need to know.
So this chapter skips the math and focuses on the key principles instead. Here,
I paint with a broad brush but give you the foundation you need to understand
this topic — just in case you run across it in the science section of the
newspaper. 

Why Quantitative Genetics Is Important
Quantitative genetics is relevant to evolution because it has to do with hered-
ity and understanding how heredity works. Darwin didn’t understand how
heredity worked; he just knew that it did — sort of. Back in those days, folks
understood that the heritability of some traits was more predictable than others.
For some things, such as hemophilia, researchers could trace the ailment back
to a single factor that they could map onto a family tree. (Today, scientists know
that this factor is a particular DNA sequence.) 
Other traits, such as how much milk a cow made, weren’t so clear cut. True,
researchers in Darwin’s day knew that things like how much milk a cow made
had a heritable component, but figuring out what that heritable component
was wasn’t as simple as determining the heritable component of eye color or
a disease like hemophilia.
Fast-forward several generations. Scientists now can explain some of the things
Darwin and his contemporaries could only wonder about. We now know that a
character is often the result of several genes rather than a single gene. 
Interacting genes 
When a whole bunch of genes affect a particular trait, these genes can interact
in different ways. The effect of the different genes can be additive, though some
genes might be more important than others in determining the final phenotype.
Imagine a lot of genes for milk production where, at each locus (location on the
DNA strand), some alleles result in more milk and some result in less. The heri-
table part of milk production will be determined by the sum of the effects at all
the involved loci. 
Different loci can also interact in non-additive ways. In some cases, the non-
additive interaction of the different genes is important. Imagine that a particular
locus may influence milk production, for example, but only when a specific
allele occurs at some particular other locus. Without that allele at the second
locus, the first locus doesn’t have anything to do with how much milk a cow
makes. This process is called epistasis.
Epistatic interactions are those in which the fitness of a particular allele at
one locus depends on alleles at another locus. 
Imagine epistatic interactions that affect the A locus, in which the relative fit-
ness of the aa and AA individuals depends on the alleles at a second locus,
which I’ll call B. If that second locus has one combination of alleles, AA indi-
viduals will have higher fitness than aa individuals. But if the B locus has a
different combination of alleles, aa individuals will have higher fitness than
AA individuals. 
100
Part II: How Evolution Works  

I made up the milk example for illustrative purposes, but one actual case of
epistasis that you might be familiar with concerns those colored squash that
you see around Halloween and Thanksgiving. In one genetic system, the
colors white, green, and yellow are controlled by two genes, each of which
have two alleles (of the dominant/recessive type; refer to Chapter 3). 
When at least one of the genes at the white locus is the dominant form, the
squash is white and the other locus has no effect on color. But when both
alleles at the white locus are of the recessive form, then the color of the squash
(green or yellow) is determined by the alleles at the green/yellow locus. You
can see that it starts to get complicated even with only two loci involved —
there can be many more.
These examples have consequences for the way selection operates. In both
cases, the extent to which selection increases the frequency of the alleles at
the one locus depends on the frequency of the alleles at other locus.
Multigenetic traits in medicine 
and agriculture
Being able to figure out the correlation between heritable genes and phenotype
when the genetics is more complicated and environment plays a role has
several benefits. Multigenetic traits are important to the fields of medicine
and agriculture, for example. 
In agriculture
Most of the characteristics that farmers breed for are quantitative traits, such
as the amount of milk a cow produces or how many ears of corn a corn plant
produces. To help farmers breed better cows and better corn plants, researchers
need to understand what’s involved when they start thinking about traits
controlled by many genes.
In medicine
Understanding genetic interactions can help scientists sort out the genetics
of human disease. For many diseases, the heritable component is not
absolute. People say that a disease or condition tends to “run in families” or
that you’re more likely to have the condition if your recent ancestors had it.
Both expressions indicate that you may be predisposed to a particular condi-
tion that has a genetic component, but you won’t definitely get it. Maybe the
ailment appears only under certain environment conditions or only when cer-
tain genes interact in a particular way.
101
Chapter 7: Quantitative Genetics: When Many Genes Act at Once

Understanding Quantitative Traits
Although all quantitative traits are multigenic traits, not all multigenic traits are
quantitative traits. Strictly speaking, a multigenic trait is any trait controlled by
more than one gene, yet when only a couple of loci are involved, researchers
can sort out all the different combinations of outcomes and understand the
phenotypes, as in the squash color example in the earlier section. As the
number of genes gets larger, doing that isn’t so easy, so scientists have to use
the mathematics of quantitative genetics. 
Continuous and non-continuous traits
Quantitative traits fall into two camps: those that vary continuously and
those that don’t:
 Continuous quantitative characters: Quantitative traits often are continu-
ously variable across some range. An example is adult height. Although
you may consider yourself to be either tall or short, heights vary
smoothly from the tallest to shortest. 
 Non-continuous quantitative characters: Although many multigenetic
traits are continuous, some aren’t — at least, not in the same way that
continuous characters are. Take bristles on fruit flies, for example. Fruit
flies have a discrete number of bristles that varies from some bristles to
more bristles, but they don’t have half a bristle. Your weight can vary by
any fraction of a pound (or gram or stone), but a bristle or a pound is
either “on” or “off.” Some diseases or conditions (those that have two
states: sick or not sick) are also non-continuous characters.
The environment has a big impact on many quantitative traits. Taller parents,
for example, tend to have taller children, but environmental factors, such as
nutrition, also affect adult height.
Crossing a threshold
For a non-continuous quantitative trait to be expressed, some threshold
combination — of genetic interactions alone or of genetic interactions combined
with environmental factors — has to occur. 
Take mental illness, which scientists are still trying to understand.
Researchers hypothesize that disorders such as schizophrenia are controlled
by multiple loci and that the condition manifests in people who have a cer-
tain number of specific alleles at specific loci (and perhaps in certain environ-
ments), but whether the condition manifests itself depends on more than the
genetic component.
102
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Schizophrenia, for example, definitely has a genetic component. If one of 
your parents has schizophrenia, you’re at higher risk of developing schizo-
phrenia than someone in the general population; if both your parents are
schizophrenic, your changes are even greater. This situation makes sense,
given that you share some, but not all, of your parents’ genes. But here’s a
particularly interesting point that reveals that genetics isn’t the only factor: 
If your identical twin is schizophrenic, you have about a 50 percent change of
developing the disease yourself, even though you share 100 percent of your
twin’s genes. 
Although the genetic component is significant, something beyond genetics
is going on. Maybe environmental factors are the key. In the case of relatives
other than identical twins, perhaps different combinations of genes and their
interactions are important as well. These questions are what schizophrenia
researchers are trying to sort out. 
QTL mapping: Identifying 
what genes matter
When you’re dealing with multigenetic traits, figuring out what genes are
responsible for a particular trait is harder but not impossible. The strategy
for identifying the relevant genes in the genome of a particular organism
involves quantitative trait loci mapping (QTL mapping, for short). With QTL
mapping, you cross lots of individuals and keep track of how particular
103
Chapter 7: Quantitative Genetics: When Many Genes Act at Once
The case of hemophilia
In the case of hemophilia, several different loci
code for different clotting factors, and different
forms of hemophilia result from alleles (that
code for bad clotting factors) at several of these
loci. But hemophilia isn’t a multigenetic charac-
ter, even though several genes can be respon-
sible for it. Why? In each case of hemophilia, a
single locus is responsible for the trait. Which
one you just happen to have been unlucky
enough to inherit determines the type of hemo-
philia you have.
Here are a couple of other interesting tidbits
about hemophilia:
 It’s an X-linked recessive character, which
means that two copies are necessary for a
woman to have hemophilia, but only one
copy is necessary for a man to have it.
 As a result of modern medicine, hemophilia
has gone from a trait associated with very
low fitness to one with greatly reduced fit-
ness consequences. Having hemophilia is
never good, but it’s not as bad as it used to
be because today medications can replace
the lost clotting ability. This situation is yet
another example of how the fitness conse-
quences of a particular gene are a function
of the environment.

genetic markers in the offspring correlate with the character you’re inter-
ested in. These markers aren’t themselves the genes responsible for the
quantitative trait, but because they’re correlated with the phenotype, they
can be used to identify the location on the chromosomes where the genes reside. 
A marker gene is any gene that’s easy to recognize because its location on the
genome is known. Imagine, for example, that people with green eyes are on
average taller. We know that tallness is a function of many genes, but now we
know that one of these genes is near the gene that controls green eye color.
The two genes are in close proximity. They are closely linked — they tend to
be inherited together. (Go to Chapter 5 or more details on linkage.)
Here’s how QTL mapping works: Scientists know where the marker gene is,
and now they know that some gene near it is responsible in part for a multi-
genetic trait. The mathematics of how this works is beyond the scope of this
book, but what’s important is that it does work. (And it works even better for
species for which we have a lot of gene sequences where we can go in and
see exactly which genes are near the marker loci!)
By using the markers as signposts, scientists can 
1. Figure out approximately how many genes underlie a given 
multigenetic trait
2. Tease apart the details of gene interactions
3. Understand the relative importance of different genes to see which
genes have stronger effects than others
4. Voila! Actually have a good idea where to look in the genome for the 
relevant genes.
Analyzing the Heritability 
of Quantitative Traits
As stated earlier in this chapter, quantitative traits are traits that result from
complex interactions between multiple genes and that may be influenced by
environmental factors. To understand how these traits evolve, evolutionary
biologists analyze the heritability of quantitative traits. 
As you can imagine, the first task is to determine what proportion of the trait
(or phenotype) is due to genetic factors (the heritable bits) and what portion
is due to the environment (the non-heritable bits). As tough as that job is, the
analysis is made even more complicated by the fact that any given gene, or
allele, may impact the resulting phenotype in an additive or non-additive way. 
104
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Additive or non-additive?
The concept of additivity can be a little slippery. To understand it better,
think about a single gene with two alleles: for example, wrinkled or smooth
peas. In this case, the smooth form (A) is dominant over the wrinkled form
(a). An individual with a single allele for the smooth form (Aa) would express
the smooth phenotype. Having two copies of the smooth form (AA) produces
the same smooth phenotype. In the first case (Aa), the single recessive allele
is non-additive, as is the second dominant allele in the second case (AA).
Neither allele affects the final expression of the trait. (For details on dominant
and recessive genes, see Chapter 3.)
This situation, wherein the combinations of different alleles can result in
some alleles not having an effect on the phenotype, can happen across differ-
ent loci. A gene may have the potential to influence a particular phenotype,
but it may not influence the phenotype in an additive way. In other words,
when the conditions are right (a certain combination of alleles across loci or
a particular interaction with other alleles), the gene may influence the pheno-
type. At other times, this same gene may not affect the phenotype, because
the necessary combination or interaction didn’t occur.
A hot subtopic of quantitative genetics is sorting through the non-additive
nature of multiple genes to figure out whether some of them are especially
important (or especially important some of the time). Given that some ail-
ments certainly have a genetic component that’s controlled by multiple
genes, it would be nice if researchers could identify genes that have large
effects and then figure out what they do. This is crucially important for
understanding the genetics of some human diseases.
Determining phenotypic variation
Evolution requires that variation exist and that this variation be heritable. The
upshot of environmental effects and of the non-additive genetic variation is to
decrease heritability and, as a result, decrease the power of selection to trans-
form populations. To determine the strength of selection, scientists separate
the variation in a population into the differences due to genetics (both additive
and non-additive) and the differences due to environment.
Variation is a property of groups of individuals or populations, not individuals
alone, no matter how fickle, unpredictable, or changeable those individuals
are. All the analysis performed to determine variation relates to groups of
individuals.
To understand all the components of an analysis of the heritability of quantita-
tive traits, consider a simple hypothetical example: height. (Why height? No
particular reason. You could use any quantitative trait.)
105
Chapter 7: Quantitative Genetics: When Many Genes Act at Once

The phenotype — in this example, whether you’re tall or short — is a function
of the genotype and the environment. Height has a heritable component: Tall
parents tend to have taller offspring. It also has an environmental component:
Absent a proper diet, you won’t get very tall.
You can further partition the genetic component of the phenotype into additive
and non-additive parts. How strong selection is for this trait is determined by
the additive component of genetic variation.
Here’s the math: The phenotypic variation within a population is the sum of
additive genetic variation plus the non-additive genetic variation plus the
environmental variation. If you like formulas, here’s what this one looks like:
phenotypic variation = additive genetic variation + non-additive genetic
variation + environmental variation
Broad- and narrow-sense heritability
Environmental variation isn’t heritable. Imagine two people who have a simi-
lar genetic makeup, one of whom is taller due only to a better diet. Because
the variation between these two individuals isn’t due to genetic factors, the
taller person won’t have taller offspring. But variation that is a function of
genetics and not of the environment is heritable. 
For the purposes of understanding natural selection, it’s helpful to think of
heritability as being either the broad-sense or the narrow-sense type:
 Broad-sense heritability: The total of all of the genetic factors, be they
additive or non-additive
 Narrow-sense heritability: The subset of the genetic component that is
additive.
Heritability is measured as a number from 0 to 1, indicating the degree of cor-
relation between the parental phenotype and the offspring phenotype:
 If the offspring phenotype is predicted by the phenotype of the parents,
heritability is 1.
 If the offspring phenotype is not predicted by the phenotype of the parents,
heritability is 0.
In the height example, in which the difference between the height of two
people was due simply to diet, the phenotype of the offspring of the tall
parent would not be any different from the phenotype of the offspring of the
short parent, and heritability would be close to zero.
106
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Think back to the example of the smooth and wrinkly peas. Imagine two pea
plants, both of which are heterozygous for the smooth character — that is,
each plant has both a dominant smooth allele and a recessive wrinkled allele.
Because of the dominant interaction between these two genes, all the peas
are smooth. Now suppose that you cross these two pea plants. On average,
one quarter of the offspring will have wrinkly seeds. In this very simple case,
you can see that although the phenotype of the offspring was a direct result
of the genes they inherited from their parents (broad-sense heritability), the
phenotype of the parents was an inexact predictor of the phenotype of the
offspring. Heritability in the narrow sense was less than 1.
In evolution, narrow-sense heritability is the important form of heritability.
Imagine that for some reason, being a pea plant with smooth seeds is advan-
tageous. Natural selection will result in the pea plants with smooth seeds being
the ones to leave more descendents, and as a result, the next generation will
have fewer plants with wrinkly seeds — but not as many fewer as you would
expect based just on the relative selective advantage of having smooth seeds.
Why? Some of the plants with smooth seeds will have wrinkly offspring. That
phenomenon is the non-additive part of the genetic variation.
Measuring the Strength of Selection
Evolution by natural selection relies on heritable variation and the strength of
selection. For that reason, examining those two different factors is important.
Scientists can easily measure how phenotypes vary in a population. What they
don’t know as easily is how much of this variation is heritable. But they can
find out.
Figure 7-1 shows the variation of a particular quantitative continuous pheno-
typic trait in a population — in this case, height. The measured heights fall
along the x-axis. Individuals on the left are shorter than individuals on the right.
The y-axis shows the frequency in the population of different phenotypes. In
this particular example, most of the individuals cluster in the middle range;
some of them are very short, and some of them are very tall, but most of
them are in between.
To find out how heritable height is in this population, you can selectively breed
the tallest (or the shortest) individuals and then examine the frequency dis-
tribution of their offspring’s height. Figure 7-2 is the same frequency distribution
as Figure 7-1, highlighting the subset of the original population you plan to use
to create the next generation in your experimental population. In this case,
assume that you picked the tall ones.
107
Chapter 7: Quantitative Genetics: When Many Genes Act at Once

So what will the offspring population look like? Specifically, what will be the
frequency distribution of phenotypes of this quantitative trait? Figure 7-3 and
Figure 7-4 show two of many possibilities. Each figure shows two frequency
distributions. The first is the frequency distribution of the phenotypes of the
original population, and the second is the distribution of the offspring popu-
lation resulting from breeding only the tallest individuals. In both cases, the
average height of the population has been shifted to the right. In both cases,
on average the offspring population is taller. But in Figure 7-4, the population
has shifted much farther to the right, meaning that the offspring population
is significantly taller.

Part II: How Evolution Works  

A result such as the one in Figure 7-4 tells you that the trait (in this case, height)
is much more heritable in that experiment than it was for the case in Figure 7-3.
The difference between the two figures can’t be due to the strength of selection,
because that was the same in both cases. (Remember, you were the selective
agent because you picked which ones would have offspring.) Given that the
strength of selection was the same, the difference in the response to selection
was purely a function of the difference in heritability between these two 
populations.

Chapter 7: Quantitative Genetics: When Many Genes Act at Once

If you increase the strength of selection, you would expect an even greater
increase in the change in average height in the offspring population, which is
exactly what Figure 7-5 illustrates. Here, the new population was founded with
a much smaller subset of the original population, comprising only the tallest
of the tall (compare the shaded area here with the shaded area in Figure 7-2).
The result is a greater shift toward an even taller offspring population.
All of this — QTL mapping, continuous/non-continuous and additive/non-
additive traits, broad- and narrow-sense heritability — is pretty academic,
and you probably need to be a scientist (or a very devoted reader) to grasp
the fine and not-so-fine points of the topic. But anyone can appreciate the
advantages that the study of quantitative genetics can bring to fields that
touch us all. The closer we get to figuring out where all the genes are on the
genome, how they interact, and what they actually do, the closer we get to
treating diseases that confound us now.

volution is nothing more than changes in gene frequencies in a group of
organisms through time. Accumulate enough of these genetic changes in
one population of a particular species, and that population could evolve into
a new species. This process, whereby members of one species become another
species, is called speciation, and it’s one of the most fascinating areas of 
evolutionary biology.
As you can imagine, speciation can take a very long time — at least compared
with the human life span. For that reason, scientists can’t perform a single
experiment in a laboratory that allows them to start with one species and watch
a new one evolve. What they can do instead is observe the process in nature
and study the individual parts of the process in the laboratory and in the
natural environment.
Evolution doesn’t need to lead to speciation. A species can evolve through
time without splitting to create a second species. The study of speciation is
the study of what factors are responsible for causing one species split into
two species.
Species and Speciation at a Glance
Speciation is simply the process whereby a single lineage splits into two
lineages. In other words, new species arise from existing species.
But what constitutes a species and how does speciation occur? The following
sections explain. 

The biological-species concept
Scientists have a pretty good handle on what constitutes a species for sexually
reproducing animals: the biological-species concept. According to this concept,
a species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce viable and
fertile offspring. 
Individuals can mate and reproduce with members of their own species but
not with members of other species. The defining characteristic separating
one species from another is that they are reproductively isolated from each
other. When a speciation event occurs — when evolution results in members
of one species developing into another species — that group of individuals
can no longer interbreed with members of the original species.
The biological-species concept best applies to sexually reproducing animals.
It doesn’t adequately define what bacterial species are. In fact, defining the
term species in other cases is an active area of evolutionary biology. For more
on bacterial species, head to the later section “A Species Concept for Bacteria.”
When one species becomes two
When new species arise from existing species, you have speciation. Here’s how
it works: Two different populations of the same species evolve in different ways.
They become progressively more different until they are so different that
they are no longer able to interbreed. That’s all there is to it. 
You’ve heard about speciation, and it might be one of the major reasons you
bought this book. Can it be that such a thing really happens? It’s clear that some
people don’t even like the idea of it. How do we know that the whole idea of
speciation wasn’t just something that Darwin concocted with after one too
many beers? Because of ring species, which are explained in the next section.
At this point, suffice it to say that by studying ring species, scientists know
that a gradual accumulation of small differences is sufficient to cause two
populations of the same species to become reproductively isolated. 
Of course, ring species aren’t the only interesting thing in this chapter. I hope
you read the rest of the chapter, too, because speciation is a fascinating topic
and one that evolutionary biologists think about a lot. But even if you read no
more than the next section, you’ll see how scientists — and now you — know
that speciation can indeed happen.
112
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Going in Circles: Ring Species 
Through the existence of ring species, scientists can say with 100 percent
certainty that small differences can accumulate in nature to the point that
two populations of the same species can become reproductively isolated.
They can actually go out and see it. 
113
Chapter 8: Species and Speciation 
Subspecies, races, and breeds
Variation exists among different populations of
the same species. The following terms are used
to describe the different types of variation:
 Subspecies: A group within a particular
species that shares genetic characters with
other group members that it doesn’t share
with members of the larger species.
Subspecies may interbreed quite freely or
may be partially reproductively isolated —
that is, they can interbreed but don’t do it as
well, or produce offspring as viable, as when
they mate within their own subspecies
group. Subspecies can range from ever-so-
slightly-different groups within a species to
groups that are on the verge of speciating.
 Race: Used most often to describe variation
within the human species. Human races are
differentiated primarily by skin color, but
even though the genes responsible for skin
color are noticeable, the actual genetic dif-
ferences among races are slight. In fact,
skin color doesn’t accurately reflect the
genetic differences among humans. Two
people of African descent could easily be
more genetically different from each other
than a person of European descent may be
from a person of Asian descent. Bottom
line: Races have slight differences, and
these differences are no where near the
level they’d have to be to decrease gene
exchange.
 Breed: Domestic animals (such as dogs and
cows) whose characteristics are artificially
selected and maintained by humans
through animal husbandry are divided into
breeds. The goal of selective breeding is to
create animals that differ from their wild
counterparts and possess relatively pre-
dictable traits. Take dogs, for example.
Humans have been breeding dogs for only a
relatively short period, and over that time,
starting with wolves, we’ve managed to pro-
duce everything from Chihuahuas to Great
Danes. All breeds of dogs are the same
species. They can all interbreed, although
admittedly, interbreeding is easier for some
pairs than for others. Note: Standard con-
vention gives species names to products of
animal husbandry. That doesn’t mean, how-
ever, that dogs and wolves are different
species (in fact they share the same species
name: canis domesticus). Dogs and wolves
can still interbreed, even though a “happily
ever after” probably wouldn’t be in the cards
for the Big Bad Wolf and your Pomeranian.

Ring species are species with these specific features:
 Their habitat surrounds an area of hostile environment that they can’t
cross. Think about a bird species living in the lower elevations around
the Himalayan mountain plateau. Or a little salamander living around the
edges of California Central Valley. Or a bird that lives on the land masses
surrounding the Arctic ice cap. They can move around the edges, but
they can’t cross over the middle, where they wouldn’t be able to survive.
Figure 8-1 shows a habitat for a ring species.
 Neighboring subpopulations around the circle, or ring, are slightly
genetically different from each other. These genetic differences can be
measured. Maybe there’s been selection for different alleles in different
places; maybe the genetic differences are the result of drift; maybe both. 
 Most neighboring populations can interbreed with each other. The
populations near one another are a little different genetically, but they are
still the same species and can therefore mate and produce viable offspring.
 At one place around the ring — the ends — the neighboring populations
can’t interbreed with each other. Each population can breed with its
neighbors (because neighboring populations are just a little bit different),
yet all those differences add up as you go from one end of the ring to the
other. The result is that, by the time you’ve gone all the way around from
the beginning of the circle to the end, the two populations on the ends are
too different to interbreed. If it wasn’t for all the populations in the middle,
the two end populations would be different species. 
Think of the ring as a horse shoe with the ends bent together so they
touch. The two populations at the ends of the horse shoe are just too
different to interbreed. 
You can still think of populations comprising a ring species as being part of
the same species because they share a common gene pool, and their genes

114
Part II: How Evolution Works  

can be combined via the intermediate populations (so they’re not completely
reproductively isolated), but obviously, this is a gray area because the popu-
lations at the ends of the range can’t interbreed.
It wouldn’t take much for a ring species to become two separate species.
Nothing evolutionary has to happen (that’s happened already): All you need is
for something to wipe out some of the middle populations and break the ring.
What could cause the elimination of the middle populations? Take your pick: 
 Any event, natural or manmade, leading to a fractured habitat that literally
separates the range (such as an erupting volcano or earthquake)
 Any event that wipes out the populations in the middle (such as an
epidemic or uncontrolled hunting).
The Components of Speciation
Speciation usually doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a gradual process that
involves these 3 components:
 Reduction in gene flow (the exchange of genes between adjacent, or
nearby populations): The mating and reproduction that go on within a
species does a pretty effective job of keeping all the genes between pop-
ulations mixed and, therefore, keeping these populations genetically
homogenous. As long as the genes can be easily exchanged between
populations, the two populations can’t diverge genetically. Mating keeps
mixing the genes back together. For speciation to occur there needs to
be a reduction in gene flow.
 A decrease in the genetic similarities among populations within a species:
Once populations aren’t being mixed together, they can become more
dissimilar as a consequence of the different evolutionary trajectories
experienced by the two populations.
 The development of reproductive isolation between the two populations:
Reproductive isolation can happen via two mechanisms. 
• The accumulation of differences can, by itself, lead to a reduction
in the ability to interbreed. The different populations are just too
different.
• When the populations have diverged to the extent that the offspring
of such matings are less fit, natural selection acts to prevent mating
between individuals of the two populations. If individuals from the
two populations can still interbreed but with reduced success, nat-
ural selection will favor individuals that say, “I’m just not that into
you.” Matings that won’t produce quality offspring aren’t good for
fitness — alleles for avoiding such mistakes will increase as a result
of selection. 
115
Chapter 8: Species and Speciation 

Numerous events can bring about reduction in gene flow, decrease in similari-
ties among populations, and their eventual reproductive isolation.
Sometimes, these events are physical barriers; other times, they’re not. 
How little changes add up: 
Local adaptations
As Chapter 4 explains, genetic variation occurs among members of the same
species — hardly an earth-shattering piece of information. Just look around.
All people are humans, but identical twins aside, all of us look different. (Even
identical twins aren’t exactly identical, of course, because of environmental
factors that affect their phenotypes; refer to Chapter 4.)
By studying naturally occurring variation, scientists have discovered that
some of this variation can be accounted for by organisms having adapted to
their local environment. Think about it: Some species have ranges that extend
over areas so large that environmental factors differ from place to place within
the species’ range. A species of flowering plant, for example, can have a range
that extends from Texas to Minnesota, and given the very different conditions
in the two areas, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that plants in Texas and
Minnesota would flower at different times. These differences often have a
genetic basis; natural selection has favored alleles for flowering earlier in
Texas and later in Minnesota.
If you’re a flowering plant, you want to flower at the same time that your
neighbors are flowering, because mating is hard if your flowers are the only
ones that are open. For that reason, flowering time, which is crucial to a
plant’s fitness, is under strong selection. A plant that flowers too early may
lose its flowers to a late frost; one that flowers too late may lack sufficient
time to produce seeds before winter comes.
A fair number of plants self-pollinate — information that is of absolutely no
value in this discussion except as a little bit of trivia. Mull it over at your leisure.
One of the tricks plants use to make sure that they flower at the right time is
to assess day length — a perfect predictor of the time of year regardless of
where you are. The “right” day-night cycle for flowering, though, depends on
where the plant grows. By taking sample plants of a species from different
places across the entire species range and growing them under controlled
conditions in a greenhouse where day length can be varied, scientists have
found that the various populations of plants have adapted to respond to the
different day-night cycles of their respective original locations, even though
they all belong to the same species. 
116
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Although plants with different light-dark cycles can interbreed, they generally
don’t, for the simple reason that the plants that are most different are likely
to be ones that are farthest away, and Minnesota pollen has little chance of
landing on a Texas flower. Because gene flow, gene exchange between adjacent
populations, is low to non-existent over such long distances, plants in different
parts of this large area can evolve different combinations of genes. By growing
the plants from different locations in a controlled environment, scientists were
able to show that some populations in the same species are adapted to the
local conditions where they were found.
Reproductive isolation: The final 
step of speciation
Speciation occurs when the separate populations become reproductively
isolated, losing their ability to produce live or fertile offspring. The mechanisms
responsible for reproductive incompatibility fall into two categories: prezygotic
isolating mechanisms and postzygotic isolating mechanisms. 
 Prezygotic isolating mechanisms: Specifically, prezygotic refers to those
things that occur before the egg is fertilized. Basically, this type of isolating
mechanism stops sperm and egg from getting together.
 Postzygotic isolating mechanisms: Postzygotic isolating mechanisms
are those that occur after the egg is fertilized. They don’t stop mating,
but they stop the offspring from being viable or able to reproduce.
The following sections go into more detail.
Prezygotic isolating mechanisms
Anything that could prevent the sperm and egg from coming together is
considered to be a prezygotic isolating mechanism, such as the following:
 Reproductive timing differences: Hey, when the time isn’t right, what
can you do?
 Spatial separation: If one population is always on hawthorn trees, and
the other is on apple trees, never the twain shall meet.
 Mate-choice specificity: Basically, this situation is the evolution of being
picky.
 Physical incompatibilities between the two sexes: This mechanism is
common among insects. Have you ever seen Drosophila genitalia? Let
me just say this: If the pieces don’t fit, you really must quit.
 Inability of the sperm and egg to fuse: No fusing means no offspring.
117
Chapter 8: Species and Speciation 

Postzygotic isolating mechanisms
Postzygotic isolating mechanisms are those that come into play even though
individuals from the two diverging groups do mate. As a result of different
evolutionary trajectories, the parents are different enough that they don’t
produce fertile offspring (or any offspring, perhaps). Postzygotic isolating
mechanisms include
 Spontaneous abortion of hybrid embryos: The offspring are never born.
 Low offspring viability: The offspring die, often before reproducing.
 Offspring sterility: The offspring themselves can’t reproduce. (As far as
one’s fitness goes, producing sterile offspring is exactly the same as
producing no offspring at all.)
Postzygotic isolating mechanisms drive the evolution of prezygotic isolating
mechanisms. Why? Because mating with someone you can’t produce viable
offspring with is a bad idea, and natural selection favors genes connected
with correct mate choice.
Types of Speciation
The ring species example is all we need to be sure that the process of speciation
can happen. There’s nothing magical about: Little differences add up until you
get a big difference. But most species don’t have a ring-shaped distributions,
so while ring species provide an excellent example of the nuts and bolts of the
process, that’s not how we usually imagine the speciation happening. 
Allopatric speciation: There 
IS a mountain high enough
In allopatric speciation, a physical barrier separates the populations and
limits or eliminates gene flow between them. Any physical barrier that
reduces gene flow will do: a mountain range, a patch of unsuitable habitat
that’s difficult to cross, or an ocean. 
Allopatric speciation is considered to be the most important speciation
mechanism — lots of examples occur in nature — and also the easiest to
understand. It just stands to reason that a reduction in gene flow will occur
when populations are physically separated, and you can easily see how
species can become separated: continents drift apart; mountain ranges 
rise; climates change and alter the availability of suitable habitat.
118
Part II: How Evolution Works  

Although scientists can’t experimentally witness the process of speciation from
beginning to end because of the long time periods involved for full speciation
to occur, they can find pairs of populations at every stage of the process, from
recently physically separated and not very divergent all the way through very
divergent and not very able to reproduce. 
Allopatric speciation by founder effect:
Getting carried away
Allopatric speciation by founder effect, like allopatric speciation (explained in
the preceding section), requires that the two populations be isolated physically.
The difference is that in founder effect speciation, the second population
originates from a small group of individuals separating from the main group,
such as a flock of birds being blown to an island. 
Common locations for allopatric speciation by founder effect are islands,
which tend to be colonized initially by small numbers of individuals. Scientists
find that isolated populations on islands often are very different from the larger
mainland population. The farther an island is from the mainland, for example,
the less likely it is that large numbers of individuals will be blowing or drifting
there. Hence, the differences between the mainland and island populations
can be attributed to either (or both) of the following situations:
 Genetic drift: The founding population already starts off a little differently
genetically and thus by chance may have gene combinations that predis-
pose it to a different evolutionary future. This process may be helped by
genetic drift in the small initial population. For the details on genetic
drift, go to Chapter 6.
 Natural selection: When a population is in a novel environment, genetic
differences accumulate as a result of natural selection. Differences in
predators, prey, or other food resources could drive natural selection in
different directions compared with the mainland population.
Parapatric speciation: I just 
can’t live in your world
In parapatric speciation, the two populations aren’t physically separated; instead,
they abut each other. Because they’re within mating distance, something other
than a physical barrier must be causing the reduction in gene flow between
these populations. That impediment? Natural selection.
119
Chapter 8: Species and Speciation 

Suppose that a species’ range encompasses two adjacent environments with
conditions different enough that genes advantageous on one side aren’t
advantageous on the other. As a consequence, natural selection favors particular
traits on one side that it doesn’t favor on the other side. If an individual from
one side meanders over to the other side for a little procreation, his offspring
with his genes from the “bad” side will be selected against. As a result, the usual
homogenizing effect of mating between individuals of two habitats will be
reduced or eliminated, and the two populations will become more divergent.
A classic example of the first stages of parapatric population divergence is
the evolution of plants in areas contaminated with mine waste such as heavy
metals. These areas aren’t ideal places to set up house, but some plants can.
In these hostile environments, natural selection favors genes that allow plants
to survive high concentrations of lead and other metals. In the absence of this
contamination, these genes aren’t necessarily favored.
These plants haven’t speciated yet; some interbreeding still occurs. Interestingly,
the hybrid plants — those that form as a result of matings between the mine-
waste plants and the native plants — do less well in both the mine-waste
environment and the native environment. Therefore, selection favors genes
that reduce the likelihood of matings between plants on either side of the
line, and as a result, the plants living on the mine waste have changed in a
couple of interesting ways:
 They have evolved different flowering times from the original 
population. Different flowering times prevent gene flow across the mine
waste. The difference in flowering times is most pronounced at the border
between the two environments, because plants that are farther from the
mine waste are less likely to receive pollen from mine-waste plants and,
therefore, are less likely to experience a selective force favoring different
flowering time.
 They have evolved to have a higher rate of self-fertilization. Self-
fertilization could be selectively advantageous for two reasons:
• It prevents the production of offspring with low fitness by preventing
matings with plants from uncontaminated soil.
• It comes in handy if getting pollen from another compatible plant
is difficult.
In parapatric speciation, selection is strong enough to reduce the likelihood
that genes from one environment will make it in the gene pool of a population
living in a different environment. Further evolution of reproductive characters
(like different flowering times, for example) decreases gene flow between
populations even more. In the mine-waste example, the two populations are
adjacent, and pollen blows back and forth, yet the offspring that result from
120
Part II: How Evolution Works  

matings between the two populations are not likely to contribute their genes
to the next generation. Different selective regimes in the two environments
have resulted in a reduction in gene flow between the two populations, which
will only increase the degree to which the two populations diverge.
Sympatric speciation: Let’s just be friends
Sympatric speciation occurs without the organisms in the two populations being
physically separated at all. No physical barrier prevents gene flow (as in
allopatric or allopatric speciation by founder effect speciation), and no
spatial discontinuity exists (as in parapatric speciation). In sympatric
speciation, it is some detail of the environment that results in a reduction 
of gene flow between the two populations.
Suppose that one particular combination of genes makes some individuals better
at foraging at night, and another combination generates individuals that are
better at foraging during the day. If some of the individuals are active only at
night and others are active only during the day, the night-active critters are
more likely to breed with other night-active critters, simply because those
are the creatures they interact with.
Although researchers suspect that sympatric speciation is unlikely to be a
very common speciation mechanism, evidence suggests that the process can
be important occasionally. A possible example is the case of the apple
maggot worm — a pest of apples in the United States.
Apples aren’t native to the United States; they were introduced by European
settlers. The apple maggot worm, on the other hand, is native to the United
States. Before the introduction of apples, it fed on hawthorns, and many maggot
worms still feed on hawthorns. Hawthorns and apples can grow in similar
locations. The apple worms that infest apple trees have ample opportunity to
mate with worms from hawthorns and produce offspring, but when scientists
examine them, they see that the apple worms infesting one type of tree are
genetically different from those feeding on the other type of tree.
Something’s preventing gene flow between these two types of worms. Even
though apples and hawthorns exist in the same environment, for some
reason the flies that lay eggs on one species avoid laying eggs on the other.
One possible answer involves ripening times. Apples ripen earlier than
hawthorn fruits, and the flies living on the different species reproduce at
slightly different times.
121
Chapter 8: Species and Speciation 

More interesting, the flies seem to have developed a preference for either apples
or hawthorns. The flies laying eggs on apples have a preference for apples,
whereas the flies laying eggs on hawthorns have a preference for hawthorns —
preferences that must have evolved after the introduction of apples to the
United States, arising in a location where apples and hawthorns coexist. It’s
this feeding preference that’s driving the flies’ divergence.
Speciation hasn’t occurred for the apple maggot flies yet. The two populations
can still reproduce (even though doing so would be the entomological equiv-
alent of a Capulet-Montague pairing), but they’re beginning to diverge genetically
even though they live in exactly the same place, as close to each other as

Diverging on the fly
As two populations diverge, they can become
reproductively isolated. Populations living in dif-
ferent environments experience different selec-
tive pressures. As a result, they become
genetically different and less able to reproduce.
In this case, reproductive isolation is a by-prod-
uct of selection. Alternatively, reproductive iso-
lation can be selected for when two populations
have diverged to the point where hybrids have
lower fitness. In that case, any mutations that
result in the organisms’ wanting to avoid “inter-
breeding” will increase in frequency.
Diane Dodd designed an experiment in which
several generations of fruit flies were raised on
different kinds of food: either a starch-based
food or a sugar maltose-based food. Starting
with a single population of flies, the researchers
produced different fly lineages. The initial flies
were the same, and the experiment was set up
in such a way that the only selective pressure
was the food type. Flies that did well on maltose
(or starch) were more likely to leave more
descendants and hence their genes were more
likely to end up in the next maltose (or starch)
generation. After 8 generations, Dodd con-
ducted experiments to investigate the mating
preferences of the evolved flies.
To conduct these experiments, Dodd introduced
male and female flies from the different popula-
tions into a cage and kept track of which flies got
together. When the flies came from different pop-
ulations that had been fed the same food, they
didn’t exhibit a preference for mating with flies
from their own population. A fly raised on starch
was just as likely to mate with a fly raised on
starch from a different population as it was to
mate with a fly raised on starch from its own pop-
ulation. The same results held for flies raised on
maltose: They didn’t exhibit a preference for their
own population compared with others raised on
similar food.
When the experiment involved flies that had
been fed different food types, however, the sit-
uation changed. In this case, the flies exhibited
a distinct preference for mating with flies that
had been raised on the same food they had.
What’s important about this experiment is that in
producing the flies, Dodd didn’t select for repro-
ductive preferences; she selected for increased
fitness on one type of fly food or another. But as
a result of evolutionary changes for increased fit-
ness, the flies also developed changes in mating
preference! This experiment clearly indicates
that selection for fitness in different environ-
ments may result in reduced ability to interbreed.

Islands: Good Places to 
Vacation and Speciate
Some places are just plain better for speciating and studying speciation than
others — islands, for example. As stated earlier, islands are just tailor-made
for allopatric speciation via founder events. 
Islands can be hot spots for speciation. Hawaii is a good example. So are the
Galapagos Islands, where Darwin got his first insights into the process of
speciation by natural selection. Two factors combine to make islands areas
that can facilitate speciation:
 Isolation: Islands are by definition places where populations are isolated
from the rest of the species. As gene flow is low, opportunities for
genetic diversification increase.
 Potential for subsequent speciation: After a species has evolved on one
island in a chain, some of its members can blow or drift to another island,
where they may diverge further. In the future, some of them may be
blown back to the first island — where, if they’re different enough, they
may diverge from the population on the original island to produce a
second new species.
Islands aren’t populated solely by species that just happen to wash up on their
shores or get dumped there by a wayward breeze. If an archipelago is far enough
from the mainland to make colonization from mainland organisms unlikely,
the island is often populated by the species that are unique to the island. You
can safely assume that these species arose via speciation on the island.
Hawaii, for example, has several native species (like ukulele players) that
don’t exist anywhere else. They arose in the Hawaiian archipelago. 
A Species Concept for Bacteria
The biological-species concept, explained in an earlier section, classifies species
based on their ability to mate and reproduce. That system is all well and good
for organisms that mate and reproduce, but it leaves lots of other organisms
out in the cold.
Bacteria are perhaps the best examples of organisms that reproduce without
mating. They simply divide into two daughter bacteria, each of which goes
happily on its way, dividing further. Mutations can occur in this process, just
as in any other DNA-replication process; hence, bacteria evolve.
123
Chapter 8: Species and Speciation 

Bacteria categories
When microbiologists go out to the environment (such as some exotic foreign
location the likes of which you see on the Discovery Channel or the back of your
throat), they find that they can group the microbes they collect into different
categories such as:
 Escherichia coli (E. coli): Common gut bacteria
 Staphylococcus aureus: microbes that can cause staph infections
 Neisseria meningitides: One of the many organisms that can cause
meningitis
Because scientists can group bacteria into separate, recognizable categories,
they give those groups names like E. coli and call them species. But the bacterial
species doesn’t mean the same thing as it does for animals, plants, and other
sexually reproducing organisms. 
E. coli isn’t a species because all E. coli mate with one another and not with
Neisseria. It’s a “species” for some other reason. The key is determining what
cohesive force differentiates one species of bacteria from another. What
keeps the groups separate? 
Periodic selection and selective sweeps
One possible cohesive force that could be responsible for the existence of
groups of nonsexually reproducing but similar organisms is periodic selection.
In periodic selection, natural selection favors a mutation that confers high fit-
ness, which leads to a purging of genetic diversity within a group of nonsexual
organisms.
The process works this way. Think about our friend E. coli. As one E. coli bac-
terium divides, different mutations begin to accumulate, and the population
of E. coli bacteria gets more and more variable. Now imagine that a mutation
arises that is especially beneficial for an E. coli bacterium, enabling it to out-
compete all the other E. coli. It’s more fit, and as it takes over, all the other E.
coli bacteria are eliminated; as a consequence, genetic diversity within the
species is reduced.
This process, called a selective sweep, may be the reason why scientists can
identify species of bacteria and name them based on their overall similarity —
something called phenetic species or ecological species. In this type of system,
natural selection periodically reduces the variation found in a species and
keeps, for example, all E. coli bacteria looking pretty much the same.

E
volution can lead to speciation, in which two species arise from a single
parent species (refer to Chapter 8). Starting with one life form a long,
long time ago, the process of evolution has generated the diversity of life
forms we see all around us. This process, all by itself, is just ridiculously cool!
Over time, the sum of these speciation events generates what scientists refer
to as the tree of life. The neat thing about trees of life (scientific name: phylo-
genetic trees) is that they enable us to trace the history of species in much
the same way that genealogical trees let people trace their family histories. In
a nutshell, phylogenetics lets biologists figure out the actual history of
branching (speciation) for a given set of species.
This chapter introduces you to phylogenetic trees, describing what they are
and how they’re made. Although knowing the history of species is pretty
darned amazing in and of itself, these trees can provide a wealth of other
information, too — and you also find that info in this chapter.
Understanding the Importance 
of Phylogenetic Classification
Scientists in general like to classify things, and they’ve been doing it for
centuries. Why? Not because it makes them feel good (although it does), but
because it helps keep things neat while at the same time providing a wealth of
information. The simple process of sorting reveals patterns and relationships,

and gives clues to past events — revelations that are absolutely fundamental
to the study of evolution. This information is so important to evolutionary
biologists, in fact, that they’ve come up with a way to show how related
organisms are, evolution-wise, and to classify them accordingly. This method
is called phylogenetic classification.
The advantage of a phylogenetic classification is that it shows the underlying
biological processes that are responsible for the diversity of organisms.
Through phylogenetics, scientists have been able to trace the genetic history
of different species and, in doing so, have proved that the process of specia-
tion — whereby ancestral species gives rise to descendent species — is real.
(For more information on speciation, head to Chapter 8.) In fact, they’ve
shown, as far as available data allows, that all species existing today
descended from a single common ancestor.

Other classification systems, courtesy 
of Aristotle and Linneaus
The field of biological classification began with
Aristotle (384–322 BCE). He concerned himself
primarily with the classification of animals and
recognized two major groups: those with blood
and those without blood. In the “with blood”
group, Aristotle recognized five subgroups:
birds, things with four legs that lay eggs, things
with legs that don’t lay eggs, fish, and whales.
The 
things-with-legs-that-lay-eggs 
group
included animals such as crocodiles, lizards,
frogs. The things-with-legs-that-don’t-lay-eggs
group corresponded mostly with what we now
call mammals, except that Aristotle’s group
didn’t include whales. (He recognized that
whales are different from fish but didn’t realize
that they’re mammals.) The main thing to know
about Aristotle’s system is that it used nested
groups; he divided organisms into two main
groups and then created subdivisions within
those groups. This structure set the standard for
later classification systems.
Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778) developed
Aristotle’s idea of a nested classification
scheme more completely. He divided all of life
into two kingdoms: animal and vegetable. Then
he subdivided those kingdoms into classes,
divided classes into orders, divided orders into
genera (singular: genus), and divided genera
into species. Linnaeus brought a huge amount
of order to the study of biology. The diversity of
life is far more manageable if it can be broken
down into smaller groups, and Linnaeus was the
guy who really got the ball rolling on that front.
Today, scientists have modified the Linnean
classification system to incorporate new dis-
coveries and understanding. Instead of
Linnaeus’s two kingdoms (plants and animals),
scientists have proposed additional kingdoms
corresponding to such things as single-celled
organisms and fungi, and even “grab bag” king-
doms for organisms that don’t fit into one of the

The evidence that all life descends from a single common ancestor includes
such things as the unity of the genetic code. Organisms use a simple code to
determine how to make proteins from DNA sequences, and all organisms use
the same code (although some minor exceptions exist; go to Chapter 15 for
details.) To find out more about the genetic code and its importance to 
evolution, refer to Chapter 3.
Beyond enabling scientists to trace genetic connections back through time,
phylogenetics lets scientists better predict what’s to come. Being able to
anticipate future mutations is an especially important function in areas like
health care; virologists and epidemiologists use info gleaned from phylogenetics
to stay one step ahead of the bugs that are trying to stay one step ahead of
the human immune system. (You can read more about viruses and the race
for vaccines in Chapter 19.)
127
Chapter 9: Phylogenetics: Reconstructing the Tree of Life
other kingdoms. The modern version of the
Linnean classification system, which scientists
use today and is probably the one you learned in
high school, looks like this:
 Domain
 Kingdom
 Phylum
 Class
 Order
 Family
 Genus
 Species
Classify humans according to this system and
you get
 Domain: Eukarya (organisms with one or
more cells with a nucleus) 
 Kingdom: Animalia (other kingdoms are
plants and fungi)
 Phylum: Chordata (animals having a dorsal
nerve tube, like the one that runs down your
spine)
 Class: Mammalia (animals that have hair,
nurse their young, and so on. ) 
 Order: Primates (yes, you’re a primate — so
are orangutans, apes, chimps, and others)
 Family: Hominidae (modern man and extinct
ancestors of man)
 Genus: Homo (species of humans, both
extinct and currently living) 
 Species: sapien (wise — proving scientists
do have senses of humor)
Here’s a little tip: A fun way to remember each
level of this system in order is to use the
mnemonic “Did King Phillip Come Over For
Good Sex?” And if you leave out Domain, which
some systems do, the mnemonic changes only
slightly: “King Phillip Came Over For Good Sex.”

Drawing the Tree of Life: Branching
Patterns and Speciation
Scientists show phylogenetic relationships by drawing phylogenetic trees. If
you trace the process of speciation on paper, you end up with a branching
pattern that’s referred to as the tree of life. Each branch in the tree represents
a speciation event, when one species evolved into another.
A simple tree
The easiest way to explain phylogenetic trees is to start with the simplest
tree possible: one with three species, which I’ll call species A, B, and C.
Imagine that you know that species B and C are more closely related to each
other than either of them is to species A. More specifically, species B and C
have a common ancestor that they don’t share with species A. All three species
also have a common ancestor that dates from a time before the common
ancestor of species B and C. A phylogenetic tree for these species would look
like the one shown on the left in Figure 9-1. Plug in species names, and you
have the tree shown on the right.
A more complex tree
Most phylogenetic trees are not as simple as the one in Figure 9-1, of course.
A more realistic (and complex) tree appears in Figure 9-2. This tree shows the
relationships among some of the major vertebrate groups. Located at the tips
of the branches are the names of the groups (lampreys, sharks, sturgeons,
mammals, birds, and so on).

Part II: How Evolution Works 

As stated earlier, Figure 9-2 shows the phylogeny, or evolutionary relatedness,
among some of the major vertebrate groups. Strictly speaking, however, the
scientific convention would be to refer to this diagram as a phylogenetic
hypothesis rather than a phylogeny. Not having been around that many millions
of years ago when these relationships were forming, modern scientists can
only infer how these things evolved; they can’t state it directly.
Reading Trees
Phylogenetic trees convey quite a bit of information. To figure out what that
information is, you have to be able to read the tree — that is, to understand
the relationships that the tree illustrates. This section explains what you
need to know.
Knowing your nodes
A phylogenetic tree is comprised of branches and nodes — places where
branches connect — that represent ancestral species (species that give rise
to the species at the tips of the branches). Figure 9-3 shows the same tree as
does Figure 9-2, except that the nodes are circled. Note that, among the many
connections, you can see that crocodiles and birds share a common ancestor.
Go a bit farther back in time, and you can see another ancestral species that
they share with lizards and snakes.

Chapter 9: Phylogenetics: Reconstructing the Tree of Life

Scientists refer to nodes as taxa. All the organisms that appear at the tips of
the tree (in Figure 9-3, the birds, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, mammals, etc.)
are terminal taxa. 
Getting oriented: Up, down, 
or round and round
As you read phylogenetic trees, keep in mind that the important thing is the
positions of the groups relative to one another. Changes in how the diagram
is drawn that don’t change these relative positions are unimportant. Exactly
the same information is conveyed either way.
Figure 9-4 shows the simple human-dolphin-goldfish tree from Figure 9-1
drawn four different ways, but — and this part is the important part — all
four diagrams in this figure represent exactly the same relationships among
these organisms. In each diagram, dolphins and humans have a common
ancestor more recent than the ancestor they share with goldfish. The differ-
ences among the four trees can be described as the results of rotating the
branches around the nodes.

Part II: How Evolution Works 

From each of the diagrams in this figure, you can see that at some point in
the past, a speciation event led to the goldfish lineage and to the lineage that
subsequently diverged into dolphins and humans. Note that the dolphin and
human (both of which are mammals and have a fair bit in common) share a
most recent common ancestor that neither shares with the goldfish. But all
three species have more distant common ancestor: All three are vertebrates. 
The left-to-right order of the diagram conveys absolutely no information. You
can draw exactly the same tree with humans in the left position or the middle
position. The branching pattern relative to the nodes is what’s important.
Figure 9-5 shows another, more complex tree with a section that’s been rotated.
Again, the branches for a particular node can be rotated around a node with-
out changing the information in the tree. Both sections convey exactly the
same evolutionary relationships: Lizards and sharks are just as related to each
other as they were before, and the combined group of mammals/lizards/
sharks/crocodiles/birds is in exactly the same position relative to the other
branches of the tree as it was before the rotation. The horizontal order of the
tips of the tree is different, but the positions of the groups relative to one
another haven’t changed.

Chapter 9: Phylogenetics: Reconstructing the Tree of Life

Understanding groups
When you look at a tree, one of the key things you notice is that the branching
pattern creates groupings of species. This section explains the two types of
groups: monophyletic and paraphyletic:
 Monophyletic groups represent all the descendants of a common ancestor. 
 Paraphyletic groups also represent shared ancestry, but of only part of
the group.
Why do we even care about these groups? Because they’re “real” — they indicate
an actual past connection. Mammals are a monophyletic group, for example, and
so are bats. The members may have diverged in different ways, but they all
started the same. 
Monophyletic group
A monophyletic group is a group of species that (1) has a common ancestor
and (2) includes all the descendants of that ancestor. Figure 9-6, for example,
includes three monophyletic groups:
 All the vertebrates in Figure 9-6 have a common ancestor, indicated by
the number 1.
 All the mammals comprise a monophyletic group (the bigger box) that
includes all the descendants of the common ancestor indicated by the
number 2.
 Dolphins and chimps comprise a monophyletic group (the smaller box)
descended from the ancestor indicated by the number 3.

Part II: How Evolution Works 

A monophyletic group is also referred to as a clade, as in “Aren’t you clade a
monophyletic group has another, equally hard-to-remember name?”
Monophyletic groups are important in a phylogenetic classification system
because they’re based on the evolutionary process, not on some arbitrarily
selected character.
Paraphyletic group
A group of organisms that has a common ancestor but doesn’t include all the
descendents of that ancestor is called a paraphyletic group. Figure 9-7 shows
two paraphyletic groups, the first of which is fish. Although the figure includes
several monophyletic groups of fish (sturgeon, lungfish, and teleost), fish as a
whole don’t make up a monophyletic group. The common ancestor of the
fish, indicated by the number 1, gave rise to many other vertebrate groups.
Another paraphyletic group in the vertebrates is the group commonly referred
to as the reptiles, represented in Figure 9-7 by the snake, lizard, and crocodile.
The reptiles are a paraphyletic group rather than a monophyletic group
because the common ancestor of snakes, lizards, and crocodiles also gave
rise to birds.

Reconstructing Trees: A How To Guide
Reconstructing a phylogenetic tree involves searching for the clues that tell
you about the relationships among different species and then applying rigorous,
and often quite complicated, analytical techniques to turn your pile of clues
into your best hypothesis about the actual tree. 
This process boils down to essentially three steps:
1. Identify and analyze characters shared by the species for which
you’re constructing the tree.
2. Use outgroup analysis to determine whether each character state is
either ancestral or derived.
3. Group the species based on your analysis.
The following sections explain these steps in more detail.

Part II: How Evolution Works 

Finding clues (aka characters)
So what are these clues that you use to make the trees? Well, evolution involves
change, and in tree reconstruction, you use these changes to map out the
history of evolution. The clues to look for are changes in the states of 
characters. Gathering clues involves
 Identifying the characters: Character simply refers to an organism’s
specific, measurable traits. A character can be just about anything — hair,
eye color, ability to digest milk, and resistance to antibiotics, for example.
 Determining the different states the characters have: The character
states could be hair present and hair absent.
 Polarizing the characters: Polarizing characters refers to determining
the direction of evolution with respect to each particular change. When
you take all your clues and put them together into a tree, it helps to know
which of the character states is the ancestral state (the one before the
evolutionary event) and which is the derived state (the one after the
evolutionary event).
Imagine three species — turtle, platypus, and rabbit — for which you want to
reconstruct the evolutionary history. First, you find some clues — things about
these organisms that allow you to group them based on their ancestry. You
decide to start with just two clues:
 Both the platypus and the rabbit have hair.
 Both the platypus and the turtle lay eggs.
You know that both characters (hair and egg-laying) have two states: present
and absent, as in “has hair/doesn’t have hair” and “lays eggs/doesn’t lay eggs.”
When scientists decide to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree, they have to decide
what characters, or traits, to use. These characters can be either morphological
(visible physical characters) or molecular (genetic). In this section, I limit the
discussion to morphological characters, such as wings, flippers, and eggs.
Before scientists knew about DNA and DNA sequencing, they were limited 
to these types of characters as well. Today, the ever-increasing amount of
information available about DNA sequences gives scientists the opportunity to
use the organism’s nucleotide sequence (basically, its genes; refer to Chapter 3)
as a character.
135
Chapter 9: Phylogenetics: Reconstructing the Tree of Life

Using outgroup analysis to determine
derived and ancestral states
Now you need to determine which character state is ancestral and which is
derived. To do that, you use outgroup analysis. Collectively, the species you’re
trying to make a tree for — in this example, the platypus, turtle, and rabbit —
are called the in group. The outgroup includes species that don’t belong in the
in group. In this example, they’d be things like clams, bumblebees, and 
mushrooms — things without backbones and four legs and stuff like that. 
Although clams, bumblebees, and mushrooms share a common ancestor with
rabbits, turtles, and platypuses, that ancestor is pretty far back in the tree. So
you can use the character states of these other organisms to assess character
polarity, which refers to which character state is the derived one and which
is ancestral. Mushrooms aren’t much help in this case; they’re just too far out.
But you can learn some things from other animals:
 Almost all the animals in the outgroup lay eggs. From this character, you
can conclude that live birth is the derived character state and that laying
eggs is ancestral. 
 None of the organisms in the outgroup has hair. From this character, you
can conclude that hair is a derived state.
After you’ve polarized the characters, you’re able to conclude that the split
between the platypus and the rabbit occurred after the split between the
lineage that led to the turtle and the lineage that led to the ancestor of the
platypus and the rabbit.
Grouping species
Based on analyzing the outgroups, you know that “laying eggs” is the ancestral
state and “live birth” is the derived state. You also know that “no hair” is the
ancestral state and “hair” is the derived state.
From this analysis, you know that in the past, farther down the tree of life,
critters laid eggs but didn’t have hair. Under this scenario, the change from
egg-laying to live birth doesn’t help you group any two species as having the
most recent common ancestor. Only one of the species — the rabbit — has
this derived character state. Because only one species has the derived state,
you can’t use it to form a group.
136
Part II: How Evolution Works 

The situation is different for hair. Two species — the platypus and the rabbit —
have the derived character state, which allows you to group these two species
as having a more recent common ancestor than the common ancestor of all
three species. You envision that the platypus and the bunny have a hairy
ancestor, so they both have hair.
To reconstruct evolutionary history successfully, you need shared derived
characters — evolutionary events that enable you to differentiate among
different groups of organisms. In Figure 9-6, shown earlier in this chapter, the
monophyletic-group mammals can be distinguished based on the presence of
several novel traits, such as hair and the production of milk. The dolphin and
the chimpanzee can be further classified as a monophyletic group based on
the derived character of live birth. The platypus retains the ancestral condition
of laying eggs.
Understanding homologous traits
When comparing character states among different species, you have to make
certain that you’re comparing two different states of the same character rather
than two completely different characters.
Take the case of forelimbs. Humans have forelimbs; earthworms and bacteria
don’t. A scan through the diversity of life suggests that having forelimbs is a
derived character state. Because the forelimbs in vertebrates share a common
evolutionary origin, they are said to be homologous. 
Homology, which is similarity as a result of common descent, helps scientists
reconstruct the history of evolution and determine the best estimate of the
tree of life. Although forelimbs themselves are homologous, they can evolve
in several directions: into wings in birds and bats, flippers in dolphins, arms
in humans, front legs in horses, and so on.
Looking at homoplasies
Traits that are similar for reasons other than common history are called
homoplasies. Homoplasies can have several evolutionary origins, most easily
categorized as convergence, parallelism, and reversal:
 Convergence: Different structures in two different organisms evolve to
appear similar. The streamlined shape and fins of dolphins appear similar
to those of sharks and fish, but closer analysis reveals that the structures
are quite different — an example of convergence. Dolphins and sharks
don’t share fins because their common ancestor had fins; they share fins
because fins evolved independently in the dolphin lineage.
137
Chapter 9: Phylogenetics: Reconstructing the Tree of Life

 Reversal: A structure that previously evolved is subsequently lost. The
moa is an example of a reversal. Moas, like most of the other vertebrates,
don’t fly; they’re similar to chimpanzees in this regard. But the similarity
is not the result of descent from a common ancestor that didn’t fly (though
it’s true that the most recent common ancestor of the moa and chimp
didn’t have wings). Numerous structural characteristics of the moa
skeleton place the moa firmly within the group of birds, and its ancestors
had wings, but these wings were lost during the course of 
evolution to larger body size.
 Parallelism: Two organisms evolve to acquire the same trait, but — and
this point is key — they don’t share this trait because of a common
ancestor. Rather, they share the trait because it evolved independently
in both lineages. As the preceding section explains, the presence of fore-
limbs in birds and bats is the result of homology; both species descended
from an ancestor that had front limbs. The fact that the front limbs of
bats and birds now function as wings is a homoplasy because wings
evolved independently in the two different lineages. Most mammals
don’t fly; the evolution of flight in bats happened independently of the
evolution of flight in birds.
The fact that dolphins and sharks evolved fins independently doesn’t mean
that their common ancestor didn’t have fins. Fins are the ancestral condition
in vertebrates in the lineage, but they were lost in the lineage leading to the
tetrapods and subsequently re-evolved in the lineage leading to the dolphins.
(If you feel like your head is going to explode, take heart. Cranial explosion is
neither a derived nor an ancestral trait in any known organism.)
The presence of homoplasy throws a wrench into the works, limiting your
ability to reconstruct the tree accurately, because it’s not always simple to
tell when a character similarity is due to homology or homoplasy.
Testing phylogenetic trees
So how do you know that the phylogenetic trees you can create represent
evolutionary relationships accurately? The answer is the way you know 
anything: Someone did an experiment and checked.
David Hillis and co-researchers set out to determine how well different meth-
ods of phylogenetic reconstruction worked at reconstructing the history of
evolution. To do this, they needed to know the history of evolution, and they
came up with a very clever method.
Taking advantage of the fact that viruses have extremely short generation
times, they produced the tree of viral lineages in the laboratory. They started
with one virus, from which they collected different mutants. Then they grew
138

these slightly different viruses, collecting mutants from these viruses in turn.
In this way they were able to generate a branching tree for which they knew
the exact pattern of the branches, because they knew which viruses came
out of which flasks.
The different strains of viruses didn’t become different species over the course
of the experiment (and as Chapter 8 explains, scientists aren’t completely
clear on what constitutes a species in viruses). But the descendant viruses
were different enough from the parent virus to allow Hillis and his co-workers
to construct an evolutionary tree.
Viruses don’t have a lot of characters like eggs and hair, so the researchers
determined what changes had occurred in the viral DNA. They were able to
demonstrate that it’s possible to measure the traits of the terminal taxa and
accurately reconstruct their evolutionary history. In addition, they were able
to use the character states of the terminal taxa to make good predictions about
the character states of the ancestral taxa at the nodes of the tree. Because they
had kept all these ancestral taxa in little vials in a freezer, they were able to
show that their predictions were accurate.
Reconstructing Trees: An Example
One way to reconstruct phylogenetic trees is to use maximum parsimony
analysis. In this method, you determine the minimum amount of evolution
required to explain a particular character set. The tree with the minimum
number of evolutionary events is called the most parsimonious, or shortest, tree.
You can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree in other ways, such as maximum
likelihood, Bayesian analysis, and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method
with Arithmetic mean). Each method has its advantages and disadvantages,
but I’m not going to explain them all. I cover parsimony because it involves
the smallest amount of mathematics. (Google maximum likelihood, and you’ll
see that you’re getting off easy!)
The following sections take you through a simple example of tree construction.
Identifying characters 
Suppose you want to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree for Species A, B, and C,
using seven different character states (1 through 7). For this example, what
the characters are doesn’t matter; the characters could be eggs present or
absent, hair present or absent, and so on.
139
Chapter 9: Phylogenetics: Reconstructing the Tree of Life

This example is uncomplicated by homoplasies (refer to the earlier section
“Looking at homoplasies” for info), but phylogenetic reconstruction can get
very complicated very quickly. Fortunately, for the purposes of this book,
you don’t need to know how to reconstruct complex trees. I just want you to
understand the basic process and to realize that reconstructing these trees
isn’t magic. 
Assigning polarity
Through comparison with the outgroup species (X), which has the ancestral
character state for all seven characters under consideration, you assign a
character polarity to each one. The number 1 represents the derived charac-
ter state, and the number 0 represents the ancestral character state. 
Looking at the characters for the other three species, suppose that you find
the following:
 For characters 1 and 2, all three species have the derived condition,
making species A, B, and C different from species X (the outgroup). 
 For characters 3 and 4, only species B and C have the derived 
characteristics.
 For characters 5, 6, and 7, only species C has the derived characters.
Grouping species
Because species A, B, and C have the derived character for characters 1 and 2,
you know that they are a monophyletic group that doesn’t include species X.
On the phylogenetic tree, you indicate characters 1 and 2 with two slash
marks — one labeled with the number 1 and another labeled with the
number 2 — at a point below the common ancestor of A, B, and C (see 
Figure 9-8). It’s most parsimonious to assume that these two evolutionary
events happened only one time.
Because only species B and C have the derived character states of characters 3
and 4, you separate these two species as a monophyletic group and indicate the
characters 3 and 4 with slash marks below the point of their common ancestor
(see Figure 9-9).
140
Part II: How Evolution Works 

In the case of characters 5, 6, and 7, only species C has the derived characters.
Because these derived traits aren’t shared with any other species, they don’t
give you any information about the topology of the tree. (Remember, to group
species within a tree, you must have shared characters.) 
Placing these characters on the tree adds to the total tree length, which is
defined as the total number of changes required to explain the data matrix,
which in this case is seven (see Figure 9-10).

Chapter 9: Phylogenetics: Reconstructing the Tree of Life

A word about more complicated trees
The preceding example includes only homologous characters — those that
appear as a result of sharing a common ancestor. When homoplasies are
involved (similar characters that don’t indicate a common ancestor), things
get more complicated. 
If you assume that sharing similar characteristics means that species belong
in monophyletic groups and plot the species accordingly, you end up in with
a tree that doesn’t make sense: A species may appear in different groups, for
example, indicating that they evolved more than once. 
To avoid such a scenario, you need to remember that similar characters can
evolve independently, or they can appear, disappear in subsequent evolutionary
changes, and then reappear. When multiple scenarios are possible, the one(s)
you support end up being those that have the fewest (or most parsimonious)
evolutionary steps.
Seeing Phylogenetic Trees in Action
As this chapter shows, it’s possible to reconstruct the history of evolution
through phylogenetic trees. Now the question is how scientists can use these
trees. The answer is that they can use trees for all sorts of purposes, like these:

 Tracing the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic
 Designing a better flu vaccine
The following paragraphs offer several examples that involve the HIV virus. The
other items are covered in detail in other chapters.
Example 1: The Florida dentist
In the early 1990s, a large number of patients of a particular Florida dentist
contracted HIV. The research question at the time was whether they could
have contracted the HIV virus from the dentist. Specifically, given that many
strains of the HIV virus were circulating in the community, was it possible to
connect the HIV strains found in the infected patients with the virus found in
their dentist?
By constructing a phylogenetic tree that included the dentist’s HIV strain, 
the six patients’ HIV strains, and a selection of HIV strains from the broader
community, investigators showed that the patient strains had a recent common
ancestor with the dentist’s strain, not with the strains sampled from the
community.
The take-home message is that even though researchers don’t know exactly
how these viruses got from the dentist to the patients, they know that the
patients did indeed contract HIV from the dentist.
Example 2: General exposure to HIV
In this example, the question is how did the human species become exposed
to HIV? Phylogenetic analysis can address this question by reconstructing an
evolutionary tree of not just HIV, but of other species’ immunodeficiency
viruses as well.
The two major types of human immunodeficiency virus are HIV-1 and HIV-2.
Reconstructing the tree of immunodeficiency viruses reveals that HIV-1 strains
are most closely related to the simian immunodeficiency virus found in
chimpanzees, whereas HIV-2 strains are more closely related to the simian
immunodeficiency virus found in sooty mangabeys. 
The fact that each human virus is related to a different simian virus indicates
that the human viruses are the result of two separate events in which a simian
immunodeficiency virus jumped to a human host. The phylogenetic analysis
that produced this information also directs researchers’ attention to the spe-
cific simian viruses that are implicated as the parent of the human infection. 
You can read more about the origins of HIV in Chapter 18.

Chapter 9: Phylogenetics: Reconstructing the Tree of Life

Example 3: Legal cases
The science of phylogenetics has made its way into the legal world, where it
has been used to prove both guilt and innocence. In the first case, a doctor
was convicted of attempted murder after infecting his former girlfriend with
an HIV strain from one of his patients. This case was the first instance in
which phylogenetic evidence was admitted in a U.S. court. Phylogenetic
analysis of HIV sequences from the infected woman and the patient, as well
as analysis of additional sequences from the community, revealed that the
infected woman’s HIV strain was most closely related to the strain from the
patient. Her strain even had resistance genes against the HIV medications
with which the patient was being treated.
The second case involved six foreign health workers in Libya accused of
intentionally spreading the HIV virus to hospital patients. An analysis of the
HIV strains infecting those patients revealed such a diversity of strains that
the parent strain from which the strains evolved would have to have been
present in Libya before any of the foreign health workers arrived. Initially
sentenced to death despite the scientific evidence supporting their innocence,
the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. Jailed since 1999, the
workers were finally able to leave Libya in the summer of 2007 following
diplomatic negotiations.

What Evolution
Does

In this part . . .
A
n organism’s genetic make up has a huge impact on
more than just its physical characteristics, like how
many limbs it has or how fast it can run. It can also affect
sex selection (how an organism picks a mate), social
behaviors (how — and how well — an organism gets along
with others), and life histories (life spans and age of repro-
ductive viability). See the connection? If genes impact
everything, and evolution impacts genes, then there’s an
evolutionary component in not only how we look, but also
how we behave and interact. This part explains it all.

Chapter 10
The Evolution of Life History
In This Chapter
 Exploring life histories
 Understanding fitness trade-offs and constraints
 Appreciating the many ways to be fit
T
he specific details of an organism’s life cycle and reproductive strategy
are its life history, which includes longevity, age at reproductive maturity,
how often the organism reproduces, and how many offspring are produced.
Life histories are fascinating to evolutionary biologists because so many of
them exist and can be so different. Of course, all this information is interesting
at the individual level, but evolutionary scientists look at life histories at the
species level. 
An oak tree will make thousands of acorns over its life, but it’s not likely
you’re going to make more than one minivan full of children. The human life
history is very different from the oak tree life history, yet both strategies
have been very good at getting offspring into the next generation. There are
lots of people and lots of oak trees, but from a life history perspective, these
two species go about it in different ways. 
This chapter introduces you to the current theories concerning life-history
evolution, theories that seek to answer questions such as these:
 Why is it best sometimes to make lots of eggs once, but at other times
it’s best to make one egg lots of times?
 Why do some animals live for weeks and others for decades?
 Why do we grow old, and why do we die when we do?

148
Part III: What Evolution Does 
Evolution and the Diversity 
of Life Histories
Life histories — the specific details of an organism’s life cycle and reproductive
strategy — differ greatly among species. To get a glimpse of this diversity,
consider the differences between a penguin and a salmon.
A salmon swims up a river to spawn, struggling against the current, jumping
waterfalls, and dodging hungry bears. After years of living in the ocean chasing
prey, avoiding predators, and storing up enough energy, it makes this final
trip to the place of its birth. When it arrives, it produces thousands of eggs
and dies soon after.
An emperor penguin — the only terrestrial vertebrate (other than a few
scientists) to winter in Antarctica — can live more than 20 years. Each year, 
it makes a perilous trip to its inland breeding grounds, walking almost 100
miles in tiny steps, only to produce a single egg. 
Both of these species have been shaped by evolution, but in very different
ways. What it takes to be a fit salmon is obviously very different from what it
takes to be a fit penguin. And before you say well, sure, one’s a fish and the
other’s a bird, remember that not all fish die after reproducing once, and not
all birds lay one egg a year for 20 years. Life histories vary significantly even
among the same types of animals.
Scientists understand enough of the underlying genetics to know that life-
history characteristics are heritable and that, over time, they change, or evolve.
The fact of life-history evolution is that like evolution of other traits, it happens.
What evolutionary biologists want to understand is why. How does selection
drive this process? And how can so many different life-history strategies exist?
Scientists have a theoretical framework that explains the facts they observe,
and they can test these ideas both in the lab and in nature. Concepts that at
first seemed confusing (such as death and aging) make sense now, in light of
an understanding of the evolutionary process.
Organisms don’t live in a vacuum. The selective pressures they experience are
a combination of their biotic and abiotic environment — that is, the organisms
they interact with and the physical factors (temperature and such) they
contend with. These factors are different for each organism, and the variations
are responsible for the corresponding diversity of life-history patterns. In other
words, no single life-history strategy is best because no one pattern could be
best across all the different environments. Fortunately, scientists have a good
understanding of how specific environmental differences influence the evolu-
tion of life histories.

’Til Death Do Us Part: The 
Evolution of Life Span
Evolution via natural selection acts to maximize fitness, and fitness is all
about making sure that your genes are around in the future. That being the
case, dying just doesn’t seem like an especially good idea. After all, death
doesn’t seem to bode well for the “Get your genes to last forever” imperative
of natural selection.
You may think that the simplest way to get your genes into the future is for
you to exist into the future. After all, you’ve got all your genes; if you live into
the future, your genes live into the future, too. Voilà — fitness without the rather
depressing and (often) messy process of dying. But organisms don’t get their
genes into the future by living forever, even though they may live for a very
long time. All this leaves evolutionary biologists, and not just older ones,
puzzling over why things eventually (or not so eventually) die.
Evolution has led to many types of life spans. Giant sequoias, for example, live
for thousands of years, but most plants have much shorter life spans. Your pet
guinea pig, with the best food and care, might live as long as 8 years, but humans
live longer than that, and other animals live much longer than we do.
Why die? Trade-offs and risks
It’s not hard to think of genes that definitely should increase in frequency.
Imagine an animal that lived forever; reproduced early and often; and had huge
numbers of offspring, all of which survived. Talk about fit! Those are some fan-
tastic genes. But these genes don’t occur in nature. Why not? Two reasons: 
 Trade-offs: Often, one thing happens only at the expense of another.
 Risks: The longer you’re around, the more likely it is that something bad
will happen to you.
149
Chapter 10: The Evolution of Life History
Farewell, sweet Harriet
Biologists were much saddened in 2006 by the
passing of Harriet, age 176 (approximate).
Before you run out to get whatever vitamins she
must have been taking, I should mention that
Harriet was a giant tortoise Charles Darwin col-
lected from the Galapagos Islands. 
Tortoise or not, Harriet showed us via her
longevity that an animal can live to be 176 years
old. The heart can beat that long, brain cells can
think that long — it’s biologically possible. But
most animals (sadly, humans included) just don’t
bother.

A common misconception is that dying is an adaptation to make room for
younger, more vigorous individuals — the idea that organisms die for the good
of the species. Although this theory may sound good at first, remember that
selection acts most strongly at the level of individuals. In a population in which
some individuals have a gene for graciously dying to make room for everybody
else and other individuals don’t, it wouldn’t take long for the “die graciously”
gene to go extinct. 
Even if such a gene were good for the species as a whole, it would be bad for
the individuals that had it because they’d be more likely to die, making them
less likely to pass this gene on to the next generation. As a result, the gene
would decrease in frequency over time and vanish from the population, along
with any individuals who were dying for the good of the population. Not
surprising, nature shows no evidence of a “die graciously” gene.
Trade-offs: Evolutionary cost-benefit analysis
The different life-history components involve trade-offs. Because an organism
has only a finite number of resources available, it doesn’t have the energy to
do everything. Energy spent on reproducing, for example, is energy that can’t
be spent on surviving. Reproducing early and often may mean not having
enough energy left to stay alive. 
In this scenario, allocating lots of resource for reproducing even though it makes
you die sooner would be adaptive if, by trading longer life for more offspring,
the organism increases its ability to pass on its genes. The crucial point here
is that the organism is getting more copies of its own genes into the next
generation, not just making room for somebody else’s.
Risky business
Living longer can be risky. The longer an organism lives, the greater the chance
that it will become ill or get eaten by a predator. As the risk of death increases,
so does the advantage of earlier reproduction, even if this early reproduction
results in a shorter life span.
Think of the salmon, which jumps waterfalls and dodges bears to make it all
the way upstream: She puts every last calorie into reproducing because the
chance of making it up that river twice is too small to make reproducing fewer
eggs the first time worth the risk. When the risk of death is higher, natural
selection favors genes for earlier reproduction.
Methuselah flies: The evolution 
of life span in the laboratory
Laboratory experiments have shown that life-history traits — specifically, life
span and metabolic trade-offs — do evolve as scientists expect. This section
150
Part III: What Evolution Does 

looks at one experiment conducted on fruit flies by evolutionary biologist
Michael Rose and company. With their fruit flies, these scientists conducted
two experiments that tested the following: 
 Whether aging could be postponed by strengthening the force of
selection at later ages. If so, this result would provide evidence that a
contributing factor of aging is that selection doesn’t remove mutations
that are only harmful late in life, after you’re done reproducing. The
mutations aren’t neutral from an individual fly’s health perspective, 
but they are selectively neutral because, by the time they rear their ugly
heads, they’ve already been passed on to the next generation. An
experiment that increases the strength of selection at later ages changes
these mutations (assuming they exist) from neutral (because there isn’t
any selection at later ages) to deleterious (because the researchers have
added selection at later ages). 
 Whether metabolic trade-offs may be involved in life-history evolution.
If so, this result would show that the trade-offs are real. It makes sense
that energy spent doing one thing can’t be spent doing something else.
The scientists hypothesized that spending all your energy on reproduction
means you have less energy to devote to survival because of these
trade-offs. 
151
Chapter 10: The Evolution of Life History
Test tubes and teacups
Peter Brian Medawar was the first person to
articulate the idea that allocating resources to
survival instead of reproduction increased
exposure to risk. Where’d he get this idea? By
imagining a population of test tubes. Test tubes
don’t reproduce, but neither do they grow old
and die. So why do you ever have to buy more
test tubes? The answer, of course, is that test
tubes experience accidental death: They get
dropped or knocked over, shattering into pieces
so that they’re no longer usable.
You can say the same thing about teacups. Even
though teacups have been made for thousands
of years, you’ve probably had to buy some your-
self, because they didn’t all survive.
Medawar’s key insight was recognizing that an
organism whose strategy for making sure its
genes were around in the future consisted of
devoting all its energy to surviving instead of
reproducing would eventually run out of luck.
Even if it’s possible to avoid aging, in the end the
risk of death remains by means other than old
age. You could get eaten, for example, or you
could be crushed by a falling tree.
As an interesting aside, Medawar spent only
part of his time thinking about evolutionary
issues and shopping for test tubes. His primary
research involved the immune system — work
for which he received the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine in 1960.

Experimental selection for increased life span
To test the hypothesis that aging can be postponed by strengthening the
force of selection at later ages, Rose set up 10 replicate populations of fruit
flies in his laboratory. For each population, he allowed the flies to feed, mate,
and lay eggs; then he transferred a sample of eggs to a new container with
fresh food. These eggs hatched; the flies matured, mated, and laid eggs; and
the process was repeated with each new generation of flies.
The flies Rose used had been living in the laboratory for 5 years before he
started his experiment, and for those 5 years, the eggs used to start the next
generation of flies had always been the ones produced on the 14th day after
transfer. Females from this laboratory population lived on average about 33
days, and a fit fly was one that made lots of eggs at age 14 days. But that situation
was about to change.
In 5 of his 10 populations, Rose changed nothing. New generations continued
to be founded with eggs produced on the 14th day. These populations were the
control populations. In the other 5 populations, Rose progressively increased
the age at which the eggs used to start the next generation were collected;
instead of gathering the eggs on the 14th day, Rose began collecting them on
the 15th day, the 16th day, and so on. These populations were the ones expe-
riencing Rose’s artificial selection. All of a sudden, a fly wasn’t very fit unless
it could produce eggs at an older age; it didn’t matter how many eggs a fly
produced on Day 14, because none of those offspring were going to make it
into the next generation.
152
Part III: What Evolution Does 
The art of testing evolutionary theories
Biologists often perform experiments to test
evolutionary theories. People often wonder
how this is possible, because they think that
evolution is supposed to take a really long time.
The answer is evolution can take a long time,
but it doesn’t have to. The trick is picking the
right organisms — ones that live fast and die
soon. Insects, for example, can be good exper-
imental subjects, but elephants — not so good. 
You need organisms with very short life spans so
that you can squeeze in as many generations as
possible. These organisms should also be small,
so that it’s easy to keep large numbers of them,
and they should be easy to raise in a laboratory.
Fruit flies (often, the species Drosophila melan-
ogaster) meet these criteria nicely.
Laboratory experiments replace natural selec-
tion with artificial selection, which means that
the experimenter — not nature — decides what
traits will increase an organism’s chance of con-
tributing to the next generation. This replace-
ment is done for many generations, and the
researchers track how the organisms change in
response to the laboratory selection regime.
Humans have actually been using artificial selec-
tion for thousands of years. It’s how we make dif-
ferent breeds of dogs, cows that give more milk,
and roses that are more resistant to pests.

After just 15 generations (15 transfers of eggs to new containers), Rose measured
the life span of flies from the 10 populations and found that the flies from the
populations selected for later reproduction lived an average of 20 percent
longer than flies transferred every 14 days! By increasing the importance of
events later in life, Rose had increased the strength of selection at later ages;
as a result, the flies evolved to live longer.
Selection experiments always compare a control group of organisms with an
experimental group. The experimental group experiences the artificial selection
regimen, and the control group doesn’t. In all other ways, both sets of organisms
are treated exactly the same; they are kept in the same lab environment, han-
dled by the same people, and so on. This technique eliminates doubt that any
interesting results are caused by the artificial selection, not by some random
factor (such as how hot the lab was that summer). As a further precaution,
the same experiment with the same control treatments are performed many
times. In experimental science, unless something happens several times, it
doesn’t really happen at all.
Testing for metabolic trade-offs
With the two different groups of flies that he created in his life-span experiment,
Rose tested the theory that metabolic trade-offs are involved in life-history
evolution. Rose and his co-workers set out to look for evidence of these
trade-offs in their selected flies. Here’s what they found:
 The longer-lived flies had increased storage reserves of fats and carbo-
hydrates compared with the control flies. 
 The longer-lived flies had lower fecundity (lifetime reproductive potential)
and devoted less energy to the production of eggs than the control flies did. 
Bottom line: Rose’s experiment produced evidence of the predicted life-history
trade-offs: The longer-lived flies spent more energy on living and less on
reproducing.
The Trade-Off between Survival 
and Reproduction
From a fitness perspective, the best (that is, most “fit”) reproductive scenario
is one in which the organism begins to reproduce early and often, and all the
offspring survive. But that’s not the way it happens in nature, mainly because
of the trade-offs between survival and reproduction. The resources required
for survival are resources that aren’t available for reproduction, and the
resources necessary for reproduction aren’t available for survival. So when
153
Chapter 10: The Evolution of Life History

and how often an organism reproduces, and how many offspring it produces,
are the results of trade-offs that give that organism the best chance for sending
its genes into the future.
You find various life histories in nature. Some organisms produce over and over
again; some produce a few times throughout their lives; and some produce a
single time and then die (perhaps the most extreme case of putting all your
eggs in one basket!). Each species evolved in a way that allowed it to persist
in its physical environment. 
It’s good to reproduce often,
except when it’s not
Organisms that reproduce several times — humans, birds, and numerous other
creatures — are called iteroparous. Organisms that reproduce only once are
called semelparous. Semelparity is the most extreme example of the trade-off
between survival and reproduction. The salmon is one example of a semelparous
organism. After swimming back to the spawning ground where it was born, a
salmon devotes every last ounce of its energy to reproduction; then it dies.
Two classes of environmental conditions lead to selection favoring the
“reproduce once and die” genes:
 When getting a second chance to reproduce is pretty much impossible
 When some particular condition of the environment makes the reproductive
payoff for reproducing once and then dying much greater than the payoff
for reproducing over several years
The following sections examine these scenarios.
One chance to make good
Reproducing just once before dying is the fittest thing to do when the odds of
making it to the next reproductive season are very low. 
After dodging all those bears and jumping all those waterfalls on the way to
the spawning grounds, the friendly salmon is pretty lucky to have made it at
all. If a gene appeared that made the salmon produce fewer offspring, with
the expectation that it would swim back out to sea to feed again so it could
reproduce more the following year, the fish would leave some descendents,
but the odds of its leaving any more are fairly low. Instead, it might die as it
tried to make it to the spawning grounds a second time. For this reason, this
particular “produce less now so you can produce more later” gene isn’t very
likely to increase through time. In fact, from what scientists know about the
154
Part III: What Evolution Does 

risks facing the salmon, it makes sense that they don’t see salmon with this
strategy. Salmon are wonderful examples of the “reproduce once and die”
strategy, but they aren’t the only ones.
Lots of different organisms have a pretty low chance of making it from one
reproductive season to the next. For many of these organisms, the culprit
isn’t anything nearly as picturesque as cascading waterfalls and hungry
predators; it’s the rather mundane reality of living in a seasonal world. 
Imagine some tiny plant in the desert that’s managed to germinate and grow
during the wettest part of the year. If that plant is to have any chance of leaving
descendents, it has to do it fast, while it still has enough water to survive.
Because the adult plants can’t make it to the hottest part of the year, they
devote all their energy to reproduction, producing seeds that can withstand
drought and soaring temperatures and that will germinate during the next
rainy season.
Big payoff for a one-shot deal
Most semelparous organisms — those annual desert plants, for example —
are relatively short lived. They gather the resources they need to reproduce
and get on with it. Other very long-lived semelparous species could reproduce
earlier but don’t; they just hang out, continuing to grow and acquire resources,
all the while taking the chance that they’ll die before they get around to
reproducing. You can see the potential down side of this strategy. So what’s
the advantage?
Although the details vary from case to case, the bottom line is that peculiarities
in the ecology of a particular species result in a disproportionate benefit to
having a big bang in reproduction that outweigh the risks. The risk is big, but
the payoff is also big, big enough that the genes for hanging back and stocking
up are favored.
One of the best-known examples of this pattern is the blue agave (Agave
tequilana), the plant from which we distill tequila. The blue agave has a very
high rate of year-to-year survival yet exhibits a life-history pattern of semel-
parous reproduction. (Although most agaves behave in a similar fashion,
iteroparous agaves exist as well, but they’re rare.)
When the blue agave finally decides to reproduce, it reallocates all its energy
to reproduction and then dies. The selective pressures on this agave are
different in nature from the pressures on the small annual desert plants 
growing all around. The little plants have to reproduce once because they
can’t survive the heat of the summer. The agave, on the other hand, can survive
just fine in the summer, but it still has a greater chance of getting its genes into
the next generation if it devotes all its energy to reproducing just one time.
155
Chapter 10: The Evolution of Life History

The reason has to do with a peculiarity of agave reproduction. The agave
needs something that’s in short supply: pollinators, which are animals that
move pollen to and from other agaves so that the plant can make seeds.
When an agave reproduces, it makes a flower stalk. These stalks can be huge,
reaching 25 feet in height. The agave uses every last bit of energy it has to
make the largest, most visible floral display possible — a good plan, given
that pollinators preferentially go to the most visible spike. If your spike is
only half as big as another, you get fewer than half as many pollinators. 
An agave with a gene that produced the trait of making a smaller spike and
surviving until next year to make another smaller spike eventually would be
eliminated from the population. Although that particular agave would keep
surviving, it wouldn’t make as many seeds because it wouldn’t be as attrac-
tive to the animals that pollinate agaves.
Early vs. later reproduction: Why wait?
An important component of an organism’s life history is the way that the life
span is divided between the pre-reproductive and the reproductive periods —
or, in more common terms, between the time spent as a juvenile and the time
spent as an adult. When scientists look at nature, they see a huge variation in
the ages at which different organisms mature and become reproductive. Some
organisms reproduce at very young ages; others wait until they are much
older. Once again, organisms can do the same thing in many ways — in this
case, producing offspring.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you may think that the best strategy for
promulgating genes would be reproducing early, making a lot of offspring,
and doing all that for a very long time. But studies of the natural environment
show that it’s not possible to do everything well.
When it comes to reproduction and getting your genes into the next generation,
it’s not just how soon you can make the first offspring, but the total offspring
you can produce throughout your lifetime. An organism that waits a little bit
longer to get started but makes many more offspring than an organism that
started earlier will have a greater effect on the genetic makeup of the next
generation — that is, a higher proportion of organisms in the next generation
will carry its genes.
The following list outlines the advantages and disadvantages of both strategies:
 Reproducing early: The benefits of early reproduction seem obvious.
Genes involved in early reproduction will make it into the next generation
that much faster. All other things being equal, earlier reduction would
always be better than later reproduction. But early reproduction creates
problems, the main one being that producing early saps the energy an
organism needs for survival and growth.
156
Part III: What Evolution Does 

 Reproducing later: An organism that delays reproduction has more
resources to devote to survival than an organism that reproduces early.
In addition, large organisms are often much better at making offspring
than smaller organisms; they can produce more or healthier offspring.
So it seems that some types of organisms get a real payoff from devoting
energy to growth early in life and waiting until it’s more efficient to begin
reproducing.
In comparing the two strategies, it certainly appears that the better reproduc-
tive strategy is to wait until the organism is large enough to make many more
offspring. In turn, these offspring should overwhelm the descendents of the
individuals that reproduce early, which are wasting precious energy to maximize
their reproductive output. But one pesky problem occurs: During the time
that an organism is devoting energy to growth rather than reproduction, it
could die, leaving no descendents. So which strategy is better: early or later
reproduction? The answer is that it depends.
Scientists’ understanding of evolution by natural selection suggests that as
the risk of mortality increases, organisms evolve to reproduce earlier. Genes
connected with early reproduction are favored and are more likely to make it
to the next generation. Organisms with genes that result in later reproduction
have a good chance of dying before they reproduce; as a result, these genes
are not favored.
Proving the point with guppies
David Resnick and co-workers set up an experiment in a natural environment
to examine how altering the likelihood of surviving at different life stages
could lead to evolutionary change in life-history parameters, such as when to
start reproducing. Resnick conducted his experiments with naturally occur-
ring guppies in a series of streams on the island of Trinidad. The goal of the
experiment was to see whether changing the relative importance of mortality
for juveniles and adults would lead to changes in the guppies’ life history.
Specifically, Resnick wanted to see whether guppies’ reproductive patterns,
such as age at maturity, would change if their risk of death changed.
The setup
The basic structure of the experiment was to figure out some way in nature
to tinker with the survival chances of the fish. Resnick made use of a few
things he knew about guppies in Trinidadian streams:
 The major cause of mortality for guppies is getting eaten by two other
types of fish. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll call these species the big predator
and the little predator. Although both species eat guppies, they prefer
different sizes: The little predator likes to eat little guppies, and the big
predator likes to eat big guppies.
157
Chapter 10: The Evolution of Life History

 Different places in streams have different assortments of fish. Some
guppies live in areas of a stream that have a large predator; other guppies
live in areas that have a little predator; and some places in streams don’t
have any guppies. In other words, the distribution of fish is uneven. Some
guppies live in a low-predation environment where the adult guppies are
less threatened because only the little predator lives there. Other guppies
live in a high-predation environment with a big predator that’s very fond
of eating adult guppies.
The reason for these variations is that in Trinidad, many streams run
down hills steep enough to produce waterfalls. Because fish can’t get up
waterfalls easily, the waterfalls effectively keep them from moving from
one place to the next.
 The guppies in the different habitats had different characteristics.
Resnick noticed that guppies living in the low-predation environments
have different life-history characteristics from guppies living in high-
predation environments:
• In the low-predation environment, guppies reproduced at a later age,
when they were larger. They were able to invest energy in growth
and survival that ultimately delayed reproduction — a successful
strategy in the absence of a big predator. When these guppies made
it to adult size, they had a reduced chance of being eaten.
• In the high-predation environments, the guppies reproduced earlier,
when they were smaller. This strategy could be the result of predation
pressure from the large fish. Delaying reproduction to a later date,
when you’re a bigger fish, isn’t advantageous if you have a good
likelihood of being eaten before you make any offspring. As the
chance of being eaten increases, so does the selective pressure for
early reproduction.
What Resnick saw was consistent with scientists’ understanding of life-history
evolution. As the chance of not making it to an older age increases, so does
the advantage of reproducing earlier. Even better, not only were the results
consistent with hypotheses about the evolution of reproductive life history,
but this natural system was ready-made to test these ideas in nature.
The experiment
Resnick found places in the streams that had little predators but neither big
predators nor guppies. He proceeded to move guppies that had been coexist-
ing with big predators into this new environment, where they had to contend
with only a little predator. (To be sure that other fish wouldn’t swim into his
experimental areas, Resnick chose study locations in parts of the stream
separated by waterfalls.)
158
Part III: What Evolution Does 

After moving the fish, he waited to see how the guppies would evolve. If the
pattern of early reproduction he observed among guppies in the presence of
the big predator was due to increased predation pressure, moving the guppies
to the different environment might result in the evolution of later reproduction.
After 4 years in one experiment and 11 years in another, here’s what he
found: The populations that were moved from a high-predation environment
evolved their life-history characteristics in the expected direction. That is,
the fish devoted more energy early in life to growth and less to reproduction.
As a result, they were larger when they first reproduced.
Determining whether the changes were heritable
To determine whether the changes were heritable — that is, genetic and
therefore capable of being passed from one generation to the next — and not
the result of some environmental factor, such as different food or different water
chemicals in the various streams, Resnick took back to his laboratory some
guppies from the old population that was living with the large predatory fish
and some guppies from the experimental population that had been living
with just the little predators. In the lab, he grew the guppies separately for
several generations in identical fish tanks, to eliminate any effects due to the
environment rather than the fishes’ genes.
159
Chapter 10: The Evolution of Life History
Natural settings vs. labs
The advantage of conducting artificial selection
experiments in the laboratory is that it’s possi-
ble to control all the variables of the experiment.
The experimenters can change just one thing,
hold everything else constant, and then see
what the result of changing that one thing was.
The goal of any experiment is to change as few
things as possible so that when it’s time to ana-
lyze the results, a lot of confusing questions
won’t be asked, such as exactly what caused
those results. Another advantage of the labora-
tory is that it is easy to repeat the experiment to
make sure of getting the same result a second
time. The disadvantage, of course, is that labo-
ratory experiments are always open to criticism
that whatever happened in the laboratory does-
n’t really happen in nature. (For an example of a
laboratory experiment, refer to “Methuselah
flies: The evolution of life span in the laboratory”
earlier in this chapter.)
Experiments conducted in nature overcome this
problem. Any effects that are measured are
obviously the result of natural processes. For
this reason, they are important for developing
scientists’ understanding of how evolution func-
tions in the wild. It’s exciting to see that over a
relatively short period, natural selection can
lead to changes in populations. But this advan-
tage comes at a cost: Changing just one thing is
rarely possible. Controlling for all the variables
is impossible, so natural experiments will
always be open to criticism that the results
were caused not by whatever the experimenter
was manipulating but by something else.
Which type of experiment is better? Actually, nei-
ther. Researchers need laboratory experiments
in which they can alter just a few things at a time,
but they also need experiments in the field,
where they can make some manipulations, let
nature take its course, and see what happens.

What Resnick found was that the fish really were genetically different. The
fish from the low-predation experiment really had become different geneti-
cally from the original population. They spent more energy growing and
reproduced later than the original population. The fish had indeed evolved.
One fish, two fish, small fish, adieu fish: The evolution of overfishing
Understanding life-history evolution can help researchers understand some
of the changes in major fisheries, where commercial fishing has made
humans the major predator.
Different kinds of fish grow to different sizes, based on what’s most advanta-
geous in their environment: Tuna get really big; trout so big. A fish’s life his-
tory involves growing for a while and then spending energy on reproduction.
Natural selection favors variants that get the details right: Reproduce at too
early or too late an age, and you won’t be as successful as the fish that repro-
duces at just the right time. So the basic strategy is to grow, grow, grow until
the point when it’s better to start reproducing rather than growing some
more. Bottom line: Fish in nature grow to some particular size because that’s
a good size to be as far as getting your genes into the next population. 
Now along comes the fisherman, who sets out some fishing nets to catch fish.
These nets aren’t designed to catch just any fish, but bigger fish, and they’re
so effective that that they often cause a noticeable decline in the numbers of
fish in the ocean. The fish numbers become so depleted that the fisheries stop
or reduce their operations, with the intent of giving the fish stocks a chance to
recover. Sounds all well and good, but guess what? The stocks don’t recover as
quickly as expected. Even after a lull, the big fish that the nets catch just aren’t
there.
Why not? What’s happened is that a new selective force has been added to
the environment. All of a sudden, being a fish of the size that gets caught in
those nets is bad. What used to be a good size for getting your genes into the
next-generation is now a good size for getting your genes grilled and covered
with a nice lemon dill sauce. 
Scientists and conservationists hypothesize that, in the past, before commercial
fishing, genes for reaching adulthood at a smaller size hadn’t been favored. To
best survive a life in the ocean, fish evolved to grow to a sufficient size and
then reproduce. Commercial fishing add a new selective pressure that makes
it better to be a smaller fish. Their nets don’t just physically remove the big
fish from the population, but they also remove the genetic variants that result
in larger fish, leaving only those that don’t grow so big. Although being smaller
may not be great as far as life in the ocean is concerned, it’s the best thing
going. Fish that don’t grow big enough to get caught in the nets will pass
160
Part III: What Evolution Does 

more genes to the next generation. The result is a population of fish that just
doesn’t get so big. They reach adulthood at a smaller size and start devoting
energy to reproduction. Just because we stop fishing doesn’t mean that all
the little fish that are left will grow up to be bigger fish; they’ve already grown
up. And this is an explanation for why fisheries stocks don’t rebound when
we reduce the fishing pressure.
Evidence from natural fisheries suggests that the fish humans harvest have
indeed shifted to earlier reproduction and smaller adult size. Northern cod
populations, for example, exhibited a decline in the size at which females
became reproductive before the collapse of the fishery. 
To test the hypothesis that fish will evolve to be smaller if mortality at large
sizes is increased, Matthew Walsh and coworkers conducted an experiment
using laboratory populations of Atlantic silverside. They set up three different
treatments and harvested fish differently in each one. From the control tanks
they took a random sample of fish, from the other tanks they took large
individuals — a protocol that mimics fishing. (To find out about the third
treatment, read the sidebar “Fishin’ for a small one.”)
All the populations started out exactly the same — a bunch of wild fish in tanks.
Over five generations, the fish populations responded to the new selective
pressure. The results were exactly what the researchers had predicted. When
large fish are more likely to be harvested from a population, the advantage of
alleles that cause fish to grow large decreases. These alleles are less likely to
make it into the next-generation while alleles that result in smaller size now
have higher fitness. These changes will cause the fish to be smaller, and that’s
exactly what happened. Selection favoring small fish over large ones resulted
in fish that just don’t grow as big. These changes included differences in
metabolic efficiency, foraging, and even the number of vertebrae.
161
Chapter 10: The Evolution of Life History
Fishin’ for a small one
Walsh and his coworkers also had a treatment
from which they removed the smallest fish,
which is not something any fisherman—com-
mercial or otherwise—ever does when actually
fishing for food, but it’s a nice experiment
anyway because the prediction is that remov-
ing the smaller individuals would cause the fish
to spend less of their lives at the smaller size.
Alleles that caused the fish to grow really fast
would be favored because they’d be less likely
to be removed from the tank by the experi-
menters. It’s bad to be a small fish, and the only
way to not be a small fish is to grow. The result
of this treatment was bigger fish.

Figure 10-1 shows the result of Walsh’s experiment. The fish on the right
came from the population from which the largest fish were harvested. In the
center are fish from the control tank. On the left are fish that came from the
population from which small fish were harvested (see the sidebar “Fishin’ for
a small one for details on this part of the experiment).

The take-home message is two-fold:
 Over-fishing is bad for all the reasons we used to think it was, plus it’s
bad because the study of the evolution of fish suggests that fish stocks
won’t bounce back to include a large individuals as fast as we’d like them
to if we stop fishing. We used to think that if we stopped fishing, the little
fish we hadn’t caught would grow up to be big fish. Now we have the
added worry that we’ve selected for fish that don’t grow up to be big.
 The remaining fish may not be as well adapted to their environment as
they would have been had they not had to respond to fishing pressure.
Fish that reach maturity at the smaller size are favored when there are
lots of nets, but that may be the only thing good about a smaller size.
The smaller size wasn’t favored before fishing, and it may just not be a
very good size with respect to doing all the things fish have to do to
survive in the ocean.

Part III: What Evolution Does 

The trade-off between size 
and number of offspring
Just as a huge variation exists in life span and reproductive timing among
organisms, a huge variation exists in fecundity and in clutch size, the number
of offspring an organism produces at any one time. Trade-offs come into play
here as well. 
For any given amount of resources devoted to reproduction, the pie can be
divided in many ways. (For fun, call this division resource partitioning among
offspring.) It comes down to the question of whether a species produces lots
of little offspring or fewer bigger ones. Human clutch size, for example, tends
to be one, despite rare cases of twins or triplets, and total lifetime fecundity
rarely exceeds ten. But a sturgeon — the kind of fish from which we get caviar —
can easily make 60,000 eggs at a time. That figure makes humans look pretty
pathetic in comparison until you consider that the human pattern seems to
be successful; an awful lot of humans are around, and our numbers just keep
going up.
What explains the huge differences in fecundity, and why haven’t sturgeon
taken over the world? The number of offspring produced is important, but so
is the probability that these offspring survive to reproduce themselves. Any
gene that results in the production of a huge number of offspring, but none of
which ended up making any offspring of its own, wouldn’t last very long. The
gene’s frequency would increase for an instant, but by the time of the grand-
child generation, it would be gone.
As always, organisms go about producing fit offspring in many ways, favoring
different strategies in different environments. Specific conditions favor different
clutch sizes. Parental care — or the lack thereof — also has an impact, as the
following sections explain.
Without parental care
Not all organisms have a reproductive strategy that includes parental care.
Sturgeons, for example, don’t care for their young. After they release their eggs,
they hit the road, leaving the eggs to fend for themselves. For these organisms,
the question becomes how best to use the available resources for egg production
to maximize the number of successful offspring. The organism can make a few
large eggs or many small eggs. Whether big eggs or little eggs are best (or the
most fit, in evolution-speak) depends on the environment the eggs will face.
At minimum, the egg needs to have sufficient resources to develop into a
juvenile. Although an individual offspring’s survival is increased if more than
the minimum resources are provided, the parents’ fitness depends on 
163
Chapter 10: The Evolution of Life History

producing the maximum number of surviving offspring. Bottom line: How
hostile or welcoming the environment is affects how much energy the par-
ents invest in each individual offspring. Some environments result in a little
extra provisioning of fewer eggs, but when the environment is hostile enough to
make it unlikely for any particular offspring to reach maturity, the parents are
better off spreading the risk among many eggs rather than investing a great
deal of energy in each individual egg. The result? Smaller but more plentiful
eggs.
This pattern occurs in sturgeons (60,000 eggs at a time, remember?) and in
the plants commonly referred to as weeds, which tend to make large num-
bers of very small seeds that disperse through the environment. Where the
seeds end up — whether in your freshly turned garden or in the middle of the
highway — is anyone’s guess. The point is they’re scattered in the wind and
have a low probability of survival.
Oak trees employ a different strategy. Although an individual tree makes lots
of seeds, these seeds are quite large by plant standards. An oak tree doesn’t
make the maximum number of very small seeds; instead, it prepares the seeds —
acorns — with a larger number of maternal resources. Acorns don’t disperse
very far from their mother plant. Instead, they tend to fall on the forest floor
under a tree’s canopy, and they need enough energy to sprout. With a little luck,
they’ll have a chance of getting big enough to gather enough light to survive.
If the oak tree made just very small seeds, none would survive, because they
would never have the energy to get big enough in the dark canopy of the oak
forest. Thus, the environment facing the offspring of the oak tree favors genes
for larger seeds, whereas the environment facing the weed seeds favors small
seeds.
With parental care
In the cases where natural selection favors organisms that provide parental
care, it doesn’t make any sense to produce more offspring than the parents
can care for at any one time, because the parents continue to provide
resources to the offspring after birth or hatching.
A fair number of studies have been conducted on why birds lay the number
of eggs they do. The naturally occurring variation in the number of eggs pro-
duced gives scientists a sense of the optimal number for any particular
species. 
Ideally, the birds would produce exactly the number of offspring that they
could feed well enough so that the offspring would survive and reproduce,
passing the parents’ genes into the future. What researchers find when they
look at natural patterns, however, is a point in the number of eggs produced
at which laying more eggs results in fewer surviving baby birds. The number
of eggs that birds lay seems to cluster around this ideal number.
164
Part III: What Evolution Does 

For an interesting case of how parental care can limit clutch size, think back
to the emperor penguin. Penguin parents care for their single egg in a unique
way: Dad balances the egg on his feet to keep it off the ice while Mom goes off
to catch fish. Maybe the daddy penguin could balance a bigger egg or a smaller
one, but it’s not clear how he could balance two at the same time. Because no
nest-building materials are available in Antarctica, an emperor penguin can’t
have more than one egg at a time.
Why Age?
Organisms often seem to undergo a gradual breakdown before death — a
process referred to as aging. Because aging, like death, seems to be a bad
idea, you may think that natural selection would favor individuals that age
less. Unfortunately (for humans), it doesn’t. 
The process of aging turns out to be consistent with scientists’ understand-
ing of how evolution works. You may think natural selection would eliminate
genes that make people age, but natural selection won’t eliminate certain
classes of genes that cause aging, either because the detrimental effects of
these genes don’t show up until later or because the gene that causes aging
offers some benefit earlier:
 Bad genes that act later in life: Selection acts less strongly on traits that
are expressed late in life. Natural selection certainly won’t favor any
genes that cause the aches and pains of old age, but it can’t select
against them either. Long before the traits appear and can be noticed by
selection, the genes that control them have already been passed to the
next generation.
 Genes that are bad later in life but good when you’re younger: Natural
selection favors genes that have beneficial effects when the organism is
younger, even if these same genes are responsible for old age. The
reason? Selection is stronger earlier in life. It doesn’t matter what the
genes do when you’re old, because by then, you’ve already passed them
to your children.
The two classes of genes are not mutually exclusive, and evidence exists that
both types of genes are involved in the process of aging. Yippee.

Part III: What Evolution Does 
Conducting a thought experiment
If you’re finding it a bit tricky to keep track of all
these hypothetical classes of genes, try consid-
ering more specific examples. Conduct a
thought experiment: Imagine a specific gene,
and then try to figure out whether natural selec-
tion will favor it, select against it, or remain neu-
tral. If you want to try to understand aging, for
example, imagine the fate of a series of genes
that does exactly the same thing, but at differ-
ent times in the organism’s life. In this way, you
can get a better handle on how the frequencies
of genes that act at different ages change in
response to natural selection. Start with an
easy one — say a gene the causes sponta-
neous combustion — and let your mind play
with the ideas from there:
 Imagine a gene that causes people to spon-
taneously combust at age 10. What happens
to people with this gene? It’s safe to say that
they won’t be making a lot of offspring, so
extremely strong selection will be against
this gene. Because this gene causes death
before reproductive age, it will be eliminated
from the population as fast as new mutations
make it appear. In other words, the genetic
lifeguard says, “You’re out of the gene pool!”
 How about a gene that makes people spon-
taneously combust at age 150? In this case,
natural selection will never see the trait.
None of us makes it to 150, so no one would
ever go up in flames. This gene is completely
neutral, and if it appeared in one of your chil-
dren, you’d never even know it. Whether or
not it increases in frequency depends only
on whether your child has more or fewer
children. Because the “combust at 150”
gene has no effect on fitness, it’s selectively
neutral — just along for the ride.
 How about spontaneous combustion at 60?
This, you’d notice. Would it make you less
fit? Not really. By the time you’re 60, you’ve
pretty much finished passing on your genes.
This gene wouldn’t help you reproduce more,
but it wouldn’t hurt you, either — unless you
happen to be one of the occasional people
who burst into flames. Hence, the “combust
at 60” mutation is also selectively neutral.
 How about a gene that made you sponta-
neously combust at age 60 but also made
you much more likely to have lots of chil-
dren? This gene increases your fitness
because it increases your contribution to
the next generation. Natural selection
causes this gene to increase in frequency.
These last two categories of genes are the
kinds of genes that would be responsible for the
phenomena of aging. The negative effects of
these genes occur only late in life, after they’ve
already been passed to the next generation. In
the last example, selection will cause the gene
to increase in the population because it’s
advantageous early, even though it’s really bad
later.
Now step back from the example of sponta-
neous combustion, and think about some of the
more real examples of things associated with
aging. Nothing about your eyes failing or your
knees getting creaky is at odds with the mech-
anism of evolution by natural selection. By the
time those phenomena start to occur, you’re
probably finished reproducing. There may be
better ways to build an eye or a knee, but nat-
ural selection won’t favor those methods unless
they have value earlier in life.
One last important note: Zero evidence exists
that spontaneous human combustion really
happens. It’s in the same category as ESP and
Roswell aliens. But just coincidentally, most of
the people who are said to have spontaneously
combusted were older than 60.

 Making fitness inclusive

 Evolving altruism
T
hroughout this book, I emphasize the importance of evolution acting on
individuals. Why? Because the individual is far and away the most impor-
tant unit on which selection acts. But natural selection doesn’t act only on
individuals. Sometimes selection acts at other levels. This chapter explores
levels of selection: the power of natural selection to act on genes and groups.
Understanding the levels of selection is important in trying to fathom some of
the behavior you see in nature. Some organisms, for example, don’t reproduce.
Others delay reproduction. Some behave altruistically toward others (giving
up their own stores of food, for example, to prevent another organism from
starving). In these systems, something besides individual selection is probably
going on.
Inclusive Fitness and Kin Selection
Evolutionary fitness is a measure of how good an organism is at getting its
genes into future generations. One way for an organism to get its genes into
future generations is to make lots of offspring, which go out and make lots of
offspring themselves, and so on and so forth. But another way for an organism
to get its genes into the next generation is to help its relatives get their genes
into the next generation — which is the main idea behind inclusive fitness
and kin selection.

Your fitness + your relatives’ fitness =
inclusive fitness
Inclusive fitness is simply the sum of an individual’s fitness plus the additional
benefits accrued through increasing the fitness of related individuals. In
English: You’re more fit not only if you reproduce, but also if relatives who
share your genes reproduce, too.
Here’s a simple example of inclusive fitness in action: Helping your identical
twin sister have a baby that she would not have been able to have without
your help is just as good a way to pass on your genes to the next generation
as having a baby of your own. Most humans aren’t one half of an identical
pair, of course. To understand how inclusive fitness works in more common
situations, you need to understand a concept called degree of relatedness,
which simply means how many of your genes you share with others.
For sexually reproducing organisms (such as humans, antelope, or titmice),
the degree of relatedness is as follows:
 Between parents and offspring: One half of an individual’s genes come
from its mother and half come from its father. The degree of relatedness
between parent (mother or father) and offspring is one half (or 0.5).
 To full siblings (individuals that have the same mother and father):
Full siblings, on average, have half their genes in common. The degree of
relatedness is 0.5.
 To half siblings (individuals that have either the same mother or the
same father): Half siblings, on average, have one quarter of their genes
in common. The degree of relatedness is 0.25.
 To your siblings’ children: The degree of relatedness between you and
any of your nieces and nephews is on average one quarter (0.25),
because you share one half of your genes with your sibling, and that sibling
shares half of his or her genes with his or her offspring.
So how many offspring do you have to help your siblings make to equal one
of your own offspring? If you’re an identical twin (that is, you and your twin
have a degree of relatedness of 1.0 because you have exactly the same genes),
helping her (or him) make an additional baby is just as good as making one of
your own as far as your fitness is concerned. But if you’re helping a non-
identical full sibling reproduce at the expense of your own reproduction, to
come out even you’d have to help produce at least two nieces or nephews for
every one son or daughter you could have created yourself.
168
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Not reproducing to help your 
family: Kin selection
Nearly everything about evolution by natural selection involves some sort of
cost-benefit analysis. Is the cost of the mutation offset by its benefit? Does
having an elaborate tail help you more than hurt you? Natural selection favors
the trait that confers the most benefit from a fitness perspective, meaning
that traits that enhance your ability to get your genes into the next generation
increase in frequency in subsequent generations.
The situation is no different for reproduction. If, for some reason, you were
unable to produce any offspring of your own, helping produce even one extra
niece or nephew would still enable you to get some of your genes into the next
generation. Or if by forgoing producing a single offspring of your own, you were
able to help produce three nieces or nephews who would not otherwise have
existed, you come out ahead, evolutionarily speaking. 
Because the cost (the single offspring that you did not produce who would
have shared half of your genes) is less than the benefit (the three nieces or
nephews who each share one quarter of your genes), natural selection will favor
helping your sibling reproduce. For this reason, genes that are responsible
for behaviors that help relatives reproduce can increase in frequency even if
they decrease individual fitness as long as they increase inclusive fitness.
This type of selective force is called kin selection.
The concept of kin selection explains many of the altruistic behaviors that
Charles Darwin found confusing. For Darwin, who lacked modern knowledge
of genetics, it wasn’t as obvious how helping a related individual could be
advantageous to the helper.
169
Chapter 11: Units of Selection and the Evolution of Social Behavior 
It’s a salamander-eat-salamander world
David Pfennig raised tiger salamander larvae in
groups with and without siblings. Tiger sala-
manders are cannibalistic. For a tiger salaman-
der, eating one of your own kind is good if it
increases your chance of getting your genes
into the next generation — but not as good if the
one you eat has your genes.
In the study, Pfennig raised his salamanders in
groups of full siblings, half siblings, and unre-
lated individuals. The results: Full siblings were
least likely to cannibalize their neighbors, and
unrelated individuals were most likely. Half-sib-
ling groups were in between.
The result makes sense from the standpoint of
inclusive fitness and kin selection. Genes that
allow a salamander to tell kin from stranger (and
to avoid eating the kin) appear to have been
selectively favored.

Levels of Selection
In individual selection, some individuals survive to reproduce, and some don’t.
If the differences in survival and reproduction are the result of particular
genes, these genes will increase in frequency in the next generation. Group
selection theory adds another evolutionary layer to this tidy little setup. The
idea is that in addition to selection at the individual level, selection can also
occur at the group level. (You can even think of kin selection as an example of
group selection where the group is the family.)
Evolutionary scientists have also become aware that selection can act at the
level of the gene, beyond the forces of individual or group selection. Essentially,
this theory recognizes that occasionally, certain genes increase in frequency
simply because they’ve got a better-than-average chance of getting into the
gamete during reproduction, regardless of the negative effect they may have
on the offspring.
Group selection
According to group selection theory, some genes have an effect at the level of
the group. Genes that act at the group level affect survival and reproduction
between groups in such a way that some groups leave descendants and other
groups don’t. Think about a gene for getting along nicely with other people,
for example. If selection acts at the group level, a get-along-with-others gene
may increase in frequency if groups of people who have this gene are more
successful than groups of people who don’t have this gene.
As you wrap your brain around group selection, keep these points in mind:
 Group selection, when it occurs, acts in addition to selection at the level
of the individual. Selection still occurs at the level of the individual.
 Selection at the level of the individual could act in the same direction as
selection at the level of the group or in a different direction. For evolu-
tionary biologists, the most intriguing cases are those where different
levels of selection conflict and as a result are of considerable interest.
 Group selection can be important when the population structure of the
species involves interacting groups.
Flour beetles: A group selection example
Michael Wade set up a laboratory experiment to investigate group selection
with the goal of showing that it occurs. In his experiment, Wade used flour
beetles — little insects that are happy to grow and reproduce in a vial of
flour. They eat flour, but they’re also cannibalistic: Adult beetles eat larvae
and eggs, and the larvae eat eggs.
170
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Wade set up four experimental treatments, each consisting of 48 populations
of beetles. For each population, he allowed 16 individual beetles to grow and
reproduce for 37 days. Then he took 16 individuals from each of these popu-
lations, put them in new vials of flour, and allowed them to grow for 37 days.
He continued in this way until he had the number of populations he needed.
What differed between the populations in the various treatments was the factor
that Wade selected for. For his experiment, he decided that population size — a
group rather than an individual characteristic — would be the favored
characteristic:
 Treatment 1 (the control treatment). In this treatment, individual selection
was the key. For the control group, Wade randomly picked 16 beetles from
a population to start the next flask. As a result, individual beetles that
were more successful at reproducing were more likely to have offspring —
and, hence, their genes — in the next generation. (If you make twice as
many offspring as the next beetle, you have twice the chance of getting
some children into the next generation.)
Individual selection is always happening, so scientists can study group
selection only by keeping track of individual selection at the same time
and then comparing the results from the group selection treatments to
the individual selection control treatment. The control group is the one
in which selection acts at the individual level.
 Treatment 2 (a group selection treatment selected for large population
size). Wade created his new populations by using beetles from only the
biggest populations.
 Treatment 3 (a group selection treatment selected for a low population
size). Wade used only individuals from the smallest populations to found
new populations.
Treatments 2 and 3 represent group selection, because not all beetles in
all vials contribute to the next generation — only those that meet the
selection criteria (in the experiment, either large or small group size).
You could be a really fit beetle in your particular vial (that is, a dispro-
portionate number of the offspring are yours), but if you exist in a popu-
lation that isn’t large (or small) enough to be used, none of your genes
get into the next generation.
Here’s what Wade found: The original beetle stock used in this experiment
generated population sizes of about 200 beetles after 37 days. But after nine
generations, population size decreased in all his treatments. Population
dropped in the control treatment (individual selection); it decreased more in
the group selection treatment for small populations and less in the group
selection treatment for large populations. The following sections explain why.
171
Chapter 11: Units of Selection and the Evolution of Social Behavior 

In the control treatment (Treatment 1)
In this case, selection was acting at the level of the individual. Whatever herita-
ble traits increased the chance of a beetle’s having descendents in the next
generation increased in frequency. It just so happened that as a result of this
selection on individuals, population size decreased from about 200 beetles in
the stock population to 50 beetles after 9 generations. Although that result
may seem odd, keep in mind what these beetles like to eat: flour and baby
beetles (those in the larval and egg stages). Essentially, this treatment selected
for beetles that were more voracious cannibals.
In Treatment 2 (group selection favoring large population size)
In this treatment, population size had decreased after nine generations, but
not as much as in Treatment 1 (the individual selection control). Selection at
the level of the group for larger population size had an effect in the opposite
direction of selection at the level of the individual.
Selection at different levels can act in the same direction or in a different
direction. If selection acts in the same direction, it compounds the effect; if it
acts in a different direction, it mitigates the effect.
In Treatment 3 (selection favoring groups with small populations size)
In this treatment, population size decreased even more than in the control
population. Selection at the level of the individual and selection at the level of
the group each had an effect on population size, and these effects were in the
same direction. After 9 generations of selection, the population had
decreased from 200 beetles to 19.
Selecting for nicer chickens: Applications of group selection
Although group selection can seem awfully technical, it has practical applica-
tions. Take, for example, egg production. A great deal of effort has gone into
producing chickens that lay lots of eggs. Historically, farmers have tackled
the problem at the level of the individual chicken. The chicken breeder would
found the next population with the descendants of the most prodigious egg-
layers. The strategy was successful: Chickens can lay 100 eggs a year.
Here’s a little bit of detail that you should know about chickens. They don’t
live isolated lives on the farm. They are raised in group pens, where interaction
among chickens can be downright nasty — so much so that chickens often have
their beaks removed to prevent them from pecking one another. If the best
egg-layer lays many more eggs than the other chickens because she takes
resources away from them, you can easily see why the other chickens in the
pen won’t produce as many eggs as the individual egg-laying champ. What
the egg farmer wants, however, is to maximize the total number of eggs pro-
duced. Because chickens are raised in pens, the important number isn’t eggs
produced by any particular chicken, but eggs produced per pen.
172
Part III: What Evolution Does 

William Muir and coworkers wanted to see whether it was possible to increase
the number of eggs that the chickens laid as a group rather than merely
increasing the number of eggs laid by individuals. So they expanded on the
farmer’s breeding practices, which favored the chickens that laid the most
eggs, by introducing selection at the group level. 
Muir selected for the largest number of eggs per pen. Chickens from pens that
produced a large number of eggs were used to found the pens for the next
generation. The best-producing pens of that generation were the source of
individuals for the subsequent generation. After five generations, Muir was
able to produce chickens that got along so nicely with the other chickens in
the pen that removing the beaks was no longer necessary. Just as significantly,
egg production increased by 100 percent, to 200 eggs per year per chicken.
Selection at the level of the gene
Selection can also work at the gene level. When a diploid individual (one that
has two copies of its genome) produces haploid gametes (sperm cells or eggs,
which have only one copy of the genome), each parental gene has a 50-50
chance of ending up in the gamete population — usually. Sometimes, though,
for reasons that are poorly understood, one gene is better than another at
making it into the gametes. This phenomenon is selection at the gene level,
or meiotic drive.
Meiotic drive occurs when a particular gene has better than a 50 percent chance
of making it into the gamete pool and from there to the offspring. Although on
its face, selection at the gene level seems to be at odds with how you expect
evolution to work, by taking a closer look at meiotic drive, you can see that
the same evolutionary forces are at play.
Increases in subsequent populations
In nearly all the other discussions in this book, the probability of a gene’s
ending up in the next generation depends on whether that particular gene
increases the survival and/or reproduction of the individual. The gene that
makes a cheetah run fast, for example, is more likely to make it into the next
generation than the gene that makes a cheetah run slowly.
Meiotic drive is different. The frequency of a gene increases because it ends
up in a disproportionate number of offspring — not because it necessarily
increases the organism’s fitness. Even a gene that has a negative effect on the
survival and reproduction of the organism could increase in frequency if the
degree to which it disables the individual is compensated for by its increased
173
Chapter 11: Units of Selection and the Evolution of Social Behavior 

representation in the offspring. In other words, individuals carrying this gene
may be less fit, but there are more of them than individuals carrying the 
gene left behind by meiotic drive.
Any gene that’s better at ending up in the offspring will increase in frequency,
even if ending up in more offspring is the only thing it’s better at doing and even
if it has fitness costs for the individual carrying it.
When selection levels collide
If the gene that increases in frequency has a high fitness cost to the individ-
ual, the direction of selection can be different at different levels. Suppose that
a gene that reduces the speed at which cheetahs can run is one that, through
meiotic drive, has a better than 50 percent chance of ending up in the gamete
population. Selection at the level of the individual will act to remove such a
costly gene, because cheetahs with this gene will be slower and will produce
fewer offspring.
Because the fitness of a particular gene can be at odds with the fitness of the
individual that carries it, selection at the level of the individual acts to
combat the deleterious driver gene. Take, for example, fruit flies.
A particular species of fruit fly has an X-linked driver gene. This driver gene
causes males to have only female offspring. Because producing both male
and female offspring is the most successful strategy for getting genes into the
subsequent generations, female flies are at a disadvantage if they mate with
the male flies carrying this driver gene.
Interestingly, the female fruit flies choose mates that have long eye stalks. The
connection? The driver gene is associated with a gene for short eye stalk.
The female preference for the long eye stalk evolved because the length of
the eye stalk correlates to the quality of the mate. Mate with a short-eye-stalk
fruit fly, and you end up with only daughters and decreased fitness. But avoid
short-eye-stalk fellas, and you get both male and female offspring and increased
fitness. (For a down-and-dirty explanation of sex selection, head to Chapter 12.)
Selection at the individual level operates to oppose selection at the level of
the driver gene. Females with a preference for males with long eye stalks are
less likely to mate with males carrying the driver gene. So even though the
gene is in twice as many gametes (males containing the driver gene make
only gametes that carry this gene), it doesn’t have twice the chance of
making it into the next generation because the male fly isn’t as likely to be
chosen as a mate.
174
Part III: What Evolution Does 

The Evolution of Altruistic Social Systems
As I explain throughout this book, evolution by natural selection means that
nature selects or favors heritable traits (or characteristics) that increase an
organism’s fitness — how successful it is at getting its genes into future gener-
ations. Yet some organisms actually postpone reproduction or forgo it. 
At first glance, such actions seem to be absolutely out of step with the core
concepts of evolution until you realize that in some cases, such as those
highlighted in the following sections, delaying or abandoning reproduction
can actually make an organism more fit. Which brings me to the evolution of
altruism and how doing good for others can be good for you.
Cooperative breeding
Although not common (only about 300 out of approximately 10,000 bird species
have cooperative breeding), cooperative breeding does happen. Birds with
helpers, regardless of whether the helpers are related or not, typically raise
more offspring — sometimes twice as many — than birds without helpers. 
There are two kinds of cooperative breeding among birds:
 Non-reproductive individuals helping other birds to reproduce: In
some cases, the helpers are related; in other cases, they’re not. Helpers
who are related benefit because doing so increases their inclusive fit-
ness (refer to the earlier section “Your fitness + your relatives’ fitness =
inclusive fitness” for details on inclusive fitness). Unrelated helpers benefit
because if male dies they have the inside track on widow: wife and home
all packaged together. 
 Groups of reproductive individuals getting together and helping each
other (often with some non-reproducing individuals, too): An example
of this type of system is found with the groove-billed ani, as explained in
the section “Other cooperative breeding behaviors.”
Helpers at the nest: When the helpers are related
Helpers at the nest refers to a situation in which offspring don’t leave the parental
environment immediately to raise offspring of their own, but remain with the
parents for some period of time and assist the parents in raising additional
broods. 
Waiting to reproduce may be beneficial for birds whose probability of repro-
ductive success is low. Suppose, for example, that reproductive success is
limited by the number of available territories in which pairs of birds can breed.
A younger, less-experienced bird may not be able to get and hold any territory;
175
Chapter 11: Units of Selection and the Evolution of Social Behavior 

therefore, on his own, he won’t have much opportunity for reproduction. If he
stays at the parental nest and helps care for his younger siblings, however, he
can boost his inclusive fitness.
The reason bird studies tend to focus on the behavior of males rather than
females is because it’s usually males that defend territories and females that
disperse to find mates — you know, the male bird sits and sings and hopes a
female flies by. When territories are scarce, extra males pile up around home.
In addition, the fact that the females are on the move can also mean
increased female mortality, which skews the sex ratio of males to females.
Sometimes, no evidence exists that the helpers at the nest increase the number
of offspring the parents are able to raise. In these cases, selection favors helping
for different reasons:
 To gain experience: A wealth of evidence shows that inexperienced pairs
of birds are much less successful at raising offspring than are experienced
birds. By sticking around to help, the young birds gain experience in
parenting.
 To inherit the territory: In an environment where territories are both
limited and needed to successfully raise offspring, staying in the parents’
territory may result in a better chance of inheriting the territory when
the parents die. (Consider this the suck-up principle.)
 To wait out tough times: Environments fluctuate, and sometimes there
just isn’t enough food or enough available mates. In this case, hanging
around in a bad year may increase your chance of surviving to breed in
a good one later. Got a 30-year-old child living at home? Then you’re
intimately familiar with this scenario.
The young bird isn’t sticking around just to be helpful; he’s looking out for
himself. The fact that his parents or siblings may benefit from his presence is
beside the point. For that matter, the parents aren’t acting altruistically either.
Even if having the young bird around doesn’t increase their own number of
offspring, the parents still benefit if, by delaying leaving home, the young bird
can increase his own reproductive success.
When the helper isn’t related
In some species, the male bird that helps out the mother bird isn’t one of her
sons or related to her at all. How can helping a complete stranger make more
offspring be selectively advantageous? 
In these species, mortality can be quite high. If the breeding male dies while
the unrelated male is hanging around being oh-so-helpful, who do you think
the female will turn to as a new mate? You’ve got it: Mr. Helpful himself, who,
by assisting her, has given himself the inside track on the job!
176
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Other cooperative breeding behaviors
The groove-billed ani is a kind of cuckoo that lives primarily in Central and
South America. These birds live in small groups (between one and five pairs)
within a single nest. They all help defend territory, provide food, sit on the eggs,
and feed the young. But this isn’t an avian utopia. Before they lay their own
eggs, the females make room for their own eggs by kicking others’ eggs out.
The ani engages in cooperative breeding, but it isn’t an example of kin selection
because the helpers are other reproducing birds; they don’t forgo or delay
their own reproduction to help the others. Even with the problems of this system
(the danger of your eggs getting tossed by another female, for example), each
reproducing pair produces more offspring than it otherwise would have. 
One good turn deserves another:
Reciprocal altruism
An individual can increase its own fitness through reciprocal altruism, the
situation in which altruistic acts are repaid. Forgot your lunch? No problem.
I’ll give you half of mine. But at some point in the future, I’ll expect you to
return the favor. Unlike kin selection (described in the earlier section), in
which the good-deed-doer gets an immediate benefit, in reciprocal altruism,
the benefit comes at some future time. In addition, reciprocal altruism can
occur whether the individuals are genetically related or not.
When it’s more likely to occur
Natural selection favors traits for reciprocal altruism (doing a good deed
today in the hope of being repaid at some point in the future) under certain
conditions:
 The individual that benefits from the altruistic behavior will be around
in the future to do a good deed in return. 
 The benefit you accrue from doing a good deed is greater than the cost
of doing the good deed in the first place. 
 Individuals are able to identify cheaters — individuals who accept altruism
but never pay anyone back. 
Because these conditions occur rarely in nature, instances of reciprocal altruism
are rare as well. Still, examples of reciprocal altruism exist in nature. One
naturally altruistic creature is — believe it or not — the female vampire bat,
as shown in an experiment performed by Gerald Wilkinson.
Reciprocal altruism in action
Female vampire bats live in colonies made up of unrelated females and their
offspring, and they feed exclusively on blood. At feeding time, these bats
177
Chapter 11: Units of Selection and the Evolution of Social Behavior 

leave the roost, find a mammal (usually, a nice juicy cow), bite it without being
detected, and lap up the blood. On a good night, they can consume almost one
third of their body weight in blood before they head back to the roost —
which is like a 150-pound person having a 50-pound dinner.
But if a bat can’t find food (sometimes, no cows are to be had), it’s in big trouble.
If it goes more than two nights without eating, it starves. In fact, studies have
shown that vampire bats fail to find food often enough that, left on their own,
most would be dead within a year. Yet vampire bats tend to live a long time.
Why? Vampire bats share the wealth. 
Back at the roost, the bats who were successful share some of the blood they
collected with the bats that are starving. Then, when they themselves are on
death’s doorstep, they get a sip of blood in return. This exchange among the
bats meets the conditions necessary for altruistic reciprocity:
 The colonies are long-term communities of the same individuals who
have many opportunities to share blood as needed. In one case, the
same pair of bats lived together for more than 10 years. Familiar bats —
those with which the donor has a longer association — are more likely
to receive a donation of blood, because they’re the ones most likely to
be around to reciprocate in the future.
Gerald Wilkinson removed a sample of bats from a colony and held them
without food until they reached the weight at which they would solicit
food from other bats. Then he compared how the bats remaining in the
colony responded to their returning (hungry) compatriots and how they
responded to hungry bats from a different colony. He found that the full
bats were likely to feed the hungry bats with which they had previous
associations and were much less likely to feed the bats that were strangers.
 The altruistic act is more beneficial to the recipient than harmful to
the giver. When a bat is close to starvation, a little bit of blood can buy
a fair bit of time. But that same amount of blood isn’t as big a loss to the
donating bat that’s flush from a successful feeding trip. 
 Vampire bats seem to have mechanisms in place to make sure that
other bats can’t cheat:
• They’re able to recognize and remember other individual bats.
• Before a hungry bat solicits food from one of its roostmates, it
grooms that bat’s belly. Given that full bats are noticeably more
rotund than starving bats, the hungry bat probably has a good
sense of who has food to share.
• The bat that’s being asked for food can assess the condition of the
bat that’s asking. Roostmates that are close to starvation are much
more likely to be fed than roostmates that are only a little hungry.
178
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Going to extremes: Eusociality
Eusociality is a social system characterized by reproductive specialization. One
or some individuals in the colony bear all the offspring, and non-reproductive
individuals assist in caring for the offspring. This system sounds nice and
tidy, but evolutionary biologists had to work long and hard to figure out why
eusociality works or what benefits it confers to the workers to make them want
to hang around rather than flit off to start their own colonies. 
The biggest question is why a non-reproductive worker class exists at all.
These individuals aren’t postponing reproduction until sometime in the
future (as is the case for birds helping at the nest). They’re forgoing repro-
duction entirely. Their genes will make it into future generations only to the
extent that they are able to help related individuals reproduce and their off-
spring survive. 
For some eusocial species, like ants, bees, and wasps (all Hymenoptera
species), kin selection and inclusive fitness explain why a nonreproductive
worker class can develop, and it all goes back to a reproductive system that
makes individuals more related to their siblings than to their own offspring.
For the other organisms, researchers suspect that other forces are at play.
Kin selection in bees, ants, and wasps
Bees, wasps, and ants live in highly structured colonies, with each individual
performing particular tasks. Each colony, for example, contains a single
reproducing female and many non-reproducing females that gather food, feed
the young, and defend the nest but don’t lay eggs of their own. So how does
helping the group help (that is, increase the fitness of) the individuals, espe-
cially those that forgo reproduction themselves?
You could say that all these insects are working toward the good of the colony
(and every animated ant or bee film ever made offers this explanation), but
you’d be wrong. Evolution rarely works at the group level; it is more likely to
work at the individual level. Each ant, wasp, or bee is really working toward
its own benefit — not the colony’s. 
In these species, non-reproductive females (the workers) increase their own
fitness more if they help the queen reproduce than if they reproduce themselves.
It’s a numbers game. Of all the relationships (parent to offspring, sister to
sister, sister to brother), females in these systems share more genes with
their sisters than they do with either parent, their brothers, or their own off-
spring. More sisters mean more fitness. The following sections explain.
179
Chapter 11: Units of Selection and the Evolution of Social Behavior 

Degree of relatedness in Hymenoptera species
In Hymenoptera reproduction, fertilized eggs become females; unfertilized
eggs become males. Because they result from fertilized eggs, females are
diploid. A female, being diploid, gets half of its genetic material from each of
its parents, just as humans do. What’s different is that the daughters receive
exactly the same genes from the father, because the males, having arisen
from unfertilized eggs, have only a single copy of the genetic material to pass
on to their children.
The upshot of this strange sex-determination mechanism is that females in
this reproductive system are three times as closely related to their sisters as
they are to their brothers, and mothers are more closely related to their sisters
(three quarters) than they are to their offspring (one half). In terms of kin
selection, being more related to your sisters than to your own offspring
means that a female can increase her fitness more efficiently by helping her
mother make another reproductive daughter than to make a daughter herself.
And guess what? That’s exactly what happens in many Hymenoptera species.
That beehive, anthill, or wasp’s nest in your backyard usually contains one
reproducing female and many non-reproducing daughters that take care of
the nest and the babies but don’t reproduce themselves.
Intrigue in the queen’s court
The mere fact that non-reproductive workers aren’t laying eggs on their own
doesn’t mean that they’re not affecting the reproductive decisions of the hive.
Consider bees as an example. 
The queen bee controls which eggs get fertilized, using sperm she stored from
her maiden mating flight. Because her sons and daughters each share half of
her genes, she would just as soon make half of each. It’s all the same to her.
But regardless of the sex ratio of the eggs laid by the queen, the ratio of
reproductive bees produced by a hive often has a three-to-one bias in favor 
of females. So if half of the Queen’s offspring are males and half are females,
how does the hive end up with many times more females than males?
The answer? Her daughters, the worker bees. For their own fitness (being three
times more related to their sisters than to their brothers), they prefer that
the queen make more daughters. And because the worker bees control the
feeding of the larvae, they control how many fertilized eggs will become
reproductive females and how many unfertilized eggs (males) will survive.
Genes that result in worker bees producing more sisters are selectively favored
because the sisters are likely to have those genes. A gene that favors producing
more brothers is not as likely to get passed to future generations, because the
brother bee is not as likely to share that gene (or any particular gene) with
the sister.
180
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Other eusocial organisms
Not all eusocial organisms have the same reproductive system that Hymenoptera
species do. Termites, for example, live in colonies with a reproductive pair
(one female and one male) and sterile female workers, but the workers aren’t
more closely related to their siblings than they are to their own offspring
(were they to have any). For them and other such creatures, kin selection
isn’t what compels them to remain in the colony.
In trying to understand these other eusocial systems, biologists suspect that
eusociality may have been the result of a dynamic between selection at the
level of the individual (which favors the fitness of the individual and therefore
tends to prevent the formation of such systems) and selection at the level of
the group (which favors groups of organisms over individual ones). 
If playing a minor role in a larger group makes an individual more fit than playing
a solitary role, natural selection could favor genes for remaining in the group.
Think of the dancers in a chorus line. They may never be the headliners that
draw in the audiences, but the show can’t go on without them — and they’re
dancing on Broadway.
So how do roles get assigned in such species? What mechanism dictates whether
a budding young organism is the star or a background player? Genes. Specifically,
genes for plasticity — those that allow individuals to develop into reproductive
individuals or non-reproductive workers. If such genes led to increased effi-
ciency in the division of labor within the colony, they would be selectively
favored.
One is the loneliest number:
Multicellularity
The fossil record makes it clear that organisms started out as single-celled
entities and developed into multicelled organisms as time passed. It’s not hard
to imagine the evolutionary pathway that led from one condition to the other:
1. A single-celled organism divided into two daughter cells.
2. Each daughter cell divided into two daughter cells.
3. Each of those daughter cells divided, and so on and so forth, until a
whole bunch of single-celled organisms were going happily about their
business.

4. One day, a mutation occurred, resulting in two daughter cells remaining
attached instead of separating after cell division.
These two still-attached cells had a couple of advantages over individual
cells — maybe they were harder to eat (because they were bigger), and
maybe they had more access to food sources — so this particular mutation
increased in frequency in the population.
This example seems fairly simple, but making a multicelled organism isn’t as
easy as assembling a collection of identical cells. In larger organisms, different
cells have to become specialized to perform different functions. The cells in
your own body, for example, are remarkably good at sharing resources, yet
few of them do any of the reproducing; that task is left entirely to the tissues
that produce eggs and sperm. Yet the specialization that makes complex
functioning possible can also lead to conflicts between different cell lineages. 
Cells can be selfish in a couple of ways:
 By not performing their appropriate functions: If all the cells want to
be gonads, and none of them wants to be a thighbone, the community
(the multicelled organism) breaks down. The only chance that one of
your nose-hair cells has of getting its genes into the next generation is to
play nice, do its job, and not suck up any more resources than necessary. 
 By trying to hog all the resources: Every once in a while, a mutation in
a cell can result in that cell’s breaking ranks and going all out for the
resources. Need a recognizable word for this phenomenon? Try cancer.
Part of the evolution of multicellularity — organisms growing from 4 cells to 8
cells to 16 cells to 32 to eventually billions of cells — seems to be the natural
selection of traits that keep selfish cells in check. For the most part, things have
gone swimmingly. Organisms have evolved from single-celled creatures to
multicelled creatures of amazing complexity and variety that can, for exam-
ple, write or read a book about evolution.

E
volutionary biologists spend a fair bit of time thinking about sex, and in
this chapter, you find out what it is, exactly, that they’re thinking about.
The evolutionary biology of sex encompasses several areas that can be
conveniently broken down into the following major topics:
 How does the added complication of mating affect the process of evolution
in sexual species?
 Why have two sexes, and what’s the optimum male-to-female ratio?
 Why have sex at all?
Just as this chapter covers a range of topics, it also illustrates a range in sci-
entists’ understanding of these topics. The evolution of sex is a hot area of
research, and knowledge is growing rapidly. In some cases, researchers are
confident that they understand what they see in nature; in other cases, they’re
not. In this chapter, I tell you what scientists know and what they’re not yet
sure of. As always, I continue to introduce you to the data and experiments
that shape current understanding.
Sex Terms You Probably 
Thought You Knew
The term sex can mean several things. Ask a seventh-grader straight out of
health class, and you’re likely to get one definition (with a few sniggers thrown
in). Ask a parent of a brood of children, and you’re likely to get another. Often,
these definitions equate sex with sexual reproduction. But ask an evolutionary

184
Part III: What Evolution Does 
biologist to define sex and sexual reproduction, and you get definitions that
are beautifully precise, even if they do suck all the fun and innuendo out of
the terms.
For evolutionary biologists, sex is not mating but the combining of genetic
material from different individuals, and reproduction simply means making
offspring; reproduction, in other words, doesn’t have to include sex:
 Sexual reproduction: Sexual reproduction is the system in which two
individuals mate and produce offspring whose genes are a combination
of some of the genes from each parent. Sexually reproducing organisms
produce offspring that have only half of each parent’s genes.
 Asexual reproduction: Asexual organisms produce offspring without
mating, and these offspring contain only the single parent’s genes. 
For some species (like humans), reproduction always relies on sex. Other
species (like rotifers and a few kinds of lizards) never have sex at all and still
manage to reproduce. Still other species can reproduce with or without sex,
proving that sexual reproduction isn’t necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition.
As mentioned in numerous places throughout this book, fitness is all about
passing on your genes to the next generation. The more successful you are at
that task, the more fit you are. All other things being equal, an organism that
makes twice as many offspring is twice as fit. (Go to Chapter 2 for a more in-
depth discussion of fitness from an evolutionary perspective.) But in repro-
duction, the quality of the offspring’s reproductive success also impacts an
individual’s fitness. If two individuals each produce four offspring, but the
four offspring of one individual die before getting a chance to reproduce, the
two individuals aren’t equally fit.
Sexual Selection: The Art 
of Picking a Mate
For sexually reproducing species, it’s not enough just to find food and dodge
predators. You also have to get a mate, because the prime directive, evolution-
arily speaking, is to pass on your genes. How you go about choosing the best
candidate to help you do just that is the topic of sexual selection.
Sexual selection refers to choosing certain characteristics over others when
looking for a mate, and it’s a subcategory of natural selection — the process
by which heritable traits that promote survival become more common.
Sexual selection can lead to the evolution of some traits that, on the face of it,
don’t make much sense. It may favor a trait that increases an individual’s ability
to find a mate but decreases its ability to survive, for example. Although this

arrangement seems strange at first, it’s perfectly reasonable if the trade-off is
a good one — that is, if the fitness increase from increased mating is greater
than the fitness loss from earlier death.
Sexual selection has two components: choice and competition. For the vast
majority of cases, this means female choice and male-male competition. These
are not mutually exclusive; you can see both in the same species and sometimes
you even see the reverse (male choice and female-female competition). Also
remember that sexual selection is found in lots of animal species from insects
to mammals.
Some evolutionary biologists argue that sexual selection should be considered
separately from natural selection, as the evolutionary changes produced are
of a slightly different nature (flashy feathers as opposed to anything that’s
actually helpful for surviving, finding food, and so on.) But for our purposes
here, I treat sexual selection as a subcategory of natural selection. 
The Peacock’s Tail: Sexual Selection
and Female Choice 
One kind of sexual selection system is one in which females choose their
partners based on some outward characteristic. In these cases, the females’
choice results in the males having some increasingly elaborate trait, even when
that trait doesn’t offer an obvious advantage in the male’s survival. At face value,
it’s the classic example of choosing style over substance. This phenomenon
has been puzzling evolutionary biologists since Darwin, because although it’s
obvious that females choose showy males, it’s not entirely clear why.
In these species, evolutionary biologists figure that something else must be
at play — something that makes it advantageous for the male (with the
showy trait that serves no other purpose) and the female (whose choice of
mate means that her offspring will end up with a trait that may actually be a
disadvantage) to get together.
To understand this system, consider peacocks. If you’ve had the opportunity
to see a peacock, you’ve no doubt been impressed by the size and beauty of
his tail. The huge fan of iridescent green and blue feathers, which he displays
so proudly, is unquestionably one of the most magnificent displays in the bird
family. 
That said, from a survival point of view, the fancy tail doesn’t appear to have
a lot of advantages. In fact, the tail seems to increase the chance that the
peacock will be caught and eaten by predators. Peacocks don’t fly especially
gracefully, and the tail certainly makes it hard to hide. In addition, although
185
Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 

the tail can’t possibly make finding food any easier, the energy required to
produce such an elaborate tail means that the peacock needs to find more.
In short, a showy tail doesn’t seem to have any obvious fitness advantages,
but it turns out that there is one, and it’s a big one: Peahens like it! In fact,
peahens like flashy tails so much that they preferentially choose to mate with
males that have showier tails. Therefore, males with showier tails are much
more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation than are males with
less-showy tales. So having a fancy tail does indeed make a peacock more fit.
But what about the peahen? How does mating with the showy male increase
her fitness? After all, she’s deliberately choosing to mate with a very showy
but otherwise less capable male. Although she’s passing on her genes to the
next generation (good from a fitness perspective), she’s combining them with
some genes that appear to make it more likely that her offspring will get eaten
or starve (bad from a fitness perspective).
Two major ideas explain the curious choices that the females seem to make
(and shallowness isn’t one of them): the runaway-selection hypothesis and
the good-genes hypothesis. The different mechanisms may be important in
different systems.
It’s not always the females that do the choosing. In some cases, the females
display, and the males choose the females. These examples are very rare,
however, so throughout this section, I concentrate on examples in which the
female does the choosing. Just remember that in some cases, exactly the
same phenomenon occurs, but with the roles of the sexes reversed.
It’s not how you feel, it’s how you look:
Runaway-selection hypothesis
The runaway-selection hypothesis says that, if females choose mates based
on some random showy character simply because they’re attracted to that
character, that character becomes more pronounced in each successive gen-
eration until the disadvantages of the having the trait (it makes you less likely
to survive) outweigh the advantages (it makes the ladies like you).
Here’s how runaway-selection works: Females choose males with, for example,
bigger tails for no other reason than that they like big tails. Because the biggest-
tailed birds father the most offspring, the average male in the next generation
will have a slightly bigger tail. When the next generation’s females choose
among these males, they select for even longer tails. In this way, male tail 
length increases until it reaches the point where the increased risk of predation,
starvation, or some other unfortunate outcome of having an enormous tail
outweighs any additional attractiveness to the females.
186
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Two questions come to mind in considering this model: How does it benefit
the females to mate with showy males, and what makes them prefer one
particular trait over others? The next sections provide the answers.
The runaway-selection hypothesis seems as though it shouldn’t be right simply
because . . . well, evolution shouldn’t work in such a strange way. But it’s
important to remember that our emotional reaction to any particular hypothesis
rarely has anything to do with whether it’s correct.
Like father, like son: The sexy-sons hypothesis
Beyond looking good as a couple, how does picking a male with a showy tail
increase the female’s fitness, particularly if the showy tail makes survival
more difficult? You’d think that if she wants to get her genes into the future,
the female would be better off choosing males with less-showy tails so that
her offspring have a better chance of survival.
As it turns out, that’s not quite how it works. Instead, specific cases have been
found in which female fitness is reduced when females mate with less-showy
males because the mating success of their sons is lower. In other words,
having a sexy son can provide a fitness advantage for a female who chooses
to mate with an elaborate male.
Imagine a mutation that makes a female less likely to choose a male with a big
tail. Now consider how that choice may affect her fitness. True, her sons
wouldn’t be hobbled with enormous tails, but they wouldn’t be prime mating
material either. If these poor sons can’t get mates, they can’t pass on their
(and their mom’s) genes. 
To see whether this hypothesis were true, evolutionary biologists came up
with a testable prediction: The sons of less-flashy fathers should have lower
mating success than the sons of more-flashy fathers. After identifying species
in the wild for which they could measure the attractiveness of males, who mates
with whom, and the mating success of the sons of more- and less-flashy fathers,
scientists discovered that less-flashy sons actually do have less success in
the mating department — and that decreases both their fitness and their
mothers’.
The case for pre-existing preferences
The brain, as you may have noticed, can be a strange thing. It allows us to do
a lot of things that are obviously adaptive: find food, avoid bears, and so on.
At the same time, it is responsible for traits that don’t have obvious advantages,
such as dreaming or a propensity to enjoy skydiving. As Chapter 5 explains,
not all traits are adaptive. Some traits that aren’t adaptive can get dragged
along by the traits that are. Pre-existing preferences could fall into this cate-
gory: in this scenario. females have a pre-existing preference for the trait.
Something about how the female brain is wired leads them to favor the 
trait just because.
187
Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 

Scientists have tested ideas about pre-existing preferences in the laboratory,
using fish closely related to swordtails. Swordtails are small freshwater fish
common in home aquariums. Males have a long pointed tail — hence, the name
swordtail. Females, as you’ve probably guessed, have a mating preference for
males with long tails. 
The fish used in the studies, although otherwise very similar to the swordtails,
differed from them in a couple of key ways: The males lack the long pointed
tails, and the females obviously don’t choose mates based on tail length,
because none of the males has a long tail. To find out what would happen if
the males did have long tails, researchers attached fake long pointed tails to the
male fish. And what did the females do? They preferred to mate with the males
wearing the fake tails.
This experiment was important because scientists were able to demonstrate
that pre-existing preferences exist. These preferences — in combination with
the data showing that the reproductive success of sons is decreased if their
fathers were less flashy — suggests that the runaway-selection model is a very
real possibility even if the showy trait never had any ecological advantage.
Or maybe it IS how you feel: The 
good-genes hypothesis
The good-genes hypothesis proposes that females select mates with elaborate
traits because the presence of these traits provides reliable indicators of
overall male quality. Under this model, peahens prefer the peacocks with the
most elaborate tails because the presence of a large tail indicates that the
male has other qualities that would be beneficial for the female’s offspring.
For evidence that the good-genes hypothesis sometimes explains female
choice, consider a study using a particularly species of stickleback, a small
freshwater fish. Males of this species have bright red bellies, and the females
preferentially choose to mate with the males with the reddest bellies. 
Iain Barber and coworkers measured the resistance to parasitic worms of the
offspring of males who differed in how red their bellies were. What they found
was that the males with the reddest bellies fathered offspring that were more
resistant to parasites. In this case, the redness of a male’s belly was a true
indicator of his genetic quality with respect to offspring parasite resistance.
Females choosing to mate with the reddest males produced fitter offspring
than females that selected duller males. The good-genes hypothesis provides
a good explanation for female choice in this fish.
188
Part III: What Evolution Does 

The handicap hypothesis
The handicap hypothesis is a special variation of the good-genes hypothesis.
Under the handicap hypothesis, the elaborate male trait indicates the presence
of other good genes, specifically because the male trait is so costly that only
males with especially good genes could produce the elaborate trait and still
survive. According to this hypothesis, a peacock that can survive with an
enormous tail must have some other really good genes to balance out the
obviously bad tail. Maybe it’s especially good at evading predators and at
finding food, for example, if it can manage to do both while still dragging
around that beautiful but cumbersome tail.
An important component of the handicap hypothesis is that the elaborate
male trait must actually be a handicap. In the example of the peacock,
researchers have been taking for granted that the peacock’s enormous tail
hinders its ability to do all the sorts of things that birds need to do to survive. 
No studies have been done with actual peacocks (mainly because they don’t
make good laboratory critters — they’re big, they’re expensive, and they bite) —
but studies of other birds have provided evidence that elaborate tails are a
handicap. For their study, Andres Moller and Florentino de Lope used barn
swallows. Male barn swallows have long tails, and the females preferentially
mate with the males that have the longest tails.
Moller and de Lope artificially increased or decreased the length of male barn
swallows’ tails and then measured the effects of different tail lengths on feeding
ability and mating success. They found that giving males longer tails increased
their attractiveness to females and at the same time decreased their efficiency
in catching food. These experimental results show that in this bird species, the
elaborate trait that is attractive to females is indeed a handicap for the male
birds.
Sexual Selection and Male-Male
Competition
As explained in the preceding section, female choice is one type of sexual
section. The other type is male-male competition, when males compete with
each other for access to females. Competition among males for access to females
can take several forms. In each case, natural selection favors characters that
increase success in those contests.
In the case of male-male competition, as in female choice, selection favors
characters that increase male mating success, which can lead to physical
differences between the two sexes. Unlike the case of female choice, however,
in which the differences result in males having some increasingly elaborate
189
Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 

attractive trait, selection resulting from male-male competition favor traits
that facilitate winning contests with other males. 
Finally, there may be cases when female choice and male-male competition
both operate. For example, male deer use their antlers in contests with other
males. Yet it is also possible that large antlers could be appealing to female deer.
Female preference could drive the evolution of antler size past the optimum
needed to bash other male deer. Or visa versa. Remember that in either case,
selection for being able to do all the other more mundane things that deer do
(like find food and run away from predators) will place some upper limit on
antler size. 
The largest deer antlers on record are from the extinct Giant Deer which had
antlers 12 feet across! Sexual selection has been suggested as a reason for the
evolution of these impressive antlers, but we can’t know for sure. If you’ve heard
about this beast, you might have also heard the idea that the reason they
went extinct was that their antlers got too big for their own good. But of course,
evolution doesn’t work that way. Any deer with antlers that were simply too
big to allow him to survive wouldn’t be passing those super duper antler
genes to the next generation. 
Direct male-male contests
The most obvious example of male-male competition for females is the case
in which males actually fight one another, and the winners are the ones that
get to mate. The stakes are high, because the losers won’t be passing their
genes on to the next generation (at least during this particular mating season),
and sometimes the contests are quite violent. Common examples of animals
that engage in male-male contests are elephant seals and lions. In both cases,
selection has led to increased size in males because larger males are more
successful fighters.
190
Part III: What Evolution Does 
Run away! Run away!
Individuals typically don’t engage in contests
that they don’t stand some chance of winning.
For that reason, many contests in the animal
kingdom are preceded by a period of posturing
in which the two combatants check each other
out to judge relative size and strength. After this
initial period, a weaker individual chooses to
withdraw rather than risk death in a contest he
probably can’t win. The same logic applies
when, part of the way through a fight, one indi-
vidual realizes that he’s beaten and withdraws.
This situation is also quite common in nature.

This phenomenon is responsible for male elephant seals being the largest
members of the carnivore family. Although female elephant seals are generally
between 1,000 and 2,000 pounds, males routinely weigh between 3,000 and
5,000 pounds, with the record weight being more than 7,000 pounds.
Studies have shown that the larger males do indeed father most of the young
in elephant seals and some other species. But living the life of a giant warrior-
lover isn’t all peaches and cream. 
Natural selection favors genes that increase size and fighting ability, but not
genes for increased longevity. Although enormous size is necessary to fight
for a mate, the violent contests and huge energy costs associated with it seem
to take their toll. Male elephant-seals live much shorter lives than females —
about 14 years as opposed to about 20. Because of how mating is structured
in this species, being an older male has no advantage; being a bigger, stronger
male does. Death is definitely a bad idea and certainly something to be avoided.
But if the only way to get access to females is at the cost of a reduced lifespan,
natural selection will favor the bigger-and-stronger genes over the lifespan genes.
From an evolutionary point of view, not reproducing — that is, not passing
your genes on to the next generation — is the same as dying. Either way, your
genes aren’t in the next generation, and your fitness is effectively zero.
Indirect competition
Competition between males isn’t always direct face-to-face conflict. Males also
compete in indirect ways. In these cases, selection doesn’t favor increased male
fighting ability; it favors whatever traits are required to gain access to females.
One obvious example of indirect competition is competition to find females.
In many species of butterflies, females mate with the first male that finds them,
so finding a female fast is a big advantage. Females often produce chemicals
called pheromones that the males can smell. As a result, males have evolved to
be incredibly sensitive to these pheromones. Some butterfly males can detect a
female more than five miles away! 
This type of male-male competition is called scramble competition because rather
than fighting, the males are scrambling to find the females as fast as they can.
Sperm competition
In some species, females mate with multiple males, which provides an additional
battleground for male-male competition: the battle among the sperm. Natural
selection has produced a variety of male adaptations designed to fight this
battle, including:
191
Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 

 More sperm: Males of non-monogamous species produce more sperm
than males of monogamous species.
 Seminal plugs: Most common in insects, but also seen in some vertebrates,
is the production of seminal fluid that solidifies into a plug to prevent
subsequent males from mating — a strange but predictable adaptation
to the problem of competition from other males’ sperm.
 Toxic seminal fluid: Fruit flies are one species that employs this strategy.
Their sperm contains toxic compounds that inhibit the sperm of subse-
quent males. Unfortunately, poison semen isn’t too good for the female;
head to the later section “The Battle of the Sexes: Male-Female Conflict”
to find out more about what happens when what the male wants is at
odds with what the female wants.
Being sneaky: Alternative male strategies
In the evolutionary process, there is often more than one way to accomplish the
same task. As biologists continue to study systems in which mating success
seems to be determined by the outcome of male-male competition, they’re
discovering some interesting alternative male strategies. One example is the
sneaky strategy. Scientists speculate that the sneaky strategy is a way for
younger males to have some chance of reproductive success before they get
old enough to bark with the big dogs.
Males that use the sneaky strategy avoid direct conflict and try to mate 
with females while the other males are busy bashing their horns together or
otherwise carrying on. It’s not clear how common this phenomenon is, but it’s
been seen in several species, including frogs and red deer. It’s also not clear
how successful this strategy is compared with the strategy of the dominant
male. For males that would be unable to win physical contests, however, it
provides the only chance to contribute genes to the next generation.
The Battle of the Sexes: 
Male-Female Conflict
In a monogamous species in which males and females enter into long-term
reproductive relationships, parents will have an interest in each other’s survival
because only through the survival of their partners will they be able to produce
any offspring. The situation is much different for species with short-lived or
no pair bonds. In this case, selection can favor traits of one individual in the
pair even if they decrease the partner’s fitness.
192
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Parents have an interest in providing for the survival of their offspring. From
a strictly evolutionary point of view, they don’t necessarily have any interest
in each other’s survival. Why? Because from a fitness perspective, it’s better
for a male if his partner makes only a few offspring, all of which are his, than
if she makes very many offspring that aren’t his. The female’s fitness is increased
by adaptations that favor her reproductive output over that of her mate’s. The
result of the conflicting goals is an evolutionary version of the battle of the sexes.
The following sections discuss some of the ways this conflict manifests itself
in the animal kingdom.
Infanticide
When male lions take over a pride of female lions, they kill or attempt to kill
the cubs. They don’t indiscriminately kill baby lions, however. They leave their
own offspring alone but kill cubs fathered by the previous dominant male. Killing
the cubs sired by the previous dominant male increases the new male’s fitness,
because it gives him a better shot of producing his own offspring before he
gets dethroned by some other male lion. 
The violent male-male competition to control a pride of females results in
frequent changes in the dominant male. When a new male takes over, he must
reproduce as rapidly as possible, as the risk exists that he too will soon be
displaced. Because female lions with cubs are not reproductively receptive
while they’re caring for existing young, the fastest way for the male to gain
reproductive access to females is to kill their offspring, which he does as
soon as he takes over the pride. The females are then soon ready to mate
with him and have his offspring, passing along his genes.
193
Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 
A sneaky sperm competition
Several adaptations seem to facilitate the
sneaky strategy. One good example occurs in
Atlantic salmon. In this species, larger, domi-
nant males guard females and then fertilize their
eggs externally as soon as the eggs are laid.
The dominant male chases away smaller males
that attempt to approach the female he’s guard-
ing. The smaller males can’t get as close to the
female as the dominant male can, but they have
an interesting characteristic that may serve to
increase their chances of fertilizing at least
some of the female’s eggs.
Matthew Gage and coworkers found that
smaller males’ sperm swim faster and can sur-
vive longer in the water than those of larger
males. Smaller males also produce sperm with
different characteristics from those of the dom-
inant males, and these sperm may have a better
chance of reaching the female’s eggs.

In this scenario, the male’s fitness increases at the expense of the female’s
fitness. She’s invested time and energy in her litter, which is now lost. Because
the new dominant male is so much larger and stronger than the female, she isn’t
able to protect her young after the new dominant male takes over.
Before then, the females aren’t completely powerless, however. Groups of
female lions often attempt to chase away solitary male lions that approach
the pride. How much — or whether — these actions decrease the probability
of the dominant male’s being replaced isn’t known, but the actions are
certainly consistent with the view that the females are trying to prevent 
the deaths of their cubs.
Poison semen
Because of the promiscuous mating system of fruit flies, each fly will mate with
many other flies over its lifetime. Neither partner has any interest in increasing
the fitness of any particular mate, only in increasing its own fitness:
194
Part III: What Evolution Does 
Should I stay or should I go?
In monogamous species, males and females
have either a short or a long-term interest in the
fitness of their partners. Non-monogamous
species don’t have the same concerns. But how
would they evolve if they did? Brett Holland and
William Rice designed an experiment with fruit
flies to investigate this question. They separated
the flies into two groups:
 For one group of flies, they continued to
grow the flies together in large groups in
which multiple non-monogamous matings
would occur. In this case, an individual fly’s
fitness is maximized by producing as many
offspring as it can, regardless of the conse-
quences for its partners.
 In the other group, they raised the flies in
monogamous pairs. In this treatment, the fit-
ness of the two flies is interconnected. Flies
whose behaviors maximize their partner’s
fitness also maximize their own fitness.
The researchers raised flies in these two treat-
ments for 47 generations; at the end of the
experiment, they measured female fitness char-
acteristics such as life span and reproductive
output. Here’s what they found:
 The male flies in the monogamous pairs had
evolved to be less harmful to the female
flies. The original male flies were rough; the
evolved monogamous ones more gentle-
manly.
 The female flies had evolved to be less
resistant to the male flies. The original
female flies watched their backs; the
monogamous evolved ones relax and let
their hair down.
Their experiment shows that changing the
mating system such that the interests of the
sexes were no longer in conflict led to rapid
evolution that decreased the strength of traits
associated with male-female conflict.

 Male fruit flies have toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid that inhibit the
sperm of other males (this is an example of sperm competition, explained
in the earlier section “Sperm competition” in this chapter). This trait is
advantageous for the male because it increases the chance that his sperm
will be the ones that fertilize the female’s eggs. But the same trait is bad
for the female because the semen is toxic to her; she’s being poisoned.
 The very act of mating seems to decrease the survival of female flies,
because repeated mating with males is physically damaging — a situation
the female fly tries to avoid.
Sex: It’s Expensive, So Why Bother? 
Lots of organisms reproduce sexually, but plenty don’t. Many organisms
reproduce asexually, without sex. Given that sex is expensive and some
organisms reproduce just fine without it, why do it? Evolutionary biologists
ponder this question because at first glance, sex doesn’t seem like a very fit
thing to do:
 A sexual organism is effectively throwing away half its genes when it
reproduces. When an organism reproduces sexually, only half its genes
get passed to its offspring; the other half come from the other parent.
Asexual organisms, on the other hand, pass on all their genes. So from a
fitness perspective, it would seem that asexual reproduction is better
(read, more fit), hands down.
 All other things being equal, the sexual individuals will soon be over-
run, and sexual reproduction will be eliminated. For sex, you need
males. Asexual females don’t have to make any males, so they produce all
daughters, which in turn produce all granddaughters, which produce
great-granddaughters, and so on. A sexual female that produces the same
number of offspring will make only half as many daughters as the asexual
female. She spends the other half of her energy making sons. Because her
daughters will, on average, make only half as many daughters as the daugh-
ters of the asexual female, the original sexual female will end up with only
one quarter as many grandchildren as the asexual female, one eighth as
many great-grandchildren, and so on.
But sexual reproduction hasn’t been eliminated, of course, which means that
reproducing sexually must have one or more fitness advantages. So what are
these advantages? Well, the truth is that evolutionary biologists just aren’t sure.
Many ideas have been suggested, and probably more that we haven’t thought
of yet will be suggested. The following sections look at the current ideas.
The ideas outlined in the following sections are not intended to be mutually
exclusive; they could be working together simultaneously to maintain sexual
reproduction. The question “Why have sex?” may well have many answers.

Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 

Idea 1: Sex produces parasite-
resistant offspring
Sex produces parasite-resistant offspring, making sexual organisms better
able to adapt to changing parasitic environment than asexual organisms are.
Sexual reproduction produces variable offspring (offspring that are not geneti-
cally identical to their parents), whereas asexual reproduction doesn’t.
Asexual females produce daughters, granddaughters, and so on that are
genetically identical to Mom. 
Asexual reproduction is also called clonal reproduction, and all the resulting
descendants of a single asexual female are referred to collectively as a clone.
All the members of a clone are identical except for possible rare random
mutations that may have occurred in DNA during the reproductive process.
Sexual females, although they produce only half as many daughters, produce
daughters that aren’t identical to Mom or to one another.
Evolutionary biologists since Darwin have pondered the possible advantages
of producing variable offspring. The first argument — that because natural
selection requires variation on which to act, having variable offspring makes it
more likely that your descendants will evolve faster than the other critters —
seems like a no-brainer until you consider the following:
 The parent sexual organism clearly has a very fit combination of genes
already. It’s survived, found food, dodged predators, and found a mate;
now it’s reproducing. 
 Sexual reproduction is dicey — you’re more likely to break up a perfectly
good set of genes with a proven track record in the current environment
than hit on an even more fit combination. 
So why take the gamble? 
196
Part III: What Evolution Does 
Why males don’t count
Males don’t contribute to population growth; they
are needed so that the females can reproduce,
but they are otherwise a waste of resources, and
that’s why they don’t get counted. Suppose that
two sexual females each make one daughter and
one son. The daughter of one mates with the son
of the other, and vice versa. Each sexual female
ends up with four grandchildren, but that doesn’t
mean there are eight grandchildren; there are still
only four total, and only two of these are female.
The population has gone from two females to two
females. That’s why the males don’t get counted.

The key words here are current environment. In the current environment, this
sexual organism does just fine. But what happens when the environment
changes? This year’s very fit gene combinations won’t necessarily be very fit
next year. The evolutionary interaction between parasites and their hosts can
lead to such year-to-year changes in the hosts’ environment.
The parasites experience selection pressure to infect their hosts better, whereas
the hosts experience selection pressures to better resist infection by their
parasites. In this sort of system, the genes of last year’s really fit host won’t
be really fit next year, because the parasites will have evolved to infect it better.
With parasites evolving to better infect their hosts, an asexual host will be in
trouble, because all its offspring will be exact copies of itself, but they will
have to fend off better-adapted parasites. A sexual host, on the other hand,
produces variable offspring with gene combinations the parasite population
has not yet had a chance to adapt to. For this reason, the offspring of sexu-
ally reproducing organisms are less susceptible to attack by the parasites. So
although the parent organism may not fare too well with new or better-
adapted parasites, its offspring will.
Idea 2: Sex speeds up adaptation by
combining rare beneficial mutations
Most mutations are bad. After all, randomly changing some piece of an organ-
ism’s DNA is far more likely to mess up something that was working just fine than
it is to improve upon something that wasn’t. Every once in a while, however, some
random change is actually beneficial and makes an organism better at doing
whatever it is that particular organism does. One possible benefit of sexual
reproduction is the ability to combine these rare but beneficial mutations
more rapidly.
Imagine a couple of beneficial mutations; call them mutation A and mutation B.
Both are rare, but they do occasionally occur. Either of the mutations makes
the organisms more fit than the organisms without the mutations, but having
both is better still. 
Sex makes it easier for the two mutations to end up in the same organism. If
an individual with mutation B mates with an individual with mutation A, some
of the offspring should end up with both beneficial mutations. If this population
were an asexual one, each individual would be reproducing in a clonal fashion,
and the only way a lineage with mutation A would end up with mutation B (or
vice-versa) would be if that mutation occurred in that lineage.

Part III: What Evolution Does 
Studying snails and worms
Curt Lively and coworkers tested the theory that
sex produces parasite-resistant offspring by
using a freshwater snail that lives in New
Zealand and is parasitized by a trematode
worm. Through their investigation, the
researchers provide strong support for the
theory that sexual reproduction is advanta-
geous in the presence of parasites.
Lively chose this particular snail because the
species has both sexual and asexual forms. The
species can reproduce sexually, with a female
mating with a male to produce sexual female
and male snails. Sometimes, however, offspring
have an extra set of chromosomes and are
triploid instead of diploid, which means that they
have three sets of chromosomes instead of just
two sets. The triploid snails appear to be simi-
lar to the diploid snails in every respect except
one: They don’t need to mate to reproduce. That
means that all the triploid snails are females
that reproduce asexually, creating identical
triploid daughters.
In any given lake, both sexual and asexual snails
coexist. The researchers used genetic tech-
niques to determine that many different clones
often coexisted in the same location. Each of
these clones was the result of a separate
instance of sexual reproduction between two
diploid snails that resulted in a triploid offspring.
Because the different clones have different
genes, it’s reasonable to assume that one or
more of these clones would be better at doing all
the things that snails do. The better, more fit
clones may outcompete all the others in the short
run, but they clearly have not eliminated all the
other clones nor the sexual snails.
Lively and company were ready to test some of
the specific predictions of the theory that the
presence of the parasite was responsible for
maintaining sexual reproduction in this system.
Prediction 1: Sexual individuals should be
more common in locations that have more para-
sites
Measuring the density of parasites and the fre-
quency of sexual reproduction at many lakes
throughout New Zealand, Lively and company
found that as the density of parasites increased
the frequency of sexual reproduction increased
as well. They also measured the frequency of
sexually reproducing snails in both shallow and
deep areas within individual lakes and found the
same thing: As the density of parasites
increased, the proportion of snails that repro-
duced sexually increased.
Prediction 2: If parasites are adapting to infect
their hosts better, parasites should be better at
infecting the host snails from their own lake
rather than the snails from other lakes
The researchers performed two sets of experi-
ments to test this prediction. They collected par-
asites and snails from two lakes on opposite
sides of the southern New Zealand Alps and
brought them back to the laboratory. (The dis-
tance between the lakes made it unlikely that the
snails or their parasites had ever encountered
each other in nature.) Then they measured the
degree to which the parasites from each lake
were able to infect snails from the two lakes.
They found that for each lake, the parasites were
better able to infect the coexisting snails than the
snails from the other side of the mountains.
Next, they chose three lakes that were much
closer to each other — close enough that ducks
could easily fly between them, transporting the
parasitic worms from one lake to the next. They
again collected worms and snails from the lakes
and brought them back to the laboratory to mea-
sure the ability of the parasites to infect snails
from their own lake as well as the other two. In
all three cases, they found that the parasites

Idea 3: Sex is beneficial because 
it can eliminate bad mutations
One of the problems faced by asexual organisms is that, after they have a bad
mutation, all their descendents will have the same bad mutation. Then, when
a second bad mutation occurs in one of these descendents, all its descendents
will have two bad mutations, and so on. This suggestion was first made by
Hermann Joseph Muller (1890–1967), and the process is referred to as Muller’s
Ratchet because the increasing number of bad mutations ratchets down the
organism’s fitness.
This problem would be especially pronounced in small populations, in which
random events might more readily result in the fixation of bad mutations (refer
to Chapter 6 for info about how random events impact small populations). Sex
provides a solution to this problem. Two sexual organisms, each of which had
a different bad mutation, could mate and produce offspring that had neither
mutation. Problem solved!
Using a virus that attacks bacteria, called phi-6, Lin Chao and coworkers tested
the theory that sex can eliminate harmful mutations. 
Unlike most organisms that have genomes made of DNA, the phi-6 virus has a
genome made of RNA. RNA replication is much more likely to result in errors
than DNA replication, and as a result, organisms with RNA genomes have much
higher mutation rates. This situation makes phi-6 an excellent subject for a
study involving mutations, because many mutations occur over a reasonably
short experiment.
199
Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 
were better able to infect the snails from their
own lake, and the effect was strong enough that
it was not overwhelmed by the genetic mixing
that could be occurring among the three lakes.
Prediction 3: The genotypes that were most
common in the past should be most suscepti-
ble to the current parasites
In testing this prediction, the researchers
focused on the clonal, asexual snails. For their
test subjects, they selected clones that pos-
sessed the clonal genotypes most common in
previous years. Using these clones, they per-
formed two sets of experiments.
They tested the susceptibility of clones from the
recent past to the parasitic worms presently
inhabiting the lakes from which the clones were
collected. What they found was that the clones
that had been common in the past were more
readily attacked than the clones that had been
rare.
If you’re a worm, you’re well served by having
characteristics (naturally selected, of course)
that make you better able to overcome the
defenses of the most common clone genotypes.
A parasite better able to attack these clones
would leave more descendents (because there
are more of these “common” snails than the
others) and therefore would increase faster
than those of parasites attacking snails with
rare types.

Step 1: Producing viruses with decreased fitness
First, Chao established that he could actually observe the phenomenon of
Muller’s ratchet in the laboratory. He produced viruses that had decreased
fitness due to the accumulation of harmful mutations. He did this by making
sure that his laboratory population sizes would become quite low periodi-
cally. When population sizes are low, evolution via genetic drift can lead to
fixation of deleterious mutations, which was what Chao observed. (Refer to
Chapter 6 for information about genetic drift.)
Then Chao randomly plucked a few viruses out of one flask to populate the
next flask, creating the next generation. (Whereas in a large population, the
process of natural selection would weed out less-fit genotypes, Chao increased
the chances that a harmful mutation would make it to the next generation by
randomly choosing a few individuals. In small populations, a virus that’s a
little less fit still would do fine because it wouldn’t have the more-fit strains
breathing down its neck.) By repeating this process numerous times, Chao
ended up with a population of less-fit viruses on which he could test his idea
that sexual reproduction can increase fitness.
Step 2: Testing whether viral sex leads to increased fitness
With his low-fitness viruses, Chao collaborated with Thutrang Tran and Crystal
Matthews in designing experiments to test whether viral sex leads to an increase
in fitness. The scientists grew different pairs of the debilitated viruses together
with their host bacteria, and they controlled how much sex was going on by
altering the ratio of bacteria to viruses. When they put in far fewer bacteria
than viruses, they ensured that multiple viruses would be infecting the same
host bacterium. As they increased the likelihood of producing viral progeny
that had genetic material from two parent viruses, they found that they were
more likely to find progeny with increased fitness.
Here’s why: An asexually reproducing virus will pass on all its harmful mutations
to each of its descendants, but if the descendants have genetic material from
two parents, they can end up with the best parts of both. Imagine that one virus
has a deleterious mutation on segment 1, and the other one has a deleterious
mutation on segment 2. If the viruses are reproducing in the same bacterium,
out can pop a virus with neither bad segment.
Evolution of Separate Sexes 
and the 50-50 Sex Ratio
Why do humans — and a lot of other species — have different sexes? Why
are some individuals males and others females? Evolutionary biologists have
offered a couple of suggestions to answer these questions.
200
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Given that two sexes do exist, the next question for evolutionary theory is how
many offspring of each sex an individual should make. And how is it that species
with separate sexes end up with a 50-50 sex ratio: 50 boys for every 50 girls? It
turns out that 50-50 sex ratio is something that is perfectly and easily explained
by natural selection.
Sometimes, it’s good to be discrete
“Why have males and females?” is a question that often strikes people as
surprising, because we humans are so used to having two separate sexes. It
doesn’t always have to be that way, however. In fact, in many species, the male
and female reproductive roles are combined in the same individual! These
organisms are called hermaphrodites, and if you take a moment to look out
the window, you can see that they’re just about everywhere.
Most trees are hermaphrodites, containing both male and female functions in
the same individual. Each individual apple tree, for example, makes both ovules
and pollen. Its pollen is carried to other apple trees to fertilize their ovules while
it awaits pollen from other trees to fertilize its own ovules. In the end, all the
apple trees produce fruit.
The same is true for most of the fruits you encounter in the orchard or the fruit
section of your local supermarket, but not for all of them. Persimmon trees,
for example, have distinct sexes. Some persimmon trees are male and make
just pollen; others are female and make just the ovules that become the
persimmons you buy at the store.
201
Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 
Viral sex
Sex in viruses is quite a bit different from what
we commonly think of as sex. In fact, viruses
typically reproduce asexually. In phi-6, sex
works like this:
1. The virus injects its genome, consisting of
three segments, into an unlucky bacterium.
2. The virus hijacks the cell’s biochemical
machinery to make more copies of itself.
3. Out pop progeny viruses, each of which
has copies of the three parental genome
segments.
Nothing about this process requires a second
virus. Viruses don’t need mates and are perfectly
able to reproduce asexually. Sometimes, though,
two viruses simultaneously infect the same host
cell, and all the various replicating bits get mixed
together. Now when the new viruses pop out, they
can have genome segments from both of the orig-
inal viruses (that is, one segment from one virus,
and the other two segments from the other virus).
These new viruses have two “parents” instead of
just one. This process is what scientists are refer-
ring to when they talk about viral sex.

Evolutionary biologists are still trying to figure out the exact mechanisms that
led to the evolution of separate sexes. A good place to start is to imagine 
that increased specialization toward one sex or the other resulted in increased
efficiency:
 A hermaphrodite has to produce both types of sexual organs, whereas a
single-sex individual needs to produce only one set of reproductive
organs and can devote the saved resources to additional reproduction.
 A single-sex individual can specialize in one particular task, such as finding
resources to produce eggs, whereas the other sex can specialize in 
finding mates.
One girl for every boy
Because one male is able to fertilize many females, the species will reproduce
faster if a higher proportion of females is produced. So the obvious question
is “Why not make fewer males?” The reason is one of the key principles of
evolution. 
Evolution acts most strongly at the level of the individual. The individual isn’t
concerned with the fate of the population’s genes; it’s concerned with the
fate of its own genes.
An individual’s genes are passed down through the generations in this way:
 First, the individual makes children.
 Then these children make grandchildren.
The 50-50 sex ratio makes sense when you think about the grandchild generation
in the following way. Each grandchild has exactly one mother and one father.
When the sex ratio of the children is exactly 50-50, the two sexes have identical
fitness. If the sex ratio of the children changes, the fitness of the two sexes is
no longer balanced.
Imagine a mutation that changes the sex ratio of the children in favor of the
production of females. Now more of the children are female than male. As a
consequence, the smaller number of males will average more grandchildren
than will the more numerous females. Due to the shortage of males, these males
end up producing offspring with multiple females. By producing more children,
the male offspring has greater fitness. Because of the bias in the sex ratio,
they’re in a better position to get their genes into the next generation. If there
is a mutation that favors producing more males, it will increase until the sex
ratio is again 50-50 and the two sexes have identical fitness.
202
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Whenever the sex ratio deviates from 50-50, the rare sex has a fitness advantage,
and selection responds by favoring individuals that produce more of the rare
sex until the numbers balance out again. As a result, the sex ratio never strays
very far from 50-50.
‘Sex’ in Bacteria
To spice things up a bit, I decided to end this chapter with a brief section on
sex in bacteria. In this case, I’m talking about sex in the sense of genetic 
reassortment — that is, the combining of genetic material from different 
individuals. 
Bacteria don’t need sex to reproduce. For the most part, they reproduce by
dividing in half. One bacterium makes two bacteria; then these two make
four, and so on. But occasionally, a bacterium acquires DNA from other bacte-
ria and combines that DNA with its genome; henceforth, all its descendents
have this new combination of genes.
Here are a few interesting tidbits about the product of bacterial sex:
 Bacteria don’t seem to be very picky about which bacteria they get
the new genes from. Some bacteria even absorb free DNA from the
environment and incorporate these genes into their own genomes. 
This phenomenon is especially puzzling from a fitness perspective,
because the free DNA has most likely come from bacteria that died and
ruptured, releasing their genetic material into the environment. Because
these particular bacteria died, it’s not clear why other bacteria would
want their genes.
203
Chapter 12: Evolution and Sex 
Changing sexes: Sequential hermaphrodites
An interesting example of the trade-offs inherent
in being different sexes is the special case of
sequential hermaphrodites: species that began
life as one sex but then changed into the other
sex. In some species, these organisms start out
as females and change to males; in other species,
they start out as males and change to females.
This lifestyle appears in several fish species.
In the case of female-to-male, these species
have mating systems whereby males compete
for access to females. Large males are more
successful than small males and, perhaps as a
result of this selection, have favored a system
in which small fish avoid being males. All the
fish are born females. They mature, mate with
the larger males, and reproduce. When they
become large enough to compete for mates as
males, they simply change sex. Voilà! They
grow male sex organs (female organs get reab-
sorbed) and begin battling to fertilize eggs. 

 Bacteria occasionally incorporate large numbers of genes from distantly
related bacteria. A trick like this wouldn’t even be possible for most
organisms, because even if they had a way to transfer some of the genes —
from a pine tree to a duck, for example — the resulting combination
wouldn’t actually be functional. Most organisms have tightly interconnected
sets of genes, and it’s not possible to just splice into a genome a bunch of
genes from some other organism and expect the resulting combination to
work. You probably wouldn’t end up with a functional organism.
Although scientists don’t completely understand the selective forces that
favor bacteria’s ability to incorporate foreign genes, they have the tools to
see its results. With the increase in the use of DNA sequencing — the technique
that determines the specific sequence of an organism’s DNA — scientists have
discovered that the new genes the bacteria acquire often confer new function.
Take the common intestinal bacteria E. coli. You have some of it living in you
right now. It keeps to itself and doesn’t do you any harm. It’s even possible
that by taking up space, this particular strain of E. coli keeps more harmful
bacteria from taking over your intestines. 
But some strains of E. coli don’t just sit quietly in your gut; they disrupt the
intestinal walls and cause illness. E. coli O157:H7, commonly known as Jack in
the Box E. coli, is one such strain, and it’s an especially nasty one. The reason
this particular E. coli strain causes illness is that it has picked up a variety of
toxin-producing genes from other bacteria, including a large cluster from the
bacterial species Shigella, which causes dysentery in humans and animals.
E. coli O157:H7 was first noticed in 1982, and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimates that it causes approximately 73,000 cases of illness and 61
deaths in the United States each year.
Scientists don’t have a clear understanding of what regulates bacterial sex. But
at least in the case of E. coli O157:H6, the new combination of genes seems pretty
good from the bacteria’s perspective. O157:H7 has been extremely successful.
Today, it can be found in most cattle farms and most petting zoos. So remember
to wash your hands regularly!

of Interacting Species

C
o-evolution is what happens when a change in one species selects for a
change in another species, and it’s ridiculously cool because it makes
for a lot of fascinating species interactions. When two species are evolving reci-
procally, they end up with some really beautiful patterns and neat adaptations.
I mean, think about it — cheetahs run ridiculously fast. Why? Because the ante-
lope that they chase run really fast too. The existence of cheetahs selects for
faster antelope, and those faster antelope select for faster cheetahs.
The cheetah-antelope scenario is an example of an antagonist interaction, in
which one species is looking to eat the other one. Possibly even more beauti-
ful are complicated examples of mutualism, in which, for example, plants with
long curved flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds with long curved beaks —
beaks that are curved to match the curved flowers exactly!
But even beyond how amazing all these interactions are, co-evolution serves
as a nice reminder that evolution is always about your own fitness, not some-
body else’s.
Co-evolution Defined
Co-evolution is what happens when interacting species evolve together. A
change in species A selects for a change in species B, which then selects for
another change in species A, which in turn selects for another change in
species B . . . and so on and so forth, ad infinitum.

For co-evolution to occur, the interacting species must affect each other’s
survival and reproduction — in other words, their fitness. The antelope
affects the cheetah when it avoids being eaten; the cheetah affects the ante-
lope when it eats it. By running away, antelope affect which cheetah genes
end up in the next population (hint: the fast ones). Cheetahs affect which
antelope genes end up in the next population (yep, the genes for fastness).
Having said that, I ask you to keep in mind that the strength of these interac-
tions doesn’t have to be equal. A cheetah that just misses an antelope misses
lunch; it might get one tomorrow. An antelope that just misses getting away is
lunch; it has no tomorrows. Hence, the selection on antelope by cheetahs
may be a little stronger than the selection on cheetahs by antelope.
The following sections explain the types of interactions that co-evolving
species can have and the outcomes that co-evolution can result in. The
remaining sections of this chapter offer examples of co-evolution in nature
and in the laboratory.
Co-evolution and species interactions
Co-evolution requires that two or more species interact such that they evolve
in response to each other. Sometimes, these interactions are beneficial to
both parties, sometimes they’re beneficial to just one and bad for the other,
and sometimes they’re bad for both. 
The following sections explain the main categories of species’ interactions.
Although these discussions focus on pairs of species, co-evolution can
involve interactions among more than two species. The relationship cate-
gories remain the same, regardless of how many organisms are co-evolving,
even though any one species may be interacting with other species in a vari-
ety of different ways (like trying to eat some and not get eaten by others).
Mutualism: You scratch my back; I’ll scratch yours
In a mutualistic interaction, the presence of each species has a positive effect
on the other. Bees and flowers, for example, can co-evolve mutualistically.
Another example is the sea anemone and the clown fish. The clown fish
hangs out (and even lays its eggs) around the poisonous tentacles of the
anemone, but doesn’t get stung. Why? Because of a combination of the clown
fish’s sting resistant mucus and the fact that the anemone doesn’t mind it
being there. 
Every once in awhile the clown fish will leave the safety of the stinging tenta-
cles and venture off into the surrounding waters where its bright colors make
it visible to predatory fish. When the predatory fish attacks, the clown fish
206
Part III: What Evolution Does 

heads back into the anemone, the predator pursues, and the anemone eats
the predator, leaving the scraps for the clown fish! Clown fish that lure prey
into the anemone tentacles get more food for themselves while anemones
that provide a safe haven for clown fish get more food, too. The participants
are in it for themselves, but the result is a beautiful mutualistic interaction.
Here’s a key point to keep in mind: The connotation of the term mutualism
and the fact that both of the co-evolving species benefit may lead you to
think that the species intend to help each other out. That is absolutely not
the case. Each organism does what it does for its own benefit. The fact that
it’s also benefiting the other organism is irrelevant.
Competition: Unrest in the forest
In a competitive interaction, each species has a negative effect on the other.
Take trees, for example. Why are trees tall, and why do they have trunks? The
energy that trees convert from sunlight needs to travel all the way down to
the roots, and the water from the roots needs to travel all the way up to the
leaves, but the trunk is expensive to make and not the most efficient con-
veyor of nutrients or energy. It certainly seems that a more-efficient arrange-
ment would be to have the leaves close to the water supply instead of many
feet off the ground.
The answer is that trees have to fight for light — a key ingredient in their fit-
ness. A tree can survive only if it’s tall enough not to be overshadowed by the
tree next to it. When you have to grow tall, a stem just won’t cut it. You need
something a bit more substantive — hence, the trunk. The next thing you
know, all the trees have to make trunks; otherwise, they’re overshadowed by
the trunky trees next to them.
207
Chapter 13: Co-evolution: The Evolution of Interacting Species
Commensalism
For co-evolution to occur, both species have to
be affected. For that reason, commensalism —
in which the interaction affects only one of the
partners, not both — isn’t really an example of
co-evolution, but it’s still interesting.
In commensal interactions, one species receives
a benefit, while the other remains unaffected.
Little organisms that hitch rides on bigger ones
or use them as places to live are examples. 
No evidence exists that a turtle cares whether
a little bit of algae grows on it, but the turtle
gives the algae a nice place to live. But if being
on a turtle is an important part of algal ecology,
there might be selection favoring algae that
better stick to turtles.

There’s a limit to how tall a tree can grow, of course. This limit is determined
by the amount of light that hits the forest where that particular tree grows,
the amount of rain, and the soil condition and type. These factors limit how
much energy a tree can devote to making trunks. Another limiting factor is
wind, which may blow a tree down when the tree is too tall.
Predation and parasitism: I’m a giver; you’re a taker
In both predation and parasitism, one species has a positive effect on the
second species, but the second species has a negative effect on the first.
Examples are predators and parasites. Antelope are good for cheetahs, but
cheetahs are bad for antelope. Ditto a dog and its fleas.
The antelope-cheetah interaction is an example of predation. The dog-flea
interaction is an example of parasitism. Whether the system is one or the
other depends on whether the parasitic organism wants to eat all of you or
some of you. In some parasitic interactions — such as deadly parasitic dis-
eases, to which you succumb in the end — there’s not much fitness differ-
ence being eaten by a cheetah or wasting away from a disease. You’re dead
either way. You can read about co-evolving disease organisms in “Diseased
Systems: Parasitic Co-evolution,” later in this chapter.
When the interactions change
As you think about co-evolution, keep in mind that these interactions aren’t
always completely fixed in nature. The type of co-evolution between species
can change over time. Bees, for example, need nectar; flowers need pollina-
tors. The two species co-evolve in a mutualism: Their interaction is mutually
beneficial because when the bee takes the nectar, the flower gets pollinated.
Now imagine a mutation in bees that results in their boring holes in the side
of flowers and sucking up the nectar. The system has gone from being mutu-
ally beneficial to being parasitic: One species benefits to the detriment of the
208
Part III: What Evolution Does 
The pronghorn antelope
Evolution has an endless number of fascinating
stories, and here’s another one for your reading
pleasure. The fastest land mammal in North
America is the pronghorn antelope, which can
outrun by a substantial margin absolutely every-
thing that it might ever come across. Why on
earth does it run so fast? How could natural
selection have caused that speed if nothing is
chasing this antelope?
Well, as it turns out, even though no cheetahs
exist in North America today, plenty of cheetah
fossils turn up on the continent. I can’t say for
sure that those fossil cheetahs used to chase
pronghorns, but they did chase something, and
they ran very fast (info gleaned from their bone
structure being similar to that of modern chee-
tahs in Africa).

other. The flowers’ nectar is gone, and no pollination has taken place because
the bees aren’t coming anywhere near where the pollen is or needs to be.
In response, natural selection will favor plants that keep the bees from get-
ting the nectar. Selection may make the flower harder to chew through, in
which case plants that happen to have thicker flowers are going to leave
more descendents because they still have some nectar left in them to attract
other pollinators. The process is still co-evolution, but a transition from one
type of interaction to another has occurred.
Outcomes of co-evolution 
In co-evolution, one organism evolves to its own benefit in response to the
other organism. As one changes, the other changes. So what’s the endpoint
for all this change? 
In antagonistic interactions, the end point could be that one organism elimi-
nates the other. In mutualisms, the end point would be when there’s no fur-
ther selection for a tighter association. In the example of the long-flowered
orchid and the long-tongued moth, unless something changes to make the
association less or more beneficial for either organism, the flower’s length
and the moth’s tongue are plenty long enough. Other times, the end point is
just that an organism has reached the limits of how tall or fast or whatever it
can be. 
The Red Queen
One possible outcome is a scenario referred to as the Red Queen hypothesis.
The expression comes from Alice in Wonderland, in which the queen runs in
place but doesn’t get anywhere.
In the Red Queen scenario, species that co-evolve essentially run in place.
You can find lots of examples in the co-evolution of plants and insects. When
a plant evolves a novel chemical defense mechanism, for example, it drives
the insects to evolve a novel detoxification mechanism. You can also see 
the Red Queen scenario in the fossil record. Fossil evidence shows steady
advances in characteristics such as shell thickness and brain size in preda-
tors and prey.
You can think of co-evolution acting this way if you imagine it in the context
of an arms race. To give itself an edge, each side evolves new or better adap-
tations, which the other side counteracts as it adapts in response. At the
start of WWI, for example, pilots shot at each other from the cockpit with pis-
tols. Frightfully fearsome — until somebody strapped a whole machine gun
to the front of a plane. Reciprocal adaptations of this sort took aircraft from
209
Chapter 13: Co-evolution: The Evolution of Interacting Species

the wood-and-fabric aeroplanes that the Red Baron flew over the fields of
France to the carbon-fiber-and-titanium jets that fighter pilots “strap on” today.
Where does that leave the respective air forces? Traveling faster than the
speed of sound but not really much ahead of the other guy.
Extinction
Another possible outcome of co-evolution is that one of the participants can’t
keep up and goes extinct. Obviously, scientists don’t see these systems,
because one of the participants no longer exists, but they know from the
fossil record that extinction is a common phenomenon. Lots of organisms
that used to be around just couldn’t keep up.
A little stability
Yet another possible outcome is that the process leads to some, at least tem-
porarily, stable end point. An example would be cheetahs and antelope
whizzing across the plains of Africa at 65 miles an hour. Given the physics of
the mammalian body plan, animals are unlikely to evolve to run at the speed
of sound. The cheetah is at the current upper limit of animal land mammal
speed. (Scientists don’t know how much faster an animal could run, but they
know that some upper limit must exist.)
Interactions between Plants and Animals
Some of the best examples of co-evolution involve interactions among plants,
animals, and insects. These interactions revolve around:
 Sex (more specifically, reproduction through pollination or seed dis-
persal): Plant reproduction relies on getting pollinated or sowing seeds.
The flowers of some plants, for example, require particular pollinators;
not just any animal or insect will do. In this case, the co-evolutionary
pair — the plant and the specific pollinator — evolve to maximize their
own fitness, each trying to get more of what’s good for it from the other.
Other plants don’t require a specific pollinator; they share pollinators
with other plants. In these cases, the plant species have to compete, so
natural selection favors traits that make each species better than the
other at attracting pollinators.
 Protection in exchange for room and board: In some systems, plants
provide food and shelter to insects in return for the protection that the
insects provide.
Although these instances certainly aren’t the only examples of co-evolution,
they offer a good glimpse of the way interactions among species can influence
210
Part III: What Evolution Does 

the characteristics that the species evolve. Also, they let me write about a
moth that has a 10-inch-long tongue.
Pollination wars
Pollination involves plants and often insects. (Forget pollination by other ani-
mals — such as birds and bats — and wind for now; those situations aren’t
important in this discussion.) Each species has a vested interest in getting
what it needs. The plant, for example, is trying to get its pollen to (or get
pollen from) another plant of the same species. To do that, the plant needs 
to spend effort and resources on attracting pollinators. It has absolutely no
interest in helping its pollinator unless, by doing so, it helps itself. For its
part, the insect (or pollinator) cares nothing about whether the plant gets
pollinated; it’s after the reward offered, or promised, by the plant.
Ideally, plants want a pollinator that’s very species-specific — that is, attracted
only to plants of the same species. After all, what good is a pollinator that
dumps your pollen on incompatible plants? With a species-specific pollinator,
the plant would be assured that its pollen would go to an individual of the
same species.
Consider the orchid species that has nectar 10 inches down in a very long,
thin flower. Based on his study of this orchid, Charles Darwin predicted that
the pollinator would be a moth with a 10-inch tongue. At the time, no one had
ever seen a moth with a tongue that long, and people considered his idea to
be pretty ridiculous. But 40 years after Darwin’s prediction, exactly such a
moth was found — and whaddya know, it turned out to be the pollinator of
this particular orchid. In honor of Darwin’s prediction, the moth was named
Xanthopan morgani subspecies praedicta, just barely beating out Darwin-He’s-
the-Man Moth.
The example of the moth with the long tongue shows the benefits of a tight
association between the two mutualists. The orchid gets its pollen delivered
only to its own species while the moth gets access to resources that the
shorter tongued moths can’t reach. But there are also potential downsides 
to being involved in such a tight interaction:
 If one of the partners is absent, then the other is out of luck. And if one
species should go extinct, the other one might not be far behind.
 It reduces the probability of dispersal to new environments. Imagine an
orchid seed carried on the wind to a remote island. The soil’s just right,
the temperature is perfect, and lots of other plants are doing just fine.
But that orchid had better hope that some of those moths get blown
over to the island too! Because if none do, then that wandering orchid 
is doomed.
211
Chapter 13: Co-evolution: The Evolution of Interacting Species

The evolution of pollination by animals
How animal pollination evolved in the first place is fun to think about.
Pollination by animals has been an incredibly successful strategy for plants.
Not that wind pollination doesn’t work, but it has its disadvantages, first of
which is the fact that the plant has to make a huge amount of pollen, because
most of it isn’t going to get anywhere near the target.
An interesting feature of wind pollination is that the plant needs to be able to
snatch the pollen from the air. Toward this end, some plants have developed
sticky fluids that assist in pollen capture. Some scientists envision that
animal pollination arose when insects or other animals fed on these plant
secretions and, as a result, moved pollen from one plant to another.
Figs and wasps: I couldn’t live without you, baby
One of the classic examples of a mutualistic interaction is that between figs
and the wasps that pollinate them.
The fig’s reproductive structure is complicated. The flowering portion of the
fig is a hollow structure with male flowers on the outside and female flowers,
which produce seeds, on the inside (which is called the syconium, but I’m
guessing that you don’t care!). Here’s what happens:
1. A female wasp arrives at one of these structures and gathers pollen. She
then enters and deposits pollen on the female flowers within and also
deposits an egg in each of the ovules that she can reach. Then she dies. 
2. The eggs hatch; the larvae feed on the developing seeds; the larvae
pupate; and adult wasps emerge. 
3. The males mate with females and chew a hole through which the females
depart. The male promptly dies; lacking wings, he wasn’t going any-
where anyway.
So how is it good for the plant to have eggs dumped inside it, its developing
seeds eaten, and a hole chewed through it? As it turns out, the female flowers
on the inside are different lengths. Some are too long for the wasp to reach
down and deposit an egg on. As a result, some seeds escape predation by the
developing wasps. So the wasp gets food for her offspring, and the fig gets a
very reliable pollinator. 
Even though in this case the plant and the insect are completely reliant on
each other for survival, each species is acting in its own interests. The fig
wasps don’t pollinate the fig tree because they care about the fig; they do it
because their offspring will feast on the developing seeds. And successful fig
trees are the ones that produce seeds above and beyond the ones that get
eaten. The wasp uses the fig; the fig uses the wasp; and the species are so
212
Part III: What Evolution Does 

tightly co-evolved that each would go extinct without the other (what scien-
tists term an obligate mutualism) because each species of wasp pollinates
only a single species of fig, and vice versa. But they’re still not pals!
Oh, and if you’ve been keeping track of the dead wasps, you’ve noted that
every time you eat a fig, you’re eating a few dead wasps, too. Don’t worry,
though; they’re very tiny — small enough to fit through the eye of a needle.
Your cheatin’ heart: Non-mutualism pollinators
Some plants don’t play fair. They cheat to get what they want and leave the
poor, gullible insects no better off for their trouble. Basically, the plant tricks
the pollinator into visiting the flower with the promise of a good time or a
good meal and then doesn’t pay up. As you can imagine, the interactions
between these plants and their unsuspecting pollinators are not mutualistic;
one of the partners is coming out behind. In these cases, co-evolution acts to
make the plant better at deceiving the pollinator and the pollinator better at
not being deceived.
A couple of examples:
 Some plants have flowers that smell like rotting meat. These flowers are
pollinated by flies and beetles that arrive expecting to find a carcass.
Instead, they end up getting a dusting of the flower’s pollen, which they
deposit the next time they make the same mistake.
 Several species of orchids have evolved the ability to attract male
insects by mimicking the sex pheromones, and sometimes the shape, of
the female insect. Imagining what happens in this case is easy: The male
insect pounces on the orchid and makes a really good attempt at mating
with the flower, getting covered with pollen in the process. In the end, he
gives up because the process just isn’t going very well and flies off to
find a different female. But he may end up on another orchid and trans-
fer the pollen that he picked up on the first orchid.
Don’t blame the poor male insects for being clueless. The compounds
that the female insects use to attract males are actually very similar
chemically to the waxy substances that the orchid uses to avoid drying
out. You can easily imagine how at some point, one or a few mutations
resulted in an orchid that smelled good in a whole different way.
Parasitic non-pollinators
Just as some plants avoid giving a reward, some animals take the reward but
don’t provide any pollination services. Think back to the 10-inch-long flower.
Many flowers have deep (though not quite so extreme) nectar sources, which
make them inaccessible to insects with short proboscises. 
213
Chapter 13: Co-evolution: The Evolution of Interacting Species

Some insects have developed a clever solution to this problem: They just hold
the base of the flower, chew a hole, and slurp out the nectar, never getting
anywhere near the pollen. In this case, the insect is a parasite of the flower. As
the species co-evolve, the plant species is selected to have less-chewable flow-
ers, and the insect is selected to be better able to chew its way to the nectar.
Sharing pollinators
Plants that share pollinators have to compete to attract them. This competi-
tion among plants introduces another place for selection to operate. Plants
that rely on the same pollinators, for example, will be selected to flower at
different times.
By flowering in a narrow window of time, a plant increases the chance that its
pollen will go to an individual of the same species. Similarly, a species of
plant that flowers at a time when other species don’t has better access to 
pollinators and, as a result, is more likely to leave descendents.
Seed dispersal
If seeds are light and small, they can be dispersed by wind. The problem with
this system is that the plant has to make a lot of seeds, because most of them
end up in the wrong place.
Having an animal disperse your seeds can solve this problem, though it may
introduce others (the animal might eat your seeds). Animals can move larger
seeds, and they provide a bit more specificity in where the seeds end up. If a
particular bird is eating a particular fruit, that bird is known to visit places
where that particular kind of plant can grow and may end up depositing the
seeds in a similar habitat. This system is how mistletoe seeds get dispersed.
Mistletoe is a parasitic plant that grows on other plants. Mistletoe fruit is
eaten and the seeds dispersed by perching birds, which conveniently deposit
the seeds right onto another potential host plant. The fruit is the lure that
gets the birds to eat the seed.
Not all relationships that result in seed dispersal are mutualisms, of course.
Some plants are very good at getting animals to disperse their seeds without
giving any reward. If you’ve ever had to pull seeds out of your socks or off
your dog after a hike, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Some plants
have evolved quite clever mechanisms that allow their seeds to be attached
to animals.
Not all seed or fruit eaters disperse the seeds; some just digest those as well,
setting up another co-evolutionary interaction that has resulted in plants pro-
ducing seeds with toxins and animals developing the ability to cope with
these toxins.
214
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Trading food and shelter for defense
This mutualism is my favorite one, occurring between the bullthorn acacia
(Acacia cornigera) and the ant Pseudomyrmex ferrugiea.
The bullthorn acacia has large hollow thorns where ants live, and it produces
nectar (not associated with flowers) and protein-rich structures that the ants
eat. The ants patrol the plant and sting anything that tries to nibble or land
on it, and they clear the ground under and around the plant, killing any plants
that might compete with the host acacia.
Not such a big deal, right? Wrong. The bullthorn acacia is unusual. Other aca-
cias don’t produce extrafloral nectaries; they don’t produce the protein struc-
tures, which have no known function other than to feed the ants; and they’re
poisonous, producing chemicals to defend against herbivores. The bullthorn
acacia doesn’t have these characteristics because it doesn’t need them; it
has the ants instead.
And let me tell you, these ants really hurt when they sting. I know because I
checked — personally. And I’m not the only person who thinks so. The
Schmidt Sting Pain Index — yes, there really is one; you can see for yourself
by going to http://scientiaestpotentia.blogspot.com/2006/06/
schmidt-sting-pain-index.html — rates them at 1.8 (a bald-faced
hornet gets a 2) and describes the pain as “A rare, piercing, elevated sort of
pain. Someone has fired a staple into your cheek.” Someone there must have
been stung, too, which just goes to prove the lengths to which scientists will
go to collect data.
Disease Systems: Parasitic Co-evolution
In host-parasite systems — specifically, disease systems — one member of
the co-evolving pair preys on the other. In such a system, scientists expect
the host to evolve increased resistance to the parasite. All things being equal,
being resistant must always be better.
So how should scientists expect the disease organism to evolve? A common
misconception is that selection will cause the disease organism to evolve in a
way that’s less harmful to its host. The rationale: Because the disease organ-
ism needs the host, it should be nice (i.e., less virulent) to it. (Virulence refers
to the fitness decrease that results from infection with a particular disease. A
disease that kills you right away has a high virulence; if it just gives you the
sniffles, and you can still make it to the office, it has a low virulence.)
215
Chapter 13: Co-evolution: The Evolution of Interacting Species

But that’s not the way it works. To a disease organism, maximum fitness isn’t
just about surviving; it’s also about spreading to other hosts. Therefore, evo-
lution selects for whatever virulence level makes the disease more effectively
transmitted. A disease will become highly virulent, for example, when high
virulence increases its fitness even as it decreases its host’s fitness.
The specific virulence that maximizes fitness varies from organism to organ-
ism, based on how the disease is transmitted. This point is key. No one
“right” level of virulence exists. The common cold won’t be more fit if it kills
me before I can make it to school, but when I’m at school, it’s more fit if it
makes me cough on someone else. 
Bunnies in the Outback
Australia didn’t have any native rabbits. A few were introduced in the mid-
1800s, and by the mid-1900s, Australia had half a billion. That’s a lot of rabbits.
In 1950, the myxoma virus was introduced to control the rabbit population.
The virus, which had an extremely high fatality rate, was very effective. But
soon after it was introduced, the virus evolved to be less virulent.
Here’s why: The virus was spread from rabbit to rabbit via mosquitoes, which
bit infected rabbits and transferred the virus to uninfected rabbits. It just so
happened that if the host rabbits had survived longer, a greater chance
existed that a mosquito would bite an infected rabbit and transfer the virus
to a new host.
That being the case, you’d think that the virus would eventually evolve
extremely low virulence to maximize the opportunity for transmission. But
this didn’t happen either, because mosquito transmission is maximized if 
the rabbit is covered with virus-filled lesions on which mosquitoes can feed.
(If that situation sounds like it’s bad for the rabbit, that’s because it is.)
The myxoma virus needs a certain level of virulence to be transmitted to a
new host. It’s not good for the virus to kill its host immediately or to float
around in the bloodstream relatively harmlessly. But it is good for the virus 
if the host is covered with lesions.
The rabbit population wasn’t taking this virus lying down; it was evolving to
be more resistant to the virus. As the rabbit population became more resis-
tant, the virus population evolved increased virulence to maintain maximum
mosquito transmissibility.
Scientists know all these things because the original rabbits (from places
other than Australia that had never been exposed to the myxoma virus) 
and the original virus were still available for study. Using the original virus,
216
Part III: What Evolution Does 

scientists showed that the rabbits living in Australia evolved increased resis-
tance. Using the original rabbit population, scientists showed that the viru-
lence of the virus in the Australian rabbit population first decreased but then
increased in concert with the increased resistance of the host rabbit popula-
tion. So there you have it — a classic example of host-disease co-evolution in
a natural setting.
Disease-host interaction in the lab
In trying to understand disease-host interaction, Sharon Messenger, Ian
Molineux, and J.J. Bull conducted an experiment to examine how different
viral transfer mechanisms affect the relative advantage of different levels 
of viral virulence. The two basic types of transfer mechanisms are
 Vertical: Transmission from parent to descendent (essentially, transmis-
sion through time)
 Horizontal: Transmission from one individual to the next in the current
time
What they discovered is that when many hosts are available, a virus that
harms its host but increases the chance that its progeny will infect new hosts
is favored. But when few hosts are available (that is, a reduced chance of hor-
izontal transfer exists), selection favors a virus that’s less harmful to its host,
because only through the host’s survival and reproduction can the virus sur-
vive and reproduce.
The experiment used bacteria and a virus that infects the bacteria. The experi-
ment first selected for different varieties of the virus that had a range of effects
on host growth rate. More-benevolent strains had a small effect on host growth
rate but couldn’t be transmitted horizontally, and less-benevolent strains had a
larger effect on host growth rate and could be transmitted horizontally. This
part of the experiment generated a variable virus population. After the experi-
menters had variation of exactly the sort that interested them in their virus
population, they were able to set up different experimental scenarios to see
when the different viral variants would have higher fitness.
Taking a 50-50 mixture of bacteria infected with the two viral types, the scien-
tists grew them in the presence or absence of additional bacteria that either
were or weren’t susceptible to infection. After allowing time for viral and bac-
terial reproduction, they assessed the relative proportion of the two viral
types at the end of the experiment. As predicted, in the absence of an oppor-
tunity for horizontal transfer, lower virulence was selectively favored. In the
presence of available susceptible host bacteria, the less-benevolent viral
strain was favored even though it was more harmful to its host.

of Development
In This Chapter
 Developing an understanding of development
 Discovering how a little change can make a big difference
 Finding the deep similarities between very different animals
A
species with one particular form can give rise to a species with another
form. Take humans and fruit flies, for example. They have a common
ancestor somewhere in the distant past. This common ancestor gave rise to
two very different organisms. The question is how. What process is at work
that results in such different creatures?
The answer has to do with the interplay between evolution and development,
which is one of the hottest areas of current evolutionary research and one 
in which today’s scientists are able to learn lots of things that people back in
Charles Darwin’s time didn’t have a clue about.
This chapter talks primarily about the development of animals because animal
development is for the most part deterministic — that is, all the members of
the species end up looking pretty much identical, at least structurally. Humans
have two arms, two legs, one heart, one head, and so on, and all these parts
need to be in the right places. Compare this structure with that of a maple
tree; branches can go every which way, and their reproductive structures
(flowers) can be all over the place. Lop off one of the branches, and another
one may grow and produce its own flowers — definitely not the way that
human structures work! All this doesn’t mean that plants don’t have develop-
ment; they’re just a little bit more free-form about it.

Defining Development: 
From Embryo to Adult
Development, in evolutionary terms, refers to the process by which a fertil-
ized egg develops into the adult form.
By adult form, I don’t mean that the organism has reached the age of majority
and is heading off to college — or, for that matter, has reached sexual matu-
rity and is getting ready to set up its own pride on the Serengeti. In evolution-
ary terms, development ends when the organism has all its parts, that is,
when it has its final shape. In this context, adult doesn’t mean grown up.
The time frame for development differs for each organism, but the process
starts with a single cell, which develops as a result of
 Cell division: The process whereby one cell splits into two, two into
four, four into eight, and so on.
 Differentiation: The process whereby one lineage of cells gives rise to
different types of cells of another lineage, such as a skin cell or a heart-
muscle cell, or any number of other types of cells. 
The embryo stage starts with the first cell division and goes until the organ-
ism has all its adult parts. This stage doesn’t end at birth (most animals
aren’t born, but develop from eggs outside the mother) but at some time
before birth, when all the parts that will be recognizable in the adult organ-
ism have formed. The organism has legs, eyes, all the various internal organ
systems, and so on. As you can imagine in complex organisms such as mam-
mals, pinning down exactly when the embryo stage ends is difficult. The key
is that you know it when you see it: The developing embryo looks like a little
version of the adult organism.
Humans have a lot more names for various stages of development. In human
reproduction, you hear the terms zygote (to refer to the fertilized egg), embryo
(to mean any stage of development before birth or the particular early stage
of development), fetus (to refer to later developmental stages), and pain in
the keister (to refer to the teenage years). Don’t let these alternative uses 
confuse you. In this chapter, the term embryo refers to the developmental
stage from the first cell division to the formation of all the adult parts.
220
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Under construction: The development
process in action
Starting from a single cell, the embryo divides and grows. As this growth pro-
gresses, different lineages of cells become specialized to perform different
tasks. All the cells in the organism contain the same DNA — the same instruc-
tions, but the instructions are expressed differently in the different cells. In
this way, the various structures of the organism develop.
From initial populations of cells that haven’t yet specialized (called pluripo-
tent cells) and that can transition into any cell type, specific cell lineages are
derived. These pluripotent cells are called embryonic stem cells. Some will
give rise to skin cells, others to bone cells, and so on.
After cells have transitioned to specific cell types, the lineage’s future appears
to be fixed. Skin cells divide to produce other skin cells, for example; they
can’t make other types of cells. Liver cells grow, divide, and go on to form the
liver; they don’t go popping up in other parts of the body.
Scientists have made great strides in understanding how this process works,
and I go into some of the details in the next sections. But for now, keep two
things in mind:
 Starting from cells with exactly the same DNA, it’s possible to obtain cells
of very many types. One component of the development process is the
mechanism by which this differentiation occurs.
 To make an organism, the different cell types have to develop in the cor-
rect place. The spatial patterning within the developing embryo is a key
to creating a viable organism. (The liver needs to develop in the abdomen,
for example, not in the skull!)
The effect of environment
An organism’s phenotype (physical characteristics) is a result of the interac-
tion between its genotype (genetic makeup) and the environment. A person
with the genetic potential to be 7 feet tall won’t achieve that height in the
absence of proper diet, for example. A malnourished person will be stunted
compared with a genetically identical individual who was well fed. The
impact of the environment on the developing organism is called environmen-
tal effects, and one way that the environment can affect phenotype is by
affecting development. (You can read more about what affects phenotype in
Chapters 4 and 7.)
221
Chapter 14: Evo-Devo: The Evolution of Development

The following sections highlight examples of environmental effects. Here’s
the take-home message: Small changes in the regulation of development in
genetically similar individuals can have major effects.
The development of queen vs. worker bees
A beehive consists of at least one queen bee who lays the eggs, a larger
number of worker bees who tend the eggs, and developing larvae. The queen
and worker bees look very different. The most noticeable difference is the
size of the queen: she’s much larger than the workers. Yet the size difference
isn’t the result of different genes. 
Whether an egg develops into a queen or into a worker bee depends on its
environment within the hive, specifically whether it’s fed exclusively royal
jelly for the first days of its life. Royal jelly is a substance produced by special
glands of worker bees and fed to all larvae. An all-royal-jelly diet equals a new
queen.
The existence of different castes in bees (and in other social hymenoptera —
a class of insects that includes ants and wasps) offers a nice example of how
changes in the path of development can result in organisms with different
body forms. We know that any female bee can become a worker or a queen —
the final form isn’t based on differences at the DNA sequence level but
instead on differences in how those genes are expressed. 
Researchers can look at patterns of gene expression in developing bees and
figure out exactly which genes are regulated differently in queens versus
workers. Queens develop from eggs that experience an increase in the pro-
duction of metabolic enzymes and that regulate the genes associated with
hormonal activity differently.
The Thrifty Phenotype hypothesis: Genes for flexibility
For mammals, the embryo develops within the mother; therefore, the mater-
nal environment influences development. Because one major component of
the maternal environment is how well nourished Mom is, embryonic develop-
ment may respond to changes in maternal nutrition — a position that med-
ical evidence seems to support. 
Medical evidence indicates that a fetus deprived of nutrition during key parts
of development will develop into a baby with a greater degree of metabolic
thriftiness, a group of characteristics that reduce caloric requirements (smaller
size and lower metabolism, for example).
Some scientists postulate that these fetal changes may be the result of natural
selection; genes that allow a developing human embryo to better prepare for
existence outside the mother will be selectively favored. This hypothesis is
called the Thrifty Phenotype hypothesis, and it goes something like this: Some
222
Part III: What Evolution Does 

of the fetal developmental changes observed in low-birth-weight babies may
have been adaptive early in human history. If the mother’s condition pre-
dicted low food availability when the baby was born (for example, she was
deprived of food during pregnancy), genes that allowed for developmental
flexibility — like growing slowly, but more efficiently, when food is scarce —
may be selectively advantageous.
From an evolutionary viewpoint, what the fetus would be responding to is
unclear. The condition of the mother could correlate with any of the following:
 The environment in which the mother was living
 The mother’s ability to provide resources
 The environment in which the adult offspring would find itself as pre-
dicted by the mother’s environment (in those situations in which the
environment changes slowly over a time scale longer than the organ-
ism’s generation time)
But the jury’s still out on whether natural selection had anything to do with
the fact that human embryos may develop differently when maternal resources
are scarce. At this point, the Thrifty Phenotype hypothesis is pure specula-
tion (often the first part of scientific inquiry). What’s not speculation is that
embryonic developmental changes do occur, which unfortunately are related
to other medical problems, such as diabetes and obesity, so being able to
identify the cause and the mechanism by which the development pathway 
is altered is medically important. 
The thrifty phenotype hypothesis postulates genes for plasticity, genes that
allow the developing fetus to develop to be more or less thrifty based on the
maternal environment. This hypothesis is different from the thrifty genotype
hypothesis, which states that natural selection for particular genes in some
human populations makes these individuals more metabolically efficient.
This theory has been implicated in diseases among Native Americans who
are now subjected to the modern American diet. 
Little changes mean a lot
Given that environmental factors can alter developmental trajectories (think
queen bee), it’s not surprising that changes in the DNA sequence of develop-
mental genes will do so as well. In fact, as you probably can guess, small
changes in developmental genes can have tremendous impact on the adult
organism. Take flies that have grown legs where their eyes should be (see
Figure 14-1). This example is a little bit Frankenstein-like (and not too good for
the poor fly that happened to have this mutation), but it’s a wonderful exam-
ple of a small change in development that has a big change in morphology.
223

What the fly example shows is how small mutational changes in regulatory
systems can influence the diversification of multi-cellular organisms. Scientists
had been struggling to reconcile how the small mutations we see all the time —
a DNA letter or two changed here, a few bases deleted there — could result in
major changes in body plan. Now scientists know from laboratory evidence
that tiny changes in DNA sequence can have major implications.
With the fly, scientists noticed the mutation and tried to figure out what had
happened. What they discovered was that a single mutation in a gene that acts
early in flies’ larval development results in antennae where eyes should be. In
other words, while this fly was still just an innocent little maggot, the pattern
of development that resulted in the adult fly had already been determined.
A small change in a single gene involved in development can cause a large
change in the final phenotype.
Key Ideas about Evo-Devo
As I’m fond of mentioning throughout this book, biology has come a long way
since Darwin’s day, and the field of developmental biology is another good
example. Today, scientists are busy trying to figure out exactly how genes

work; in Darwin’s time, they were struggling just to understand what genes
might be. Absent all the molecular techniques available today, it’s no surprise
that the study of embryology in the mid-1800s involved primarily the exami-
nation of embryos from different stages of development.
The following sections look at what early embryologists found — or, more
accurately, what they thought they found — and explains what scientists
know today.
Developmental stages = 
Evolutionary stages
According to biologist Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), the developmental stages
that an embryo passes through reveal the evolutionary history of the species.
In other words — and brace yourself; it’s a mouthful — the ontogeny (the
developmental process) recapitulates (summarizes) phylogeny (the evolution-
ary history).
Haeckel saw in the various stages of mammalian development what he
described as stages of development corresponding to specific ancestral
species. At one point in their development, for example, human embryos
have a tail-like structure, which was thought to signify tailed ancestors.
Earlier developmental stages included pharyngeal arches, which were
thought to resemble gill slits. This feature was taken to indicate that the
developing human embryo passes through a fishlike stage.
Haeckel’s investigations were conducted during a period when Darwin’s
theory of evolution by natural selection and the concept of the common
ancestry of all life were stimulating a fair amount of research. The proposi-
tion that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny was seen as being consistent with
Darwinian theory, though it was difficult to understand why such a pattern
would occur.
Today, scientists understand that the different stages a developing embryo
goes through are in no way the equivalents of other species in the tree of life.
There is no fish stage in mammalian development, for example. But humans
do have structures that are homologous to (share the same ancestor with)
structures that a fish has, and some of these structures are most evident at
early embryological stages.
Two traits that are homologous have a common ancestor. The wings of birds,
for example, are all homologous. All birds are descended from an initial bird
ancestor. Go back farther, and you can see that the front limbs of all tetrapods
(four-footed animals and the things descended from them — so whales and
snakes are called tetrapods, too, as are humans) are homologous. Your arms,
225
Chapter 14: Evo-Devo: The Evolution of Development

the wings of all birds, the front legs of crocodiles, and the front flippers of
dolphins all trace back to the first tetrapod. Homologous characters can be
similar in appearance, but they don’t have to be. Contrast that with analo-
gous. The wings of birds and the wings of butterflies are analogous. They
have similar functions, but not as a result of having a common evolutionary
ancestor. Insect wings are derived from very different parts than are the front
limbs of ducks, for example.
Although Haeckel’s idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny turns out not
to be true, he was right in thinking that embryology can tell scientists some-
thing about evolution. Today, 150 years later, scientists have a much better
handle on what that something is.
Earlier vs. later stages
For related species, earlier stages of development are usually more similar
than later stages. In the early stages of human and chimpanzee development,
the fetuses are very similar, but as development proceeds, the developmental
pathways diverge.
For a more detailed example, take crustaceans. Crustaceans include critters
you’ve heard of, such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimp. But the group also con-
tains some members that aren’t immediately recognizable as being related to
crabs and lobsters. Perhaps the best example is the barnacle. Barnacles,
believe it or not, are really quite like lobsters. Although an adult lobster
(mmm, mmm, good) is quite a bit different from an adult barnacle (not deli-
cious at all), the early larval stages are extremely similar. 
In the early stages of development, the different members of a group are
extremely similar, but as development proceeds, the specific adult features of
each group are expressed. From this fact, researchers discovered that much
of the diversification in body structure within the crustacean group results
from developmental shifts later in development.
It’s all in the timing
Haeckel was a clever guy, and although he didn’t quite hit the nail on the
head with ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny, he did recognize the impor-
tance of developmental timing in differences among species. Developmental
timing is also important within the same species, with small changes during
the embryonic level having dramatic effects at the adult level.
The fancy word for a change in developmental timing is heterochrony, which
includes any of the following:
226

 A change in the start or end of a developmental stage
 A change in the rate of a process
 The loss of the developmental stage
Human babies
If you like watching nature shows on TV, you’ve probably seen films of animals
being born. The newborn tiger/wildebeest/whatever shakes itself off, stumbles
to its feet, and trots along after Mom. If you’ve had children of your own, you
probably noticed that your newborn didn’t do that, even though the newborns
of all our closest relatives — chimpanzees, gorillas, and so on — are reason-
ably mobile from day one. Humans are the branch of the primate family tree in
which something changed.
To make a long story short, human babies are born before their heads are fin-
ished developing. (If you’ve had a baby pass through your birth canal, you
might realize that a malleable skull made delivery easier; if it still didn’t seem
like a stroll through the park, remember that evolution often involves com-
promises!) The human child’s head and brain continue to develop and grow
after birth. This process of juvenile traits persisting later in development is
called neoteny.
The Mexican salamander
In a more-extreme form of neoteny, development doesn’t progress past the
larval stage. One example is the Mexican salamander Ambystoma mexicanum,
a species that’s currently endangered because it lives in a single Mexican lake
that’s been heavily affected by human activities.
Salamanders typically progress from an aquatic larval stage to a terrestrial
stage, but the Mexican salamander doesn’t pass beyond the aquatic stage.
The gonads mature, but the rest of the body keeps its larval form. It appears
that this form originated through mutation in a thyroid hormone, and individ-
uals can be made to change into a form more typical of adult salamanders if
you give them hormone injections. A small mutation results in a dramatic
shift in development — in the case of this particular salamander species,
resulting in an adult that is entirely aquatic.
These salamanders have a couple of interesting features:
 They have enhanced regenerative abilities. They’re able to manufacture
replacement body parts to a degree much greater than that of salaman-
ders that reach the terrestrial stage. In fact, if they’re forced to metamor-
phose to the typical adult form via thyroid hormone injections, they lose
this regenerative ability. It’s the typical “Do I want great power or good
looks?” dilemma. Unfortunately, these little critters don’t get to decide for
themselves. Why? Read on.
227
Chapter 14: Evo-Devo: The Evolution of Development

 They’re not uncommon pets in America. You’d be surprised at the
number of parents who let their kids have creatures with fully mature
gonads in a larval body that’s able to regenerate larval parts as necessary. 
The Caribbean tree frog
You’d think that mutations that prevent development from progressing to the
next stage or that eliminate a stage are not good. Interestingly enough, the
resulting mutants sometimes survive. In the case of one Caribbean tree frog,
they do very well indeed.
When you think of the developmental stages of frogs, you probably think of
tadpoles. Well, the Caribbean tree frog Eleutherodactylus coqui is a frog with
no tadpoles; its developmental pathway has lost the tadpole stage. Eggs
develop directly into very tiny frogs.
As a result of this developmental shift, the species is able to live in areas
without bodies of water, which tadpoles require for development. These 
frogs can live in trees, and they colonize mountainous regions where ponds
are rare.
Here’s an interesting tidbit about these frogs: They’ve unfortunately and acci-
dentally been introduced into Hawaii, where they’re doing extremely well.
Hawaii has so many Caribbean tree frogs, in fact, and their calls are so loud
that people are reportedly being kept awake! (People who finally do get to
sleep are generally awakened again by the thousands of introduced wild
chickens — which, on the island of Kauai, have no natural predators, but
that’s a story for another day.)
Why any of this is important
The evolution of development is still a young area of evolutionary biology,
but it’s already extremely important. Understanding the interaction between
evolution and development can help scientists figure out the following:
 How specific developmental processes affect the outcome of natural
selection. When researchers know how processes work, they can under-
stand the kinds of changes expected to result from random mutations.
 How the developmental process itself evolves. The genes that are
responsible for determining body pattern, called the Hox genes (see the
later section “Genes Responsible for Development: Hox Genes”), are
slightly different from one class of organism to another. Hox genes of
mammals differ from the Hox genes of insects, indicating that the
machinery itself is evolving.
228
Part III: What Evolution Does 

 How the great diversity of animals on Earth could have evolved from
a common ancestor. DNA sequence data has allowed researchers to
refine the picture of the tree of life and the details of the branching
process, but DNA sequence information by itself does not explain how
so many varied body plans can have arisen from a common ancestor.
Knowledge of developmental controls, as well as laboratory experiments
showing how small changes in developmental genes result in large
changes in animal body plan (think multi-headed jellyfish), are giving
scientists this understanding.
Genes Responsible for Development: 
Hox Genes
Certain genes are responsible for some major aspects of animal development.
One of the most important discoveries in developmental biology (or in evolu-
tionary biology, biology in general, and medicine, for that matter) is a set of
genes called the Hox genes. These genes are responsible for the determina-
tion of body pattern — a sort of design plan for items such as where the legs
go and where the head should be. Pretty important stuff! In effect, these genes
control the process whereby the embryo is divided into segments, and then
they determine the specific fates of different segments.
The initial research on Hox genes involved a fruit fly, Drosophila. Like other
arthropods (invertebrates such as spiders, crustaceans, and insects), the
fruit fly is made up of a series of segments, some that are the same and some
that are different.
If you know what a millipede looks like, you’re familiar with an arthropod
with a lot of segments that are all pretty much the same. After the head each
segment has two pairs of legs — a very simple design and the fossil record
tells us that millipedes are a very ancient group of land animals.
Now consider a fly or other insect. The segments are more differentiated:
 Head segments: This is where . . . well, where the head is. What can I say?
 Thoracic segments: The thoracic segment includes the internal organs.
It’s also where the legs are.
 Abdominal segments: No legs, but this is where the reproductive struc-
tures are.
229
Chapter 14: Evo-Devo: The Evolution of Development

For an up-close-and-personal look at sections, treat yourself by performing a
tasty and very informative dissection of a lobster. Find the head and thoracic
segments, and then the repeating segments of the tail/abdomen, which are
delectable! Note that seeing the segments in the thorax is easier if you take it
apart a little bit — externally the thoracic segments are fused together. Not
much in the lobster thorax is edible (although some people swear that the
liver is a delicacy), but it offers a lot of good biology. Lobsters aren’t cheap,
of course, so it’s important that you get the most for your dollar. Education 
is priceless!
You may be thinking, “Whoa! How can the mammalian body plan be organized
by the same family of genes that organized the arthropod body plan, espe-
cially when the human body lacks all those repeating segments?” Consider
your backbone. It’s a structure of repeating segments (all those vertebrae).
And at particular points along your spinal column, you have other structures,
such as arms and legs.
Keeping it in the family
As stated previously, Hox genes are the family of genes that control develop-
ment of body plan. They determine how different areas of the developing
embryo become different body parts: where does the head go, where do the
legs go — that sort of thing.
The Hox genes are responsible for body patterning in most animals. Even
though different animals look completely different, the underlying genes are
clearly related. You have them, a mouse has them, a fly has them. Although
humans are extremely different from fruit flies, the genes responsible for
body patterning are identifiable in both species. The copies in mammals are
different from the ones in flies, but not so different in DNA sequence that sci-
entists can’t see their common origin in a distant ancestor.
A fly and a mouse have similar Hox genes, for example, but they don’t have
exactly the same collection of these genes; the exact sequences are different.
Also, Hox genes can become duplicated just as can other genes in the imper-
fect DNA replication process, so different animals have different numbers of
Hox genes. Looking across different animals, scientists see cases where some
animals have several copies a very similar Hox genes — evidence of past
gene duplications — while others will have a different number of copies of
related genes. 
The fact that the genes for body patterning would be recognizably similar
across such different animals was quite a revelation — and a major break-
through in the evo-devo field. It gives scientists deep insights into how
changes at the level of the DNA can result in changes in animal body plan. 
230
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Here’s the big take-home message: Developmentally you’re not all that differ-
ent from a fly. Understanding Hox genes takes us a long way toward under-
standing how small changes at the level of the DNA, besides the things we
actually know to happen, could result in large differences in animal form.
Of mice and men and . . . jellyfish!
The preceding discussion focuses on bilaterally symmetrical animals — those
with a right and left side, a head, and a tail end. Most animals are bilaterally
symmetrical: you, your dog, your goldfish, your hamster, and your houseflies.
But a few animals aren’t symmetrical — jellyfish, for example. As it turns out,
jellyfish also have genes related to the Hox cluster. They’re much different
from the genes that humans share with mice or even flies, which makes
sense, because the hypothesized common ancestor of the bilateral animals
and the jellyfish lived millions and millions (and millions) of years ago.
Now, a jellyfish doesn’t have a head in the sense that humans do, but it does
have a place where the mouth is, which is probably as close to a head as you
can imagine. Jellyfish have an oral side and an aboral side — in plain English,
a mouth side and a side opposite the mouth side. Genes related to the Hox
genes in bilateral animals are responsible for this oral-aboral patterning, and
in honor of the group that jellyfish find themselves in — the Cnidarians —
these genes are called Cnox, instead of Hox, genes. (The C is silent; it’s just
there to mess with you.)
Cnox genes are similar to the ones involved in head formation in bilateral ani-
mals. Scientists can investigate the function of these genes in jellyfish by
altering them genetically. One such experiment resulted in a jellyfish with
multiple heads and multiple functional mouths!

volution is all about heritable changes, and DNA is the material that’s
inherited. Other chapters in this book don’t go into a lot of detail about
the various sorts of changes that can occur at the DNA level. Instead, they
focus mostly on examples involving changes in alleles at particular loci, like
changes in some bit of bacterial machinery that renders the bacteria antibi-
otic resistant. This simple process, whereby one of the nucleotides (A, C, T,
or G) in a bacterium’s genome was incorrectly copied and thus changed the
bacterium’s phenotype, is an example of a change at a locus from one allele
to another and an example of how a new allele appears in a population. 
But there are other evolutionary questions we can ask about an organism’s
DNA. For example, how many genes are there? It turns out organisms don’t
have the same number of genes. Since all organisms share a common ances-
tor, where did the new genes come from? What sort of evolutionary changes
can result in new instructions in the organism’s instruction manual? Another
question is how much DNA is there, and is all of it genes? Scientists have dis-
covered that the number varies a fair bit between organisms and not always
in a way you’d expect. In some organisms, most of the DNA doesn’t corre-
spond to different genes, and in other organisms, such as ourselves, lots of
the DNA doesn’t seem to do very much.
The field of molecular evolution seeks to understand how these changes
come about, how evolution works at the DNA level, and what understanding
the details of the process can tell us about how evolution might proceed.

My Genome’s Bigger than Your Genome!
As discussed in Chapter 3, every organism has a genome made up of DNA,
which is the instruction manual for making the organism, spelled out in a
four-letter alphabet: A, C, T, and G. These letters are called nucleotides, or
bases. The size of the genome is the total number of DNA bases used to spell
out the instructions. (OK, not every organism has a genome made up of DNA;
some types of viruses have genomes made of RNA instead of DNA. But that
exception’s not important here.)
Genome sizes at a glance
Haploid organisms have only one copy of their DNA; diploid organisms have
two copies. Humans are diploid: A person’s genome consists of two DNA
copies, one from Mom and one from Dad. Both copies contain the same type
of genes (eye-color genes, for example), whose “specifics” (blue eyes versus
brown eyes, for example) may or may not be different.
To standardize across all organisms, when scientists talk about genome size,
they talk about the size of a haploid genome. For diploid organisms, genome
size corresponds to the amount of DNA in a non-fertilized egg or in a sperm
cell. Table 15-1 lists the haploid genome sizes and the number of genes for
many organisms. It also identifies what branch of the tree of life the organism
occupies.

Note: The reason the numbers in Table 15-1 differ between “Estimated Size”
and “Estimated Number of Genes” is that the “Estimated Size” includes both
coding and non-coding DNA (explained in the section “Distinguishing between
genes and non-coding DNA”), whereas the “Estimated Number of Genes”
entries include only the coding DNA.
The tree of life (refer to Chapter 9) has three main branches: 
 The Eubacteria: These are all the bacteria you’ve heard of, including 
E. coli, staph, strep, and other such critters
 The Archea: These are the other group of single-celled things without a
nucleus. These look pretty similar to the Eubacteria under a microscope
but turn out to be very different when scientists are able to figure out
their DNA sequences.
 The Eukaryotes: These include all the organisms whose cells have a
nucleus — yeast, pine trees, you, and so on — basically anything big
enough to see as well as most of the biggest things that are still too
small to see.
235
Chapter 15: Molecular Evolution

The C value and the C-value paradox
When scientists began to measure the genome sizes of different organisms,
two things became apparent: Within a species, genome sizes are the same,
but across species they differ quite a bit and not necessarily in the way you’d
expect. The following sections explain.
Genome sizes consistent within a species
Within a species, every organism has the same size of genome. This finding
makes perfect sense. The instruction manual to make one person should be
the same length as the instruction manual to make somebody else, although
the details vary from person to person. Both people need the instructions to
make eyes, for example, but the exact details — the color and shape of the
eyes — may vary from person to person. 
What’s true for people is true for other species as well: The instruction
manual is the same length, even if some of the instructions are slightly differ-
ent. There are some exceptions to this, however, such as with E. coli, whose
genome size can vary, as explained in the later section, “Getting genes from
other lines: Lateral gene transfer.”
Because the size of the genome is constant across all individuals in a species,
a species’ genome size is referred to as its C value, with C standing for constant.
Genome sizes vary between species
Between species, genome size varies greatly — a fact that is extremely puz-
zling, because although it makes sense that different organisms require 
different-size instruction manuals, no obvious connection exists between the
size of the species’ genome and that species’ complexity. For that reason, sci-
entists call the discrepancy between complexity and genome size the C-value
paradox (or the C-value enigma).
Distinguishing between genes 
and non-coding DNA
An organism’s genome can roughly be divided into two parts:
 Genes (coding DNA): These sequences of DNA are transcribed and are
the genes that determine phenotype.
During transcription, DNA sequences are copied to RNA. During another
process called translation, the RNA is copied to amino acids, chains of
which are called proteins. Not all the transcribed RNAs are translated
into proteins; they have some other jobs. Chapter 3 has the details on
these processes.
236
Part III: What Evolution Does 

 Non-coding DNA. These areas of DNA aren’t transcribed. In other words,
they don’t seem to do anything. 
Number of genes
If you take a close look at the numbers in Table 15-1, you may notice that
some of the differences make sense. You’d probably expect single-celled
organisms to have fewer genes than multicelled organisms, and that’s what
you find in some instances. Humans, for example, have about 20,000 genes,
whereas E. coli, a species of Eubacteria (beneficial bacteria) that inhabits the
human gut, has slightly more than 4,000 genes.
But in other instances, the numbers aren’t what you’d expect. Although
humans have twice as many genes as fruit flies, rice plants have almost twice
as many genes as we do. At first pass, rice isn’t obviously twice as complex
as humans are. Because scientists don’t know what most of the rice genes do,
they don’t really understand why rice has so many genes, but they do know
that having this many genes isn’t a universal property of plants. The small
weed Arabidopsis has about the same number of genes as humans but far
fewer than the rice plant has.
While it’s true that the littlest critters — viruses, eubacteria, and archea —
have the smallest genomes and the smallest numbers of genes, there are
other single-celled creatures, like certain amoebas, that have enormous
genomes and the same number of genes as some (but not all) multicellular
organisms. The single celled amoeba Entamoeba histolytica has almost 10,000
genes, not that many fewer than a fly!
Amount of non-coding DNA
Another thing you may notice in Table 15-1 is that different organisms have
different amounts of non-coding DNA, represented in the “Average Gene
Density” column. The more bases there are for each gene indicates more non-
coding DNA. So humans, who have only one gene for every 100,000 bases,
have quite a bit of “wasted” space, or non-coding DNA. H. influenzae, on the
other hand, has one gene per thousand bases, meaning it has virtually no
non-coding DNA. 
Clear patterns appear between the major groups of organisms:
 Eubacteria and Archea have almost no non-coding DNA.
 Eukaryotes have non-coding DNA, but the amount of non-coding DNA
varies widely among them. Some ferns have 100 times as much non-
coding DNA as humans do.
 Viruses don’t have non-coding DNA, but they don’t fit neatly on the tree
of life. In fact, viruses probably are not a single group. They have such
small genomes that very little information is available to group them
with other organisms.
237
Chapter 15: Molecular Evolution

No one knows exactly why organisms on the different branches of the tree of
life have different amounts of non-coding DNA, although scientists can make
educated guesses:
 Size of the organism: It seems reasonable that the smallest organisms
simply don’t have room for extra stuff. You can’t fit a gallon of milk into 
a quart container. The same constraints wouldn’t exist for eukaryotic
cells. Your genome has a lot of non-coding DNA, but the nucleus is still
only a small part of the cell; it seems to have room to spare.
 Rapid cell division: For organisms such as viruses and bacteria, for
which rapid division is a key component of fitness, the extra time that
replicating a larger genome takes is too much of a selective disadvan-
tage, so non-coding DNA doesn’t accumulate.
 Population size: Maybe non-coding DNA can accumulate more easily in
eukaryotic organisms because they have smaller population sizes, on
which genetic drift (random events) can be a more influential evolution-
ary force. (Head to Chapter 6 for info on genetic drift.)
The Whys and Wherefores 
of Non-coding DNA
Imagine being the person who took the first gander ever at a genome, the
instruction manual for life. Pretty amazing stuff. Now imagine ferreting out
which bits do what and discovering that quite a lot of what you’re looking at
doesn’t seem to do anything. It’s just there, cluttering things up. In a word,
it’s junk. Quite a bit of the genomes of eukaryotic organisms is junk — non-
coding DNA. Why is it there? No one really knows, but several explanations
have been proposed, as the following sections explain.
It performs a function
Maybe non-coding DNA plays some role in controlling how other DNA sec-
tions are transcribed, even though it isn’t transcribed itself. In this case, the
non-coding DNA is advantageous to the organism (it performs a necessary
job), so natural selection maintains it. Some evidence exists that this situa-
tion actually occurs; even so, it’s not enough to account for the huge
amounts of non-coding DNA.
Alternatively, the non-coding DNA may serve a structural function during cell
division or the production of gametes (sperm and egg). Replicating the eukary-
otic genome, which is packaged in a series of chromosomes (refer to Chapter 3
238
Part III: What Evolution Does 

for info on chromosomes), is a pretty complex process. The non-coding DNA
could be involved in putting the chromosome together — pairing things up
and partitioning the copied chromosome in the daughter cells, for example.
It serves no function but isn’t harmful
Some scientists hypothesize that the non-coding DNA serves no function, but
because it’s not especially harmful, natural selection doesn’t select against it.
If a certain amount of non-coding DNA doesn’t have any negative fitness
costs, it could just pile up in the genome and persist because it keeps getting
dragged along to future generations by nearby advantageous genes. (Head to
Chapter 4 for more on hitchhiking DNA.)
It’s parasitic!
Much of the non-coding DNA may be parasitic DNA — the result of replicating
elements in the eukaryotic genome reproducing themselves. As you can
imagine, anything that’s a parasite can’t be good for the host organism, and
selection would act to favor individuals with less of this parasitic DNA.
So why is it still there? Because parasitic DNA elements that are best able to
reproduce themselves in the eukaryotic genome are selectively favored, even
though selection is also acting to favor organisms in which they are less able
to replicate. Lots of evidence exists that a large amount of your genome is
really taken up by the selfish elements.
Retroelements
All kinds of selfish, non-coding DNA are around, but one very important kind
is the retroelements. To understand the retroelements, think about retro-
viruses, the most famous of which is HIV (explained in detail in Chapter 18).
Retroviruses are viruses that alternate between an RNA genome and a DNA
genome. They start with an RNA genome, infect their host, make a DNA copy
to integrate into the host, and then replicate an RNA copy so that they can
spread. 
A retroelement does essentially the same thing that a retrovirus does, except
that it lacks the genes that enable it to package the RNA copy into a particle
that spreads. (When scientists sequence retroelements, they find that they
are closely related to retroviruses but have a reduced set of genes.)
Amazingly, 95 percent of the human genome is made up of retroelement-like
sequences. What’s their purpose? Like everything else in evolutionary biol-
ogy, their purpose is simply to make more of themselves. They replicate in
your genome, and you pass them along to your kids.

Chapter 15: Molecular Evolution

Harmless — until they mess things up
For the most part, retroelements don’t seem to do you any harm — until they
do. Retroelements can move around in your genome and mess things up.
They can insert into a new location right in the middle of an existing gene. 
An example of a retroelement in action is the blue merle pattern in some
breeds of dog. This coloring pattern is caused by a particular retroelement
popping in and out of the pigment genes during embryonic development. At a
certain point, the retroelement stops jumping around, but the dog still ends
up with splotches of different colors in different places. Another, more harm-
ful effect of retroelements may be cancer, where certain retroelements move
around more actively. 
Bottom line: Retroelements don’t do anything beneficial, take up space, can
be harmful, and may be parasitic. You’d be better off if they weren’t there,
but they just keep reproducing.
Transposable elements in general (pieces of DNA which pop around from one
place to the next in the genome) and retroelements in particular (a subclass
of transposable elements whose replication involves a reverse transcription
step — that is a transcription from RNA back to DNA) are a big part of your
genome, but they don’t do anything of value. Why oh why are they there?
That’s the sixty four million dollar question of genome size.
Coding DNA: Changing the Number 
of Genes an Organism Has
Although the largest differences in the amount of DNA between different
species are the result non-coding DNA (see the preceding section), differ-
ences also occur in the number of genes between different organisms. 
Think back to the branching tree of life (refer to Chapter 9) and the evolution
of more complex organisms such as humans from less-complex organisms.
You can appreciate why the number of genes has increased. In this section, I
explain how the number of genes an organism has can change. New genes
can appear in a variety of ways.
Getting genes from other lines: 
Lateral gene transfer
Lateral gene transfer is the process by which one evolving lineage acquires
genes from other lineages. This mechanism isn’t thought to be especially
240
Part III: What Evolution Does 

important for eukaryotes such as humans, but it’s quite common among non-
eukaryotes, the Eubacteria and Archea.
A good example of lateral gene transfer is the vastly different number of
genes between the beneficial E. coli strain that all humans have in their guts
and the disease-causing E. coli 0157:H7. The human-gut E. coli has about 4,300
genes, whereas the pathogenic strain has 5,400 — a huge difference. It’s not
clear where all these extra genes came from, but some of them clearly are
related to genes from the bacteria species Shigella dysenteriae, whose name
probably makes clear why these genes can turn a good E. coli bad.
Shuffling exons: Alternative gene splicing
DNA sequences are transcribed into RNA sequences. A subset of these RNA
sequences, termed messenger RNA (or mRNA for short), are then translated
into sequences of amino acids, called proteins. 
The most sensible way for an organism to make proteins would be to have
just enough DNA to code for the length and type of protein being made. And
often that’s what we find, especially in things like bacteria. But many times,
the sequence of DNA, and thus mRNA, is much longer than necessary to
make the desired protein. 
In this too-long sequence, some sections of the RNA nucleotides are trans-
lated to amino acids (they’re called exons), and others aren’t (they’re called
introns). To make the amino acid, the mRNA is “processed” — the introns get
spliced out, leaving just the exons all strung together. This new, shorter piece
of mRNA codes for the amino acids that make the protein, and everything’s
hunky-dory.
Yet when scientists look at the details of this process, they find that some-
times there’s more that one way to process the same mRNA. 
 Sometimes all the exons get strung together
 Other times just some of the exons get strung together. 
In the second case, when the exons are sewn back together to make the final
piece of RNA, some of them get left out, and the result is that different pro-
teins are made from a single gene. This is important, because using different
combinations of exons from the same sequence of DNA can result in cells
with different functions. This process is called alternative splicing or, more
informally, exon shuffling.
In exon shuffling, a gene with four exons, for example, might be spliced differ-
ently to create several different types of mRNA. One obvious one would be an
mRNA made up of all 4 exons. But mRNAs could also be made from just a
241
Chapter 15: Molecular Evolution

subset of the exons — say exons 1, 2, and 4 in one case, and exons 1, 3, and 4
in another. In each of these cases, the protein produced from this mRNA
could have a different function. In mammals, for example, the calcitonin gene
produces a hormone in one cell type and a neurotransmitter in another cell
type, due to alternative splicing.
Alternative splicing suggests one way that new functions can arise. A muta-
tion that resulted in exons being spliced one way sometime and another way
another time would create two protein products from the same DNA. In short,
through exon shuffling, it would be possible to gain a new protein while still
being able to make the original one. If the new protein were selectively advan-
tageous, then the new mutant would increase in future generations.
Duplicating genes: A gene is born 
Errors in DNA replication can lead to duplications of sections of DNA or, as in
the creation of polyploids, duplication of the entire genome (see Chapter 4).
It’s akin to going to Kinko’s for a single copy and ending up with two: the
copy you needed and an extra you’re not quite sure what to do with. The
same thing goes for the DNA. What’s an extra gene good for? 
If a mutation knocks out a duplicate copy, the organism is pretty much back
where it started: It still has the original copy and an extra. This situation is
the spare-tire gene duplication theory. (Just kidding.) The extra copy may or
may not be functional:
 When the second copy is nonfunctional: These nonfunctional genes are
called pseudo-genes. Pseudo-genes look like the original genes, but they’re
a little, or a lot, broken, and they tend to accumulate more and more
mutations over time. The more mutations occur, the harder it is to rec-
ognize that these genes are related to existing genes. But since they’re
already nonfunctional, there’s no fitness cost to a few more mutations.
 When the second copy is functional: If the second copy mutates such
that it is able to perform an additional function that’s selectively advan-
tageous, individuals with this mutation increase in frequency, resulting
in two different yet related functional genes where one originally was.
Many examples exist of families of genes that appear to have a common
ancestor.
When you know about the possibility of gene duplications, you understand
that natural selection could result in a change of function of one copy with-
out having to worry about losing the function of the other copy. When you
have two copies, you have room to move. Because most mutations are dele-
terious, these duplicated genes usually end up losing their original function
without acquiring any new function. But sometimes beneficial mutations
occur in the second copy, and a new gene is born.
242
Part III: What Evolution Does 

The Neutral Theory of 
Molecular Evolution
The neutral theory of molecular evolution says that genetic drift — random
events that affect evolutionary change (see Chapter 6) — accounts for much
of the change in DNA. This is the case because most mutations are selectively
neutral. In fact, much more variation is neutral than scientists once thought.
The variation exists in the DNA, but either it doesn’t result in a change at the
level of the protein or, if it does result in changes in proteins, these changes
don’t change the protein’s function. 
The chance that a mutation will have no effect can vary between different
genes. Some proteins, for example, are very tightly constrained in the shapes
that they can adopt and still be functional. For these proteins, relatively few
mutations are selectively neutral. When scientists examine the mutation
rates of different proteins within the same organism, they find that some
evolve faster than others.
As stated previously, neutral mutations are neither good nor bad, and when a
mutation is neutral, natural selection doesn’t act on it. (Why should it? A neu-
tral mutation doesn’t help the organism, which would cause an increase in
frequency in subsequent generations. Neither does it hurt the organism,
which would cause a decrease in frequency.) Therefore, the evolutionary
force that acts on these genes is genetic drift. Over enough time, a selectively
neutral mutation can reach a frequency of 100 percent in a population just by
chance — a situation called fixation. (You can read more about fixation and
genetic drift in Chapter 6.) 
Many mutations are almost, but not quite, neutral. A slightly deleterious
mutation, for example, might still increase in frequency as a result of genetic
drift in a small population. Remember that for any given mutation, the chance
of fixation (that is, the chance of reaching a frequency of 100 percent) is a
function of population size. If population size fluctuates (as it often does), a
particular gene may be changing in frequency primarily as a result of natural
selection at one time and primarily due to genetic drift at another time.
Two evolutionary forces are at work: natural selection and genetic drift. If a
mutation isn’t neutral, both natural selection and genetic drift can be the
cause of evolution. If a mutation is neutral, only genetic drift can result in 
a change in the frequency of the gene over time. (This discovery — that
random events are evolutionary forces in and of themselves — has been the
most important addition to the theory of evolution since Darwin.)
243
Chapter 15: Molecular Evolution

Telling Time with Genes: 
The Molecular Clock
The molecular clock refers to the idea that if mutations are often neutral, all
other things being equal, they might be expected to accumulate at a constant
rate. If this idea is true, it should be possible to measure the genetic differ-
ences between two species and determine how long ago the two lineages
diverged. Sounds, good, but telling time with the molecular clock is tricky;
sometimes you can, and sometimes you can’t.
When you can’t
Using the molecular clock to determine when lineages diverged requires that
the neutral mutations accumulate at a constant rate. Which doesn’t happen,
for several reasons:
 Differences between genes: There is no reason to think that the propor-
tion of neutral mutations should be constant across genes with different
functions. One protein may function only if it’s exactly the right shape or
configuration to do its job; another protein may do its job pretty well
even in spite of a few changes. At the very least, comparisons should be
made only between the same gene in different species. But even then,
scientists can’t be sure that a gene shared across two species performs
the same function. The function of the gene may have changed as the
species evolved to a different environment, for example.
 Population size and generation time: The rate at which neutral muta-
tions become fixed in a population is a function of population size and
generation time, both of which may vary between lineages after they
diverge. In small populations with short generation times, neutral muta-
tions rise to fixation more rapidly.
 Strength of selection: The strength of natural selection may vary
between species over time, thus changing the ratio of neutral to non-
neutral mutations that rise to fixation.
When you can
Despite all the reasons why you shouldn’t get too excited about the idea of
the molecular clock (see the preceding section), in some cases, scientists can
show that the accumulation of mutations is an excellent predictor of the time
since two species diverged. 
244
Part III: What Evolution Does 

The key to using the molecular clock effectively is calibrating it. To do that,
you must know the time at which some lineages diverged so that you can
translate the amount of divergence between different lineages into time. Then
you can use this information to estimate the divergence times of additional
species.
Performing experiments in the lab
For organisms that have generation times short enough to create divergent
lineages in the laboratory, you can ask how fast mutations accumulate in
these microorganisms over time. Then you can look at sequence variation
that you know to be neutral — changes in the DNA that don’t result in any
changes in the protein. These changes pile up over time, based on the muta-
tion rate. You measure how fast they pile up, and then you know the mutation
rate — simple as that! (This strategy doesn’t work for organisms that are
much longer lived, of course.)
Looking at ancient DNA and the fossil record
As researchers’ biochemical techniques become more sophisticated, they’ve
been able to retrieve DNA sequences from the distant (but quantifiable) past.
By studying these ancient sequences, they’ve been able to put bounds on the
rates of mutation accumulation between the date of the old sequence and the
current time. 
The fossil record also allows scientists to generate estimates of when differ-
ent lineages diverged by noting the geological era in which the fossil was
found. Then they can use these divergence times to calculate the rate at
which mutations have accumulated in the lineages since the divergence.
Imagine you have three species: species 1, species 2, and species 3. You
sequence all three, generate a phylogeny, and find that species 2 and 3 seem
most closely related, and they’re both related to species 1. Just by digging
and finding fossils at different ages, you have a pretty good idea of when
species 1 and 2 split. But you have absolutely no fossils telling you anything
about the history of species 3, and you want know when species 3 split off
from species 2. 
By knowing when species 1 and 2 diverged, you can correlate the number of
DNA differences between these two species and the amount of time since
they diverged. You can then take this estimate and use it to translate the
number of DNA differences between species 2 and 3 into the time since they
diverged, even in the absence of any fossil record for species 3. And that’s the
molecular clock!
245
Chapter 15: Molecular Evolution

From the fossil record, scientists know the approximate times when many lin-
eages arose. Date the rocks that a fossil is found in, and you pretty effectively
date the fossil. Scientists know, for example, about when the mammal lineage
split off from the rest of the tetrapods (four-limbed creatures, such as lizards,
turtles, and birds). On a finer scale, they have a pretty good idea about when
the hominid lineage diverged from the chimpanzee lineage.
Scientists can use the fossil record to generate divergence times for lineages
for which there is a good fossil record, and then they can use the molecular
clock to estimate divergence times for species for which a good fossil record
isn’t available.
Examining biogeographic patterns
Biogeographic patterns can also generate estimates of divergence times. Take,
for example, the fruit fly species (Drosophila) that lives in the Hawaiian islands.
Because geologists have an excellent understanding of how the Hawaiian
islands formed, they can date the islands accurately.
The Earth’s crust has a thin spot, and as the Pacific plate moves across this
hot spot, periodic eruptions have generated the chain of the Hawaiian
islands. Because geologists can date exactly the age at which lava solidifies,
they can figure out when the islands were formed. 
In addition, the Hawaiian islands are extremely distant from other land masses.
As a result, much of the biological diversity on the islands is a result of speci-
ation events that happened in Hawaii. Most of the fruit fly species in Hawaii
occurs nowhere else, for example. Hawaii is so far from anywhere else that
the rate at which fruit fly speciation occurs on the islands far exceeds the
rate at which non-Hawaiian fruit fly species could arrive. So although some
fruit flies got to Hawaii initially from elsewhere, the original colonists have
radiated into many of the species you find there today.
As new islands appear in the chain, flies from the neighboring island colonize
them and, over time, diverge to become separate species. As explained in
Chapter 8, this divergence is a consequence of the very reduced rates of
genetic exchange between the islands. A fruit fly occasionally gets from one
island to another, but this migration doesn’t happen often enough to over-
whelm the gradual divergence between the separated populations and their
subsequent speciation.
Phylogenetic analysis (refer to Chapter 9) of the Hawaiian fruit fly yields a
tree that matches geologists’ understanding of the geological formation of the
islands — and sure enough, the fly species on different islands each share a
most recent common ancestor with the species on the next island over.
246
Part III: What Evolution Does 

Usually, we don’t know when in the past two lineages became geographically
separated, but with the Hawaiian islands, we know exactly when the new
islands popped up out of the ocean. We can combine the data about how
genetically different two species are (which we get from the sequence of 
their DNA) with the length of time they’ve been separate species. 
Not surprisingly, the longer two species have been separated, the more
genetically different they will be, simply because changes add up over time.
But what’s most important about these Hawaiian flies is that, because we
know the dates the islands appeared, we can tell that the amount of genetic
difference is exactly correlated with the length of time since the species
diverged. If one pair of species diverged twice as long ago as another pair, it
has twice the amount of genetic differences. 
This information tells us that the molecular clock can tick at a constant rate
for long periods of time. Proving that (through studying the phylogeny of
Hawaiian fruit flies and knowing the dates when the islands formed) makes us
more comfortable with assuming that the rate of molecular evolution may be
constant in other species as well.

lthough many of us like to tell ourselves that we’re
different from other organisms in some fundamental
ways, we’re all subject to evolutionary processes. So evo-
lution doesn’t pertain only to animals, plants, bacteria,
etc. It pertains to humans as well. As this part explains,
we have our own evolutionary history as a species and an
evolutionary future, as well. 
Ironically, the other species that poses the biggest 
challenge — and threat — to us and therefore deserves
attention in this part is the one we can’t even see (without
help): the microbes, like bacteria and viruses, organisms
that evolve amazingly quickly and in response to the med-

M
ost people are very interested in human evolution and know some-
thing about it but still find the topic perplexing. They have an inkling,
for example, that humans evolved from apes (actually, apelike creatures) 
but think that evolution works differently for humans than it does for other
organisms. It doesn’t. The same evolutionary principles that apply to every
living organism apply to human beings: speciation, genetic drift, coalescence,
you name it.
This chapter explains both the evolutionary origin of our species and subse-
quent evolution within the species Homo sapiens. In a way, this chapter
answers two questions: “Where did we come from?” and “Where are we
going?”
The Origin of Homo Sapiens: 
Where We Came From
When you think about human evolution, you may think immediately about the
fossil record. Although fossils are extremely important parts of the evidence
we humans have for understanding our own origins, other vital lines of evi-
dence exist as well:
 Phylogenetic reconstructions: A phylogenetic reconstruction is essentially
a visual representation of the genealogy of a group of species (refer to
Chapter 9 for more details). This image can provide insight into where
humans fit in the tree of life.

 Human DNA studies: By looking at our DNA, researchers can get intrigu-
ing information about the patterns of migration of Homo sapiens
(humans) that help them sort out different hypotheses about where
humans originated. They can’t get this info just by looking at fossils,
which aren’t always clear.
 Neanderthal DNA studies: It’s possible now to obtain DNA from one of
our closest relatives: the Neanderthals. By comparing modern human
DNA with Neanderthal DNA, scientists gain a better understanding of
our relationship to this extinct species of hominid.
Phylogenetic evidence: Hangin’ 
round on the Tree of Life
As I explain in Chapter 9, phylogenetics takes data about existing species and
reconstructs the evolutionary branching pattern that led to those species.
Not surprisingly, no small amount of effort has been devoted to reconstruct-
ing the parts of the tree of life where humans reside. Our particular branch
includes the apes: gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, the two types of chimpanzees
(the standard one that you’re familiar with and the bonobo, which used to be
called the pygmy chimp but which turns out to be a species of its own), and us!
When biologists started wondering where all these creatures should reside
on our branch of the tree, they imagined one sub-branch leading to us and
another sub-branch leading to all those charming, furry creatures who seem
so different from us. Researchers could tell that, of all the animals, humans
are most like apes, but in the past, they tended to think of the apes as belong-
ing on the other twig of our shared branch of the tree.
Enter the amazing resource of DNA. Now that scientists have been able to
sequence human DNA as well as good samples of DNA from the other apes
(in the case of the chimpanzees, the entire genome), they’ve discovered that
humans and chimps aren’t very distant at all. The current best hypothesis
about the relationships between humans and the rest of the great apes is
shown in Figure 16-1.
In Figure 16-1, you can see that the two chimpanzee species (chimps and
bonobos) have a most recent common ancestor. These species are a lot more
like each other than they are like anything else. But — surprise! — humans
have a most common ancestor with the chimpanzee lineage that we don’t
share with the other great apes. To find the most common ancestor of goril-
las, humans, and chimpanzees, you have to go back a bit farther — and far-
ther yet to find the most recent common ancestor of orangutans, gorillas,
humans, and chimpanzees.
252
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

Figure 16-1 shows a point that I want to drive home: Humans didn’t evolve from
chimps! Instead, chimps and humans arose from the same common, apelike
ancestor.
Kissing cousins
Humans turn out to be a lot more similar to chimpanzees than biologists first
thought. Human DNA is about 95 percent the same as chimpanzee DNA. A lot
of active research is going on in this area, and some studies put the number
at 97 percent or 98 percent. Whatever the precise percentage, however, the
bottom line is that humans are very similar to chimps.
Why do the different percentages exist? Because it’s no easy task to figure out
which bits in the DNA sequence are genes, which bits might be genes, and
which bits are just junk. (Yes, believe it or not, humans, chimps, all other
mammals, and most multicellular creatures have a lot of junk DNA; refer to
Chapter 15 to find out more about non-coding DNA.) As a consequence, dif-
ferent researchers come up with different estimates regarding which parts
are genes and which parts aren’t, and thus different estimates of similarity
between species.

Chapter 16: Human Evolution

By combining the information about the relative differences in the genomes
of chimpanzees and humans with what we know about the rate of DNA sub-
stitutions in specific genes in these two organisms, researchers can tell that,
approximately 5 million to 7 million years ago, the lineage leading to modern
humans split from the lineage leading to modern chimps. (For information on
how to use DNA as a molecular clock to determine the time in the past when
two lineages split from a common ancestor, head to Chapter 15.)
If the DNA sequence of humans is so close to that of the chimpanzee, why do
the two species look so different? They certainly don’t seem to be only 5 per-
cent different (at least, that’s what we humans like to think!). The answer is
that small changes in regions of the DNA that have a regulatory function can
have major effects, as explained in Chapter 14, including examples of genes
that may be important in the different developmental trajectories of chimps
and humans.
You say hominid; I say hominian
Biologists commonly name every group; everything that has a common
ancestor gets a name. And because humans (the species Homo sapiens) are
the ones who do the naming, we’ve made sure that every higher group that
includes us also starts with the letters hom — hominid; hominine; hominin
(yes, it means something different from hominine); hominian; and, of course,
human.
These names come up a lot in the published studies of human evolution, and
they certainly do sound awfully scientific. My opinion? They’re nothing but
trouble. So in this book, I don’t use any of these terms except hominid, which
refers to all the creatures on the branch of life starting at the common ances-
tor of chimps and humans, and leading up in time along the human branch. If
you need a more precise definition, try this one on for size:
HOMINID: Modern humans and their extinct relatives, going back to the
most common recent ancestor with the chimpanzee lineage.
Carved in stone: The fossils
As you can probably guess from the excitement with which paleontologists
greet each new fossil find, hominid fossils are few and far between. This fact
isn’t especially surprising, given that great apes tend to have relatively low
population densities (and our earliest ancestors probably did, too). That sci-
entists have been able to find fossils of many early hominids at all is a cork-
popping event.
254
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

The human species found in fossils
Paleontologists have found fossils for a large number of hominid species,
including prehuman primates and human primates. In fact, various hominid
species have been identified from fossil remains, as Table 16-1 shows. 
Note: The A or H in the species’ names is scientific shorthand. Instead of 
writing Australopithecus, for example, scientists simply write A. The term
Australopithecus speaks to the origin of the fossil: southern Africa. H, of
course, stands for Homo, which means wise. The name Homo sapiens means
wise man.

H. neanderthalensis
250,000 to 30,000 years ago
H. sapiens
100,000 years ago to today
As you can see, for most of the past 3 million or so years, multiple species of
hominids have existed at any one time — a situation that persisted until
about 25,000 years ago. In short, in the not-too-distant past, we shared Earth
with human species other than our own.
255
Chapter 16: Human Evolution

The dates in Table 16-1 indicate the years from which fossil specimens of
each species have been recovered. (For a review of how scientists determine
the dates of fossils, see Chapter 2.) But — and this point is important — the
lack of fossil evidence doesn’t necessarily mean that a species wasn’t around
longer than the time periods indicated, only that scientists haven’t found it.
So even though the current dates indicate that a H. habilis, for example, lived
from 2.3 to 1.6 million years ago, if H. habilis fossils dating from 1 million
years ago are found, the dates would change. (It’s also why you see the range
for H. erectus and a note that this species also may have existed up to 50,000
years ago.)
The tricky task of separating one species from another
As Chapter 8 explains, a very useful way for determining whether two individ-
uals are of the same or different species is to determine whether they can
interbreed. If the answer is yes, the individuals are of the same species; a no
answer means, they are different species. Obviously, this information isn’t
available for any of our fossil ancestors, so in this case, species names are
simply a function of morphology, or body structure. All the fossils that look
the same are assigned to the same species.
This arrangement sounds easy enough until you consider that the fossil
record is sparse and fossil remains of hominids usually are extremely incom-
plete —part of the leg bone here, half a jaw there, part of the cranium some-
where else. Complicating matters even more is the expectation of finding
both juvenile and adult individuals, as well as males and females which may
vary in size. As a result, there’s a fair bit of argument about whether a new
find should be considered a new species or merely another representative of
an existing species. 
Using skull size and shape, jaw muscles, and limb length can help researchers
distinguish between one hominid species and another, as follows:
 Ratio of forelimb to hind-limb length: Humans’ arms are proportionally
much shorter than the arms of chimpanzees, and scientists find different
fossil hominids with different arm-length ratios.
As bipedal locomotion (walking upright) developed, forelimb length
shortened. (If you want to get persnickety, as scientists tend to do, you
can say that forelimbs aren’t really arms until the organism is walking on
its hind legs — hence, the use of the term forelimbs.) Forelimb length is a
good way to evaluate which group a fossil belongs to because it’s rela-
tively constant for individuals of different ages. The absolute lengths of
forelimbs and hind-limbs change as the individual grows, but the ratio of
the lengths is consistent over a range of individual sizes.
 Skull shape: Humans have proportionally much larger brains than do
the other apes.
256
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

 The form and arrangement of teeth (dentition): Humans have markedly
different dentition from other apes. We do a lot of our food processing
with our hands rather than with our teeth, and we lack the powerful jaw
muscles and large teeth that are characteristic of the rest of the primates
(a group including the apes and other things like monkeys).
We humans have forelimbs, which just happen to be arms, but because we
don’t need them to reach to the ground when we walk, they can be shorter.
Chimps can walk around on hind legs for a little bit, but soon resort to using
their (longer) forelimbs again. Watch a chimp walk next time you’re at the
zoo; then try it with your comparatively short, little arms — you’ll fall on
your head! Why the difference? Because humans started to adopt a more
upright posture that was selectively favored. The move to upright posture
and the decrease in the importance of front limbs for locomotion would have
happened at the same time. 
Reconstructing the history 
of hominid evolution
With all these hominid species, scientists are still trying to figure out which
species may have given rise to which other species along the lineage that led
to humans. Because no one can say with certainty that a fossil represents a
common ancestor of two other species (the fossil may represent a closely
related dead end, for example), this task is fairly challenging.
257
Chapter 16: Human Evolution
This just in
Don’t you just love it when science keeps dis-
covering things? Every time anthropologists dig
up a new skull, humans’ view of the fossil
record and what it says about human evolution
can change. After a recent bit of digging,
researchers now know that Homo habilis and
Homo erectus lived at the same time.
This bit of info changes nothing in the chapter;
it just reconfirms that in the past, more than one
type of hominid was around at the same time.
But it does provide a clearer picture of whether
one hominid gave rise to another (as opposed
to both having descended from a common
ancestor). Some paleontologists thought that
perhaps H. erectus evolved from H. habilis. The
new fossil find shows that both species were
around together, meaning that (1) they both
evolved from something else or (2) H. erectus
could still have evolved from an offshoot of H.
habilis (you know — some habilis got lost on the
way to the office, ended up in a place with dif-
ferent selective pressures, and so on).

Figure 16-2 shows a hypothetical evolutionary pathway from an ancestral
species similar to the extant apes and leading to modern humans. It includes
a sequence of intermediate species with increasingly large brains, reduced
jaw musculature and dentition, and the evolution of bipedalism (walking on
just two feet). I’ve thrown in stone tools and fire just for fun.
The actual intermediate species may not be the ones scientists have already
found, or they may be; knowing for sure is impossible. What scientists do
know is that we can reconstruct the evolutionary events that led from an ape-
like ancestor to a modern human through the series of fossil species that
have already been found. The following sections describe some of the major
players; consider this a sort of hits list of the hominid fossil record.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds: Australopithecus afarensis
This famous fossil, called Australopithecus afarensis (A. afarensis, for short) is
commonly known as Lucy. Named for Lucy in the Beatles song “Lucy in the
Sky with Diamonds,” which was playing at the time, Lucy was such an impor-
tant find because a large part of her skeleton was found together, which gave
paleontologists a fair bit of confidence in describing the species.
Lucy was found in 1974, but her species lived from about 2.9 million to 3.6
million years ago. She was about 31⁄2 feet tall and weighed 60 pounds. She was
bipedal. At the time of her discovery, Lucy was the earliest bipedal hominid
that had been discovered. The relative length of her forelimbs is intermediate
between that of apes and people.

Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

Before Lucy’s discovery, many researchers believed that the driving force
behind the evolution of the large brain in the human lineage was that once
the hands were free (due to the development of bipedalism) to use the tools,
smarter individuals (those who were better toolmakers) would have an
advantage. This idea is interesting, but it turns out that Lucy’s brain was no
bigger than a chimpanzee’s — about one third the size of a human brain. 
What this fossil species (and others since) have made clear is that the evolu-
tion of bipedal locomotion occurred before the evolution of a large brain. A
long part of the human family tree is populated with ancient hominids that
walked upright but had small brains. This is a nice example of a case in which
the evidence provided by a fossil find allows scientists to reject one potential
hypothesis about the pathway of human evolution. So it’s back to the draw-
ing board to come up with hypotheses that explain why a big brain was all of
a sudden favored by natural selection.
The fossil record shows that after A. afarensis, the hominid lineage split into
two branches. One branch eventually led to humans; the other branch led to
a group referred to as the robust Australopithecines: A. boisei and A. robustus.
These species had very strong jaws (perhaps for eating plant material). This
lineage, which also includes A. aethiopicus, persisted from about 2.7 million
to 1 million years ago and then became extinct. 
I’m a traveling man: Homo erectus
Another important branching event in the hominid family tree is the one that
separated H. erectus from the lineage leading to H. sapiens. H. erectus origi-
nated around 1.9 million years ago and went extinct almost everywhere
300,000 years ago, though one subspecies may have persisted on the island
of Java perhaps as recently as 50,000 years ago.
H. erectus had a substantially larger brain than the Australopithecines, made
and used tools, and may have been able to control fire. But the species’ great-
est claim to fame was being the first hominid species to leave Africa, which it
did around 1.5 million years ago. By 1.2 million years ago, it had reached
China and Southeast Asia.
H. erectus had a brain about two thirds the size of the human brain, but analy-
sis of the internal structure of the H. erectus skull suggests that the area of
the brain involved with speech wasn’t developed to the extent that it is in
later hominids. Meaning? Language came later.
259
Chapter 16: Human Evolution

Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis
The last two species on the hominid tree are Homo sapiens and Homo nean-
derthalensis. Both species originated in Africa — H. neanderthalensis about
250,000 years ago and H. sapiens about 100,000 years ago — and both moved
out of Africa. H. neanderthalensis colonized Europe and parts of Central Asia,
whereas H. sapiens went on to colonize the whole world. H. neanderthalensis
coexisted with H. sapiens for a long time and went extinct only about 30,000
years ago, but anthropologists don’t know why.
H. neanderthalensis was more robustly built than H. sapiens, possibly as an
adaptation to the cold, but the two species’ brains were the same size.
Evidence has been found that H. neanderthalensis had advanced cultures:
They modified their environment for shelter; they had art; and they buried
their dead (the reason why a good fossil record for the species exists).
Many drawings of H. neanderthalensis incorrectly portray the species as
having a hunched posture. The reason for the mistake? An early specimen
had extreme arthritis. Analysis of many additional specimens reveals an
upright posture like that of humans. If you were to pass a specimen of H.
neanderthalensis on the sidewalk, you might notice the stockier build and
facial features (such as a more pronounced brow and perhaps a larger nose),
but if he was wearing a nicely tailored suit, you might not give him more than
a second glance.

Part IV: Evolution and Your World 
Hobbit Man: Homo floresienses
An incredible and still somewhat controversial
fossil find, Homo floresienses, discovered on
the Indonesian island of Flores in 2004, was pos-
sibly a dwarf species of the genus Homo.
Nicknamed “Hobbit Man” after the character in
J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, the first
skeleton found was a female approximately 3
feet tall, weighing perhaps 50 pounds, and esti-
mated to be approximately 30 years old at the
time of her death. The fossil evidence suggests
that the species inhabited the island as recently
as 13,000 years ago. (Homo Neanderthalensis
went extinct approximately 25,000 years ago.)
Because of the limited fossil record (so far, only
one fossil has been found with an intact skull),
no one knows exactly where H. floresienses fits
in, but here are some suggestions:
 It’s a dwarf form of Homo erectus.
 It’s a Homo sapiens afflicted with micro-
cephaly, a condition characterized by an
unusually small head and mental impair-
ments (This idea gained traction based on
the fact that the H. floresienses’ brain case
is so small).
 It’s a new species that lived into modern
times — an interesting conjecture that’s not
supported by any physical fossil evidence
but that has traction because people native
to the island have legends of small furry
people who lived in caves and had a differ-
ent language. Sightings of such creatures
were mentioned as recently as the 1800s
and continue to this day on the island of
Sumatra.

261
Chapter 16: Human Evolution
Did H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis 
interbreed?
The fossil record seems to indicate that Homo
sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis had far
more similarities than differences. That being the
case, was H. neanderthalensis truly a separate
species? Maybe, as some researchers have
suggested, it was simply another subspecies of
H. sapiens, and possibly — just possibly —
during the many years that the species over-
lapped in range, they interbred. This possibility is
interesting, but you can’t find clues in the fossil
record. Instead, you have to turn to DNA.
Luckily, DNA is tough stuff, and advanced
retrieval techniques have made it possible to
obtain sequences of nuclear DNA from H. nean-
derthalensis specimens almost 40,000 years old.
The human and neanderthal DNA sequences
are very similar, but there’s about one half of a
percent (0.5) difference. This is enough to iden-
tify specific DNA sequences that are specific to
one or the other species. 
Here’s what DNA testing has revealed: The H.
neanderthalensis genome is clearly distinct.
Had any significant amount of mixing occurred,
this result would be less clear. So DNA evi-
dence clearly weighs in against the idea that
the two groups interbred. Scientists can’t rule
out the possibility of any mating between the
two species, but they can rule out the possibil-
ity that any significant genetic mixing occurred.
Out of Africa: Hominid migration patterns
Human beings originated in Africa. The evidence: Most hominid fossils are
found only in Africa, and for those species with a wider distribution, the
oldest specimens are always found in Africa. In addition, humans’ most
closely related living relative (both genetically and as placed on the tree of
life; refer to Figure 16-1), the chimpanzee, lives in Africa. Not enough to con-
vince you? The existing genetic variation in the human population provides
another line of evidence.
Coalescence: Sharing a single ancestor
According to the concept of coalescence, all the genes in a given population
have a single common ancestor — some individual in the past from whom
they are all descended. Coalescence is the result of random processes
whereby some individuals leave descendents and others don’t (refer to
Chapter 6). 
Think of families in which different members have had different numbers of
children. Perhaps one sibling has no children, and another sibling has many.
In this way, random forces pile up through time. After enough time has
passed, with some members having children and others not, eventually all

262
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 
the existing individuals will be descended from one ancestor. Scientists have
discovered that this is essentially what happened, and they dubbed this
common ancestor, because she is the one woman from whom all humans
descended, “Mitochondrial Eve.” 
Coalescence doesn’t mean that if you go back far enough, you find only one
individual who started the whole population ball rolling. What it means is
that only one individual, out of however many existed initially, has any
descendents left. 
Figure 16-3 shows a graphical representation of this process. Time progresses
horizontally, from left to right. At the left are eight initial lineages, but as you
go forward in time, more and more of these lineages die out due to random
events until, in the end, all the current individuals are descendents of just
one of the initial eight. Looking backward in time, you can see how the final
lineages coalesce to a single ancestor in the past.

We’re all descended from Mitochondrial Eve, but we’re not all the same.
Plenty of variation has been added to the population by mutation over the
long period of time between the common ancestor and us. Eve’s family tree
has lots of branches, and there have been lots of mutation, selection, and
genetic drift acting all that time. (Head to Part II for info on the key evolution-
ary processes.)
First Africa, then the world!
By sequencing information from the mitochondrial DNA and the Y-chromosomes
(see the nearby sidebar “Of mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomes” for
details on why these bits were used), scientists know the following:
 Humans probably originated in and spread through Africa first, with a
small group leaving Africa and colonizing the rest of the world, although
some scientists disagree about whether a single group left Africa and
colonized the rest of the world or whether two different periods of emi-
gration from Africa occurred. Figure 16-4 shows a map of the Earth with
arrows indicating the patterns of human migration.
 The mitochondria of all living humans descend from one woman who
lived in Africa perhaps 200,000 years ago. Because this one woman has
been named “Mitochondrial Eve,” many people misunderstand the find-
ings, thinking that the name means that only one woman existed in the
beginning — essentially, the Biblical Eve. What the name really means,
however, is that only one out of however many women were alive at that
time gave rise to all living humans. (This situation is the key point of
coalescence, as explained in the preceding section.)

Part IV: Evolution and Your World 
Of mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomes
The name “Mitochondrial Eve” was never meant
to be provocative, but unfortunately, most people
focus on the “Eve” part (which is merely an allu-
sion to the biblical Eve and not meant to imply
that there was only a single woman on the
planet) 
and 
completely 
skip 
over 
the
“Mitochondrial” part, which is really the most
important part of the name. Mitochondrial DNA,
which remains intact through the female line,
makes it possible to identify ancestors all the
way back through time. The same is true for the
Y- chromosome, which remains intact through
the male line. 
To understand mitochondrial DNA and Y-
chromosomes, start by thinking about how you’d
create a genealogy of your ancestors. You’d get
a piece of paper, write your name down, then
draw a couple of lines from you to your parents,
draw a couple of lines from each parent to their
parents (your grandparents), and so on and so
forth until you went as far back as you could go. 
Now think about your DNA. You got half of your
DNA from each of your parents, who each gave
you one set out the two sets of chromosomes
you have. So they each gave you half of their
own DNA, but because chromosomes break and
rejoin during the process of gamete formation,
the DNA you got from each parent was a mixture
of the DNA they got from each of their parents.
Which is why one quarter of your DNA came
from each grandparent, one eighth came from
each great grandparent, and so on and so forth.
Now from the genealogical point of view for any
given bit of DNA in your genome, it’s not really
possible to tell which of your great-great-great-
grandparents that bit of your DNA came from —
with two exceptions: your mitochondrial DNA
and, if you’re male, your Y-chromosome DNA as
well. That’s because these two kinds of DNA
don’t get scrambled every generation. You got
your mitochondrial DNA from your mother; she
got it from her mother, who got it from her mother,
and so on all the way back down the line. 
All of a sudden, you (or scientists who trace lin-
eages through mitochondrial DNA) can go back
in time from one mother to the next. Through
mitochondrial DNA, a lineage can be traced
through the maternal line. 
The same thing is true of the Y-chromosome.
Because in males it pairs up with the X-
chromosome and they’re different, it doesn’t do
any recombining. (X-chromosomes do recom-
bine when they’re in women, because women
have two of them; men only have one). In males,
the Y-chromosome never has a partner for
recombination. If you’re a man, you got your Y-
chromosome from your father, who got it from his
father, and so on and so forth. Scientists can
trace the Y-chromosome back through the male
lineage. 
And that’s why these are the bits of ancestral
information we can get from our DNA. 
Recombination doesn’t happen with mitochon-
drial DNA or Y-chromosomes, but mutations can
happen, and these accumulate through time —
most are probably neutral because good muta-
tions are rare and bad ones get weeded out — in
different lineages. By studying these mutations,
scientists can say which of us are more closely
related. If you and I had a nearly identical mito-
chondrial genome, we would’ve had a most
recent common great-great-great-great-etc.
grandmother more recently than someone who’s
mitochondrial DNA was a little bit more different
than ours. 
Apply this bit of knowledge to all the people on
earth. The more mitochondrial DNA diversity we
have, the more we’ve all been diverging from a
common mother (called Mitochondrial Eve) —
and that’s the information we use to figure out
how long ago that woman existed. The deep
branches of the tree suggests that our most
common recent female ancestor lived in Africa
a couple of hundred thousand years ago. 

Evolution within Homo Sapiens
Although the primary focus of this chapter is the evolutionary origin of the
human species, human evolution didn’t stop at the moment of speciation.
Humans are still evolving. The following sections discuss some of the evolu-
tionary events that have happened since the origin of our species.
Natural selection: Still acting on humans
Because humans can alter the environment to suit ourselves, we sometimes
assume that we’ve stopped evolving, but we haven’t. Natural selection has
continued to act, increasing the frequency of advantageous genes. In fact, the
very changes we make can select for evolutionary changes. For some exam-
ples, read on.
265
Chapter 16: Human Evolution
Of lice and men
If you always suspected that humans were spe-
cial in some way, here’s another bit of evidence
to prove that you’re absolutely right: Although
most species of mammals have at most one
kind of louse, the human species has three! This
fact actually says quite a bit about human
development.
Humans have head lice, adapted to hanging
onto hair; body lice, adapted to hanging onto
clothing; and pubic lice which like the nether
regions. An analysis of the amount of genetic
difference between the head lice and the body
lice suggests that they diverged approximately
100,000 years ago, which gives scientists an
approximate date of origin for tight-fitting fabric
clothing — the sort body lice adapted to attach
to. In the absence of clothing, lice were con-
fined to hair, but when humans began to wear
clothes, lice were able to spread to other
regions of the body. Because the selective
forces were different in each environment —
head versus body — speciation between head
and body lice eventually occurred.
So what about the third type of human lice:
pubic lice? As it turns out, human pubic lice are
closely related to gorilla body lice. They’re
divergent enough from gorilla lice, however, for
scientists to be able to say that the transfer from
gorillas to humans predated the evolution of
body lice (and, therefore, the development of
clothing). This finding suggests that humans lost
their body hair (and, hence, had separate head
and pubic-hair regions that different species of
lice could colonize) long before they developed
clothing.
Bottom line? Lice tell a story. If you have hair all
over your body, you have only one kind of lice.
Separate the hair into patches, and you can get
lice adapted to each different patch. Cover
some of the hairless area with a substance like
clothing, and you can get diversification and
speciation as one of the lice species (it just hap-
pened to be the one on the human head) radi-
ates into this new habitat.
Oh, and by the way, lice are continuing to
evolve. If you’ve ever had to deal with head lice
and couldn’t get rid of the buggers, you already
know that many of them are now resistant to the
chemicals we use to eradicate them.

The evolution of lactose digestion
None of our primate relatives can digest lactose — the sugar found in milk —
as adults. Infant mammals need to be able to digest milk, but historically,
they haven’t needed this ability after weaning. By domesticating dairy ani-
mals, however, humans altered the environment in a way that selected for
evolution of lactose-digesting ability in adults.
Human lineages that are associated with dairy farming have a much lower
level of lactose intolerance than do lineages that aren’t. In Africa, for exam-
ple, the Nigerian Yoruba, an ethnic group in Nigeria, are 99 percent lactose
intolerant, whereas cattle herders in the southern Sudan are less than 20 per-
cent lactose intolerant.
Human disease and population density
The evolution of human disease is strongly affected by human population
size. And large human populations became possible with advances in food
production, namely the advent of farming. As human population density
increased, human pests and parasites thrived, and humans evolved increased
resistance to them. So in large populations, humans have developed built-in
protection against the organisms that would do them harm.
But not all humans developed this resistance — just the ones living in high-
density environments. Human populations living in low-density environments
are relatively free of virulent pathogens. Small populations can’t sustain infec-
tion, because everyone can be infected at the same time, and survivors of the
disease become immune. The result? The pathogen goes extinct. If no one in
the small group survives (in small groups, less chance exists that resistant
individuals are present), the pathogen still goes extinct. As a result of the lack
of constant exposure, small populations don’t evolve resistance to disease. In
a large population, on the other hand, new sensitive individuals are always
being born. 
When humans from large populations come into contact with humans who
have traditionally lived in small groups, those from the large populations
pass along diseases that can be far more serious for the people in the small
populations. Tragic examples are the debilitating effects of disease on native
populations in the Americas after contact with European explorers. The risk
continues to this day when people from large populations come into contact
with small groups in the Brazilian rain forest and other isolated locations.
Think about smallpox. Back in the day when smallpox was rampant, some-
body always had it. (If at any instant no one was sick with smallpox, the virus
would’ve gone extinct.) In a large population, new susceptible individuals
were always being born, so the virus always had a refuge of new people to
infect. Although smallpox was a dreaded disease, people in Europe, Asia, and
266
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

Africa were relatively resistant to it. Only 25 percent of people who con-
tracted it died — a big number, true, but 75 percent of infected people sur-
vived. Compare that outcome with the experience of smaller populations,
particularly in the New World.
The Americas were colonized via the Bering land bridge at a time preceding
the development of agriculture and large population sizes. Movement to the
New World would have been in small groups of hunter-gatherers — groups
too small to maintain infectious diseases such as smallpox. As a result of the
relative freedom from European diseases in the New World (an accident of
history), human populations in the Americas didn’t evolve resistance to
these diseases and were devastated by them upon coming into contact with
European explorers and colonists.
Relaxation of selection
Allele frequencies can change in response to natural selection or in response
to a reduction in selection pressures. As some of the selective forces that
have acted on humans in the past are eliminated — humans no longer need
to run away from big, fierce, hungry animals, for example — other alleles can
increase in frequency as a result of genetic drift (random events; refer to
Chapter 6). 
In an environment in which running fast doesn’t confer any particular benefit,
not being able to run fast doesn’t mean that humans are in any way less fit. As
long as no tigers are around, our slow alleles don’t have a lower probability
of being passed on to the next generation. So we may get slower, but we don’t
get less fit. (Note that there isn’t selection for slower running; there just isn’t
selection either way.)
Cultural evolution
Cultural evolution isn’t a biological phenomenon, but it’s an interesting topic
that can help you understand how humans are able to alter the environment
rapidly and outcompete all the other species.
In biological evolution, genes get transmitted directly from parent to offspring,
and they increase in the population as a result of either random forces or posi-
tive selection. Either way, the process can take some time. In cultural evolu-
tion, advancements (such as bright ideas or better ways of doing things)
aren’t limited to this vertical pathway of parent to offspring. If I figure out how
to make a better spear, for example, I don’t pass the information to my chil-
dren genetically; I just show them how to do it. Then I show everybody else in
the tribe how to do it, too.
267
Chapter 16: Human Evolution

Because cultural evolution can change behaviors or traits much faster than
genetic evolution does, animals whose sole adaptive ability relies on genetic
evolution are at a disadvantage. Rapid selection will occur to cause tigers to
keep their distance from large groups of people armed with spears, for exam-
ple, but changes in human hunting ability occur so suddenly that the tigers
might still go extinct. Humans are still evolving biologically, but we’re evolv-
ing culturally as well, which gives us an edge that other species can’t match.

The Evolution of Antibiotic
Resistance
In This Chapter

 Figuring out what to do next
H
ere’s an interesting tidbit to throw out at your next dinner party: Our
bodies have been colonized by all manner of bacteria. Yes, that’s right;
you are your own big blue marble. Fortunately, many of the bacteria that
have set up housekeeping in your body are commensal bacteria: They colo-
nize your skin or your gastrointestinal tract and are rarely of any concern.
Others, however, such as Staphylococcus aureus, aren’t such good citizens.
They hang around on your skin and in your nasal (and other) passages, look-
ing for ways to stir up trouble.
So why aren’t you sick all the time? Because your immune system does a
pretty good job of keeping potentially harmful bacteria at bay. And when
your immune system has trouble, antibiotics — compounds designed to kill
or neutralize infectious agents — can help. There’s one hitch, though:
Bacteria evolve in ways that make them better at overcoming our bodies’
defenses and more resistant to the antibiotics we use to get rid of them.
In this chapter, I explain the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and
show that the way humans use (and overuse) antibiotics is directly related to
how bacteria evolve.

Antibiotics and Antibiotic 
Resistance in a Nutshell
In this chapter, I use the term antibiotic to refer to any chemical that kills bac-
teria or inhibits bacterial growth. I’d stop there, but because the term antibiotic
is often in the news and used interchangeably with terms like antimicrobial and
antiviral, a little more explanation is in order — especially when these terms
tend to appear in rather alarming news stories about infections running
amok. To help you avoid confusion and gain a little perspective, I offer the fol-
lowing sections.
Splitting microbial hairs: 
Defining antibiotics
Microbes are a diverse collection of organisms, many of which have almost
nothing in common except that they are extremely little. They fall into three
major categories — bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotes, which include fungi
(which have some important disease organisms) — as well as a bunch of
other critters, like Giardia and other protozoan parasites, that cause diseases
like diarrhea and malaria. Humans tend to lump them all together because, as
a group, they’re responsible for infectious diseases.
Antimicrobials, as you may cleverly guess, are compounds that are active
against microbes. Each antimicrobial has a name that indicates which
microbe it’s active against:
 Antivirals: Antimicrobial compounds that target viruses.
 Antifungals: Compounds active against fungi.
 Antimalarials and other compounds: These are active against specific
kinds of eukaryotic diseases (see the nearby sidebar “Eukaryotes for
you and me”). (Note: Antimicrobials that are active against these types
of infections tend to be named more specifically.)
 Antibacterials: Compounds that are active against bacteria.
Here’s where matters get confusing: Antibacterials are often referred to as
antibiotics, a term that is also occasionally used interchangeably with the
term antimicrobial.
Antibiotic can be used generally to refer to all disease-fighting compounds
and specifically to mean only those compounds that are effective against bac-
terial agents. This dual-purpose use of the term leads to one of the biggest
misunderstandings about what antibiotics can and can’t do. You may have
270
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

heard that antibiotics aren’t effective against viral infections. That’s true,
when the term antibiotics is used specifically to mean antibacterial, which by
definition means active only against bacteria, not against other microbes.
Technically, antibiotics are chemicals that kill or inhibit the growth of biotic
(biological, or living) things, as opposed to abiotic things (like rocks). Rat
poison is an antibiotic; so is Round Up. But when scientists use the term
antibiotic, they’re almost always referring to antibacterial agents — things
that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria — because the original antibiotic
compounds, such as penicillin, were active against bacteria.
A brief history of antibiotic resistance
In the days before antibiotics were widely available and widely used, people
knew the dangers of infection. Even minor injuries like cuts and scrapes were
taken far more seriously; just ask your grandparents. That’s because an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure — all the more so when there
isn’t any cure.
Fast-forward to today. People tend not to view cuts and scrapes as being
potentially serious medical conditions. Prevention seems less important,
because we have a pound of cure — pounds and pounds and pounds, in fact.
In 2007, people in the United States used millions of pounds of antibiotics.
Therein lies the problem. With each passing year, antibiotics become less
effective as bacterial populations evolve to be resistant to them.
Although recent news stories warning people about antibiotic-resistant
strains of bacteria may lead you to believe that the phenomenon is relatively
recent, it’s actually as old as the use of antibiotics. Penicillin, the first widely
used antibiotic, dates to the end of World War II. Within four years after its
introduction, scientists observed resistant bacteria, and the incidence of
resistance has increased steadily to the present day.
You’d think that having identified the fact that bacteria began to evolve almost
immediately in response to penicillin would have encouraged people to be a
bit more careful about the use of antibiotics. But we weren’t, partly because
it’s hard to not use a medication that’s so effective (many people considered
penicillin to be a miracle drug) and partly because at the time, new antibiotic
compounds were being discovered regularly. When one compound was no
longer effective, doctors simply switched to a different compound. The sce-
nario is very different today.
In recent years, bacteria have been gaining on us: The rate at which
researchers have discovered new medically useful antibiotics has slowed,
but the steady march of the evolution of resistance continues unchecked.

Chapter 17: The Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance

Again, the evolution of resistance isn’t new. In every case, scientists have
noted the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria shortly after the antibiotic
was introduced. 
Today, we humans now find ourselves facing bacteria that are resistant to
many — and, in some cases, all — available antibiotics. Examples include
staph, tuberculosis, syphilis, and gonorrhea. The most frightening thing we
can observe from this information is that in the end, all of our antibacterial
compounds end up being defeated.
Becoming Resistant to Antibiotics: 
A How-to Guide
Try as scientists might to develop new and better antibiotics, bacteria are
gaining on them, evolving resistance against every compound science can
throw their way. Bacteria, in other words, are pretty good at this evolution
thing, and here’s why: 
272
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 
Antibacterials, antifungals, antivirals, and you
Most of the antimicrobial compounds at humans’
disposal are compounds that are active against
bacteria rather than against other microorgan-
isms, such as fungi and viruses. Why? Because
developing compounds that are active against
viruses and fungi is far harder. To be medically
useful, a compound has to be able to stop the
invading microorganisms without hurting the
person taking the compound.
At the biochemical level, bacteria are quite dif-
ferent from people, making it possible to target
specific details of the bacterial physiology with-
out overly affecting human physiology. The
same isn’t true of viruses and fungi:
 Viruses replicate primarily by harnessing
human cellular machinery. For that reason,
harming the virus without harming our-
selves is very difficult.
 Fungi are quite a bit more similar to humans
at the biochemical level than we might like
to imagine; therefore, the substances that
hurt fungi also hurt us (which is why it’s so
hard to cure a fungal infection like athlete’s
foot). Although chemicals are available that
can harm the fungus pretty efficiently, the
same chemicals tend to harm us, too.
This isn’t to say that antibacterial compounds
are without side effects. Many compounds do
have side effects, which can be severe, but 
the medical risks of these side effects are bal-
anced against the obvious benefits of curing the
infection.

 They reproduce extremely rapidly, and lots of them exist. 
 They’ve been at it a long time. Antibiotics are common in nature.
Penicillin, the first antibiotic in wide use, comes from a fungus,
Pennicillium chrysogenum.
 They are the weapons bacteria and other organisms sometimes use in
fighting each other. 
Bacteria can gain antibiotic resistance in a couple of ways: by mutations and
by gene transfers. The following sections give the details.
Evolution via mutation
As I explain in Chapter 5, evolution by natural selection requires the exis-
tence of a variation on which selection can act. The initial source of all varia-
tion is the random mutations in an organism’s DNA. These mutations occur
during the processes of DNA replication (when copies are made) or repair.
Basically, whenever an organism is doing something with its DNA, a chance
exists that a mistake will occur, resulting in DNA with a slightly different
sequence.
Because bacteria reproduce rapidly (sometimes as fast as every 15 minutes),
and because so many of them are around, many opportunities are available
for these changes in DNA sequence to occur. Put a billion bacteria in a
beaker, and come back 15 minutes later; you could find 2 billion bacteria. In
the course of duplicating those 1 billion genomes, a substantial number of
errors will have occurred. Bacteria’s fast, high-density lifestyle gives them an
evolutionary edge.
You can observe this phenomenon in the laboratory very easily. An experi-
menter takes a single bacterium that’s known to be sensitive to a particular
antibiotic, drops the bacterium into a nice cozy beaker, and lets the bac-
terium divide. Pretty soon the beaker contains two bacteria, then four, and
then eight. By the next day, the beaker contains millions and millions of bac-
teria, all descendents of the same antibiotic-sensitive parent. Now the experi-
menter takes these millions of bacteria and exposes them all to the antibiotic.
Often, he finds that the beaker now contains resistant bacteria. Mutations
have appeared in these bacteria as a result of DNA replication errors, and
these mutations confer resistance to the antibiotic. When the remaining bac-
teria reproduce to fill the flask again, the experimenter ends up with a flask
full of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
273
Chapter 17: The Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance

Scientists would really like to develop an antibiotic to which bacteria can’t
evolve resistance, but so far, they haven’t had any luck. The process of evolu-
tion is so powerful that when scientists change the bacteria’s environment by
adding antibiotics, they always manage to select for resistant bacteria. In our
new antibiotic-drenched world, any bacterium that’s a little bit better at sur-
viving in the presence of antibiotics is going to be the one that leaves the
most descendents.
A common misconception is that the addition of the antibiotic leads to the
genetic changes that result in antibiotic resistance. But evolution requires
that the variation already be present. The addition of the antibiotic didn’t
cause the bacteria in the beaker to become antibiotic resistant; it just killed
all the antibiotic-sensitive bacteria, leaving behind only the bacteria that 
happened to be antibiotic resistant already.
Evolution via gene transfer
An interesting characteristic of bacteria is that occasionally they acquire
genes from bacteria of other species. Yes, that phenomenon is as weird as it
sounds. Bacterial reproduction usually involves just dividing in two; no other
bacteria is required, and both of the resulting bacteria are (excepting the
occasional mutation) genetically identical. Every once in a while, however, a
bacterium acquires genes from somewhere else. When it does, it’s not too
picky about which genes it gets.
An example of this kind of acquisition of new genes is the pathogenic E. coli
0157:H7 (see Chapter 15). E. coli 0157:H7 first came to light after an outbreak
at a fast-food establishment; as of late, it’s been found in a large number of
domestic cattle operations, as well as in the occasional bag of spinach. This
nasty version of E. coli started out as plain old, relatively harmless E. coli, but
it picked up a whole bunch of genes that E. coli usually don’t have, some of
them quite nasty.
Gene transfer between bacteria can greatly speed the rate at which an 
antibiotic-resistant gene spreads. Rather than having to evolve separately 
in each individual bacterial species, antibiotic resistance can, after having
evolved once, be transferred to different species.
This type of gene acquisition by bacteria (called horizontal transfer to differ-
entiate it from vertical transfer, in which the trait is passed down through
descendents), occurs via three mechanisms:
274
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

 Transformation: The process whereby a bacterial cell picks up DNA
from its environment and incorporates it into its own genome.
 Transduction: The process whereby genes are carried from one bac-
terium to another in a bacterial virus. Occasionally, before leaving the
host cell, a virus particle that’s being assembled accidentally gets filled
with bacterial DNA instead of viral DNA. When that virus particle latches
onto a new bacterium, it injects that bacterium with the foreign bacterial
DNA, which may then be incorporated into the bacterium’s genome.
 Conjugation: The process in which two bacteria join and DNA is passed
from one to the next. This process is controlled by a small circle of DNA
living within the bacterium, called a plasmid.
Plasmids, which are much bigger than the pieces of DNA usually involved
in transformation and transduction, are especially important in the
spread of antibiotic resistance. Through a single plasmid, a bacterium
can become resistant to numerous antibiotics in one fell swoop, some-
times with tragic results: An outbreak of Shigella dysentery containing a
plasmid coding for resistance to four antibiotics was responsible for
over 10,000 deaths in Guatemala during the late 1960s.
Resistance at the cellular 
and biochemical levels
In the preceding sections, I talk about antibiotic resistance in general terms:
how bacteria can evolve through mutations and through gene transfer.
Whether resistance is conferred by mutations in DNA or by gene transfers,
something goes on at the cellular and biochemical levels that changes the
bacteria from being antibiotic sensitive to being antibiotic resistant. Basically,
the resistance comes in one of three forms:
 Mutations that reduce the amount of antibiotic entering the bacterial cell,
such as changes in the cell membrane that make it more difficult for the
antibiotic to get in or that pump out the antibiotic as soon as it gets in.
 Mutations that enable the bacteria to produce enzymes that destroy the
antibiotic.
 Mutations that change what the antibiotic targets. These changes can
range from changing the shape of proteins so that the antibiotic no
longer recognizes them to reorganizing biochemical pathways to elimi-
nate the stages that the antibiotic targets.
275
Chapter 17: The Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance

Evolving a bit at a time: Partial resistance
Bacteria may evolve complete immunity to the particular antibiotic by first
passing through a stage of partial immunity. Partially resistant bacteria can
survive a concentration of the antibiotic sufficient to kill susceptible bacteria
but will succumb to a greater concentration.
Imagine a scenario in which no single mutation can render the bacteria com-
pletely immune to a particular antibiotic, but some mutations convey partial
resistance. These mutations are favored only when antibiotic concentrations
are low; such conditions lead to a population of partially resistant bacteria.
Then another single mutation could result in the partially resistant bacteria
becoming either more or completely resistant to the antibiotic.
Partial resistance is the reason why doctors tell you to finish a course of
antibiotics — even if you’re feeling better and even if you’ve decided that the
last couple of pills are unnecessary. The initial pulse of antibiotics kills all the
sensitive bacteria (which is why you feel better), but some of the remaining
276

Mercy, mercy me! MRSA
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) is a staph infection that can be very
hard to treat because it’s resistant to a lot of
antibiotics including, no surprises here, methi-
cillin, which otherwise would be wonderfully
effective. According to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, MRSA infec-
tions (discovered in the early 1960s) accounted
for 2 percent of staph infections in 1974. Thirty
years later (by 2004), MRSA accounted for 63
percent. 
MRSA is alarming for these reasons:
 Although MRSA staph infections can still be
treated with other drugs, these drugs are
more expensive, have greater side effects,
and act more slowly than the drugs that
were effective against it in the past. MRSA
can often be treated with the antibiotic
Vancomycin, for example. Unfortunately, we
now have to worry about a new version of
staph infection called, you guessed it, VRSA.
 MRSA infections cause thousands of deaths
every year, but the most frightening ones, the
ones that make for the most sensational
news, are the cases of “flesh eating staph.”
Deep bacterial infections can cause massive
tissue damage. While many kinds of bacte-
ria have been implicated in such infections,
MRSA is becoming an increasingly common
cause. Because of the speed with which
these deep infections can progress, treat-
ment becomes a race against time. Even
with the best medical care, fatality rates can
be high, and having to use suboptimal antibi-
otics (because bacteria have grown resis-
tant to the better ones) only makes the
situation worse.
 Most MRSA infections (about 85 percent)
are acquired in healthcare settings, but in
the 1990s, MRSA began showing up in the
broader community and are called CA-
MRSA (for community associated MRSA).

bacteria may be partially resistant to the antibiotic. Rather than let the par-
tially resistant bacteria off the hook, don’t give them a chance to get a leg up
on the antibiotic. After all, they’re the ones you really want to control. Stop
them while you still can!
The Battle against Antibiotic Resistance
Science is fighting a battle against antibiotic resistance — and losing because
of how quickly microbes evolve. A big part of the problem is that we humans
are the major selective force driving the evolution of antibiotic resistance in
those critters that infect us. Every time scientists throw a new antibiotic at a
microbe, they end up selecting for more resistant microbes. Science needs to
change its strategy, and evolutionary biology can help:
 Making new drugs: If researchers understand exactly how the bacteria
evolve resistance, they may be able to design better drugs.
 Testing and refining theories about what happens if humans use
antibiotics less: The science of evolutionary biology, complete with all
the beautiful experiments outlined in later sections of this chapter, is
how scientists generate and modify their expectations. Unfortunately,
much of what they learn from these experiments is bleak, but at least
they learn something, and what they learn is important to understanding
how microbial populations respond to changes in the way humans use
antibiotics.
 Not screwing up the drugs we already have: By being careful about
how and when we use antibiotic medications, humans can slow the
development of antibiotic resistance.
New and improved! Making new drugs
By understanding the mechanisms that make a particular microorganism
antibiotic resistant, scientists can tailor new antibiotics to undermine that
mechanism. If a bacterium is antibiotic resistant because it can pump antibi-
otics out of its cell, doctors can change the way the antibiotic is administered:
Instead of giving the antibiotic alone, they can give it along with a second com-
pound that disrupts each bacterium’s pumping ability. Voilà — an effective
solution. Similarly, by understanding exactly how bacterial enzymes destroy an
antibiotic, scientists can design new, slightly different antibiotics that aren’t as
readily degraded.
277
Chapter 17: The Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance

Turning back the clock 
to bacterial sensitivity 
Some scientists have suggested that if humans temporarily cease using antibi-
otics, bacterial populations will lose their resistance in one of two ways — by
evolving back to being susceptible to antibiotics or by being out competed
by the remaining sensitive bacteria that are no longer at a disadvantage — at
which point humans could resume using antibiotics with much greater effect. 
Evolving back
The thinking goes like this: Removing the antibiotic would result in the evolu-
tion of sensitive bacteria only if the sensitive bacteria have an advantage over
the resistant bacteria. The most commonly envisioned advantage? That antibi-
otic resistance has a cost. Maybe the changes that make bacteria resistant
(changes in bacterial membranes, for example, or DNA replication) also make
them less able to perform other bacterial functions. By removing the antibi-
otic from the environment, mutations back to the original bacterial physiology
would be favored, because sensitive bacteria are better than resistant bacteria
at doing all the things bacteria have to do in the absence of antibiotics.
This hypothesis is great, but would it work? Several experiments have been
conducted regarding this question, and they show, unfortunately, that the
solution isn’t as simple as instituting a moratorium on antibiotic use. Why?
For the reasons explained in the following sections.
Bacteria continue to evolve
Although bacteria resistance comes at a cost (they tend to grow more slowly
in the presence of antibiotics than the original sensitive bacteria do), the
process of amelioration — secondary mutations decreasing the debilitating
effect of the initial mutation — is favored by selection. If the initial antibiotic-
resistant mutant had a high fitness cost, subsequent evolution selects for
additional mutations that increase the fitness of the antibiotic-resistant
strain. As time goes by, the antibiotic-resistant bacteria don’t have as low a
fitness compared with the original bacteria (in the absence of antibiotics) as
scientists would wish them to have. Thus, removing the antibiotics won’t
have as much of an effect as we would all want.
Starting with a wild sensitive bacterial strain, Stephanie Schrag and cowork-
ers grew the strain until they could find and isolate an antibiotic-resistant
bacterial mutant whose fitness was lower because of its mutation (the old
DNA sequence was better than the new DNA sequence for some key bacterial
function). They then grew this antibiotic-resistant bacteria for many genera-
tions in the lab and let evolution happen. As the antibiotic-resistant bacteria
evolved, their fitness improved because of compensatory mutations, addi-
tional mutations that returned their fitness to about the level of the original
antibiotic-sensitive strain.
278
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

Think back to that antibiotic-resistant bacterium that’s not so good at DNA
replication. Because it has the resistant allele, it manages to spread to the
environment after all the sensitive bacteria have expired; now it lives in a sea
of bacteria that are all resistant to the antibiotic but that all have a little trou-
ble replicating their DNA. In this population, mutations that restore the abil-
ity to replicate DNA easily will be favored, and after selection has proceeded
for some time, the antibiotic-resistant bacteria gain back much of the func-
tion they initially lost. 
Compensatory and back mutations aren’t what they’re cut out to be
So you have a strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are now just as fit as
the original antibiotic-sensitive strain. Now imagine what would happen if
you take away all the antibiotics. Mutations still occur, and eventually one
will appear that undoes what the original resistance mutation did (replaces
the new sequence with the old sequence again), making this strain sensitive
again. Will this new antibiotic sensitive strain take over so we can start using
antibiotics again? Unfortunately no, because the old DNA sequence is not
better than the new DNA sequence in the presence of the subsequent, post
resistance, DNA changes. It was in the original strain, but not any more.
To determine that compensatory mutations could actually lower the proba-
bility that the resistant bacteria would evolve back toward sensitivity to
antibiotics if antibiotics were removed, Schrag and coworkers conducted a
second study. Using genetic engineering, they replaced the DNA responsible
for antibiotic resistance with the DNA sequence of the sensitive strain while
leaving the compensatory mutations unchanged. In effect, they created the
bacteria that would exist if the antibiotic-resistant strain mutated back to
being antibiotic sensitive.
The surprising result was that the antibiotic-sensitive bacteria they’d created
in the laboratory grew more slowly than the resistant strain in the absence of
antibiotics. What this result means is that all the compensatory mutations
that piled up in the antibiotic-resistant bacteria were advantageous only in
the presence of the antibiotic-resistant gene; they were deleterious in the
presence of the original sensitive gene.
After an antibiotic-resistant gene has appeared and compensatory mutations
of the sort that Schrag and coworkers found in their laboratory have arisen,
the antibiotic-resistant gene can be more fit than the antibiotic-sensitive
gene, even in the absence of antibiotics. Why? Because a back mutation (a
mutation that undoes exactly what the first mutation did) rendering one of
these antibiotic-resistant bacteria susceptible could have lower fitness even
in the absence of antibiotics. That situation is troubling because when all the
bacteria become resistant, they stay resistant even if the antibiotic is stopped
for a while. While we don’t know exactly how common this sort of result
would be, it’s not good news.
279
Chapter 17: The Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance

Mutations aren’t necessarily as costly as you’d think
Although most antibiotic-resistant mutations have associated costs, some of
them have very small costs, and some even have no cost. An awful lot of bac-
teria are around, and if even a few of them are capable of acquiring antibiotic-
resistant mutations with no deleterious effects, this small class of mutations
will be able to beat out the much larger number of antibiotic-resistant muta-
tions that result in less healthy resistant bacteria. In a battle between the
debilitated bacteria and the undamaged bacteria, the debilitated ones won’t
last long.
Just as genetic differences exist between different humans, genetic differences
exist between different bacteria within a species. This situation raises the
question of how important these different genetic backgrounds are in deter-
mining the associated costs of resistance. Fred Cohan and coworkers found
that the genetic background in which an antibiotic mutation appeared was an
important factor in the associated costs of that mutation. They determined
that in some cases, acquiring resistance to an antibiotic was associated with
few or no costs in other areas of bacterial physiology.
Cohan and his coworkers performed an experiment using the common soil
bacteria Bacillus subtilis, which can take up DNA from the environment and
incorporate it into its own genetic material. The researchers isolated a strain
of Bacillus subtilis that was resistant to the antibiotic rifampin, made many
copies of the gene that made the bacteria antibiotic resistant, and then intro-
duced this gene into a collection of wild Bacillus subtilis strains simply by
exposing samples of the different bacteria to the DNA responsible for antibi-
otic resistance. As they expected, the sample bacteria took up this gene.
For each of the wild bacteria, they compared the growth rate of the strain
before the introduction of the antibiotic-resistant gene with the growth rate
of the strain after the introduction of antibiotic resistance. In most, but not
all, cases, they found a substantial decrease in growth rate with the introduc-
tion of the antibiotic-resistant gene.
Their conclusion? Antibiotic resistance indeed had a cost — but not always.
Costs differed greatly among the different genetic backgrounds, and in a
small number of cases, the antibiotic-resistant bacteria weren’t significantly
debilitated compared with the original sensitive strain.
Antibiotic resistance and tuberculosis 
To determine the clinical importance of antibiotic mutants with different fit-
ness effects, Sebastien Gagneux, Clara Davis, Brendan Bohannan, and others
conducted a series of experiments with the strain of bacteria that causes
tuberculosis. They found that the mutations they could identify in the labora-
tory as having the lowest fitness costs were the same antibiotic-resistant
mutations that were responsible for the resistant strains of tuberculosis pre-
sent in clinical settings.
280
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

The researchers conducted laboratory experiments to measure the fitness
costs of a series of antibiotic-resistant mutations. They examined a variety of
mutations and found that some tended to have low fitness costs and that
others tended to have high fitness costs. Then they examined the mutations
present in clinical settings.
What they found was that antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis strains isolated
from patients were very likely to contain antibiotic-resistance genes that had
been shown in their laboratory experiments to have low fitness costs. They
never found, in their patients, antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis strains with
resistance alleles that had been shown to have high fitness costs. Both types
of mutations occur, but the types with high fitness costs don’t increase to the
point where they are detectable. Furthermore, some of the clinical strains
harboring the lowest-cost antibiotic-resistance mutation exhibited no
decrease in fitness relative to the sensitive strain. 
This is a finding of major importance, and unfortunately it’s bad news. It had
been suggested (and hoped) that if we reduced our use of antibiotics, the
antibiotic-resistant bacteria would decline because they were supposed to be
less fit than the original strains in the absence of antibiotics. They would just
get overwhelmed by the few remaining resistant bacteria. Turns out that
while many possible mutants are less fit, the ones that take over are the ones
that aren’t. 
Changing the way antibiotics are used
The results of the experiments outlined in the preceding section suggest that
we humans had better think seriously about battling antibiotic resistance by
trying to slow its progression rather than hoping we’ll be able to deal with it
after it occurs. To do that, we have to make real changes in how we use
antibiotics — such as taking all our medicine. Taking only some of the antibi-
otics can create partially resistant bacteria, which may acquire subsequent
mutations that make them even more resistant. 
Here’s just a little personal (and public) health note: Once you’ve knocked
the infection down with the first half of the bottle, you’ve selected for the
most resistant bacteria. The only way to kill those off is to finish the course
of pills. 
Another change is that people can use antibiotics less, which will decrease
the selective pressure on the remaining sensitive bacteria. With fewer antibi-
otics around, sensitive bacteria would be less likely to be outcompeted by
resistant bacteria. The idea is that, although humans can’t stop using antibi-
otics to cure diseases, maybe we can stop hosing down the entire agricultural
world with the same compounds we rely on to survive those diseases.
281
Chapter 17: The Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance

Of the fraction of antibiotics in the United States that are used to treat human
disease, evidence exists that many prescriptions are unnecessary. Patients
want antibiotics even when they have no reason to think that their illness will
respond to antibiotics — when they have the flu, for example — and the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 90 per-
cent of physicians report feeling pressure to prescribe antibiotics that they
know are unnecessary. So give your doctor a break!
For the past 60 years, antibiotics have allowed humans to live without fear of
bacterial disease. With proper stewardship of this great resource, we can
continue to enjoy the protections that antibiotics offer, but the point where
we must take action to ensure the future efficacy of antibiotics is rapidly
approaching. Scientists know with absolute certainty that bacteria will con-
tinue to evolve antibiotic resistance in response to human use of antibiotics.
What is uncertain is whether we humans will make this evolution hard for
them.
282
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 
Antibiotics and agriculture
Of the millions of pounds of antibiotics used
annually in the United States, less than half are
used to treat human diseases. The majority of
antibiotics are used in agriculture and not pri-
marily for treating sick animals:
 Low doses of antibiotics are used as a food
additive to increase animal growth rate. The
mechanism by which low doses of antibi-
otics increase animal growth rate is unclear,
but what is clear is that farms and feed-
lots are growing reservoirs of antibiotic-
resistance genes.
 Antibiotics are sprayed on fruit trees, result-
ing in a continuum of antibiotic concentra-
tions starting from high at the center of the
orchard and gradually fading to nothing at
the edges of the antibiotic mist cloud. These
continuous low doses of antibiotics in agri-
cultural settings provide exactly the right sit-
uation for the evolution of fully resistant
bacterial types.

mallpox. Influenza. Cholera. Syphilis. Yellow fever. Measles. Typhus.
Plague. Malaria. Every age — and region — has its scourge, and some
have more than their fair share. You may think that some these diseases are
of the past (or of undeveloped countries) and that they don’t really affect
you. But when it comes to viral infections, no society or region is off the
hook. Case in point: the appearance in the early 1980s of a new disease:
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS.
AIDS scared the bejesus out of people. It was deadly. It was painful. And in
the beginning at least, no one knew where it had come from or how it was
spread. Fast-forward nearly 30 years. Scientists know quite a bit more about
AIDS now than they did then. They know what causes it (the human immun-
odeficiency virus, or HIV), where it came from (other primates), and the path
that the disease takes when it enters a human body.
How do they know all this stuff? By knowing how viruses work and by study-
ing the evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus itself. Evolution is
important in understanding HIV at many levels — from the origin of the virus
to the disease process within a single patient to the development of effective
treatment options.

What Viruses Are
Given that this chapter and the one on influenza that follows both deal with
viruses, knowing exactly what a virus is and how it functions is probably a
good idea. To that end, viruses are
 Microscopic entities: The smallest microorganisms are viruses, even if
not all viruses are smaller than all other organisms.
Viruses used to be considered the smallest of all microorganisms (the
smallest things are still viruses) until scientists found a really big one —
so big, in fact, that you can see it under a light microscope. This Baby
Huey of viruses is bigger than a lot of bacteria, and it infects amoebas.
 Obligate intercellular parasites: This is a fancy phrase that means
viruses can survive and multiply only in living cells. Whose living 
cells? Why the hosts’, of course. 
A virus is an extremely simple organism. It consists of the viral genome
(which can be made up of DNA or RNA) and any other molecules that the
virus needs to get going after it’s invaded the host cell. All this stuff is
enclosed in an outer coat made of proteins or, in some cases, of proteins 
and lipids, which is a fancy word for fat.
Are viruses alive? We say “Yes!”
Viruses are odd — so odd that no consensus exists on whether they’re actu-
ally living things. Some people say yes; some people say no (and some people
say sort of, but I’m not going to worry about the fence-sitters here).
One way to classify things as living or not living is to come up with a list of
things that we think living things should have and then ask if our test object —
in this case, viruses — has those things. Consider these examples of things
that living organisms share:
 Cells: With the discovery of the microscope, which predated the discov-
ery of viruses, scientists saw that all the living things they looked at had
cells, so the definition of a living thing came to include having cells.
Then scientists discovered viruses, which don’t have cells. So under the
“all living things have cells” definition, a virus, which doesn’t have cells,
can’t be a living thing.
284
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

 A genome made up of nucleic acid: Viruses have a genome, the instruc-
tion set for making the organism, and when it’s time to reproduce, they
make new copies of the genome and package them into progeny viruses.
The viral genome also codes for proteins, just as the human genome
does, but because viruses are parasites, they don’t need to make all the
proteins — just the ones that the host doesn’t already make. If having 
a nucleic-acid genome that codes for the production of proteins is the
definition of life, viruses are alive.
If you say that, to be considered living things, viruses must have certain char-
acteristics, then they are (or aren’t) living organisms based on the character-
istics you select. But this is a very nebulous way of defining what’s alive and
what isn’t. If you say, for example, that having hair is a defining characteristic
of a living organism, then you’d be alive, but a fish wouldn’t. This example is
silly, of course, but it shows how definitions have no foundations other than
the ones humans give them.
A more helpful way to determine whether something is alive is to think about
fundamental processes associated with life. Living things reproduce, for
example. They also evolve. The process of copying the genome isn’t error
free, and mutations occur; mutations that are advantageous may increase in
frequency. Being able to evolve is what fundamentally separates the living
from the not living. A fire spreading through a forest reproduces itself, and a
few flames lead to more flames, but fire itself doesn’t evolve.
Viruses are independently evolving entities. They reproduce. They contain
within themselves the instruction set for their own reproduction: the genome.
And that genome changes through time: it evolves. If you use the life processes
of reproduction and evolution as the fundamental characteristics of living
organisms, viruses are alive.
The fact that viruses evolve is important not only for understanding where
they come from and how they work, but also for addressing the threat 
that they pose and providing treatment. To treat a patient who’s been 
poisoned, you just need to know how to counteract that particular poison.
Treating a patient whose illness is the result of an organism that can evolve
requires anticipating and responding to the adaptations that the organism
can make. In the case of HIV, by the time a patient experiences symptoms, 
the virus has evolved and behaves differently from the original virus that
infected the patient.
Whether you want to consider viruses living or not is entirely up to you.
Regardless of which side of the debate you land on, all the information in 
this chapter still applies. Alive or not alive, viruses evolve, and that’s the
important thing.

Viral reproduction: DNA, RNA, or retro?
The only way a virus can reproduce is to infect a host cell, hijack the cell’s
machinery to make copies of itself, and then move on to infect other 
cells. But not all viruses do things the same way, and these differences 
can have consequences for everything from viral evolution to treatment.
Different viruses use different nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) as the genetic
material. Some, like herpes, use DNA. Some, like the flu, use RNA. And some
(like HIV) use both, alternating back and forth. This third type of virus is
called a retrovirus. Retroviruses use the enzyme reverse-transcriptase to
make RNA from DNA (refer to Figure 18-1). 
Different viruses have different mutation rates, and viruses that use RNA
(either all or some of the time) can have very high mutation rates. HIV is one
such virus. Its reverse transcriptase makes a lot of mistakes, leading to many
slightly different viral types. 
Some viruses replicate in the host cell and then the progeny go on to find
another cell to infect. But others, including HIV, will also sometimes slip their
DNA into the host chromosome. When the HIV genome is present as DNA, it
can integrate into the host chromosome and hide there. It’s just a string of A,
C, T, and G bases and the immune system can’t find it. Neither can current
antiviral drugs. Hopefully, drugs that can find the virus can be developed. 
HIV researchers know what sequence to target; it’s just a matter of figuring
out how. 
What Is HIV?
HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV attacks and impairs the
cells in your immune system. HIV itself doesn’t kill you; you die of any of 
the infections that your body usually would be able to fight off.
Several HIV viruses exist, and they can be divided into two major groups:
HIV-1 and HIV-2. Both groups of viruses behave in a similar fashion, but the
global HIV epidemic is primarily the result of HIV-1, and HIV-2 is confined
mostly to one region of Africa. 
The reason I say groups or types of viruses rather than species of virus is that
scientists really have no idea what constitutes a viral species. Head to
Chapter 8 for a discussion of what defines a species and why categorizing
viral or bacterial organisms is so difficult.
286
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

Understanding the replication process that HIV uses is key to understanding
why it’s such a hard-to-treat disease. As the preceding section explains, HIV is
a retrovirus; as such, it copies its RNA genome to DNA and then back to RNA.
This replication process is important for two reasons, as explained in the fol-
lowing sections. 
Sneaking around in your chromosome
HIV does this really sneaky thing: When it copies its RNA genome into DNA, 
it integrates that DNA into the host chromosome (your chromosome). Now
looking like just a few more nucleotides in the genome, it can hide there. 
Your immune system can’t find it as long as it’s dormant and not doing any-
thing. This phenomenon is also a big problem for HIV treatments that might
be able to target the viruses — if it could find them.
Attacking T cells
HIV targets cells of the immune system. Most important, it targets the T cells —
white blood cells that fight infections either directly or indirectly. The type 
of T cell that is most susceptible to HIV infection is called the helper T cell.
Helper T cells don’t attack infection themselves, but they produce compounds
that are involved in mediating the response of other T cells to the infection.
To do its dirty work, the virus looks around for something it can attach to,
called a receptor. It finds the CD4 molecule on the T cell’s surface and
attaches to that.
Although the virus uses the CD4 molecule as a receptor, the molecule actu-
ally has some other purpose. Just as viruses hijack cells for their own pur-
poses, HIV hijacks the CD4 molecule and uses it as an attachment point.
After attaching to the CD4 receptor, HIV attaches to a second receptor, called
a co-receptor. HIV can use several co-receptors, but two are especially impor-
tant in understanding the disease’s progression:
 CCR5: This receptor is important in the early stages of infection. The
form of HIV that attaches to the CCR5 receptor is called R5 HIV.
 CXCR4: This receptor is important later in the progression of the disease.
The form of HIV that attaches to the CXCR4 receptor is called X4 HIV.
287
Chapter 18: HIV: The Origin and Evolution of a Virus

Mutating like crazy
HIV is prone to mutations. Reverse transcriptase, which enables the virus to
copy RNA back into DNA, is very error prone. This means that HIV has a high
mutation rate, but because the virus is small, it can survive with such a 
high mutation rate. 
The shorter the genome, the greater the probability that a sloppy copying
process will be able to generate a copy without too many errors. (If you’re a
bad typist, you’re more likely to correctly spell a short word than a long one,
just because you have more chances to get something wrong in a long word.) 
And even though most mutations are deleterious, so many HIV particles exist
that an advantageous mutation (one that makes the virus resistant to a drug,
for example) is likely to occur by chance. 
The History of the HIV Epidemic
Despite what some preachers said at the time, AIDS didn’t drop out of the sky
to plague the sinful or humble the proud. Instead, it was caused by a virus
that simply did what viruses do. (Refer to the preceding section if you’re
unfamiliar with the general behavior of viruses.)
One thing that’s so interesting about HIV viruses is that they’re very similar
to viruses that infect primates. Until this simian virus infected some unlucky
person, AIDS didn’t exist in the human population. Once in the human 
population, the previously simian virus was exposed to a new selective 
environment — namely us. 
We don’t know how often such cross-species transfers happen, but we do
know (unfortunately) that sometimes the introduced virus heads down an
evolutionary path that results in viruses that eat the new host for breakfast.
In the case of AIDS, the primate virus can sometimes get a toehold in a
human, and then selection sorts through all the various viral mutants, favor-
ing those that are even better at infecting humans. Before such an event hap-
pened, AIDS wasn’t a human epidemic; now it is.
Another interesting thing is that the primate-to-human transmission of the
virus may have happened a whole lot earlier than people tend to think, given
that most people think of AIDS and HIV as being “born” in the last decades of
the 20th century. One of the reasons we noticed AIDS later may have been
that people move around more nowadays. In the old days, you had to walk 
to the next village to spread whatever germs you might be carrying, and if
people occasionally fell sick here and there due to an odd illness, not many
288
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

people beyond their doctors or families knew about it. But today, with air-
planes that can move people and viruses long distances in little time, a dis-
ease can get all the way around the world in a day, and many more people
can be exposed in a very short period of time.
Where it came from
Many species of primates harbor viruses that are closely related to HIV. These
viruses, called SIV for simian immunodeficiency virus, occur in 26 African pri-
mate species. Both major groups of HIV — HIV-1 and HIV-2 — arose when the
simian virus transferred from primates to humans. Scientists have been able to
pinpoint which primate-to-human transfers resulted in both HIV-1 and HIV-2:
 HIV-1 jumped to humans from chimpanzees, which harbor SIVcpz. In
at least three different events, SIVcpz jumped to humans, resulting in 
the three major groups of HIV-1. Each group represents an independent
origin for the virus.
 HIV-2 jumped to humans from sooty mangabeys, which harbor SIVsm.
At least half a dozen independent origins of HIV-2 from sooty mangabeys
exist.
The naming conventions of the simian viruses indicate the species of primate
that harbors the particular virus: SIVcpz stands for the chimpanzee simian
virus, SIMsm for the sooty-mangabey simian virus, and so on. If your eyes
tend to glaze over when you see what appears to be a random string of
uppercase and lowercase letters, you may not have figured this convention
out already.
When a virus goes from one species to another
Sometimes, a virus in one species transfers to another species. In the case of
HIV, a simian virus transferred to a human host, where it mutated into HIV.
The phenomenon is fascinating and terrifying. People’s fears about the bird
flu — that after it’s in a human host, it could mutate into a human version
that’s transmittable from human to human — have in essence already been
realized with HIV viruses.
When people had no idea where HIV came from, they assumed a single origin.
But when scientists started sequencing a bunch of simian immunodeficiency
viruses, they realized that HIV (both 1 and 2) had leaped from primates 
to humans multiple times. Although scientists don’t understand all that’s
involved in such a transfer, you shouldn’t be too surprised. Given that
humans are not all that different from primates (refer to Chapter 16), if we’re
going to catch a virus, getting it from other species of primates is as good a
place as any.
289
Chapter 18: HIV: The Origin and Evolution of a Virus

The evidence of primate-to-human transfer
How can scientists be so sure that the human immunodeficiency virus origi-
nated in simian populations? First, they know that humans can catch primate
retroviruses. In at least one case, an animal handler acquired a simian
immunodeficiency virus from a rhesus macaque (SIVmac), and cases of
acquisition of other retroviruses have occurred.
Also, a strong correlation exists in Africa between the distribution of HIV
types and the distribution of primates. The center of HIV-2 infection is the
same part of Africa where sooty mangabeys live. And although HIV-1 has
spread throughout Africa and the world, the origin of that virus appears to be
the region inhabited by the subspecies of chimpanzees that harbors a related
virus. These regions also provide ample opportunity for human-primate con-
tact. Both chimps and sooty mangabeys are hunted for food, and young ones
are occasionally kept as pets.
Other evidence includes
 Gene sequencing: The HIV and SIV viruses have been sequenced and
compared, and the human viruses are remarkably similar to the simian
virus that’s considered to be its parent.
 An HIV phylogenetic tree: In reconstructing the tree (refer to Chapter
9), researchers discovered that instead of the HIV-1 strains appearing 
off to one side on their own little branch (which would indicate a single
origin from one chimpanzee virus), the HIV strains are interspersed with
the SIVcpz strains, indicating that HIV originated from three different
simian strains. 
The same is true for HIV-2. Phylogenetic analysis doesn’t show all the
HIV-2 strains on their own branch of the viral tree, but instead several
branches pop out of the sooty mangabeys viral tree. 
A timeline
HIV is a relatively new human disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) first reported on what we know now was the beginning
of the AIDS epidemic in 1981. It wasn’t until 1983 that the virus causing the
disease, HIV, was identified.
Yet even though the disease was first recognized in 1981, it obviously was
present before that time. Virologists decided to review old medical records
and tissue samples to see whether anybody had suffered from the condition
in the past.
290
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

People in the medical field often keep tissue samples in cases in which diag-
nosis proved to be difficult and an unknown disease seemed to be the culprit.
Using modern molecular techniques in a process that can be thought of as a
hunt for viral fossils, researchers were able to examine these historical sam-
ples for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus.
You may be surprised to know just how early AIDS reared its head:
 The earliest known case of AIDS dates from a British sailor who devel-
oped AIDS-like symptoms in the late 1950s.
 The earliest known case of acquired immune deficiency in the United
States (that is, the earliest date for which molecular evidence exists)
occurred in 1968, involving a teenage male who reported that he’d been
symptomatic for at least two years. Because he had never traveled out-
side the country, he must have caught the virus in the United States
sometime before then.
 A survey of preserved blood samples has revealed antibodies to HIV
dating back to the late 1950s.
 The degree of divergence between HIV and the suggested SIV source
suggests that HIV mutated from SIV between 50 and 100 years ago.
So HIV was around possibly up to a century ago. A little more than 50 years
ago, it presented itself in isolated cases. In the early 1980s, many people
began to fall ill. What scientists don’t know is whether the virus persisted at
low levels until the later outbreak was noticed or whether it had gone extinct
in the United States and then was reintroduced. What they do know is that by
the end of the 1980s, AIDS was terrorizing the world.
The Path and Evolution 
of HIV in the Patient
Every person infected with HIV has his or her own story, and the disease takes
a dramatically different course in different people. Yet when you take all the
sufferers in total, you get a picture — albeit a general one — of what HIV does
when it enters the body.
Basically, right after infection, the levels of HIV in the blood increase rapidly,
but then the body’s immune system kicks in and is successful in reducing the
amount of HIV virus present. Yet over time, the amount of HIV in the blood
291
Chapter 18: HIV: The Origin and Evolution of a Virus

increases as the number of T cells decrease. Eventually, HIV destroys the
immune system, eliminating T cells until almost none are left. At this point,
the patient succumbs to infections that the immune system is no longer able
to battle. 
A key component of understanding the progression of HIV infection is under-
standing how the viral population evolves in the patient. The following sec-
tions explain these different evolutionary stages of HIV in the human body.
During the course of HIV infection the viral population evolves, first 
in response to the host immune system, then in the absence of immune
response. Viral types unlike those in the initial infection arise during the
course of the infection and are associated with later stages of disease 
progression. 
Increasing and growing more divergent
Right after infection, the levels of HIV in the blood increase very rapidly, yet
the immune system is strong enough to fight back. As it suppresses the initial
outbreak, the infected person’s immune system also exerts a powerful selec-
tive force on the HIV virus. 
The infected person’s immune system recognizes HIV as a foreign invader
and attacks it. But HIV has a high mutation rate, and not all of the individual
viruses produced in the infection are exactly same, so some are able to avoid
being targeted. So now the immune system has to go after these slightly dif-
ferent viruses and, in doing so, selects for viruses that are even more differ-
ent. This cycle—in which the attacks launched by the immune system attacks
select for slightly different viruses—goes on, back and forth for quite some
time. The immune system puts up a valiant fight, often for years. During this
period the HIV population evolves in two ways. 
The viral population becomes progressively 
different from the original strain
The viral population evolves to be progressively more different from the orig-
inal infecting strain. Initially, the person’s immune system is pretty good at
battling the virus. So although HIV increases immediately after infection, it
drops back down when the immune system fights back. 
But as the disease progresses, the HIV population in the person evolves.
Mutant virus progeny that are less susceptible to the immune system
increase in frequency. Over time, the virus population becomes more and
more different from the original infecting particles. The viral population is
evolving in response to the immune system — the immune system is fighting
hard and only new viral mutants can avoid it.
292
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

The virus population grows increasingly diverse
The virus population as a whole becomes increasingly diverse — that is, there
are progressively more different HIV types within the patient as the disease
advances. The most fit HIV viruses will be the ones that are different from
those that the immune system has responded to, but there are many ways 
to be different so viral diversity goes up.
Reaching a plateau
HIV destroys one of the key components of the immune system, a type of 
T cell. When enough of these cells have been destroyed, the immune system
can no longer contain the virus, and the HIV population starts to evolve in a
new way.
As T cells are destroyed, the crippled immune system no longer acts as an
agent of selection on the HIV viruses. At this point, selection no longer favors
viruses simply because they are different — they don’t have to escape the
immune system, which is worn out and can fight no more. The difference
from the original strain reaches a plateau. Mutations still occur during HIV
replication, but now if a particular strain is especially good at growing in the
host, there’s no immune system to knock it back down.
Destroying T-cells in a different way
HIV disease progression can vary dramatically from patient to patient, and
evolution does not occur along exactly the same trajectory in each case. But
one major event which is observed repeatedly is the evolution of viruses
later in infection that attack the immune system in a different way. These
viral variants (called X4 variants) are able to attach to a different part of the
surface of immune cells (a cellular feature called the CXCR4 receptor ) and
destroy the T cells in a different way. 
The X4 type begins to increase in frequency around the time that the overall
genetic diversity of the viral population is decreasing, and the peak of the X4
virus type is associated with period proceeding transition to full blown AIDS
symptoms.
Researchers don’t completely understand how theses X4 viruses influence
the disease or whether the X4 variants evolve in every patient. What they do
know is that the X4 variants cause T cell death differently from the original
variants.

Other Interesting Facts about HIV
HIV is as interesting as it is scary. Consider this to be the section of other
cool things about the human immunodeficiency virus — if you can use the
word cool when talking about a deadly pathogen. If you can’t, consider this 
to be the section of noteworthy-but-not-vitally-important information for 
serious-minded readers.
Some people may be resistant
During the initial infection, the virus binds to a CCR5 co-receptor (refer to
“Attacking T cells,” earlier in this chapter). As it turns out, not everyone has
that same molecule. Some people have a mutation that makes a slightly dif-
ferent CCR5 molecule. People who have one mutated copy of the CCR5 locus
show delayed progression toward full-blown AIDS. And people who have two
mutated copies appear to be resistant to HIV infection.
Interestingly, this mutation is found primarily in Europe, and its prevalence is
correlated with the degree to which a particular location experienced plagues
in the past. It’s been hypothesized that this mutation may have made people
more resistant to certain other disease organisms and that as a result the
mutation increased in frequency in places that once experienced plague. Just
by coincidence, the same mutation confers resistance to HIV infection.
Scientists aren’t sure that the bubonic plague was caused by black-plague
bacteria. Instead, it may have been caused by a viral hemorrhagic fever. 
HIV evolves in a new host
Evolution within the patient selects for a more divergent virus, and that viral
diversity increases through time in the individual (refer to the earlier section
“HIV Evolution within the Patient”). When you compare the virus present
during the initial period of infection across different people, however, you
find less divergence among people than you see over time within one person.
Think about this for a minute: If the virus is diverging in one person, and that
person infects a second person, you’d expect that the second person would
start out with a more divergent population of the initially infecting virus. But
that’s not the case. 
Here’s why: After infection, strong selection for the ancestral viral type occurs,
so the virus evolves back toward this condition. This selection may happen
for at least a couple of reasons:
294
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

 The viral forms present in a person late in the infection may not be well
suited to living in the environment present in a newly infected person.
Hence, selection favors going back to an initial viral form.
 Although the diverse viral population may be perfectly capable of sur-
viving in a newly infected host, this population may be outcompeted 
by viral variants that have mutations resurrecting the ancestral type.
HIV has a high recombination rate
One way that the HIV population generates all that diversity is via a huge
amount of recombination among viruses. In recombination, a DNA or RNA
sequence (whichever the critter uses for genomic information) is produced
that’s a combination of two original sequences. For most organisms, recombi-
nation is generally believed to happen far less frequently than mutation. But
in HIV, the recombination rate may approach the rate of mutation.
Scientists know about the recombination rate by making and analyzing phylo-
genetic trees for a group of viruses with different genes. For organisms with
low rates of recombination, phylogenies constructed from different genes
should have trees that match. The extent to which they don’t match allows
scientists to determine the frequency of recombination. 
When you take a bunch of HIV viruses, determine the sequence of several
genes, and then make phylogenetic trees from these different genes, the
resulting trees don’t always match. This shows that, rather than being a rare
event, recombination is a major source of the diversity in the HIV population
within a patient.
Using Evolution to Fight HIV
The major problem we face in coming up with a vaccine for HIV is that the
virus mutates so rapidly that it ends up being different enough from the
strain used to make the vaccine that the vaccine doesn’t confer immunity.
Scientists can use the techniques of phylogenetic analysis to study the evolu-
tion of HIV and identity which parts of the HIV virus are more or less likely to
change, and it might, and I stress might, be possible to use this information in
our hunt for an effective vaccine.
Morgane Rolland, David Nickle, and James Mullins at the University of
Washington have been working on just this problem: how to design a vaccine
that essentially sneaks up on the virus when it’s not looking. They hypothe-
size that the trick might be to eliminate all the info from the parts of the HIV
295
Chapter 18: HIV: The Origin and Evolution of a Virus

genome that are mutating most rapidly and focus on the parts that aren’t.
The key is to figure out what parts of the HIV virus have been outwitting the
immune system and then design a vaccine that targets parts of the virus that
can’t evolve. 
By understanding how the virus evolves, we may be able to get a few steps
ahead of it and make a vaccine that’s harder for the virus to evade. This
would be a remarkably cool application of evolutionary biology to a 
real-world problem.

nfluenza. Before the mid-20th century, people gave this disease the
respect it deserved. Now we call it the flu; act fairly cavalier about the
symptoms unless we need a break from work; and poo-poo the vaccine
unless we’re in a high-risk group populated by babies, octogenarians, and
hypochondriacs. Periodically, though, we get reminded that the flu can be
serious business — a fact that epidemiologists and virologists have been
trying to beat into our thick skulls forever — and then we fly into a panic.
Well, here’s news for you, some good, some bad: 
 Many strains of influenza exist, and courtesy of evolution, even more are
on the way. Their rapid rate of evolution makes them a constant prob-
lem, and every so often, an especially nasty strain catches scientists by
surprise. 
 Although some of us may succumb, we aren’t completely helpless.
Scientists have been fighting back, even using the process of evolution
to turn the tables on these pesky viruses. Thanks to techniques for vac-
cine design, scientists are getting closer to being prepared for these new
and improved strains as well.
This chapter has the details on all the bad things the flu can do and all the
reasons by you don’t need to panic — at least not yet. 

The Flu and Your Immune System
Most likely, your immune system has already been introduced to the flu. You
got sick, felt lousy for a while, and eventually got better. Why? Because your
body has an immune system. To understand the rather eventful history of
influenza in the human population, you need to know how the flu virus
infects humans and how the human immune system fights back. Consider it a
play in three acts.
Act 1: The virus attacks and spreads
The influenza virus, which causes the illness commonly referred to as the flu,
is most often transmitted from one person to the next in small droplets drift-
ing through the air — possibly the result of somebody’s sneeze or cough.
One day, you’re unlucky enough to inhale one of these droplets, and a flu-
virus particle attaches to one of your cells. Once inside the cell, the particle
takes over the machinery necessary to make more copies of itself. Then your
cell bursts and releases all these copies, which go looking for more cells to
infect. At this point, you’re sick, and you’ll probably help the virus get to new
cells in other people when you start coughing. End Act 1.
Act 2: The body fights back
You’re sick, but you don’t stay sick. Instead, your body responds to the
invading flu, fights back, and overcomes the infection. How? Keep reading.
Your body has numerous, quite complicated systems for fighting off micro-
scopic foreign invaders such as the flu virus. Combined, these various mech-
anisms make up your immune system. I won’t get into the details here except
to note that your body has two general classes of response:
 Nonspecific responses: Nonspecific responses are reactions, such as
tissue inflammation and fever, that are generally bad for all invading
microbes. When your body senses the presence of invading microbes, it
sometimes turns up the heat in its fight against them. Indeed, having a
fever may make you feel bad, but it makes the invading microbes feel
even worse.
 Specific responses: Specific responses include such things as antibodies,
which are special proteins that seek out and destroy invaders. When
your body becomes aware of the flu, the first thing it notices is that the
flu virus is foreign. It’s not part of you and, as far as your body is con-
cerned, doesn’t belong in you. That’s why as soon as the flu has been
identified as “not self,” your body begins to produce antibodies that
specifically target this strain of flu.
298
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

As your body responds to the invader in both nonspecific and specific ways,
it starts winning the battle against the flu. After a week of two, all the flu par-
ticles in your body have been killed, and you’re on the road to recovery.
Act 3: Building up the guard
Your immune system has a very special property called memory. Although it
takes a little time for your body to produce enough antibodies to beat back
this strain of flu, memory means that after your body has responded once,
it’s immediately ready to respond again. 
That’s great news for you, because the flu strain you just recovered from can
no longer invade your body; now you are immune to it. And since your body’s
antibodies are able to attach to different but similar flu strains, you also have
resistance to those as well.
Which leads to a sequel: 
The return of the flu
The evolution of influenza is strongly affected by the immune system’s
response. The strain of flu from which you recovered was clearly quite good
at being the flu. It managed to get not only from some other person into you,
but quite possibly into a third person as well. In fact, it’s possible that the
strain of the flu you got also spread through your workplace, your kid’s
school, your town, the rest of the country, and even the world. Indeed, flu
strains do this all the time. But after everyone who had a particular strain of
flu gets better, all of them are immune to that strain. Thus, the next time you
get the flu, it will be a genetically different flu strain.
The Three Types of Influenza: A, B, C
Three different strains of flu infect humans. These strains are conveniently
named influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. They all have genomes that
use RNA instead of DNA as the genetic material:
 Influenza A: This flu sweeps through the human population each flu
season. It evolves so fast that strains are sufficiently different to avoid
existing antibodies every year. Influenza A occurs in humans and a vari-
ety of other animals, which makes the evolution of influenza A some-
what more complicated, as well as more interesting for this discussion.
The remainder of this chapter concentrates mostly on influenza A.
299
Chapter 19: Influenza: One Flu, Two Flu, Your Flu, Bird Flu

 Influenza B: Influenza B is just like influenza A, except that influenza B
exists only in humans. Beyond this single difference, you just need to
remember that influenza B evolves similarly to influenza A.
 Influenza C: Because most people are immune to influenza C, this strain
of flu is not characterized by epidemics that periodically sweep through
the human population. Instead, it is primarily a disease of the young,
because it has a chance to reproduce only in children who have not yet
developed an immunity to this generally mild flu. I mention it here in
case you’re curious, but it really isn’t important to the discussion in this
chapter. 
Unlike influenza A and B, influenza C evolves very slowly. We don’t
understand exactly why it evolves so slowly, but as result of this slower
evolution, all influenza C strains are basically the same. About 97 per-
cent of Americans have antibodies to influenza C, which means it’s likely
that at some point in your life, you were infected with it and developed a
resistance to it. Now you are immune to the strain that infected you, and
as a result of the high level of similarity among strains, you are also
immune to all other influenza C viruses.
The Evolution of Influenza A
Influenza A is a very small virus with a genome made of RNA instead of DNA.
Its genome is comprised of eight different RNA segments, and it has only ten
genes. (For comparison, consider that people have over 25,000 genes.)
Influenza A is a remarkably compact organism, and these ten genes enable it
to do everything it needs to do to infect you and reproduce. 
Mechanisms of evolution: Mutation,
recombination, or reassortment
The influenza A virus (and the influenza B and C viruses too, for that matter)
can evolve in three ways:
 Mutations: Influenza is a virus with an RNA genome, and RNA replication
has a high error rate. For this reason, the virus mutates rapidly. That’s
why this year’s flu is different from last year’s flu. The strains may be
similar enough for the immunity you developed to last year’s flu to pro-
tect you (or at least partially protect you) but don’t count on it.
 Reassortment: Because influenza has a genome divided into segments,
new variants can also arise via genetic reassortment, the process
whereby two different viruses infect the same cell, and the progeny have

Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

segments that are a combination of these two strains. (For an explana-
tion of how viruses can reproduce this way, refer to Chapter 12.)
When reassortment involves the segments that code for the H or N pro-
teins that cover the outside of the flu virus, the new strains (or the
strains produced) can be so different from the parent strains that no
host has even partial immunity. As a result, these strains can sweep
rapidly through entire populations.
 Recombination: In recombination, one of the existing influenza genes is
incorrectly replicated and ends up with a new section of RNA spliced
into it. This sequence could come from another influenza strain or even
from a host cell’s RNA. Although such events are almost always likely to
be harmful to the virus, every once in a while a new sequence with for-
eign RNA spliced into just the right part of one of the surface proteins
may make the new flu strain resistant to existing host antibodies.
Genes to know
For the purposes of this discussion, you need to pay attention to only four
genes: three on the outside and one that determines which species a particu-
lar strain can infect.
The three genes on the outside are
 Hemagglutinin (abbreviated H)
 Neuraminidase (abbreviated N)
 Matrix
The fourth is the Nucleoprotein gene (also called Nucleocapsid) and is abbre-
viated NP.
Hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix code for proteins that are on 
the surface of the influenza particle. These surface proteins are important
because when the flu enters your body, these proteins are the ones that your
immune system can potentially see — and guard against. 
The Nucleoprotein gene is important is determining the host-specificity of a
particular flu strain — a fancy way of saying which critters that particular
strain can infect.
The importance of H and N
As noted in the preceding section, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are
abbreviated H and N, respectively. If you’ve been reading about the flu or
hearing about it on TV, you may have heard a particular strain described in
terms of H and N and some numbers — for example, avian influenza H5N1.
301
Chapter 19: Influenza: One Flu, Two Flu, Your Flu, Bird Flu

There are 16 different hemagglutinin proteins and 9 different neuraminidase
proteins, but each individual influenza A virus has only 1 type of each pro-
tein. The numbers in a strain’s name (H5N1, for example) indicate which neu-
rominidase and hemagglutinin proteins that particular strain has.
All the H and N types occur in waterfowl, but only some of them occur in
humans. At this time, two types of influenza A are circulating in the human
population: H3N2 and H1N1. Ideally, avian strain H5N1 — the bird flu you
occasionally hear about in the news — won’t mutate to easily infect humans
and be transmittable between them, and make it three. Right now we can
catch this strain from handling infected birds, but we don’t seem to pass it to
other humans, so it can’t spread in the human population. At least not yet.
NP: The host-specificity gene
From the earlier section as well as the reports in the newspapers these days,
you know that humans aren’t the only ones plagued by the flu. Birds get the
flu, too, specifically waterfowl like ducks and geese. But people and birds
don’t usually get the same strain of the flu because flu strains tend to be
species-specific. A human cell is different from a goose cell, and the flu strains
that replicate in geese don’t usually infect humans. In short, flu strains tend to
be specific to a particular groups of animals. The gene that controls (in large
part) which species of animal a flu strain can best infect is the NP gene.
The H and N types determine how readily your immune system can see the
flu. If a particular strain is an H-N type that your body has seen before, then
you’ve got a jump on it. If it’s one your body hasn’t seen before, then the flu
has the jump on you. The NP gene determines whether the flu can see you,
that is, whether it can reproduce in your body. The worst possible combina-
tion is an NP gene that lets the flu chow down on you wrapped in surface pro-
teins that take your immune system by surprise.
Who gets the flu and from where
There are five major groups of Influenza A strains. In addition to the strains
that infect humans and waterfowl (ducks and geese), there is a group of flu
strains that infects horses, one that infects pigs, and one that infects seagulls
(which, contrary to what you may reasonably assume, are not waterfowl). 
By taking a closer look at the genetic sequences of the NP gene (the one that
determines which species a flu strain can best infect), scientists find that it’s
usually easy to tell the human flu strains from the waterfowl flu strains from
horse flu strains and so on because flu strains are species specific. Seagulls
tend to get seagull flu, horses tend to get horse flu, pigs tend to get pig flu,
and so on. But not always.
302
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

One of the most interesting conclusions that can be drawn from an analysis
of the sequences of Influenza A is that, much as we tend to think of this little
beast as a human virus, its home base appears to be waterfowl. It seems that
every so often, a flu strain jumps from waterfowl to some other susceptible
species where it persists for a while and then goes extinct and/or is replaced
by another strain.  All the seagull, human, pig, and horse influenza A strains
currently in circulation were probably acquired from waterfowl within the
last 100 years. Understanding what causes these events is particularly impor-
tant today, when public health officials and governmental agencies are coping
with the very real possibility of another devastating flu pandemic. 
The evolutionary history and relatedness of different flu strains
The RNA sequence information allows scientists to reconstruct the family
tree of the flu and figure out how the five major groups of the flu are related
to each other. Humans, for example, have influenza strains similar to those in
pigs; in fact, it’s not unheard of for pigs to catch the flu from people, and vice
versa. (The Swine flu scare of 1976 is one example).
In addition to helping scientists formulate hypotheses about the relationship
between the different flu groups, surveying the RNA sequence variation for a
collection of flu strains allows them to measure the amount of variation in the
different groups of the flu. This information can provide information about
underlying evolutionary processes. 
An important finding is that not all groups have the same amount of variation
in the host-specificity protein. A collection of human flu strains has quite a
lot of variation, as do the flu strains that attack horses, pigs, and seagulls. But
the flu strains infecting waterfowl are much more uniform at the protein level.
The waterfowl strains have the greatest diversity of surface proteins — all
the different H and N molecule types — but when it comes to the proteins
important for actually chowing down on ducks and geese, most of the differ-
ent waterfowl flu strains are about the same. There just isn’t very much varia-
tion at the protein level, even though there’s variation at the RNA level.
(Remember that there could be changes at the nucleotide level that don’t
affect what protein is made.)
Scientists know that mutations are common in RNA replication, but when
they look at the host specificity gene of the flu strain that infects waterfowl,
they find that most of the variation is neutral; it doesn’t affect proteins.
Mutations that affect protein structure are certainly always appearing, but in
the waterfowl population, it seems these mutations don’t increase in fre-
quency. We know they happen, but we don’t see them. From this, we can
speculate that the flu strains that are infecting waterfowl have, at least for
now, gotten to be about as good as they can be. 
303
Chapter 19: Influenza: One Flu, Two Flu, Your Flu, Bird Flu

Which strains are evolving faster
Because of differences between neutral and non-neutral sequence variation,
scientists can tell that the flu strains in waterfowl are evolving differently
than the flu strains in the other groups. Although all five groups have varia-
tion at the nucleotide level, the waterfowl group doesn’t have any significant
variation at the protein level. The flu in waterfowl seems to be at an evolu-
tionarily stable point, evidence that selection is acting differently in different
groups of flu. 
Take-home message: The host-specificity protein in waterfowl has evolved to
some optimum level. Think of it as a peak on the adaptive landscape. (If you
don’t know what the adaptive landscape is, refer to Chapter 6.) Mutations
that occur that change the protein are just as rapidly eliminated from the
population, so we don’t see them. What we do see are changes in the RNA
that don’t affect the protein. 
Jumping from one species to another
Because different species tend to be infected with flu viruses specific to their
species, scientists who collect flu strains simply have to know which organ-
ism it came from to make a pretty good prediction about which strain it is.
Take a strain from a horse, for example, and analyze its genetic sequence,
and chances are, it’ll be recognizable as a horse flu. Sometimes, however, sci-
entists find a sick animal, collect the specimen, do the analysis, and find an
unexpected flu strain. 
304
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 
Duck, duck, goose: How waterfowl flu spreads
Interestingly, the waterfowl flu strain doesn’t
usually tend to make waterfowl very sick, and it
doesn’t have to be spread from one duck or
goose to the next. Waterfowl are really good at
making bird droppings (if geese or ducks have
ever taken up residence at your local park, you
know what I’m talking about), and these drop-
pings contain huge amounts of flu virus. The flu
in ducks lives in the gastrointestinal tract, not
the lungs, and those droppings spread the flu
virus through the entire pond where it can easily
infect many other ducks. 
Every once in awhile, some other organism
comes into contact with some of the waterfowl
flu — easy to see how that can happen when
you think of a pond full of influenza infected
droppings. When this happens, the chance
exists for the waterfowl flu to infect a different
kind of animal. Scientists have evidence of sev-
eral different cross-species transfers from
ducks to a variety of mammals. 

When an animal has been infected with a flu strain different from the one
expected, scientists use phylogenetic analysis again, because in making the
tree of the five groups they can spot when a particular strain is out of place. 
If they find that a horse is sick with the flu, for example, they only have to
check the flu sequence to discover whether it’s the strain they’d expect (one
specific to horses) or one they didn’t expect (a strain that horses don’t typi-
cally get). They can also tell in what ways it’s different: that it’s way different
from the horse flu, for example, and just like the bird flu. 
Such sequence analysis tells scientists that sometimes flu from waterfowl can
infect other groups. Its been shown to move to horses and pigs, as well as
other animals not usually associated with the flu, such as whales, seals, and
mink. Now of course we’re finding these flu strains in unlucky people in Asia
as well. 
That waterfowl flu can be transferred to other species is significant because
the waterfowl population contains the highest diversity of surface proteins.
Were a change to occur in a waterfowl flu that would allow it to reproduce in
human cells, for example, it could take our immune system by surprise. The
strain wouldn’t look like any of the other flu strains that your immune system
has responded to before. Although your immune system would respond to
the infection, it’d be starting from scratch. If the flu strain is particularly viru-
lent, you might not have that much time. 
Bottom line: The waterfowl flu population is a source of cross species infec-
tion, and it’s implicated as a source of new variants that have infected the
human population in the past, a process we may be seeing the early stages of
with the H5N1 avian flu.
Learning from the Past: Flu Pandemics
The term pandemic refers to an epidemic of an infectious disease that occurs
over a large area, such as a continent or even the entire world. The black
plague that swept from Asia through Europe in the mid-1300s is a good exam-
ple of a pandemic. Flu pandemics can occur when a flu strain that appears in
the human population is so different from the circulating strains that the
worldwide population is completely susceptible. As a result, this new flu is
able to sweep rapidly through the entire world. Often, influenza pandemics
are given names related to the regions where the virus first appeared.
In an average year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates
that influenza kills more than 20,000 Americans. The global total is harder to
estimate accurately, but the World Health Organization places it at some-
where between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths per year. Pandemic years see a
much, much higher death rate — sometimes into the millions.
305
Chapter 19: Influenza: One Flu, Two Flu, Your Flu, Bird Flu

Scientists have information on flu pandemics dating from the pandemic of
1889 to the more recent 1977 pandemic. By studying the genome sequences
of the more recent strains and the antibodies of the victims in the more dis-
tant strains, researchers have been able to piece together the origin of these
pandemic strains. The following sections take you on a little stroll through
the pandemic flus of the last hundred years.
Pandemics of 1889 and 1900
Because sequence information isn’t available, scientists have to rely on
seroarchaeology — the search for antibodies in preserved tissue samples —
for these pandemics. The antibodies in these tissue samples can’t tell
researchers about all the genes in the flu strains responsible for the pan-
demics, but they can identify the H and N proteins, because these proteins
are the external parts of the flu virus that the body’s immune system pro-
duces antibodies against. So we know that the 1889 and 1900 pandemics were
caused by an H2N2 and an H3N8 strain, respectively.
The Spanish flu (1918)
This influenza pandemic strain is the first one for which researchers have
complete sequence information. Sequence analysis of the genes from this
strain suggests that it was the result of an H1N1 avian influenza virus entering
the human population. This finding is important, particularly in light of
recent concerns about the possibility that the rare but often fatal H5N1 avian
flu will change to a form that can be easily spread between humans. The
Spanish flu is an example of a flu strain from one host (waterfowl) infecting a
new host (us). 
The Asian flu (1957)
The Asian flu strain (H2N2) contained 5 gene segments from the circulating
1918 strain and 3 new ones — the different versions of the H and N genes, as
well as a gene involved in RNA replication. These changes were almost cer-
tainly the result of a reassortment event with an avian strain of influenza A,
and the new strain replaced the H1N1 strain from which it was derived. 
The Asian flu pandemic was the result of a reassortment event between the
original H1N1 strain and an avian strain that contributed the 3 new genes.
These two strains ended up in the same host, the various segments got
mixed up during the flu’s replication, and out popped something new. 
306
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

The Hong Kong flu (1968)
When the Asian flu strain (H2N2; see the preceding section) went through a
second reassortment with a different avian influenza strain, the H3N2 strain
was born. This strain had the same N gene but had acquired 2 new genes,
including a new H gene. 
This is another example of a reassortment event between a human strain and
an avian flu strain. This H3N2 strain replaced the H2N2 strain in the human
population. 
The Russian flu (1977)
In 1977, the H1N1 flu last seen in humans in 1950 reappeared. Because most
people older than about 20 had been exposed to H1N1 flu, the resulting epi-
demic was not severe enough to be labeled a true pandemic, but it was cer-
tainly a significant event. 
Scientists don’t know exactly where this strain came from, but it has been
suggested that it escaped from a laboratory somewhere. Support for this
hypothesis is not just the strain’s sudden reappearance, surprising though
that is. More convincing is that the 1977 H1N1 was almost identical to the
1950 H1N1 — in all those years, this strain hadn’t been evolving. 
307
Chapter 19: Influenza: One Flu, Two Flu, Your Flu, Bird Flu
The last great pandemic
The 1918 Spanish-flu pandemic killed more
people than any other disease outbreak in
human history. It is estimated that between 20
million and 40 million people died of the flu
during the 1918–1919 flu season. Furthermore,
although influenza is usually most fatal among
the very young and the very old, the 1918 flu had
very high mortality across all ages.
It was not until very recently that scientists
learned the complete genome sequence of the
1918 flu. No samples suitable for genome
sequencing were known before that. However,
in 2005, viral nucleic acids were isolated from
the bodies of victims who died in Alaska during
the epidemic. Their bodies had been buried in
the Alaskan permafrost and had remained
frozen until the present. These frozen samples
were sufficiently preserved that scientists could
isolate the viral genetic material (RNA) from
them.
Before the rediscovery of the 1918 flu, scientists
thought that the 1918 pandemic originated in a
fashion similar to the 1957 and 1968 pandemics —
that is, via the acquisition of several new genome
segments from a reassortment event with an
avian strain. Scientists now know, however, that
all eight segments of the 1918 strain are very
similar to avian strains, and the current hypoth-
esis is that the 1918 pandemic was the result of
an avian strain entering the human population.

Remember that this year’s flu isn’t quite the same as last year’s flu, and next
year’s flu won’t be the same as the flu that follows it. The point? Twenty-
seven years without change is hard to explain — hence the suggestion that
maybe those 27 years were spent in a test tube in a freezer! 
Since this event in 1977, two influenza A lineages have been circulating simul-
taneously in the human population: H3N2 and H1N1. 
Fighting Back: The Art and Science 
of Making Flu Vaccines
Vaccines work because of immune-system memory, which essentially pre-
pares your immune system to defend you immediately when it senses that a
previous invader — or one like it — has returned for a repeat performance.
(Refer to “Act 3: Building up the guard,” earlier in this chapter, for details.) 
By combining their knowledge of how immune-system memory works and
how flu strains evolve, scientists were able to come up with a strategy for
vaccination.
A vaccine is a substance introduced into your body to trick it into bringing
forth an immune response. This response creates antibodies, which can then
protect you from the microorganism the vaccine is designed to imitate.
Typically, the vaccine is developed in some way from the organism from
which immunity is desired. The vaccine can be made from the whole organ-
ism or from some of the external parts, because those are the parts that your
immune system recognizes. Moreover, vaccines can consist of live or dead
organisms.
When you get vaccinated against the flu, you’re actually receiving three dif-
ferent vaccines at the same time. That’s because three major lineages of the
flu are currently in circulation in the human population: two different types of
influenza A and one influenza B strain. Because these three kinds of viruses
are different enough that no single vaccine can protect against all of them, one
strain from each of the three viral groups is chosen for vaccine production.
Dead vaccines
Initially, a dead vaccine appears to be the better vaccination option, if you
consider that the vaccine consists of disease agents that you’re going to be
introducing into your body. But producing a dead flu-virus vaccine has a
major disadvantage: You need to make a lot more of it than you do of a vac-
cine based on a living virus.
308
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

The problem doesn’t sound so critical; surely manufacturers can just make
more. But in fact, the production of the annual flu virus is a major undertak-
ing. The viruses created for vaccine production are grown in chicken eggs,
where the flu happily multiplies. But think about all the eggs you need to
grow enough flu vaccine for all the people who need to be inoculated. In the
United States alone, you need more than one quarter of a billion eggs. In addi-
tion to requiring a lot of eggs, this process takes a lot of time. It’s approxi-
mately half a year between the time when flu-vaccine production starts and
when the first doses are delivered for distribution.
Further complicating this long period of production is the fact that the deci-
sion about which three influenza strains should be used to make the vaccine
has to be made months before the beginning of the flu season. Because the
flu is always evolving, the earlier the decision is made, the less likely it is to
be correct. Thus, as you may have noticed, flu shots work better in some
years than in others.
Cell-based flu vaccines are newest thing in the manufacturing of flu vaccines.
Rather than incubate the virus in eggs, the cell-based techniques grow vac-
cines in laboratory cell cultures. One of the main advantages of this tech-
nique is that, by not being dependent on a huge supply of eggs, the makers
don’t have the same quantity limitations or contamination challenges.  
Live vaccines
The advantage of using a live flu virus in a vaccine is that a little goes a long
way. The virus replicates in a person’s body; the immune system ramps up to
defeat the infection; and the result is immunity against further infection.
Unfortunately, one of the risks is that the live virus is going to reproduce in
your body before your immune system knocks it out. That situation compli-
cates the vaccine-production process, because vaccine designers have to
create a strain of the virus that won’t make you sick but is still similar enough
to the more virulent virus to kick your immune system into action.
Using evolution to create less harmful viruses for vaccines
The flu’s ability to exchange genome segments with other influenza viruses
has been nothing but trouble for humans. But scientists have turned the
tables, using this mechanism to fight back. They’ve discovered a clever way
to create new virus strains that are disguised on the outside with all the bits
of the virus humans want to be immune to, but filled on the inside with a col-
lection of different alleles (slightly different forms of the flu genes) that aren’t
that good at making people sick. Voilà! This “cream-filled” virus reproduces in
the body well enough to cause the immune system to attack it, but not so
well that the person actually gets ill.
309
Chapter 19: Influenza: One Flu, Two Flu, Your Flu, Bird Flu

The live-vaccine virus will begin evolving to attack you more efficiently as
soon as it starts reproducing in your body. The plan, of course, is that long
before enough time has gone by for the virus to develop greater efficiency at
reproducing in you, your immune system will have had a chance to defeat it.
That’s the plan, anyway.
Using evolution to keep vaccines safe
The fly in the live-virus vaccine ointment is evolution, of course. Even though
the live virus used for vaccine production has been constructed so that it’s
weak and can’t reproduce rapidly in the human body, it may not stay that
way. As the weakened live virus reproduces, it will produce offspring with
random mutations, some of which may improve their ability to live in a
person. These progeny in turn will produce offspring, and some of them may
be even better at beating the body’s defenses. If enough time goes by, a rea-
sonably harmless virus designed for use as a vaccine could end up as one
that’s much better at eating human cells for lunch.
So can scientists do anything to reduce the chance that evolving viruses will
get the best of us? Short answer: Yes, by using the evolutionary process to
our advantage.
The influenza that makes you sick is happiest at your normal body tempera-
ture. That shouldn’t be too surprising, because it lives in the human body,
and selection has had a lot of time to tune the flu for 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
That’s one of the reasons your body turns up the heat when you get sick: It’s
trying to burn the virus out.
Scientists have used this bit of knowledge to their (and your) advantage:
They decided to turn down the heat in the laboratory. By growing the flu in
colder temperatures in the laboratory, they evolved a flu strain that repro-
duces well at lower temperatures. These new, cold-adapted flu strains aren’t
very good at growing at human body temperature.
Why did scientists want this cold-adapted flu strain? Some very clever vac-
cine designers realized that it’s colder in your nose than it is in your lungs.
Your lungs are deep inside your toasty-warm body, but your nose is right 
up there on the edge, breathing air that’s generally below 98.6 degrees —
especially during the flu season. 
By creating a vaccine virus that can reproduce at temperatures slightly below
your body temperature but not very well at your body temperature, the
designers developed a very nifty live vaccine indeed. You can spritz a little
bit of it in your nose, and although it will reproduce and stimulate your
immune system to respond, it can’t get from your nose into your lower respi-
ratory system, where it’s just too hot. (That’s why when you get the live flu
virus, the nurse spritzes it into your nose.)
310
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

The power of evolution is such that, given enough time, even this virus can
get out of your nose. With each round of replication, variants that are a little
bit better at growing in high-temperature cells may be produced by mutation.
For this reason, people with weakened immune systems, including very
young children and elderly individuals, should not get the live-virus vaccine.
Predicting the future to make 
next year’s vaccine
It’s a shame that each year, designers have to redesign the flu vaccine to
account for recent flu evolution. It’s even more of a shame that getting the
vaccine right is so hard. The health officials who make these predictions use
a variety of information concerning past patterns of flu outbreaks, as well as
which strains are sweeping through different parts of the world. Given the
rapid evolution and incredible variation of the flu population at any given
time, it’s amazing that vaccine designers do as good a job as they do.
Understanding the details of flu evolution can help scientists predict what flu
strain may be coming next. We don’t know what’s going to happen next year
(that flu isn’t here yet), but we do know what has happened in the past (sam-
ples of those flu viruses are in the freezer, and their genetic sequences are
known). Scientists can use this information about past years’ flu strains to
reconstruct the history of flu evolution. Phylogenetic analysis lets them make
a family tree for the past years flu strains (refer to Chapter 9 for information
on how to construct these trees). This tree is scientists’ and virologists’ 
best estimate of what begat what in the never ending progression of new 
flu strains.
Robin Bush, Walter Fitch, and colleagues used the sequence of the H gene to
create such a tree for the  H3N2 group of influenza A currently infecting
humans. They used data from 1984 through 1996, and they were able to iden-
tify which flu lineages in each year gave rise to the flu strains that made
people sick the next year.
They then set out to figure out what was it about those strains that predis-
posed them to being the ancestors of the next big wave of infection. There
are lots of little branches of the flu family tree around at any one time — what
we want to know is from which of those little branches will the strain that’s
going to sweep through your school district arise. We want to make a vaccine
against that particular sort of flu strain. The trick is figuring out which strain
it is.
311
Chapter 19: Influenza: One Flu, Two Flu, Your Flu, Bird Flu

By figuring our how the flu is evolving in response to our immune system, we
learn clues that might help us predict what next years will look like and fine
tune vaccine design in advance. 
Making and testing predictions
With 12 years of data in this study, Bush and the others had 11 separate pairs
of data sets to test different predictions. First, they looked really hard at the
flu RNA sequences for 1985 and asked what they could measure about the
1985 flu strains that could be used to predict the major 1986 flu strain. They
then went back to the 1986 records to check to see whether their predictions
were right. Then they did the same thing ten more times to test their ideas
further. The following section explains what they discovered.
Anticipating next year’s flu: The clues
Possible factors indicating that a particular flu strain is likely to give rise to
next year’s outbreak include the changeability of a particular strain (maybe
the strain that changes the most is the one that spawns the following year’s
flu) and the changeability at a particular region of the virus (maybe a virus
that changes in a particular way is the culprit responsible for next year’s flu).
What Bush and colleagues discovered is that the first one wasn’t the key, but
the second one was: 
The degree of general change in a particular strain. 
Maybe the best candidate is the flu strain that’s changing the most overall.
Because this strain is changing at a faster rate, maybe it will be the one that
gets around your immunity to last year’s flu. 
Sounds good, but this predictor didn’t turn out to be an especially accurate
one. Having lots of random mutations is no guarantee that those mutations
result in genes that are better at fooling our immune system. 
The degree of change at particular regions. 
Maybe the flu strain most likely to cause next winter’s problems is the strain
that’s changing in some particular way — changing the most at just the
regions where the H protein is interacting with the human immune system,
for example. This strain would be more likely to catch your immune system
napping! 
Turns out we don’t know the exact details about which parts of the flu are
the most important in interacting with our immune system. But by studying
the flu’s evolution we can find out! By looking at the flu stains that had been
successful in the past the researches were able to identify specific sites in the
H gene where changes were associated with this success. 
312
Part IV: Evolution and Your World 

Bush and coworkers discovered that the more mutations that occurred in a
particular isolate at just these key locations, the more likely that isolate was
to spawn the next year’s flu. These are the flu strains that seem to be rolling
with the punches of the human immune system, and they’re ones we need to
be prepared for in the future. 
Making a more universal 
influenza A vaccine
Because the H and N proteins that cover the surface of the flu are so variable,
designers have to reassess which particular strains they should use as
models for each year’s vaccine (refer to the preceding section). It’s a shame
that the surface of the flu is so variable from one viral strain to the next;
things would be a lot more convenient if they were all the same. 
Fortunately, one part of the surface of influenza A is very uniform across
many isolates: the Matrix, or M, protein. When your immune system finds the
flu in your body, it doesn’t seem to pay much attention to the M protein, as H
and N proteins are much more obvious targets. But that protein is there, and
it’s possible to make your immune system see it, too.
Walter Fiers and colleagues set out to do just that. They manufactured virus-
sized particles covered with the M protein. Once Fiers and company had the
little M-protein-covered particles, they tested them on mice to see whether
they could stimulate an immune response that would protect the mice from
influenza A. They found that even though the mice still got sick, they got
much less sick than the mice that had not been vaccinated with these 
particles.
The fact that it is possible to make the immune system respond to the M pro-
tein raises a question: How would evolution of the influenza A M protein be
affected by the presence of many such vaccinated individuals? The M protein
is very uniform among different influenza A strains right now. If many people
had antibodies that attached to the M protein, however, that might select for
increased variation in the M protein. All the influenza A viruses make their M
proteins in about the same way, but that doesn’t mean they have to. Perhaps
the viruses can make the M protein in many ways.
Walter Gerhard and colleagues set up an experiment to see how influenza A
viruses evolved in the presence of antibodies that targeted the M protein.
They took mice with weakened immune systems and gave them antibodies
against the M protein. They infected the mice with an influenza A strain, and
after several weeks, they examined the descendents of the original viruses to
look for changes in the M protein.

Chapter 19: Influenza: One Flu, Two Flu, Your Flu, Bird Flu

Because these mice had weakened systems, they were not able to eliminate
the flu virus rapidly. Because the flu virus was replicating in the mice,
random mutations were occurring, and it turned out that some of these muta-
tions did result in changes in the M protein. The scientists found only two
new variants of the M protein, however, rather than the huge number of vari-
ants that would occur in the H protein in the same sort of experiment.
These experiments are encouraging, because the results suggest that the
influenza particle may have only a limited number of ways to make a func-
tional M protein. With any luck, it might be possible to vaccinate against all
influenza A viruses at the same time using a vaccine based on M protein.
This type of experiment shows the potential of incorporating evolutionary
information in drug design. By trying to target a part of the flu that seems
more evolutionarily constrained, it may be possible to create a more univer-
sal vaccine for use in the event of a dangerous outbreak. In the case of an
extremely pathogenic flu, a vaccine that offered only partial protection would
be much better than no protection at all. A vaccine like this could provide
one line of defense against the threat of the H5N1 avian influenza. 
In fact, British and American researchers have recently tested such a vaccine
(one based on the M protein), and the results are very encouraging. They
indicate that the vaccine could provide universal protection against the
Influenza A virus.

C’
mon. You can’t possibly expect to get through a
book on evolution without at least a little informa-
tion on fossils. So this part has a list of ten of my own per-

particularly fond of. 
And let’s be honest; you were probably also expecting a
little bit of information about what the evolution naysay-
ers have to say (beyond “nay”), as well as some discus-
sion on what intelligent design is all about. As hesitant as I
am to include non-science-parading-as-science in this
book, I have included a list of ten arguments you’ll hear
against evolution. And then I explain why those arguments
don’t hold water.

In This Chapter

You can’t talk about evolutionary biology without talking about fossils.
They’re the only physical evidence of plant, animal, and microbial forms
that existed long before the first primordial human.
In this chapter, I offer ten fossil finds. I chose these fossils because they
reveal information not only about specific organisms (such as miniature
mammoths), but also about evolution and the world. I didn’t organize this
chapter in any particular order, but really, how can you begin a discussion of
fossils and not begin with dinosaurs? You can’t. So I start there.
Dinosaurs
Since the early 1800s, when the first dinosaur fossil was discovered (and 
recognized for what it was), people’s imaginations have been fired by
dinosaurs — not only because of their size (they included some of the 
largest animals the world has known), but also because they seem so unlike
animals today. 
What does the fossil record say about these beasts? Quite a bit, actually, but
not nearly as much as you’d think, despite the attributes given to them by
movie directors and novelists:
 They lived from approximately 230 million to 65 million years ago — a
period long enough for them to see some species go extinct and other
species arise.
 They were not lizards, even though the word dinosaur comes from the
Greek, meaning “terrible lizard” and they have a common ancestor with
lizards. The skeletal differences between lizards and dinosaurs are pro-
nounced enough that dinosaurs get their own branch of the tree of life.

Dinosaurs’ legs, for example, were directly under the body rather than
off to the side, as is the case with lizards and crocodilians.
 They didn’t live at the same time as humans. Modern humans have been
here for only a few hundred thousand years, and the dinosaurs went
extinct (mostly) 65 million years ago.
 No one can claim to know what color dinosaurs were (the fossil record
doesn’t give information about color), though it’s reasonable to assume
that, like every other group of animals, they came in a variety of colors.
 The largest dinosaurs may have weighed 100 tons or more. Why the
uncertainty? Many dinosaur fossils are incomplete. It’s reasonably
straightforward to come up with a good estimate of an animal’s weight
based just on its skeleton — if you have a complete skeleton. The largest
dinosaur species for which scientists have found all the various bits is
Brachiosaurus, which weighed in at about 30 to 40 tons, but bones from
much larger species have been found. Unfortunately, without all the
bones, paleontologists can’t be sure exactly what those dinosaurs
looked like.
 Some species had social behavior. Fossilized tracks indicate that large
groups of dinosaurs traveled together. Nesting areas where several
dinosaurs made nests together have also been found. Evidence even
exists that baby dinosaurs remained in the nest and were cared for by
the parents (because fossils of young but not newly hatched dinosaurs
have been found in nests).
 No one knows for sure what caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. One
theory is that a large meteor smashed into the Earth, raising a cloud of
dust big enough to alter sunlight and weather around the globe. As it
turns out, scientists have found evidence that a large meteor struck the
Earth around the time when the dinosaurs went extinct. The geological
boundary corresponding to the time when the dinosaurs disappeared
contains a layer of iridium — an element that is rare on Earth’s surface
but plentiful in some meteors; it would have settled on the Earth as dust
from the sky after a meteor impact.
 One group of dinosaurs is still around today. You know this group as
birds. The bird lineage has its origin within the dinosaur branch of the
tree of life — an initially controversial idea that’s now widely accepted.
The first “scientific” discovery of dinosaur fossils occurred in the early 1800s,
but it’s surmised that ancient peoples (such as the Romans and Chinese) dis-
covered dinosaur fossils earlier. Those fossils could be the source of myths
about dragons and other fantastical beasts that crop up in lore and literature
from ancient times.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Archaeopteryx
Archaeopteryx (see Figure 20-1) is an example of what is often referred to as
a missing link. Except of course that it isn’t missing anymore because we
found some! Archaeopteryx is a species of bird-like dinosaur that has many of
the characteristics of modern birds — feathers, wings, flying — stuff like that.
But it also has characteristics typical of the dinosaur lineage from which it
arose: most obviously its toothy grin! 
Archaeopteryx was discovered only a couple of years after Darwin published
his book On the Origin of Species. As he said in his 4th edition:
Until quite recently these authors might have maintained, and some have
maintained, that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence
during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of Professor
Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper
greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx,
with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and
with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the
oolitic slates of Solenhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more
forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of
the world.

Chapter 20: Ten Fascinating Fossil Finds

As you can imagine, this discovery caused quite a stir for such a small crea-
ture. Archaeopteryx was about a foot and a half from nose to tail, hardly what
we think about when we think about dinosaurs, but — ignoring the distrac-
tion of wings and feathers for a minute — many of its structures are clearly
related to the dinosaurs. So it turns out the dinosaur branch of the family
tree did not entirely die out. One small branch, the birds, remains with us
still. 
That birds might be a surviving lineage of the dinosaur branch of the tree of
life was originally proposed by one of Darwin’s contemporaries, Thomas
Huxley, but the idea never really caught on. It wasn’t until the 1970s and the
developments of phylogenetic analysis that the question was revisited and
found to have overwhelming support. 
Wrangle Island Mammoths
Woolly mammoths lived at the same time as early humans but went extinct
about 10,000 years ago. At least scientists thought so until the late 20th cen-
tury discovery of fossils on Wrangle Island, off the coast of Siberia. Mammoths
were living on this island as recently as 4,000 years ago — the same period
when the Egyptians were building the pyramids.
These island mammoths are especially cool not because they survived to his-
torical times (though that fact is fascinating), but because they were minia-
ture mammoths, only about 7 feet tall — the Shetland ponies of the mammoth
family. Why would pint-size mammoths have evolved? Possibly because there
was no advantage to being huge on islands.
One of the major advantages of being a very large animal is that you’re just
too big for any predators to attack. When an elephant — or a mammoth, I
suppose — reaches a certain size, nothing is going to eat it. But being large
also has costs. An African elephant needs to eat around 300 pounds of food
and drink 50 gallons of water every day. The evolution of smaller mammoths
could have been selectively advantageous if the species had no predators on
the island. Smaller mammoths that could survive on less food would be less
likely to starve. 
Pterosaurs (Pterodactyls)
The largest living flying bird in the world is the Andean condor, which can
have a wingspan of more than 10 feet. Go back in time, and you can find fos-
sils of an extinct bird with a wingspan twice as big — a creature that would
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

make Big Bird look small. To find the largest animal that ever flew, you need
to go back even farther — 65 million years back, in fact, to the time of the
pterosaurs (or pterodactyls, as they are often called).
Pterosaurs were flying reptiles related to dinosaurs. Although some of them
were quite small, the largest had a wingspan that reached almost 40 feet.
Perch a pterosaur atop a school bus, and its wings would stretch the entire
length of the bus. (Hang on to your children!)
Evolutionists like pterosaurs not just because the group includes the largest
creature that ever flew, but also because it’s represents yet another indepen-
dent origin of the ability to fly. Pterosaurs’ wings were structured differently
from those of other vertebrate lineages that have taken to the air: birds and
bats (which also differ from each other). In bats, for example, the wing is sup-
ported by the elongated digits of the forelimbs, but in pterosaurs, the wing
was supported by an elongated third finger with the other digits being much
reduced. Both mechanisms work to make a wing, but the random process of
mutation and differences in initial structures nudged these lineages down dif-
ferent pathways.
Trilobites
If you ever owned an animal fossil, chances are that it was a trilobite — one
of the most common types of animal fossils (see Figure 20-2). Trilobites were
arthropods (things like lobsters, spiders, and bumblebees) that lived in the
ocean. They appeared in the fossil record more than 540 million years ago
and went extinct 250 million years ago.
The fossil record of trilobites is especially rich because aquatic sediments
provide the perfect environment for fossilization. In addition to the trilobite
fossils themselves, scientists have found fossils showing the organisms’ bur-
rows and tracks. Here’s what these fossils tell researchers:
 Different trilobite species evolved different body shapes. Some were
smooth; others were extremely spiny. They ranged in size from a few mil-
limeters to a couple of feet.
 Some lineages had the ability to dig burrows; others were able to roll up
in balls, like pillbugs and hedgehogs; and some evolved the ability to
swim.
 They inhabited shallow waters as well as deep waters, though they have
not been found in any freshwater environments.

Just as important as the trilobite-specific information that these fossils offer
is what they show about the time frame of evolutionary transitions in lin-
eages with a plentiful fossil record. We have so few human fossils, for exam-
ple, that it’s reasonable to assume we will miss transitional forms because
the hominid fossil record is poor. 
Even though trilobite fossils are numerous, we still see sudden (in geological
time) transitions and the rapid appearance of new forms in this lineage.
Where speciation events occur in a small, localized area, the probability of
finding intermediate forms decreases, and the fossil record appears to con-
tain more sudden transitions as species appear and go extinct. Head to
Chapter 8 for info on speciation.
Tiktaalik Rosea
Perhaps you’ve seen cartoons depicting the transition of vertebrates from
water to land animals. Usually, these drawings show some sort of fish with
Figure 20-2:
A trilobite.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

stubby little legs, which isn’t too far off the truth. Scientists recently found a
fossil quite similar to the type that’s famous from all those evolution car-
toons: Tiktaalik rosea.
Tiktaalik has a lot of fishlike structures, such as fins, scales, and gills. But its
“fins” have a leg-like structure with wrists and parts like a hand or fingers
(see Figure 20-3). This critter could do pushups! It’s not clear to what extent
Tiktaalik left the water, if it did at all. Some scientists hypothesize that this
new fin structure would have been advantageous for maintaining position in
fast-flowing shallow water.

Other interesting characteristics of this fossil are its neck and the eyes on top
of its head — more like a crocodile than a salmon. What scientists have dis-
covered from this fossil is that the anatomical modifications associated with
the transition to land may have evolved first in the water.
Hallucigenia and the Burgess Shale
The Burgess Shale is a concentration of fossils in the Canadian Rockies con-
taining large numbers of morphologically distinct species that at first glance
don’t seem much like the organisms that are around today. 
The fossils found in this shale are cool for two reasons: 
 Their excellent degree of preservation often reveals intricate structures
of the softer body parts. 
 The large diversity of forms that were new to science raises interesting
questions about the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

Chapter 20: Ten Fascinating Fossil Finds

For the most part with fossils, it’s possible to identify the major group to
which the organism belongs. For example, you might know that a particular
fossil is a clam, perhaps not like any clam we have today, but a clam never-
theless. Before the discovery of the Burgess shale, scientists could identify
fossil animals as earlier members of particular branches of the tree of life.
Trilobites (see the preceding section), for example, were recognizable as
members of the arthropods branch. 
But when the animals in the Burgess Shale were examined, it wasn’t clear
immediately what groups many organisms belonged to, and in some cases,
such as the organism hallucigenia, it wasn’t even immediately clear which
end was up (see Figure 20-4). Creatures like hallucigenia make one think that
perhaps many such interesting and unusual creatures have evolved and sub-
sequently gone extinct.

On subsequent analysis, and with the passing of considerable time and effort,
scientists have been able to assign many of the fossils found in the Burgess
Shale to existing groups. But some fossils still defy placement and may
indeed be examples of unique body plans that turned out to be evolutionary
dead ends.
Stromatolites
Stromatolite fossils dating back more than 3 billion years are among the
oldest fossilized evidence of life on Earth. Stromatolites are pillars formed by
Figure 20-4:
Halluci-
genia.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

layer upon layer of microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria (see “Micro-
fossils,” later in this chapter). These layers trap sediments that become
incorporated into the structure, or in some cases, the organisms themselves
are responsible for producing calcium carbonate, which becomes a compo-
nent of a structure. Either way, when the structure is fossilized, the layers are
visible as bands in the columnar structure. 
Stromatolites are common in the fossil record; however, it wasn’t until the
discovery of living stromatolites that we could be sure that these structures
were the result of biological activity. While there certainly seem to have been
a fair number of stromatolites formed billions of years ago, they are a lot less
frequent now. Living stromatolite structures are currently found only in areas
where there are no predators to feed on the layers of microorganisms. In the
days before anything else had evolved to eat them, being eaten wasn’t a prob-
lem. Today, they’re just out of luck in most places.
Microfossils
Microfossils are simply fossils too small to study with the naked eye. Micro-
fossils are grouped based solely on their size and don’t correspond to a par-
ticular branch of the tree of life. Following are a few examples:
 Cyanobacteria: The earliest cyanobacterial fossils date from approxi-
mately 3.6 billion years ago, and for the longest time, such single-cell
organisms were the only life on the planet. Interestingly, the earliest fos-
sils of these microorganisms are extremely similar to those that exist
today.
 Foraminifera: Organisms typically about a millimeter in size that pro-
duce hard shells, with each species being unique. Because the species
present at any given time vary (as a result of extinction and speciation),
scientists can use the species to date different geological strata. If they
find the same collection of foraminifera species in two samples, they
know that the samples date from the same time.
That info may seem rather useless, but it’s pretty handy for marine oil
exploration. Suppose that you find oil in strata of a particular age.
Naturally, you want to explore the strata in a nearby location. But
because of geological activity, the strata may be at a different depth in
the second location. By analyzing the various species of foraminifera
across the two locations, you can match strata of similar ages.
 Spores and pollen: Researchers can use changes in the composition of
plant reproductive structures over time to glean information about how
communities change through time. Scientists can use pollen samples to
325
Chapter 20: Ten Fascinating Fossil Finds

make inferences about climate change over shorter time scales, observ-
ing how pollen from plants characteristic of one set of environmental
conditions is replaced in subsequent strata by pollen from plants char-
acteristic of a different set of environmental conditions.
Amber
Amber is fossilized tree sap. It’s quite commonly used in jewelry and has a
beautiful golden color. As nice as the sap itself is, the really interesting thing
about amber is that organisms — plant parts (such as leaves, seeds, and
flowers), small mushrooms (representing fungi), insects, snails, spiders, and
even frogs — can become trapped in it. These trapped organisms retain
incredibly fine detail. Flowers, for example, can appear perfectly preserved.
For groups that are poorly represented in other forms of fossils, amber pro-
vides the best clues about the timing of various evolutionary events.
Spiders, for example, are quite rare in the fossil record because they don’t
have hard exoskeletons, but these creatures, and even their fossilized webs,
turn up in amber. Data from amber allows researchers to date the evolution
of spider webs to more than 100 million years ago. A 130-million-year-old
spider-web fossil has been preserved with enough detail that you can see the
individual droplets of glue the spider placed on the web!

Ten Amazing Adaptations
In This Chapter 
 Adaptations that you see over and over again
 Big adaptations resulting from a series of small steps
 Weird adaptations
A
daptations are evolutionary changes resulting from natural selection.
The environment in which a species lives exerts selective pressures on
species such that they change over time. 
This chapter lists ten adaptations I particularly like because they represent
the types of adaptations that are possible. Some are no-brainers. Want to live
in the ocean, and you’re a mammal? You’d better be streamlined and insu-
lated. Others are breakthroughs. Photosynthesis, for example, changed the
chemistry of the entire world because of all the oxygen it produced. And
some are — almost — out of this world, such as the creatures that have
evolved to live in the deep-sea thermal vents that you see on the National
Geographic Channel.
Different Kinds of Teeth
You have different kinds of teeth, but have you ever thought about how help-
ful those differences are? According to the fossil record, the ancestral condi-
tion in reptiles and the reptilian lineage that led to mammals is to have teeth
that are all the same. Think about a crocodile; it has lots of teeth, but they’re
all the same. The same goes for the dinosaurs.
But then things changed. The Dimetredon, a dinosaur-like creature that had a
sail on its back, had two kinds of teeth. Having two kinds of teeth allows for
the possibility of division of labor. The teeth in the rear can be used for pro-
cessing food — for grinding in grazing mammals or for slicing up chunks of
flesh in your house cat — and the teeth in the front can specialize in food
acquisition or other functions: snipping plants in herbivores, subduing prey
in carnivores, or other functions such as defense.

What’s interesting about the evolution of teeth shape is that the lower jaw
has to match the upper jaw. As a consequence, changes to both jaws have to
occur at the same time. For this reason, teeth change very slowly. Things get
a little more complicated for humans. We’ve taken to capturing and process-
ing most of our food outside our mouths. We cook it (ever try to eat raw
rice?) and use knives and forks to cut it (ever ripped raw meat apart with
your teeth?). As a result, our dentition is much reduced.
Evolution has also gone in the other direction: an ancestor with different
kinds of teeth evolving into a species with uniform teeth. Example are ani-
mals that don’t need to process their food because they swallow it whole —
like dolphins and some other marine mammals. These creatures are
descended from ancestors with non-uniform teeth, but they evolved dentition
with one kind of tooth designed for grabbing small, slippery prey, which they
then swallow whole.
Sight: The Evolution of the Eye
Eyes are beautifully complex structures, and their evolution was a source of
some mystery to Charles Darwin. The idea that the eye could not have arisen
from the process of natural selection is a common misconception even today
and is rooted in the idea of irreproducible complexity (see Chapter 22), which
states that complex structures could not have arisen as a result of a gradual
evolutionary process because humans can’t imagine how intermediate forms
would be advantageous. You often see this argument stated this way: “What
good is half an eye?”
Darwin never suggested that natural selection couldn’t produce the eye, 
of course; he just admitted that he didn’t know exactly how the process
unfolded. He imagined that many intermediate steps had to occur, leading
from a very simple light-sensing structure to the structures you’re using to
read this page; he just didn’t know what they were. Fast-forward to today,
when scientists know that many of the intermediate stages exist in other ani-
mals. From this fact, they can imagine the series of small steps that would lead
from the simplest light-sensitive cell to a more complex eye. For example:
 Step 1: Start with the simplest light-sensitive cells. A patch of these
cells can determine the presence or absence of light but not much else.
 Step 2: The cells are set slightly into the body in a little pit or cup.
After the cells reside in a depression in the surface of the organism, the
light-sensing apparatus becomes capable of determining the direction
from which the light is coming.
 Step 3: The edges of the pit grow together so that light enters the pit
through a very small opening. This arrangement is the principle behind
a pinhole camera. Even though the camera has no lens, restricting light
to traveling through a small hole results in a crisper image.
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The principle behind the pinhole camera is simple physics, and you can
test it yourself. If you have to hold a book at a distance to focus (you
young folks wait a few years), poke a tiny hole in a piece of paper and
peer through it. You can read the text without having to move the book
away (or so far away).  
 Step 4: A lens is added to the opening of the light-sensitive cells. You
don’t have to imagine the lens evolving all at once as a lens; you can
easily imagine that a layer of translucent cells over the opening of the
pinhole had a protective function. And we have plenty of examples of
see-through cells in the animal kingdom. When that layer was in place,
any changes that resulted in a crisper image would be selectively 
advantageous.
Imagining such intermediate steps goes a long way toward helping you see
how a series of small changes can lead to complex structures like the eye.
Cave Blindness
A common pattern that’s repeated across a large number of animals in differ-
ent locations is the evolution of cave blindness — the evolution of sightless-
ness in lineages that have come to inhabit caves. Cave blindness is an
excellent example of convergent evolution, in which the same trait evolves
independently in different organisms (refer to Chapter 9).
The ancestors of most cave-dwelling organisms came from non-cave environ-
ments that had light. In fact, you can go to any big cave with its own ecosys-
tem full of cave critters, and you’ll find blind cave animals whose closest
relatives (in the tree of life) can see. 
You can easily see why the selective pressures on organisms existing in dark-
ness would be different from those existing in light: Perhaps the energy
required to produce those structures was needed for other functions — it’s
wasted making eyes in the dark and is better spend it some other way.
Perhaps rewiring the sensory system — cave critters often have a good sense
of smell, extra-sensitive tactile feelers and antenna, or other stuff that’s good
to have in the dark — requires minimizing the eyes. 
A common theme in evolutionary biology is that things can happen over and
over. If something is good once, maybe it’s good twice. Cave blindness is an
example; over and over, organisms that move into caves lose their sight.
Flight (discussed in “Vertebrate Flight,” later in this chapter) is another good
example; it evolved in insects, mammals, birds, and even the extinct lineage
pterosaurs (which you can read about in Chapter 20).
329
Chapter 21: Ten Amazing Adaptations

Finally, as discussed in Chapter 5, we always need to be cautious about
assuming that an evolutionary change is an adaptation. Once it’s dark, muta-
tions that degrade the eye are no longer bad; they just don’t matter. So over
enough time, genetic drift might be expected to result in the loss of eyes even
if the change isn’t adaptive — in which case cave blindness is an example of
evolution but not adaptation. 
Back to the Sea
Eons ago, the first vertebrates crawled out of the ocean and onto land. It
seemed like a good idea at the time. But since then, a few species have
headed back to sea. Some have gone back completely; others return to the
land to reproduce. Sea snakes, penguins, seals, whales, manatees, and sea
otters are examples of animals that evolved independently back to sea ani-
mals from terrestrial ancestors.
Through phylogenetic analysis (see Chapter 9), scientists can tell that verte-
brates have returned to the sea on several occasions; that in each case, the
aquatic group is nested within a larger terrestrial group; and that the common
ancestor of all the individuals in the group was terrestrial. DNA-sequence evi-
dence has been especially helpful in confirming relationships. The skeletal
structures of whales and hippos, for example, provide evidence that they’re
related, even though they don’t look all that similar. Through DNA evidence,
scientists also know that the seal group is nested within the carnivores.
Living in the ocean selects for several suites of characters:
 With the exception of the sea snakes, which live in warm tropical
waters, all these groups have made adaptations to keep warm.
Penguins have an insulating layer of blubber, as do all the mammals that
live in the ocean, except for sea otters, who have water-resistant coats
that trap insulating air layers.
 All ocean-dwelling species are reasonably streamlined to facilitate
faster motion in water. The manatee group is the least streamlined and,
not surprisingly, the slowest. But then, manatees are also vegetarians,
and plants don’t run very fast.
 Their appendages have become modified for locomotion in water: flip-
pers in the case of many of the mammals; wings that act like flippers and
webbed feet in the case of the penguins. Sea snakes have a flattened body,
especially in the tail region, allowing them to swim with an eel-like motion.
 All have characteristics that indicate their descent from land animals.
They all breathe air, for example, which can be very inconvenient when
you live in the water, but each has evolved a rather impressive capabil-
ity for holding its breath. (Sperm whales can routinely hold their breath
for an hour!) They also have vestigial structures indicative of terrestrial
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

ancestors. One of the best examples is the hind leg bones of whales.
These small bones are completely within the body (whales don’t have
hind limbs) but correspond to the rear leg bones of terrestrial
quadrupeds.
And Back to the Land Again
Current research suggests that the elephant may have an aquatic ancestor.
Keep in mind, though, that the jury’s still out on this particular hypothesis.
But I decided to share it with you nonetheless because it’s a good story.
Think of it as a trip to the cutting edge of science but remember: There’s not
a lot of room on the edge, so sometimes we fall off!
The evidence that the elephant evolved from an aquatic ancestor is threefold:
 Elephants’ closest living relatives are manatees. The fossil record for
the evolutionary transition of the manatee lineage to the aquatic envi-
ronment is reasonably complete. Fossil manatees with the vestigial legs
have been found, and in Jamaica recently, scientists discovered a fossil
manatee with functional legs that could support the weight of the animal
yet still showed adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle. The aquatic ancestor
of elephants would have been similar to such a creature, but the ele-
phant lineage returned to the land rather than transition to a fully
aquatic lifestyle, as the manatee lineage did. What we know from the
fossil record and the structure of existing manatees and whales is con-
sistent with the hypothesis that the most recent common ancestor of
these beasts already had its feet in the water. One branch of the family
tree kept going, while the other headed back to shore. 
 Elephants are surprisingly good swimmers. Although they can’t raise
their heads out of the water while swimming, they can use their trunks
as snorkels. If you’ve ever breathed through a snorkel while standing in
water (rather than floating on the top of the water), you know that this
feat is difficult because of the pressure of the water. Well, snorkeling is
even harder for elephants because of the length of their trunks, but they
do it relatively easily because they don’t have a pleural cavity (a mem-
brane surrounding the lungs that’s unique to mammals). The absence of
this cavity prevents the pressure difference from damaging the lungs.
 Elephants have traits that are common to mammals that have
returned to the ocean. Chief among these traits is internal testes — 
a characteristic found in no other land mammal but in all aquatic 
mammals.

Photosynthesis
Photosynthetic organisms convert light energy from the sun to chemical
energy, which they use to power their bodies. Photosynthesis is responsible
for almost all the energy used by organisms on this planet. Either directly, as
a result of internal photosynthesis, or indirectly, by eating something that
photosynthesizes itself (or that ate something that did), most species run on
photosynthetic energy. Because oil is ancient fossilized plant matter, your car
is running indirectly on photosynthetic energy, too.
When you think of photosynthesis, plants are probably the first (and likely
the only) organisms that come to mind, but they aren’t the only organisms
that use photosynthesis. Some bacteria do, too. Figuring out the origin and
evolution of the various chemical mechanisms by which bacteria photosyn-
thesize is a source of active research. As with so many things, biologists are
still learning about the evolutionary diversity of photosynthetic mechanisms.
In the summer of 2007, a new type of photosynthetic bacteria with different
chemical pathways was discovered in a hot spring in Yellowstone National
Park.
Deep-Sea Thermal-Vent Organisms
Photosynthesis may be responsible for most of the energy that organisms
use, but a group of organisms that live deep in the ocean use another source
of energy. Down at the ocean bottom, in regions of sub-oceanic volcanic activ-
ity, are thermal vents that spew out hot, mineral-rich streams of water from
within the Earth. These mineral-rich streams of water, which were unknown
before the 1970s, can be used to generate energy in much the same way that
photosynthesis does. 
Specifically, some bacteria can generate energy by oxidizing the hydrogen
sulfide (the substance that makes rotten eggs smell rotten) that is present in
the hot vent water. So these organisms derive energy not from photosynthe-
sis, but from chemosynthesis. The energy that forms the base of the food
chain in these deep thermal vents is not the energy of the sun, but the energy
at the core of the Earth.
Just as plants form the basis of an entire community on the surface of the
earth, these bacteria form the basis of a whole community on the ocean floor.
And what a community it is! Creatures found nowhere else live near these
thermal vents. The sulfur-oxidizing bacteria live within large worms that have
no digestive systems but derive their energy solely from the bacteria, which
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

in turn get a secure location anchored right near the stream of hydrogen 
sulfide.
Finally, these deep thermal vents have a very dim glow, so additional photo-
synthetic bacteria may be lurking there somewhere. Things are always more
complicated than they seem at first!
Endosymbiosis
One of the most amazing evolutionary events is called endosymbiosis.
According to this theory, some of the structures in eukaryotic cells — such
as mitochondria and chloroplasts — once were free-living bacteria that
became engulfed in ancestral eukaryotic cells, and a symbiotic relationship
evolved. Somehow, and we don’t completely understand how, two ancient
critters joined up and eventually became so tightly interdependent that they
effectively became a single organism. Remember that we’re eukaryotes so
that means that we are derived from two different lineages that came
together deep in the distant past to make the eukaryotic cell. That’s why
your mitochondria have their own genome — their distant ancestors used to
fly solo.
Here are the details supporting this theory: Mitochondria and chloroplasts
bear a strong resemblance to bacteria. When the eukaryotic cells divide, the
organelles divide too, and the division process of these organelles is reminis-
cent of the division of bacteria. Most importantly, these organelles have their
own DNA, and analysis of the DNA sequences shows that the organelles are
closely related to some free-living species of bacteria.
As you can imagine, this hypothesis was quite controversial initially. Think
about it: Descendents of ancient bacteria are living in all your cells. But the
DNA evidence seems to be beyond doubt. Your mitochondria have their own
genome, albeit much reduced, and it’s a lot more similar to a bacteria genome
than it is to anything in your nuclear genome. Luckily, we eukaryotes are all
living happily ever after, and we’ve been doing so for at least 2 billion years.
Vertebrate Flight
Flight is another trait that has evolved several times in several lineages.
Birds, bats, pterodactyls — all evolved true flight, and a couple of others
have rudimentary gliding ability. Flight is a remarkably successful trait.
Groups that are capable of flying radiate extensively. Bats account for one
333
Chapter 21: Ten Amazing Adaptations

quarter of all mammal species, for example. And pterodactyls, though
extinct, survived for 150 million years and encompassed many species,
including the largest creatures ever to take to the air.
Theories about the evolution of flight can be divided into two groups: up
from the ground and down from the trees. The second group is easier to visu-
alize, because species living today, such as flying squirrels (which don’t
really fly, by the way), have structures that allow them to glide from tree to
tree. Current thinking is that bats arose from an arboreal ancestor, so the
gliding hypothesis may apply to them, too. Pterodactyls, on the other hand,
don’t seem to have descended from arboreal ancestors, so maybe both mech-
anisms are possible.
What scientists do know is that bats, pterodactyls, and birds evolved flight
structures in different ways. In bats, the wing is constructed of a membrane
stretched between what for humans would be the fingers of the hand. In the
case of the pterodactyls, the wing is supported by just one elongated digit. In
birds, the wing is comprised of feathers all along the arm. And that list covers
just the vertebrates; flight has also evolved in the insect lineage. Bottom line:
Several different mutational pathways generated wings.
Trap-jaw Ants
Trap-jaw ants are species of ants in which the mandibles (the jaw-like things
that they grab prey or bite you with) are locked open and have a trigger that
allows them to spring shut with great force. In one case, the jaws snap shut at
speeds reaching up to almost 150 miles an hour. The principle is something
like an archer drawing a bow: You pull and pull to load the bow, and when
you suddenly release the bowstring, the energy is transferred to the arrow.
This adaptation is cool on several levels:
 The jaw speed — 150 miles per hour — is the fastest attack motion in
the animal kingdom.
 This trait has evolved at least four times in four different groups of ants.
And although the final outcome is the same in all cases, the exact path-
way by which the trait was obtained varies from one species to the next.
Specifically, different parts have been modified to serve as the trigger in
different ant species.
 At least one species uses the great force generated by the snapping jaws
for functions other than biting — for example, as a means of escape from
predators. To escape, the ant points its head at the ground, releases its
jaws, and is propelled rapidly away from whatever it’s trying to escape.

Ten Arguments against Evolution
and Why They’re Wrong
In This Chapter
 Common misconceptions about evolution
 What the intelligent-design camp has to say
 Why science in general and evolution in particular aren’t anti-religion
F
or an idea that’s almost beautifully simple, evolution certainly has gar-
nered a lot of bad press. To hear some people talk, you’d think Darwin
himself was the devil incarnate; evolutionary biologists are his handmaids;
and people who teach evolution in the classroom are corrupting the minds of
children across the land. Can we get a little perspective, people? 
I wrote this chapter specifically to provide a little perspective — and facts to
arguments that tend to lack them. Here I present the arguments some people
make against evolution and then explain why these arguments are wrong. 
It’s Only a Theory
Yes. Evolution is a theory, but not in the way the naysayers mean. When they
say it’s only a theory, they mean it’s only an idea—a guess, if you will. But as
Chapter 2 explains in quite a bit of detail, a scientific theory is not merely a
best guess. It’s a hypothesis that — through experiment after experiment,
study after study, analysis after analysis — has yet to be refuted.
Having said that, evolution is not only a theory; it’s also a fact. The key to
understanding evolution is to recognize how it can be both:

 As a fact: Evolution is simply genetic changes occurring through time in
a group of individuals (a population, a species, and so on). Scientists
know that these changes occur. They can see the changes; measure
them; and, in many instances, figure out when they happened.
 As a theory: Evolutionary theory seeks to explain what’s responsible for
the evolutionary process — in other words, what causes these changes.
What scientists know today is that natural selection (Chapter 5) and
genetic drift (Chapter 6) are two key forces driving these changes.
It Violates the Second Law 
of Thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy — essentially, 
randomness — increases (or stays constant) in a closed, or isolated, system;
it cannot decrease. In other words, left on their own, isolated systems become
more uniform, not less. The differences smooth out until one common state
exists. Think about a glass of ice water. After the ice goes in, the water gets a
little colder, and then the ice melts: The entropy has increased in the glass.
According to the second law of thermodynamics, the whole universe is doing
the same thing: Increasing entropy is “smoothing out” the world. Rather than
having hot regions and cold regions, for example, the world would have all its
parts the same temperature.
So what does this law have to do with evolution? Diversification of life on
Earth has involved very complex organisms evolving from simple forms that
were present a few billion years ago — a fact that seems to fly in the face of
the second law, because on Earth entropy is decreasing, not increasing. And
there’s the key. Earth is not a closed system. It gets loads of energy from the
sun, and that energy is what powers the increase in complexity.
It’s Been Proved Wrong (by Scientists!)
I love this one! This argument stems from the fact that in the hundred-plus
years since Darwin’s death, scientists have contributed to his original
thoughts and refined their understanding of evolutionary events and princi-
ples. The spin you see in lots of articles, though, implies that a particular
piece of research is at odds with what Darwin thought and, therefore, is proof
that Darwin got things wrong.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The best example is the importance of random factors — genetic drift (see
Chapter 6), which is one of the key insights modern evolutionary biologists
have added to our current understanding of evolution. What scientists know
today that they didn’t know during Darwin’s time is that random events, as
well as natural selection, can be evolutionary forces; that random events can
be evolutionarily important is an example of a major change in theory of evo-
lution, but it doesn’t negate in any way Darwin’s theory of evolution by nat-
ural selection. It simply makes his ideas more broadly applicable. 
It’s Completely Random
How long would it take a million monkeys hammering away on a million type-
writers to produce Moby-Dick? Who knows? (How long did it take one monkey
hammering away on one typewriter to come up with the premise for “Who
Wants to Marry a Millionaire?”) The point? That a complex work — whether
it’s a Shakespearean sonnet or a book about evolution — can’t possibly be
the result of random processes.
The problem is that people who make this argument are confusing the fact
that some of the evolutionary process of natural selection involves random
events with the idea that the whole process is random. True, the mutations
produced are random (that is, not directed toward a goal), but natural selec-
tion sorts through these mutations in a nonrandom fashion, selecting for
those that increase fitness.
A major stumbling block that prevents many religious people from accepting
what science has learned about the evolutionary process is the idea that evo-
lution is connected to a random process, the one whereby DNA sequences
are passed inexactly from one generation to the next — in other words, the
process of mutation. Yet the very process of replicating the DNA is error
prone. Scientists can measure the rate at which errors occur in DNA replica-
tion just as they can measure the rate of radioisotope decay, but whether an
error occurs in one location or another is random.
The random aspect is unsettling for many people. Although we know that,
given the amount of time available, the process of natural selection acting on
randomly produced mutations is more than sufficient to generate our own
species, this viewpoint is at odds with some people’s view of humanity’s
place in God’s universe. To reconcile the role of randomness with the reli-
gious beliefs that things happen for a reason or with purpose, some people
suggest that nothing is truly random — that perhaps God set into motion the
series of events that caused exactly the particular sequence of mutations
337
Chapter 22: Ten Arguments against Evolution and Why They’re Wrong

that resulted in Homo sapiens. Maybe. But no way exists to scientifically mea-
sure whether God is or isn’t directing these mutations. So these possibilities
are outside the realm of science.
It Can’t Result in Big Changes
According to this argument, some changes (namely, the small ones, a
mutated nucleotide here or there) can be the result of the evolutionary
process, but others (namely, the big ones) can’t be. The key areas of dis-
sention are
 Speciation: The argument goes like this: Although evolution can 
lead to changes within a lineage, it can’t lead to lineages splitting or spe-
ciating. Au contraire. Gradual changes can lead to reproductive isolation
(and the key characteristic differentiating one species from another is
the inability to interbreed). The best examples for understanding specia-
tion involve ring species, species where some but not all subpopulations
can interbreed. The geographically adjacent populations are different
enough from each other such that reproductive isolation occurs in some
but not all cases. Moreover, we can select for the start of reproductive
isolation in the laboratory. For more on when, how, and why speciation
occurs, and for a more complete explanation of ring species, go to
Chapter 8. 
 Evolution of new characteristics: Some folks insist that mutations can
affect existing structures or traits but can’t be responsible for new ones.
Except that they can. As Chapter 15 explains, the process of gene dupli-
cation can result in multiple copies of a gene, and these copies can
evolve along different trajectories. Changes in one copy that would have
been deleterious in the absence of the other copy now are not deleteri-
ous (because you’ve got a spare copy) and are potentially advantageous.
Through this process, the number of genes present in the organism can
increase and diversify in function.
 Big changes in physical characteristics: If I’m starting to sound like a
broken record, it’s because the same goes for big changes in body struc-
tures: Small changes can produce big results. See Chapter 14 for more
details on the evolution of development.
No Missing Link Means No Proof
In the period immediately after Darwin published On the Origin of Species,
there was a lot of talk about missing links. If humans and apes were relatives,
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

where was the fossil evidence? There wasn’t a good answer back then, but
fast forward to today and the answer is easy: in museums all over the world! 
We’ve found a wealth of fossils, everything from recent relatives like
Neanderthals, to more distant relations whose two-legged stance puts them
clearly in our part of the tree of life but whose tiny brains suggest that we
wonder about their lives a fair bit more than they probably did. Every few
months a story appears in the news about some new fossil discovery.
Modern paleontologists have gotten really good at finding these things! And
this in spite of the fact that
 Fossils generally are rare and hard to find. If, as scientists suspect,
speciation occurs more often in small, isolated populations (refer to
Chapter 8), finding such fossils would be much harder. But just because
a certain fossil hasn’t been found doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist. Just
that we need to keep looking — and look we do. 
 As scientists get better at fossil-hunting, they’ve found more and more
fossils, some of which definitely qualify as transitional life forms.
Although scientists haven’t found all missing links, they have found
series of fossils that document transitions for many cases. Any of the fol-
lowing creatures discovered in the fossil record could be considered
missing links, for example: 
• The fish with legs
• The whale with legs
• The series of feathered dinosaurs leading up to flight
Who knows what we’ll see on tomorrow’s news!
It Can’t Account for Everything: 
Enter the Intelligent Designer
There are almost as many descriptions of intelligent design (ID) as there are
proponents of the theory, and some even allow a limited role for evolution
via natural selection. But all the versions of ID have one thing in common: the
belief that some things in the biological world could not have come about
without a “designer.”
Proponents of ID argue that some structures (or systems, processes, or what-
ever) in the biological world clearly show that they were produced by an
intelligent designer. This designer may be a divine entity but doesn’t need to
339
Chapter 22: Ten Arguments against Evolution and Why They’re Wrong

be. Leading proponents of ID, testifying in a court of law, have suggested that
the designer could be a space alien or a time-traveling biologist. 
ID proponents identify complex biological structures and then state that
these structures could not have been the product of natural selection and,
therefore, are evidence of the designer. Yet they don’t produce any testable
hypotheses. Their arguments aren’t scientific — regardless of the scientific
terms and language they use — but theological, aliens and time travelers
notwithstanding. They can’t say, exactly, what it is that allows them to con-
clude that one structure shows the hand of the designer and another one
doesn’t. They just seem to know it when they see it. Many books are written
on the subject of ID, but none of them share the methodology that would
allow a student of ID to learn how these decisions are reached.
In this book, I don’t attempt to address in detail the intricacies of religious
beliefs. Religion can be a powerful force for good, but it is no more appropri-
ate for a religious viewpoint to try to interject itself into the scientific process
than it would be for the scientific view point to claim special knowledge of
the mysteries of religion. 
It Can’t Create Complex Structures
Irreducible complexity is the key component of most of the arguments put
forth by the ID camp. Proponents of ID argue that extremely complicated
structures, such as the eye, could not have evolved through a series of small
steps because an eye is so complicated that it won’t work without all its
parts. When something can’t work without all its parts, they conclude that it
could not have been assembled one part at a time. 
To bolster their argument, ID proponents quote Darwin himself, claiming that
his very words support their argument against evolution. Well, here’s what
Darwin actually said about the structure of the eye, an organ he considered
“of extreme perfection complication” (Note: The italics are mine and they
highlight the part of this quote that ID proponents don’t share): 
To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting
the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light,
and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have
been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the
highest possible degree. Yet reason tells me that if numerous gradations
from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each
grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye
does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to
an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing
that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though
insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.
Time and again, for pretty much whatever the ID camp claims couldn’t have
evolved incrementally, evolutionary biologists have identified the intermedi-
ate steps that led to the complex structure. Two classic examples of highly
complex structures that evolved precisely through intermediate steps are the
eye and blood-clotting factors.
Just because a system is made up of a series of parts doesn’t mean that those
parts evolved to perform the functions they now perform. Take, for example,
bacteria that have evolved to break down polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
which are new to the environment. Until humans made them, these very
nasty chemicals didn’t exist. But some bacteria have evolved very compli-
cated biochemical mechanisms for breaking down these compounds. As it
turns out, the biochemistry that allows these bacteria to degrade PCBs is
kludged together from a series of other biochemical pathways that serve
other functions. Such PCB-busting biochemical mechanisms seem irreducibly
complex, but the individual parts are advantageous in ways that are not
related to PCB degradation.
It Should Be Taught with 
ID in Science Class
ID proponents argue that the theory of evolution isn’t the only theory
explaining how life on Earth came to be; therefore, in the interest of 
fairness and balance, ID should be taught along with evolution in the 
science classroom.
The issue isn’t what should be included in the school curriculum, but what
should be included in a science class. This statement may sound like hair-
splitting, but science instruction isn’t about a simple accumulation of facts
and data (even though facts and data are accumulated in the process of
doing science). 
Science is a way of asking questions by coming up with ideas and then trying
hard to shoot them down. The ideas that scientists can’t shoot down even
after lots of trying become theories about how things work. And if at some
point, other scientists come up with evidence that refutes these theories,
they shoot the theories down.
341
Chapter 22: Ten Arguments against Evolution and Why They’re Wrong

Although the ID argument is compelling to many people, it isn’t science. In
fact, it turns the entire scientific process on its head. Instead of trying to
shoot down their own premise that a designer is responsible for the complex-
ity of the universe, ID proponents use the very complexity that they claim
requires a designer to prove the existence of the designer. This reasoning is
circular (and an error in logic); it’s not science.
The ID argument relies on a particular world view that demands a designer. In
essence, it promotes the religious viewpoint that something beyond natural
processes created the world and the creatures in it. Evolution, on the other
hand, is a scientific discipline; it doesn’t concern itself with anything beyond
what can be seen or observed in the natural world. That one deals with the
supernatural and the other with the natural is the key difference between sci-
ence and religion and why they don’t have to be at odds.
It’s a Fringe Topic
Evolution is a central part of modern biology. In fact, making sense of most of
biology concepts in the absence of an evolutionary perspective is difficult.
One of the most important things that an understanding of the evolutionary
process provides to the study of biology is a way to understand the effect of
history.
This historical perspective is important for fields as diverse as agriculture,
conservation biology, and medicine. Doctors, for example, don’t worry about
removing an appendix, because they have a framework in which to under-
stand that it’s a vestigial organ — that is, it may have served a purpose once,
but that purpose is long gone, even though the organ isn’t. And understand-
ing how organisms evolve continues to be vital in the fight against infectious
diseases (see Chapters 18 and 19 to find out why).
Conservationists seeking to save species also need to preserve biological
diversity. Without genetic diversity, endangered species — even those that
are making headway in the numbers game — remain vulnerable to extinction.
By understanding natural variation in the evolutionary process, conserva-
tionists better understand what their conservation goals should be and how
to meet them. It’s probably better to save a few spotted owls from a bunch 
of different forests than all the spotted owls from one isolated forest, for
example.

It’s at Odds with Biblical Creation
Quite a few people see discrepancies between the biblical creation story as
they understand it and the idea of evolution. Young Earth creationism, for
example, states that the Earth is only a few thousand years old and that all
living organisms were created by God exactly as you see them today. Right
there, you can see the areas of disagreement. This theory’s creation date 
is at odds with most of what humans know from other fields of science —
specifically, from physics and astronomy, which indicate that the Earth is
about 4 billion years old. If the Earth were only a few thousand years old, the
evolutionary process as scientists understand it wouldn’t have had sufficient
time to generate the diversity of the planet.
Old Earth creationism differs from Young Earth creationism in that it accepts
that the Earth is as old as physicists and astronomers say, but it disagrees
that any evolutionary processes would have occurred over that time.
According to this theory, species were formed by God and did not change
subsequently.
Other groups make other distinctions:
 Some allow for the possibility of small evolutionary changes that may
have happened within a species over time but not for the origin of new
species.
 Others allow for the possibility that speciation could have occurred
within specific groups but say that larger taxonomic groups could not
have arisen. 
 Still others, recognizing that the Ark was only so big, have come up with
a clever workaround that melds both biblical and evolutionary theory:
Noah loaded the Ark with all the animals that existed on Earth at the
time. Then somehow, in the few short years that followed the grounding
of the Ark, the species diversified to produce the variety we see today.
In all these regards, evolution is at odds with a literal interpretation of bibli-
cal creation story. There’s just no way around it. Many denominations of
Christianity (as well as other religions), of course, have no problem with the
theory of evolution or with the age of the Earth being a little over 4 billion
years. Maybe, they say, that’s just the way God did things. 
Evolution is a fact that scientists can measure and test. As we further our
understanding of the underlying processes responsible for evolution, we
refine our theories about the details. If these theories ever seem at odds with
particular aspects of religious belief, be assured that that was merely a con-
sequence of following the data and never an intentional goal. The process of
science has no mechanisms for addressing questions of a spiritual nature; it
concerns itself solely with the natural world.
