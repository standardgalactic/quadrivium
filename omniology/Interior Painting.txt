INTERIOR PAINTING  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
No special skills are needed in order to paint and decorate 
successfully - attention to detail is the key to it all. 
  
 
 
Even when working just a couple of feet off the floor, always 
use a strong stepladder - never stand on a chair or other 
'hop-up'. Use protective clothing when necessary. 
  
 
 
Painting is a cheap and easy way to give your home a new 
look. 
  
To get the best results when painting, choose good materials
and equipment; keep brushes and other tools clean and in 
good condition. 
  
Never skimp on preparation work or you'll be disappointed 
with the finished results. Take time to rub down surfaces 
properly and fill cracks and holes neatly. Only start painting 
when surfaces are smooth, clean and dry. 
 
2  - Preparing a room  
Clear as much furniture from the room as possible. 
Whatever has to remain should be gathered in the middle of 
the floor. Vacuum the room thoroughly. Use dustsheets to 
cover furniture and floor coverings.  
 
 
 
Remove all fixtures and fittings from walls and doors. In the 
long run, it is far quicker to do this rather than to try and 
paint around them, which leads to paint runs and smudging 
on the fitting itself. With electrical fittings, turn off the power
before loosening switches, ceiling roses, etc.  
 
 
 
Mask off window-panes and woodwork using masking tape, 
newspaper and polythene dustsheets. 
 
3  - Preparing walls and ceilings  
If there are any damp patches on walls and ceilings, find out 
the cause and remedy it first. There's no point in trying to 
paint over dampness, because it will probably cause the 
paint to flake off quickly and the damp patch will seep 
through again anyway. When the damp patch has dried, it 
should be primed with a damp seal. Watermarks will seep 
through even several coats of emulsion.  
 
 
 
Use sugar soap or mild detergent and a large decorator's 
sponge to wash down all surfaces, starting with the ceiling. 
Rinse thoroughly, but do not saturate the surfaces. Allow to 
dry before painting. Make sure that electrical fittings are 
protected from water. Plaster surfaces tarnished by nicotine 

stains need to be coated with a stain block or nicotine block 
before painting.  
 
 
 
In older houses, you can still find walls and ceilings coated 
with distemper, and paint will not adhere to this. You can tell
if this is the case, because the powdery coating will come off 
when you wash down the surface. Distemper is best 
removed. Wet the distemper thoroughly with water and 
remove with a nylon-scouring pad, or for thicker layers, 
scrape off as much of it as possible. Use a stabilising 
solution over the area to bind any last traces of distemper.  
 
 
 
Ceiling paper that is sound and well adhered can remain and 
be painted. Any loose edges can be stuck back with 
wallpaper adhesive or overlap adhesive and allowed to dry 
before painting. Loose or bubbled paper has to be stripped 
off. Remember that paper may have been applied to a wall 
or ceiling to hide minor cracks that are superficial but 
unsightly. If necessary, you may need to re-paper.  
 
 
 
4  - Cracks and holes 
Use interior filler to fill any 
small cracks and holes in 
plaster. Use a flexible filling 
knife to force the filler into 
the hole (1). 
 
 
 
Leave the filler slightly proud 
of the surface, allow it to dry, 
then rub it smooth with dry 
sandpaper wrapped aroun
wooden block (2). You may 
need to repeat the process in 
some areas for a really 
smooth finish. 
d a 
 
 
 
Larger holes and cracks are more economically filled with 
deep-repair filler, or a plaster filler. Check manufacturer's 
instructions for use - a larger crack may have to be filled in 
a couple of stages. Any loose plaster should be chipped off 
first. Where a surface is sound but covered with a network of
crazed superficial cracks, you can use a textured flexible 
paint, or first hang lining paper. Alternatively, use a textured
wallcovering that is specifically made to be overpainted and 

ideal for uneven walls. 
 
5  - Preparing woodwork 
If existing paintwork is in a sound condition, there is no 
need to strip it off - it will make a good base for the new 
paint. The only exception is where a thick coat of paint is 
causing windows or doors to jam.  
 
 
 
If the paint is to remain, then it should be washed down with
sugar soap and water to remove all traces of dust, grease 
and stains. Rinse thoroughly. 
 
 
 
Rub down the surface with 
medium-grade sandpaper, or 
an orbital sander fitted with a
medium-grade sanding she
(3). This roughens the 
surface, giving a good key fo
the new paint to adhere to. 
Always wear a facemask 
when sanding (please refer to
the section 'Lead in Pain
 
et 
r 
 
t'). 
 
 
 
Finally, wipe over the surface with a lint-free rag moistened 
with white spirit. Use a pointed stick to get the rag into 
corners where dust can be trapped - it may be picked up on 
the brush and spread across the surface to leave a pimply 
effect on the dried paintwork. Don't forget to clean out 
keyholes and the top edges of doors where dirt and dust can 
be picked up on the brush.  
 
 
 
Paintwork that has the odd chip or crack need not be 
stripped off. Fill any chips and holes with interior filler or a 
wood filler and sand it flush with the surface when the filler 
has dried. 
 
 
 
If the paintwork is in bad 
condition and has lots of 
cracks and flaking areas, th

paint by dry sanding, with a 
chemical paint stripper 
with a heat gun (4). Dry

to wear a facemask. Chemical
stripper, in the form o
pastes, gels and liquids, is best where you suspect that the 
old paint may have contained lead. See the section 'L

than using heat, and more costly. A hot-air gun melts the 
thickest paint coat so that it can be scraped off with a shave
hook. It is best to use a chemical stripper near to windows 
where heat can crack the glass. Bare wood should be rubbe
down with medium sandpaper or an electric sander.

9 -  Painting woodwork 
 
Always use a primer on bare wood first to help seal the 
surface. Where a surface has already been painted, use t
undercoat colour recommended by the manufacturers of 
your chosen gloss or satin paint. In some cases it might 
require a second undercoat to completely obliterate the old
paint. It is important that you do this or the colour will show
through the new coat of paint. When each coat has dried

10 - Painting radiators  
 
The best paints to use are special radiator enamels, as 
 
will give you a tough and durable surface that will not 
discolour with the heat. However, solvent-based gloss or 
satin can also be used to good effect. Only paint a radiato

11 - Lead in paint 
 
Up until the mid-sixties, lead was used in some kinds of 
paint, especially those use on wood and metal work. This is 
a hazardous substance, especially for young children and 
pregnant women, and should always be handled with care. 
Lead can be absorbed into the body through the skin or by 
inhalation of dust particles. The danger occurs if the 
paintwork is loose and flaking, or if it is likely to get 
knocked, chewed or scratched by a child or a

If your house was built after the sixties, it is unlikely that
