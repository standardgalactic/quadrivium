About the Author
Patricia Barry is a recognized expert on Medicare and its Part D prescription 
drug coverage. As a senior editor of the AARP Bulletin — the newspaper and 
Web site that serve AARP’s 40 million members — she’s written extensively 
about Medicare from the consumer’s point of view since 1999. That year, she 
went to a press conference at the White House to hear President Bill Clinton 
announce his proposal to add outpatient prescription drugs to Medicare and 
came away thinking: “This story has legs — it’ll run and run.” For the next 
four years, she covered the bitter political battles in Washington that finally 
led to President George W. Bush signing Part D into law in December 2003.
Ever since, Patricia’s mission has been to explain the controversial and compli-
cated benefit to consumers. She’s written numerous articles and guides on navi-
gating Part D for AARP publications and books. Before and after the drug benefit 
went into effect in 2006, she invited readers’ questions and personally answered 
hundreds of them. She continues to do so through the Bulletin’s Web site 
(bulletin.aarp.org). Patricia has directly helped many, many people — 
readers, friends, neighbors, and colleagues’ parents — find the Part D plan that 
suits them best. Those questions and experiences are the foundation of Medicare 
Prescription Drug Coverage For Dummies.
In her long journalism career in Europe and America, Patricia has written 
thousands of newspaper and magazine articles and three books. A native of 
Great Britain, she’s lived since 1985 in Maryland, where she and her husband 
raised three adventurous children — Katerina (currently living in Russia), 
Jessica (in France), and Oliver (in Egypt). In 2006, not without a sense of 
mutinous disbelief, Patricia became a Medicare beneficiary herself.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the hundreds of older or disabled Americans who 
so generously shared their personal Part D stories with me since Medicare 
prescription drug coverage began. You told me what it was like on the front 
lines — experiences that were good, bad, and occasionally downright ugly. 
You prompted me to find answers to questions I hadn’t thought of asking. 
You gave me the motivation to write this book, and I couldn’t have done it 
without your insights. You were the consumer pioneers of Part D. To each 
and every one — a huge thank you!
Author’s Acknowledgments
Writing this book has been a roller coaster grounded by the expertise and 
wisdom of many people who kept me on track. My thanks go to experts at 
two key federal agencies, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and 
the Social Security Administration, who helped me through the labyrinth of 
regulations that govern the Part D program and patiently answered hundreds 
of questions I threw at them. I’m also indebted to experts at the consumer 
help organizations who daily assist Medicare beneficiaries with Part D issues: 
the Medicare Rights Center, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, California 
Healthcare Advocates, and the State Health Insurance Assistance Programs.
I’m especially grateful for the advice and generously shared knowledge of 
many colleagues at AARP: David Gross, Gerry Smolka, Paul Cotton, Ed Dale, 
Lee Rucker, Elinor Ginzler, and, above all, Joyce Dubow, a national expert 
who for many years has been my guru on all things Medicare. I thank my edi-
tors at the AARP Bulletin, Jim Toedtman and Susan Crowley, for their encour-
agement and forbearance when I needed to take time out — and my former 
editors, Elliot Carlson and Bob Hey, who first twisted my arm to take on the 
Bulletin’s Medicare beat.
I’m enormously grateful to my project editor on this book, Georgette Beatty, 
and copy editors Vicki Adang and Jen Tucci at John Wiley & Sons, who have 
been a pleasure to work with. Also to Vicki Gottlich, of the Center for 
Medicare Advocacy, for her profound knowledge of Part D and vigilant eye 
while acting as technical adviser during the book’s draft stages. And to my 
superb agent, Maureen Watts, who got this ball rolling.
Finally, to my children (who urged me on when I felt daunted by the task) and 
to my husband (whose devotion ran to cooking dinner every night for 
months), I can only say: What would I do without you?

Introduction
I
f you’re reading this book, chances are you’re baffled. That’s okay — 
you’re not alone. Since Medicare prescription drug coverage began in 
2006, I’ve heard from multitudes of people trying to get their minds around 
Medicare Part D — the program’s official name — and most often they call 
it “confusing.” In fact, the crispest verdict came from an exceptionally on-
the-ball 93-year-old who’d spent the afternoon swing dancing at a Wisconsin 
senior center. He asked, simply: “Why did they come up with a program I 
couldn’t figure out myself?”
That’s why I’ve written this book. There’s no doubt about it — the Medicare 
drug program is complicated, largely because it comes with a lot of choices. 
Sure, choice is a good thing, but having many options also forces you to 
make more decisions. And to make good decisions — instead of just guess-
ing and hoping for the best — you have to know the angles. That’s where 
Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage For Dummies comes in. It takes you step 
by step through the choices you face and gives you the practical knowledge 
you need to make informed decisions. Consider it a road map for navigating 
the twists and turns in the system so you can figure it out for yourself — and 
with confidence.
Part D is a real benefit. Yes, it could be simpler and better, but it has still 
saved money for millions of people and allowed many to get the meds they 
need for the first time. For 40 years, Medicare didn’t pay for outpatient pre-
scription drugs at all, and during that time, these meds became increasingly 
expensive and more necessary as a medical treatment. But now there’s Part 
D, and the problems are different. Typical questions I hear include:
 
 “There are 52 Medicare drug plans in my area, so how the heck am I supposed 
to choose one?”
 
 “I’ll be getting my meds through my retiree health plan. How will Part D 
affect it?”
 
 “I was tricked into a plan I didn’t want. How do I get out of it?”
 
 “This benefit has saved me a lot of money, but now my plan has stopped 
paying for my drugs entirely. Why?”
This book answers those questions and many more. Yes, taking a whole book 
to explain Part D says a lot about the program’s complexities. But in these 
pages, I try to consider everybody’s circumstances by covering the widest 
possible spectrum of issues. In doing so, I draw on the frontline experiences 
of people like you who’ve grappled with Medicare drug coverage, my own 

2
Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage For Dummies 
experience in helping them, and the knowledge of many experts I’ve 
badgered for answers to the trickiest questions.
So whatever your situation, Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage For Dummies 
offers strategies to cut through the confusions of Part D, either for yourself 
or for someone you’re helping. It explains the program’s ins and outs in plain 
words. It shows you how to avoid or cope with pitfalls and suggests how you 
can lower your costs or find a better deal. Best of all, it convinces you that 
you can — yes, you can — handle Medicare Part D!
About This Book
Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage For Dummies gives you a lot to chew 
on, but don’t worry — you can take small bites. What you personally want 
to read depends on your situation — and on whether you’re using this book 
to help yourself or someone else. But one matter’s certain: If you recognize 
yourself in any of the following scenarios, you can find help in these pages:
 
 You have no insurance for prescription drugs right now (or it’s coming 
to an end), but you’ll soon be going into Medicare and know zip about 
Part D coverage or how to get it.
 
 You do have drug insurance now (from an employer or elsewhere) but 
will soon be eligible for Medicare and need to know whether Part D will 
affect you and whether you should sign up for it.
 
 You’re already in Medicare but haven’t signed up for Part D and are 
wondering whether you should.
 
 You’re already enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan but can use some 
help troubleshooting problems, finding a better deal, or cutting your 
expenses.
 
 You need to know about Part D because you’re helping parents, 
relatives, or friends find the best Medicare drug plan for them.
 
 In your job (or as a volunteer) working with seniors or people with 
disabilities, you can use a plain-language reference to Part D.
Conventions Used in This Book
As you may expect from a program run by a federal bureaucracy, you’re 
going to meet certain unavoidable jargon in this book. This Part D–speak is 
worth getting to know, because notices you receive from Medicare or your 
drug plan — or any to-and-fros you have with either — will be easier to 
understand. So I use the following conventions:

3
 Introduction
 
 New terms in Part D–speak are explained the first time they appear.
 
 When you see the word “Medicare” used on its own, it usually means 
the whole Medicare program. (As in: “When you join Medicare . . .”) 
Sometimes it means the federal agency that runs Medicare. (As in: 
“Medicare may send you a notice . . .”) The agency’s official name, the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is used as the source 
of information in some tables.
 
 The Medicare prescription drug program is referred to interchangeably 
as Part D or Medicare drug coverage. The private plans that provide this 
coverage are referred to as Part D plans or Medicare drug plans.
I also include a few standard conventions to help you navigate this book:
 
 Italics indicate definitions and emphasize certain words.
 
 Boldface text highlights key words in bulleted lists and actions to take in 
numbered steps.
 
 Monofont points out Web and e-mail addresses.
 
 “Quotation marks” generally indicate specific buttons or links you are to 
click on a given Web site.
What You’re Not to Read
Guess what? You can skip the sidebars — chunks of text that appear in nifty 
gray-shaded boxes. They’re not necessary to understanding how to find your 
way through Part D. Still, you may find them interesting. Ever wonder how on 
earth Congress dreamed up some of the more oddball bits of this program? 
You’ll find answers in the sidebars scattered throughout this book.
Foolish Assumptions
This book assumes that you don’t have any working knowledge of the 
Medicare prescription drug program — none, zip, nada. But even if you do, 
you can still find practical insights and useful tips to help you navigate the 
system more quickly, easily, and confidently.
Another point: This book assumes no political standpoints. Part D has always 
been controversial, coming under fire from conservatives and liberals alike. If 
you hold strong opinions, fine — that’s your privilege. But in these pages, the 
only “us versus them” undertone is a bias toward consumers (us) rather than 
government bureaucracies and insurance companies (them). The aim of this 
book is to help you understand and deal with the system as it is now. If you 
want it changed, please tell your members of Congress, not me!

Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage For Dummies has six main parts with 21 
chapters and three appendixes. Just dive into whatever you need to know — 
whether you’re thinking about Medicare drug coverage for the first time, 
you’re already in a Part D plan, or you’re in a special situation, such as having 
a limited income or living in long-term care. You don’t need to read stuff you 
already know, and you don’t have to wade through stuff you don’t need to 
know right now. The following summaries of each part include guidance on 
what you may want to read, according to your own situation.
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare 
Prescription Drug Coverage
This first part begins with a quick run through the essentials of Medicare 
as a whole. This spot’s your first port of call if you’ll soon be going into 
Medicare and need to know if you qualify and how to sign up. Next, I get into 
the nitty-gritty of Part D itself by first looking broadly at the main rules of the 
prescription drug program and how it works. Then I take a closer look at the 
big questions that matter most to your pocketbook and health — costs and 
coverage. These chapters are essential reading if you’re considering Part D 
for the first time.
In this part, too, I provide detailed information about the program-within-a-
program known as Extra Help, which offers much more generous drug 
benefits to people with limited incomes. Head to this chapter if you think you 
can’t afford the premiums and co-payments required in the regular Part D 
program, or if you currently get your meds from Medicaid.
Part II: Deciding Whether 
to Sign Up for Part D
For many people, this crucial question — “Do I really need Part D?” — can 
cause everything from head-scratching to panic attacks. Read this part if you 
already have prescription drug insurance, rely on free or low-cost drugs from 
some other source, or take no or very few meds right now. Here you discover 
how to find out if your current drug coverage is considered better or worse 
than Part D coverage and why this distinction matters. You also find help in 
weighing the consequences of continuing to have no drug coverage when 
you’re eligible for Part D — including hard facts about the late penalty if you 
don’t sign up for Part D at the right time.

5
 Introduction
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in 
the Right Part D Plan for You
Having to pick just one Medicare drug plan — out of more than 50 that are 
available to you, wherever you live — can bring on an acute form of paralysis, 
especially because each plan has different charges and covers a different range 
of drugs than the next one. So this part shows you the best ways to pick the 
plum — meaning the best plan for you — out of a whole lot of apples, oranges, 
and pears. It explains how to compare plans properly in the quickest way and 
why doing so is worth the effort. It also suggests ways to avoid scams and 
hard-sell marketing tactics. Finally, I show you how to enroll in the plan of 
your choice. Check out this part if you’re joining Part D for the first time and if 
you’re already in a Part D plan in November or December and want to know if 
it’ll still be the best one for you next year.
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating 
Part D from the Inside
This part covers a ton of ground — from first receiving your plan’s card right 
through to the end of the year when you’re deciding whether to stay with this 
plan or switch to another. Want to know how to navigate the dreaded dough-
nut hole (formally known as the coverage gap)? Need a drug that your plan 
won’t pay for? Want to cut down your out-of-pocket expenses? Wondering 
how going into a nursing home affects your Part D coverage? Need help in 
challenging a decision your plan has made that you don’t agree with? You 
can find the answers to these questions and many more right here. Consider 
reading much of this part if you’re joining a Medicare drug plan for the first 
time. But if you’ve been in a plan for a while, you may just want to jump into 
the chapter that directly speaks to your particular concern.
Part V: The Part of Tens
From the Ten Commandments to David Letterman’s Top Ten Lists, ten has 
long been the magic number for snappy lists. This part has two ten-point 
lists. Check them out for information you can take in at a glance on two key 
areas — ten ways for boomers to ride to the rescue of loved ones grappling 
with Part D and ten proposed changes to Part D that you should know about.

6
Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage For Dummies 
Part VI: Appendixes
Appendix A offers sample worksheets you can use when comparing Part 
D plans — whether stand-alone drug plans or Medicare Advantage plans. 
Appendix B is your go-to resource for when you need personal help with Part 
D. Look here for the names and contact info of organizations and agencies 
mentioned in this book. Appendix C is your guide to safely buying prescription 
drugs by mail order from abroad. It explains steps you can take to ensure you 
receive genuine products from reputable pharmacies instead of falling prey to 
counterfeit medicines and dubious sellers.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those cute drawings you see in the page margins now and again. 
Here’s what they mean:
 
This icon indicates a situation in which you need your doctor’s help — for 
example, when asking your Part D plan to pay for a medicine it doesn’t usually 
cover, or when finding out whether a lower-cost drug would work just as well 
as the expensive one you’re taking now.
 
This icon signals important info. If you take anything away from this book, it 
should be information highlighted with this icon.
 
This icon draws your attention to on-target advice and practical insights that 
will save you time, effort, and maybe even money.
 
This icon raises a red flag to alert you to a Part D rule or potential pitfall that 
may trip you up if you remain blithely unaware of it.
Where to Go from Here
Nobody expects you to read this book cover to cover. Harry Potter it’s not! 
But you can jump in anywhere to the bit you need, at whatever point you 
happen to be in when grappling with Medicare prescription drug coverage. 
I’m going to whip off the cloak of invisibility to reveal . . . not the Sorcerer’s 
Stone, not the Chamber of Secrets . . . but the practicalities of a system that 
isn’t very mysterious at all — after you know how to navigate it.

Part I
The Nuts and Bolts 
of Medicare 
Prescription Drug 
Coverage

In this part . . .
B
efore you can choose a prescription drug plan, you 
should understand the basics of Medicare Part D 
prescription drug coverage — how it fits into the wider 
Medicare program and, broadly, how it works.
First, for those of you who are just about to join Medicare, 
I give a quick primer on the different parts of the Medicare 
program — Part A (hospital coverage), Part B (doctors 
and outpatient services), Part C (private health plans), 
and Part D (drug coverage) — as well as how to be sure 
you’re eligible for Medicare and how to enroll. Then I give 
an overview of the main rules of Part D so you can get a 
general idea of how Medicare drug coverage works if 
you’re not yet enrolled in the program.
In the remaining chapters of this part, I explain in more 
detail the two topics that probably most concern you at 
this stage — how much you’re likely to spend and save in 
Part D (whether you’re in the regular program or you 
qualify for extra financial help in paying for meds) and 
how your prescription drugs will be covered.

edicare helps pay for your prescription drugs only if you’re in the 
wider Medicare health program. You don’t necessarily have to be 
using its medical services at this time to be eligible for drug coverage; you 
just need to have your very own numbered file in the vast Medicare system.
So with this info in mind, why not begin at the beginning with a quick 
tour through the essentials of Medicare as a whole? If you’re already well 
acquainted with Medicare, you can skip to other chapters for the scoop on 
Medicare prescription drug coverage. But stick around if you’re facing the 
mysteries of Medicare for the first time and need to know whether you qualify, 
how to sign up, and how the different parts of the program — each with its 
own benefits and costs — fit together.
 
This chapter outlines only the basics of Medicare, just enough to get you 
on your way. To find out where to go for more detailed information, turn to 
Appendix B. 
Knowing Your Place in the 
Wide World of Medicare
Medicare is a federal government insurance system, begun in 1966, that helps 
tens of millions of seniors and people with disabilities nationwide pay for 
healthcare. It’s the only national healthcare program — available regardless 
of income or where you live — in the United States, and it’s enduringly popular 
among people who use it.

10
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Medicare doesn’t pay all of your medical bills by any means. Nonetheless, it 
still gives a lot of protection against today’s high healthcare costs if you don’t 
have other health insurance. And unlike other forms of health insurance you 
may have met in the past, you can’t be excluded from Medicare, or pay more 
for it, because of advancing age or the state of your health. How’s that for 
your tax dollars at work?
 
To qualify for Medicare, you must meet certain rules, depending on the following 
circumstances:
 
 If you’re age 65 or older: You qualify for Medicare as soon as you reach 
age 65 if you or your spouse has worked long enough to entitle you to 
Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, even if you’re not yet 
receiving them. You usually need at least 40 credits (amounting to about 
ten years of work) to become eligible for these retirement benefits, 
which are paid through monthly checks. Anyone with enough work 
credits can claim these benefits from the age of 62 onward, though doing 
so means accepting lower payments than when starting at or after full 
retirement age. (For people born between 1943 and 1954, full retirement 
age is now 66.) But remember — even if you claim these benefits early, 
you still have to wait until age 65 to qualify for Medicare.
 
 The annual statement you receive from Social Security says whether 
you qualify for Medicare or, if you’re not eligible yet, when you will be. If 
you lose your statement, call Social Security at 800-772-1213 to ask for a 
replacement.
 
 If you’re younger than 65 and have disabilities: You’re entitled to 
Medicare at any age if you have a severe illness, injury, or disability 
that prevents you from earning more than a certain amount of money 
each month and you’ve received Social Security disability benefits for at 
least 24 months. These months need not be consecutive. Anyone diag-
nosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS) 
doesn’t have to wait 24 months to join Medicare. If you think you may 
qualify and want to find out the earnings limits that apply to your cir-
cumstances, call Social Security at 800-772-1213 or go to www.ssa.gov.
 
 If you have permanent kidney failure: You’re entitled to Medicare at 
any age if you have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) — usually defined 
as needing a kidney transplant or regular dialysis — and if you or your 
spouse has paid into Social Security through work for a certain length 
of time. This period depends on how old you are. For specific eligibility 
information, visit www.ssa.gov or call Social Security at 800-772-1213.
 
 If you don’t qualify for Medicare: If you’re 65 or older but don’t have 
enough work credits, you may be able to buy into the system by paying 
premiums. You can buy in only if you’re an American citizen or a legal 
resident (green card holder) who has lived in this country continuously 
for at least five years. The premiums for Medicare Part A (hospital insur-
ance) are pretty hefty for people who don’t qualify for Medicare — the 
amount varies depending on how many work credits you have — but 
they’re probably less expensive than insurance you can buy yourself. 

11
 Chapter 1: The ABCs (And D) of Medicare
Purchasing Medicare Part A makes you eligible for other Medicare ben-
efits, like prescription drug coverage. If you work long enough to earn 
enough credits to qualify for Medicare in the future, you no longer have 
to pay Part A premiums.
Now you know the general guidelines. Of course, the fine print of Medicare 
rules and regulations deals with many specific situations, but I avoid this 
nitty-gritty here because you’ll find out where you stand when you go to sign 
up for Medicare. (I explain how to enroll later in this chapter.) If you want 
more detailed information, contact the sources listed at the end of this chapter.
Examining Costs and Coverage 
in Medicare’s Four Parts
Medicare has never been a single unified program in which you pay just one 
premium to belong and a certain amount for each medical service you use. 
Instead, Medicare evolved over time and now has four parts, each covering 
different types of medical care and requiring different payments. The follow-
ing sections are a brief overview that outlines what you pay and what you get 
in return. Here’s where you dive into the Medicare alphabet soup and learn 
your ABCs all over again!
Part A
Part A is insurance that pays most of your costs when you’re a patient in a 
hospital and also, in some circumstances, if you’re in a skilled nursing facility 
or hospice, or are receiving treatment from a home healthcare agency. When 
you turn 65 and have enough work credits, as described in the previous 
section, you instantly qualify for Part A.
But wait! There’s more good news: If you’re eligible for Medicare, you pay no 
monthly premium charges for Part A. (That’s because you, or your spouse, 
already paid payroll taxes for Medicare in a job.) Services received through 
Part A, however, aren’t free; you pay a share of the costs when using them. 
For example, when you go into the hospital, you pay the first chunk of 
expenses until you meet the deductible, an amount set by law that usually 
goes up every year ($1,024 in 2008).
This amount isn’t an annual deductible. Instead, it applies to every benefit 
period — the time you’re treated in the hospital for a particular spell of 
illness or injury. After you’ve met the deductible, Medicare pays 100 percent 
of covered costs for a stay of up to 60 days (which need not be consecu-
tive). After that, you pay a share of the costs ($256 a day in 2008) from Day 
61 to Day 90. (If you need extra days, you can use up to 60 lifetime reserve 
days that Medicare allows for additional coverage over the rest of your life. 

12
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
The co-pay for these days, in 2008, is $512.) If you go into the hospital for 
a different illness or injury, you start a new benefit period and again pay 
the deductible before coverage kicks in and the payment cycle starts over. 
There’s no limit to the number of benefit periods you can use.
Part A covers the following inpatient services:
 
 A semiprivate room.
 
 Regular nursing care.
 
 All meals provided directly by the hospital or nursing facility.
 
 Other services provided directly by the hospital or nursing facility, 
including lab tests, prescription drugs, medical appliances, and 
rehabilitation therapies.
 
 A temporary stay (up to 100 days) in a nursing home or hospital under 
the skilled nursing facility benefit. This benefit is available only when 
nursing or rehabilitation care is necessary following at least three days 
in the hospital with a related illness or injury.
 
Part A doesn’t cover the cost of a private room (unless one is medically 
necessary), private nurses, or nice-to-have conveniences such as a telephone 
or television. Except for the skilled nursing facility benefit, Part A doesn’t 
cover the costs of living in a nursing home. (I explain this benefit, and nursing 
home care, in more detail in Chapter 18.)
Part B
Part B is insurance that helps you pay to see a doctor and use services out-
side of a hospital or nursing facility. Part B is voluntary, meaning you can 
choose whether you want it and, depending on your circumstances, when to 
sign up.
 
If you’re 65 or older, you can purchase Part B coverage even if you don’t 
qualify for Part A. To do so, you must be an American citizen or a legal 
resident who has lived in the U.S. continuously for five years.
Part B requires you to pay a monthly premium, even if you or your spouse 
paid taxes for Medicare while working. The Part B premium amount is set 
annually ($96.40 a month in 2008) and generally goes up from year to year. 
Most people pay the same premium. However, those with high incomes 
(more than $82,000 a year in 2008) pay more, and those with very low 
incomes may receive state help for paying these premiums, if they qualify. 
Part B also requires you to pay an annual deductible, determined by law 
($135 in 2008), which is the out-of-pocket amount you pay for medical care 
at the beginning of the year before coverage kicks in. You also have to pay 
a share of the cost of services that Medicare covers — usually 20 percent of 
the bill, though some services (such as outpatient mental health care) cost 
more, and some (such as approved home healthcare) cost less.

13
 Chapter 1: The ABCs (And D) of Medicare
Wondering what you get for this voluntary coverage? Part B covers
 
 Approved medical and surgical services from any doctor who accepts 
Medicare patients, whether provided in a doctor’s office, hospital, 
long-term care facility, or at home, anywhere in the nation
 
 Diagnostic and lab tests done outside hospitals and nursing facilities
 
 A certain number of preventive services and screenings, such as flu 
shots and mammograms
 
 Some medical equipment (for example, wheelchairs and walkers)
 
 Some outpatient hospital treatment received in an emergency room, 
clinic, or ambulatory surgical unit
 
 Inpatient prescription drugs given in a hospital or doctor’s office, 
usually by injection (such as chemotherapy drugs for cancer)
 
 Some coverage for physical, occupational, and speech therapies
 
 Outpatient mental health care (copay of 50 percent in 2008 reducing to 
20 pecent by 2014)
 
 Approved home health services not covered by Part A
A wide range of medical services, such as dental, vision, and hearing care 
(including hearing aids); routine checkups; and outpatient prescription 
drugs, falls outside Part B’s coverage zone. Fortunately, outpatient prescrip-
tion drug coverage is exactly what Part D is for!
Part C
In the previous two sections, I outline costs and coverage under traditional 
or original Medicare, which earned the name because it follows the basic 
design of the program originally laid out in 1965. It’s also called fee-for-service 
Medicare because each provider — whether a doctor, hospital, laboratory, 
medical equipment supplier, or whatever — is paid a fee for each service.
But Medicare also offers an alternative to the traditional program in the form 
of a range of health plans that mainly provide managed care. These plans 
are run by private companies, which decide each year whether to stay in the 
program. Medicare pays plans a fixed fee for everyone who joins the plans, 
regardless of how much or little healthcare a person actually uses. This 
health plan program is called Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Part C.
In most cases, you pay a monthly premium for a Medicare Advantage (MA) 
plan — with the amount varying from plan to plan — on top of the regular 
Medicare Part B premium. Some plans, however, don’t charge an extra 

14
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
premium, and a few also pay all or some of the Part B premium for their 
members. You pay a share of the costs of hospital and outpatient services. 
These co-pays vary from plan to plan and are usually different than those 
required in traditional Medicare.
MA plans must cover all services covered by Part A and Part B in the 
traditional Medicare program. They may also offer extra services that 
Medicare doesn’t cover — for example, dental and eye care. Most plans 
include prescription drug coverage as part of their package.
 
Unlike traditional Medicare, your choice of doctors and hospitals under most 
MA plans is likely to be limited to those in the plan’s provider network and to 
the plan’s local service area. You also pay more if you go out of network. In a 
medical emergency, however, the plan must cover the treatment you receive 
from any doctor or hospital.
Part D
Part D is insurance for outpatient prescription drugs — meaning medications 
you take yourself, instead of having them administered in a hospital or doctor’s 
office — that Medicare began offering in 2006. Like Part C, this program is run 
entirely through many private plans approved by Medicare, each of which 
has different costs and benefits. You can get Part D through stand-alone plans 
(which cover only prescription drugs and are used mainly by people in 
traditional Medicare) or through Medicare Advantage health plans that 
include drug coverage. But I don’t dwell on Part D here, because the rest of 
this book explores the program in detail.
Comparing different types 
of Medicare insurance
All the different kinds of insurance under Medicare are enough to blow any-
body’s mind. (Would you believe there’s another? Medicare supplementary 
insurance isn’t a government program, but it can be bought to fill in some 
of the gaps in Medicare, as I explain in the later section “Lowering Costs 
and Adding Benefits.”) Consequently, it isn’t surprising people get confused 
about what each means and what the difference is between them.
Table 1-1 helps cut through the confusion by briefly describing coverage, 
provider details, and pros and cons for each kind of Medicare insurance, 
including the types of Medicare Advantage plans you’re most likely to 
encounter. Note: Two types of Medicare Advantage plans aren’t included 
here: Special Needs Plans (SNP) and Medicare Medical Savings Account Plans 
(MSAs), both of which restrict enrollment to certain groups of people.

 Chapter 1: The ABCs (And D) of Medicare
Getting with the Program: When and 
How to Sign Up for Parts A and B
Don’t panic if your 65th birthday is looming and you haven’t a clue about 
how to sign up for Medicare — or even whether you should. You’re not 
alone. Remember how you dived into a state of denial when you turned 50? 
Now you’re 15 years further on, but you still haven’t given much thought to 
Medicare, an even bigger psychological milestone — until now. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain when to sign up at the time that’s right for you and 
walk you through the process of enrolling.
It’s all in the timing: When to sign up
You can (and should) sign up for at least Medicare Part A — hospital insur-
ance — around the time you turn 65, whatever your circumstances (even if 
you’re still working, have health insurance from your employer, or haven’t 
yet begun to draw Social Security retirement payments). It costs nothing to 
enroll, and you have no premiums to pay. But even if you don’t need any 
Medicare coverage right now, simply getting your name in the system as 
soon as possible may ensure a smoother ride later on if and when you decide 
you want (or need) to sample more of Medicare’s offerings.
When to enroll in Medicare and what services you decide to sign up for 
depend on your circumstances. This section covers the possibilities.
You already receive Social Security benefits
When I say “Social Security benefits” here, I’m referring to Social Security 
benefits for retirement, dependents, and survivors — or similar benefits for 
Railroad Retirement. If you’re already receiving any of these benefits and 
haven’t yet turned 65, you don’t need to sign up for Medicare. In this case, 
Social Security automatically enrolls you in Medicare Part A and Part B, and 
you receive your Medicare card in the mail. Coverage starts on your 65th 
birthday. The same automatic enrollment takes place if you’ve been getting 
Social Security disability benefits for two years, regardless of your age.
 
In both situations, you have the right to cancel Part B coverage if you 
don’t want it (for example, if you already receive medical coverage from an 
employer or union health plan). But if you’re considering canceling because 
the Part B premium is more than you can afford, you may want to apply for 
your state’s Medicare Savings Program. If you qualify, the state pays your Part 
B premium, and you automatically become eligible for low-cost prescription 
drug coverage under Part D’s Extra Help program, as explained in depth in 
Chapter 5.

18
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
You don’t receive Social Security benefits yet
If you don’t receive Social Security benefits by the time you’re 65, you need 
to apply to enroll in Medicare. Timing is very important here because you 
have a seven-month window, or initial enrollment period, to sign up. It begins 
three months before the month in which you turn 65 and ends three months 
after your birthday month. So if you’re going to celebrate 65 years on June 22, 
you can sign up any time between March 1 and September 30.
 
Sooner is better than later. If you enroll early, your coverage starts the month 
you turn 65. If you wait until after your birthday, it begins on the first day of 
the month after you enroll.
 
If you don’t sign up for Medicare Part B when you first become eligible, you 
have to pay a late penalty when you do eventually sign up. (The exception is 
if you’re still working and have group health insurance from an employer or 
union that’s primary to Medicare, meaning that your group plan pays your 
medical bills first.) A late penalty means paying more for Part B in the form 
of permanently higher premiums — 10 percent higher for every year you 
could’ve had Part B but didn’t. After your personal deadline for joining Part 
B has passed, you can sign up only during a general enrollment period from 
January 1 to March 31 each year. Your coverage then begins July 1.
You have no other health insurance
If you don’t currently have health insurance, you’ll need Medicare for all of 
your medical coverage. So you’ll probably want to sign up for both Part A 
(hospital insurance) and Part B (insurance for doctor visits and outpatient 
services). You should sign up for these programs during your seven-month 
initial enrollment period around the time of your 65th birthday (see the pre-
ceding section). If you don’t sign up for Part B during this time but decide to 
do so later, you’ll pay a late penalty.
You work and have group health insurance
If you’re still working after the age of 65 and have group health insurance 
from your employer or union, check with your benefits administrator to find 
out whether this coverage is primary or secondary to Medicare. Primary 
means your own insurance pays your medical bills first; secondary means 
Medicare pays first and your insurance pays for certain services that 
Medicare doesn’t cover. So how does this explanation relate to your specific 
situation? Here are your options:
 
 If your insurance is secondary: You should sign up for Medicare Part 
B within your seven-month initial enrollment period (see the earlier 
section “You don’t receive Social Security benefits yet”). In fact, your 
employer or union health plan will probably insist on it as a condition 
for continuing your current coverage. (If your employer has fewer than 
20 employees and you are 65 or older, your health plan is automatically 
secondary to Medicare.)

19
 Chapter 1: The ABCs (And D) of Medicare
 
 If your insurance is primary: You don’t need to sign up for Part B 
at this time. However, when you sign up for Part A, make sure that 
Medicare documents that you have primary coverage from elsewhere. 
In the future, if you lose your employer or union coverage, you’ll need 
Medicare to know that you once had it so you can enroll in Part B at that 
time without incurring a late penalty. If you do lose your current cover-
age, you’ll have eight months to sign up for Part B, starting from the end 
of the month in which you lose coverage. As long as you sign up within 
this period (or earlier), you won’t pay a late penalty, and you’ll still have 
guaranteed access to Medigap insurance. (I explain guaranteed access 
to Medigap later in this chapter.)
You no longer work but have retiree health insurance
After you retire, consider signing up for Part B, even if you still have health 
insurance from your former employer or union under a retiree plan. Yes, 
this precaution probably means paying two premiums — and of course you 
have the right not to join Part B if you don’t want to (unless your employer 
or union insists on it as a condition of your retiree coverage). But if at some 
future date you lose or drop your retiree benefits and need to sign up for Part 
B at that time, you’ll have to pay a late penalty. You won’t incur a late penalty 
if you join Part B within eight months of retiring from your job.
You don’t qualify for Part A
If you don’t qualify for Part A’s hospital insurance, you may be able to buy 
into the system by paying a premium for this coverage (see the earlier sec-
tion “Knowing Your Place in the Wide World of Medicare”). Regardless of 
what you choose to do with Part A, you can still get outpatient medical 
coverage under Part B as long as you’re 65 or older and an American citizen 
or have lived in the U.S. as a legal resident for at least five years. To receive 
this benefit, you simply pay the same premium, deductibles, and co-pays as 
anyone else. To join the Part B party, and avoid a late penalty, enroll at one 
of the following times:
 
 During the seven-month initial enrollment period around the time of 
your 65th birthday if you have no other health coverage, or if your 
current coverage is secondary to Medicare
 
 Within eight months of losing your current health coverage, if it’s 
primary to Medicare
 
 Within eight months of retiring from a current job that provides retiree 
health benefits
You live outside the United States
If you have enough Social Security credits to qualify for Medicare, you should 
file for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) around your 65th birthday if 
you live outside the U.S. You can’t use this insurance abroad, but, after all, 
it doesn’t cost you anything to sign up. To do so, contact the U.S. embassy 
or consulate in the country you’re living in — or the Department of Veterans 
Affairs’s regional office if you live in the Philippines.

20
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Deciding whether to buy Part B (doctor and outpatient services) may be 
trickier. If you’re still working and have primary group health insurance from 
your employer, you don’t need to join Part B yet. But if you don’t have such 
insurance (or are perhaps relying on the public health service of the nation 
where you live) or are retired, you have two options:
 
 Sign up for Part B when you turn 65 and pay the required premiums 
— even though you won’t be able to get Part B medical services while 
living abroad.
 
 Delay signing up after you turn 65 and incur a late penalty if you join 
Part B after moving back to the U.S.
Taking the plunge: How to sign up
When you don’t automatically qualify for Medicare — that is, if you’re not 
already receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement payments — you must 
apply for the program. All you have to do is make one toll-free phone call to 
the Social Security Administration (not Medicare) at 800-772-1213. A customer 
representative will ask for your Social Security number and will give you the 
choice of signing up for Medicare directly on the phone or making an appoint-
ment for you to visit your local Social Security office. Signing up on the phone 
is simpler, but you need to send important documents (such as your birth cer-
tificate or passport and, if you’re not an American citizen, proof of legal 
residence) to Social Security through the mail. If this process unnerves you, 
you can take the documents with you to an office appointment. The represen-
tative you initially speak with schedules the appointment and gives you the 
address of the nearest Social Security office.
During this interview, whether on the phone or in person, you can discuss 
your Medicare needs — such as whether you want to sign up for Part B right 
now — and whether you want to start receiving Social Security payments as 
soon as you’re eligible. The customer representative then answers your ques-
tions and enters your information into the computer system. A week or two 
later, you’ll receive your Medicare card in the mail. The card indicates which 
benefits (Part A alone, or Part A and Part B) you’ve signed up for. With your 
card, you’ll also receive a copy of your information that’s been entered into 
the Medicare system. If any details are wrong, call the phone number listed in 
your mailing to have them changed.
Lowering Costs and Adding Benefits
Medicare has a whole slew of out-of-pocket expenses and doesn’t cover all 
medical services. What, if anything, can you do to lower costs and get more 
benefits? These sections break down your possible options, depending on 
various circumstances.

21
 Chapter 1: The ABCs (And D) of Medicare
Medicare supplementary insurance 
(also known as Medigap)
Medicare supplementary insurance is not a government program offered by 
Medicare. It’s a separate private insurance you can purchase for an addi-
tional monthly premium to fill in some of the gaps in traditional Medicare, 
which is why it’s often called Medigap. Depending on the kind of policy you 
buy, Medigap covers out-of-pocket expenses in Medicare, such as deductibles 
and co-pays, and may cover extra services (for example, at-home recovery 
after hospitalization and emergency treatment abroad). Medigap features 12 
standard policies, designated A through L, each offering a different range of 
coverage options — the more options, the more expensive the policy. These 
policies are sold by many insurance companies at varying premiums. You 
can compare benefits and costs online at www.medicare.gov or by calling 
Medicare at 800-633-4227.
 
The best time to buy Medigap insurance is within six months of signing up for 
Medicare Part B, because this timing gives you significant consumer protec-
tions. During the six-month window, you have a guaranteed right to buy any 
Medigap policy sold in the state where you live. In other words, you can’t be 
turned down because of poor health or any pre-existing medical conditions. 
Nor can you be charged higher premiums based on your age. You get this 
window, with all of its guarantees, regardless of when you enroll in Part B, 
even if you sign up late for Part B.
 
Other factors may affect your decision to purchase Medigap insurance:
 
 You can’t use Medigap if you’re in a Medicare Advantage health plan. So 
if you enroll in one of these plans immediately after joining Part B, you 
lose your right to buy Medigap with guaranteed protections. (However, 
you may be able to get this right back if you leave the MA plan within 
your first year in Medicare or if you gave up a Medigap policy to join 
an MA plan for the first time. I explain the details of these exceptions in 
Chapter 17.)
 
 No Medigap policies sold after 2005 include drug coverage, and you 
can’t use them to cover out-of-pocket expenses in Part D.
Medicare Advantage plans (Part C)
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans may have lower costs and offer more ben-
efits than traditional Medicare. Depending on the plan, lower costs may 
include zero premiums, a reduced hospital deductible, a flat co-pay (for 
example, $10 or $20) rather than 20 percent coinsurance for each doctor 
visit, and a cap on out-of-pocket expenses in a calendar year. Extra benefits 
may include coverage for vision or hearing services, emergency treatment 

22
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
abroad, or exercise programs. However, some plans charge higher costs than 
traditional Medicare for some services and offer only minimal extra benefits. 
Also, you need to recognize that most MA plans limit the choice of doctors and 
hospitals and may not cover treatment outside of their service area, except in 
emergencies. (I compare MA plans with traditional Medicare in Chapter 9.)
Veterans benefits
If you qualify for federal health benefits from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA), you can use them in addition to, or instead of, Medicare. You 
can also decide which benefits to use for each medical service you need. 
If you choose the VA for treatment, you must obtain your treatment at a 
VA facility. Medicare doesn’t pay for care at VA facilities but does pay for 
Medicare-covered medical services that you obtain elsewhere. If you’re a vet-
eran with a low income or a high enough service-related disability rating, you 
may qualify for free VA care. Whether you’re eligible for free care or not, you 
should consider signing up for Medicare in case you need future services that 
the VA can’t provide or you have to travel too far to get to a VA facility. For 
more info, call 877-222-8387 or visit www.va.gov/healtheligibility.
Medicaid
Medicaid is a healthcare program for low-income people and is adminis-
tered by each state, which shares the costs with the federal government. 
(In some states it has a different name — for example, MediCal in California, 
MassHealth in Massachusetts, and TennCare in Tennessee.) Eligibility 
depends on the level of your income and savings and varies among the 
states. If you qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, you should pay little 
or nothing for medical treatment — because Medicaid covers Medicare’s 
out-of-pocket expenses — and you have coverage for broader benefits, such 
as nursing home care. In addition, you automatically qualify for low-cost 
prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D’s Extra Help program. 
(Extra Help is covered in detail in Chapter 5.) To find out whether you qualify 
for Medicaid and how to apply, call your State Health Insurance Assistance 
Program (SHIP). See Appendix B for the local number to call.
State Medicare savings programs
If you don’t qualify for Medicaid, but the Medicare Part B premiums and other 
costs are still more than you can afford, you may be eligible for help from your 
state to pay for them. Getting this assistance depends on your income level 
and any savings you may have. If you qualify, you also automatically receive 
the full Extra Help benefit under Part D, which provides prescription drug cov-
erage at low cost. Call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) 
to find out whether you qualify for a Medicare savings program and how to 
apply. (SHIP contact information is in Appendix B.)

n Chapter 1, I introduce you to the general Medicare program, but from 
this chapter forward, I focus on the Medicare prescription drug program 
(also known as Part D). In later chapters, I outline the decisions you’ll likely 
face in getting drug coverage and how to find the best deal that suits your 
situation. And I delve into a lot of details on different aspects of Part D. But 
first, here’s the big picture — a broad view of how the program basically 
works. If you’re new to Part D, this framework helps you more easily grasp 
the specific information that you find out later in this book.
Qualifying for Medicare Prescription 
Drug Coverage
 
Everyone in Medicare is entitled to Part D drug coverage. As long as you’re 
enrolled in Medicare Part A or Part B — it doesn’t matter which — or both, 
you qualify for Part D. That’s true whether you’re in Medicare because of your 
age (65 or over) or because you have disabilities.

24
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
 
It doesn’t matter whether you’re rich or poor or somewhere in between. 
You’re entitled to Part D regardless of your income or how much money you 
have in the bank or invested in the stock market or stashed under the mat-
tress. However, if your income is low, you may also qualify for a special part 
of the program known as Extra Help. As its name implies, this part offers much 
more generous drug benefits and lower costs than the regular Part D program. 
To get Extra Help, your income and savings are taken into consideration and 
must be under a certain level, as explained in detail in Chapter 5.
The state of your health isn’t taken into account to enroll in Part D either. 
Unlike many other types of private health insurance, there’s no such thing 
as a pre-existing condition in Part D (just as there is none in Medicare as a 
whole). You can’t be denied coverage because of any illness or disability that 
you have now or had in the past, no matter how severe, or because you take 
a large number of drugs or very expensive ones right now.
Voluntary Enrollment and 
All the Strings Attached
You get to choose whether you want Medicare drug coverage. Well, that’s 
true for most people. The exception would be if you’re now getting your 
prescription drugs from Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays the 
medical costs of people with very low incomes. In that case, you’ll be auto-
matically switched to Part D (and receive Extra Help) to help pay for your 
drugs as soon as you become eligible for Medicare, as explained in Chapter 5. 
For everyone else, enrolling in Part D is voluntary.
The folks who tend to be the most anxious about Part D are those who already 
have prescription drug insurance from elsewhere, such as an employer or 
union’s health plan, or retiree benefits that cover medications. Let me give 
some reassurance here. You won’t need to join Part D if you have such cover-
age and that coverage is what Medicare calls creditable —meaning Medicare 
considers it at least as good as Part D. But you’d be wise to check that your 
current coverage is, in fact, creditable. Also, some employers require retirees 
to take Part D at age 65 and may or may not contribute toward their out-of-
pocket expenses. (Chapter 6 goes into all the angles on how Part D fits in with 
employer- or union-sponsored drug coverage.)
 
The outlook is different if your other insurance is not creditable, or if you have 
no coverage for drugs at all. Here’s where the strings are attached. You still 
have the right to turn your back on Part D, but doing so means you have to 
pay more for your coverage if you decide to join Part D in the future. Medicare 
rules say that people without creditable coverage who sign up for Part D later 
than when they first become eligible for the benefit must pay a late penalty in 
the form of permanently higher premiums. (I explain the late penalty more 
fully in Chapter 8.)

25
 Chapter 2: The Rules of the Game: How Part D Works
The late penalty is a powerful incentive (as Medicare intends it to be) for 
enrolling in Medicare drug coverage at the right time. What the “right time” is 
for you depends on when you first become eligible for Part D, which in turn 
depends on your circumstances. The best time to enroll may be when
 
 You first sign up for Medicare
 
 You lose your current creditable drug coverage, or decide to drop it
 
 You return to live permanently in the United States after living abroad
Each of these situations comes with a time limit for signing up for Part D 
without incurring the late penalty, as explained in more detail in Chapter 8.
Picking a Plan, Any Plan — 
but Only One
In earlier sections, I talk about signing up for Part D as though it were a 
simple one-step operation. It isn’t. There’s no single Medicare drug plan. 
Instead, the program is run through many private insurance plans that 
Medicare has approved to offer drug coverage. To get coverage, you must 
join one of them.
There are scores of these private drug plans servicing any given area of the 
country. Some are called stand-alone plans because they provide only drug 
coverage and are mainly used by people in traditional Medicare. Others are 
Medicare Advantage health plans that provide medical services and prescrip-
tion drugs. Each plan differs from the next in the fees it charges, the range of 
drugs it covers, and its overall benefit design. So you have plenty of choices. 
But when it comes to picking a plan, this isn’t a straightforward, apples-to-
apples comparison. It’s more like comparing apples to oranges to pineapples, 
with maybe a few lemons thrown in. Nonetheless, you have to choose just one.
Not surprisingly, people find this aspect of Part D the most daunting. Even if 
you’ve had employer health coverage in the past and are used to comparing 
plans, it’s safe to say that you’ve never faced such a huge number of choices 
before — there could be well over 50 plans available to you, wherever you 
live. But please don’t let this put you off. It’s possible to drill down and find 
the plan that most meets your needs in a relatively short time, if you know 
how to go about it. You can find all sorts of helpful information on how to 
do this — including a step-by-step guide for comparing plans properly and 
to your best advantage — in Chapters 9 and 10. Chapter 11 shows you how 
to be on your guard against scams and hard-sell marketing tactics. And in 
Chapter 12, I walk you through the process of actually signing up for a plan.

Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Making Sense of Drug Coverage That 
Can Vary throughout the Year
Bizarre as it sounds, you may find yourself paying different amounts for the 
same medicines at different times of the year. That’s because Medicare drug 
coverage is generally divided into four phases over the course of a calendar 
year. Whether you encounter only one phase, two, three, or all four depends 
mainly on the overall cost of the drugs you take during the year. Here’s how it 
works:
 
 Phase 1, the deductible: This is a period in which you may pay full 
price for your drugs until the cost reaches a limit set by law ($275 in 
2008, $295 in 2009) and drug coverage actually begins. Many plans don’t 
charge deductibles. But if your plan has one, this period begins on 
January 1, or whenever you start using your Medicare drug coverage.
 
 Phase 2, the initial coverage period: This begins when you’ve met 
the deductible, if there is one. Otherwise, it begins on January 1, or 
whenever you start using Medicare drug coverage. You then pay the 
co-payments required by your plan for each prescription, your share 
being roughly 25 percent of the drug’s cost. This period ends when the 
total cost of your drugs — what you have paid plus what your plan has 
paid — reaches a certain dollar limit set by law ($2,510 in 2008, $2,700 in 
2009).
 
 Phase 3, the coverage gap: This gap — often called the doughnut hole 
— begins if and when you reach the dollar limit of Phase 2. You then 
pay 100 percent of the price of your drugs until your total out-of-pocket 
expenses reach another dollar limit set by law ($4,050 in 2008, $4,350 
in 2009). This amount includes your deductible (if any), your co-pays 
during the initial coverage period, and what you paid for your drugs 
during the gap.
 
 Phase 4, catastrophic coverage: If your drug costs are high enough to 
take you through the gap, coverage begins again. And here, at last, is the 
good news — your payments then drop sharply. In this period, 
co-pays are small and set by law: $2.25 per prescription for generic 
drugs and $5.60 per prescription for brand-name drugs in 2008, or $2.40 
and $6.00 in 2009, or 5 percent of each drug’s price (whichever is the 
greater amount). Catastrophic coverage ends on December 31. The fol-
lowing day, January 1, you return to Phase 1 (or Phase 2 if your plan has 
no deductible), and the whole cycle starts over again.
Table 2-1 is a quick way of looking at the same progression.

What you see in Table 2-1 is the basic design for minimum Medicare drug 
coverage that Congress dreamed up and set in law. No drug plan can offer less 
than this coverage. However, drug plans often vary this design, as explained 
in Chapter 3. Many charge no, or lower, deductibles. Some plans charge less 
than 25 percent of the cost for some drugs and more than 25 percent for 
others. And some plans provide partial or full coverage during the gap, usually 
for a higher monthly premium. You can find a lot of detailed information about 
the coverage gap — including how to tell whether you’ll fall into it and some 
ideas for avoiding it or softening its impact — in Chapters 15 and 16.
No plans limit the amount for catastrophic coverage. If you reach that level, 
you continue paying the same low costs until the end of the year, no matter 
how many drugs you use or how high the cost becomes.
 
If your income is limited and you qualify for Extra Help (as explained in 
Chapter 5), you’ll pay far less than the costs shown in Table 2-1, and you’ll 
receive continuous coverage throughout the year. People enrolled in Extra 
Help don’t face the doughnut hole.

28
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Getting Coverage for 
the Drugs You Take
You may assume that all Medicare drug plans cover any prescription 
medicine that you need. Well, maybe they do and maybe they don’t. No drug 
plan covers every drug — though every plan has to cover at least two drugs 
out of several that are used to treat a particular medical condition — and 
some plans cover a much wider range than others. Each plan has its own 
formulary — that is, the list of drugs the plan will pay for.
 
What if the plan you choose doesn’t cover all of your drugs? You’ll need your 
doctor’s help here. She may decide that a different drug that is on the plan’s 
formulary will work just as well for your medical condition. Or, if your doctor 
wants to keep you on your present medication, she can help you ask the plan 
to cover that particular drug for you as an exception to its policy. If the plan 
turns down your request, you have the right to appeal against its decision.
I explain all these coverage issues (and more) in detail in Chapter 4.
Paying for Your Drugs and 
Filling Your Prescriptions
To get drug coverage under Part D you’ll likely pay a monthly premium to the 
Medicare drug plan that you choose. (However, some Medicare Advantage 
health plans that offer drug coverage don’t charge a premium; see Chapter 9 
for details.) You may have to meet a deductible, if your plan has one, before 
coverage starts. You’ll also pay a share of the cost of each prescription you 
fill. Your share may be in the form of a co-payment (a flat dollar amount) or 
coinsurance (a percentage of the cost of the drug).
If you compare plans properly — that is, according to the medications you 
take — you’ll notice a lot of variation in the co-pays that different plans 
charge for the same drug. What’s more, even within one plan you can pay 
different co-pays for different drugs. Why and how this happens — plus tips 
for using the system to your advantage — is explained in Chapter 3.
You can fill your prescriptions at local pharmacies that are in your plan’s 
network — meaning that they have a business relationship with the plan. 
Going to pharmacies outside the network means you pay more for your 
drugs. Most plans also give you the choice of getting 90-day supplies from a 
mail-order service, often for a lower price.

29
 Chapter 2: The Rules of the Game: How Part D Works
How does the pharmacy know what to charge you? After all, your payments 
can vary according to
 
 The Part D plan you’re enrolled in
 
 What phase of coverage you’re in (deductible, initial coverage period, 
coverage gap, or catastrophic coverage; see the “Making Sense of Drug 
Coverage That Can Vary throughout the Year” section, earlier in this 
chapter, for details)
 
 Whether you receive the Extra Help benefit (see Chapter 5)
 
 Whether you have other coverage (for example, from an employer or a 
State Pharmacy Assistance Program) that coordinates with Part D (see 
Chapter 6)
The answer is that your plan’s ID card is the key that should unlock these 
mysteries. Scanned through the pharmacy’s computer, it accesses a database 
that tells the pharmacist the amount you’re required to pay each time you 
fill a prescription. These pharmacy issues (including what to do if the system 
fails to work properly) are explained in Chapter 14.
Being Locked into One Plan for a Year
After you’re enrolled in a Medicare drug plan, you have to stay in that plan 
for the whole year (or the rest of the year if you first join Medicare sometime 
during the year) except in special circumstances, which are described in 
Chapter 17.
During the calendar year, the plan can’t change its overall design or the 
amount of its premium and deductible. Those must stay exactly as they were 
at the beginning of the year. The plan can change the prices it charges for 
drugs, but it must also conform to certain Medicare rules that give some 
protection to consumers. Chapter 3 goes into this in more detail.
 
At the end of the calendar year, plans can change anything they please for the 
following year — their benefit design, their premiums, the drugs they cover, 
and their co-pays. Most plans do, in fact, make changes, so it’s important to 
read the notice that your plan must send you each fall (usually in October) 
informing you of any changes, as explained in Chapter 17.
 
Being locked into a plan for a whole year makes it all the more critical that you 
choose the plan that’s best for you to begin with, as explained in Chapters 9 
and 10. And, if you want to continue being in a plan that gives you the best 
deal, you should be prepared to compare plans every year.

Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
What were they thinking . . . when they made the 
Part D drug benefit so complicated?
Part D was the result of a bitter political battle 
in Congress between lawmakers with opposing 
philosophies. One group (mainly Democrats) 
wanted prescription drug coverage to be run 
by the federal government as a simple add-on 
to Medicare, for which beneficiaries would pay 
an extra premium and uniform co-pays for each 
prescription — a proposal that would’ve cost 
billions of dollars more than Congress was will-
ing to allow. Another group (mainly Republicans) 
argued that a drug benefit offered by compet-
ing private insurance plans would hold down 
costs and give beneficiaries more choice. A 
third group wanted a benefit that would give 
drug coverage only to low-income people. 
And a fourth group didn’t want a drug benefit 
at all, arguing that it would add an expensive 
new entitlement to Medicare that the country 
couldn’t afford.
Underlying all these conflicting views was a 
more fundamental political struggle that had 
been going on for decades. Should Medicare 
continue to be a federal social insurance pro-
gram that gave all eligible Americans the same 
deal, as originally enacted by a Democratic-
controlled Congress and a Democratic 
president, Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1965? Or 
should it become a more “privatized” system 
with a menu of options offered through pri-
vate insurance companies? Prescription drug 
coverage eventually became a bargaining chip 
in that struggle. Most Republican lawmakers 
and some conservative Democrats were will-
ing to add drug coverage to Medicare only if the 
program was overhauled to include many more 
private options.
In late 2003, after years of stormy debate, a 
Republican-controlled Congress narrowly 
voted to pass the Medicare Modernization Act 
— by only five votes in the House and ten in the 
Senate — and a Republican president, George 
W. Bush, signed it into law. The final package 
contained compromises that provoked howls 
of rage from both liberals and conservatives. 
The act established a drug benefit available to 
everyone in Medicare and gave extra help to 
people with low incomes or high drug costs. It 
also gave private insurers a much greater role 
in Medicare than they’d had before, as well as 
large financial incentives to participate in Part D, 
which resulted in far more drug plans entering 
the market than had ever been expected. These 
trade-offs created a program so complicated 
that the original legislation ran to 681 pages, 
and subsequent regulations that interpreted 
the law and put it into effect ran to thousands 
more. Years later, Part D remains controversial, 
with many lawmakers on both sides vowing to 
“reform” it, in one way or another, if they get 
the chance.

t’s all about money, right? You’re thinking about Part D because you’re 
looking for some relief from the outrageous cost of prescription medicine. 
Okay, a lot of drugs aren’t especially expensive, and some of them allow you 
to avoid the even steeper costs of surgery and hospital stays. But plenty 
of meds out there can still take a big bite out of the average retiree’s Social 
Security check, and some cost more than the typical mortgage payment for 
a house. (Think I’m kidding? The priciest cancer drugs range from $4,000 to 
more than $10,000 a month.) So you’re wondering how much money you’ll 
save in Part D — and, at the same time, how much it’ll cost you.
Medicare says that “on average” people with Part D coverage save about 
half the cost of their medications. But that calculation runs the gamut from 
people who don’t save anything to those who save thousands of dollars a 
year. Again, your individual savings depend on the drugs you use, how many 
you take, and — to a degree that may surprise you — the Medicare drug plan 
you choose. That said, you can’t judge a plan on cost alone. Whether a plan 
covers all of your drugs, or makes you go through hoops to get some of them, 
is equally important when you’re choosing the plan that’s best for you (see 
Chapter 4 for details).
In this chapter, I explain the out-of-pocket expenses you’re likely to have in 
Part D and how those costs add up if you’re in the regular part of the pro-
gram. But if your income is low, see Chapter 5. It explains the much greater 
financial assistance available to people who qualify for the Extra Help part of 
the program, and therefore pay much less.

Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Decoding the Jargon of Medicare 
Drug Payments
As you’re well aware, health insurance has its own special language — a 
whole lexicon of jargon relating to coverage, payments, restrictions, and the 
like. In the following sections, I explain the meanings of words and phrases 
used in Part D to describe your out-of-pocket expenses.
Making a commitment: Monthly premium
Here’s an easy one: Your monthly premium is the amount a plan charges each 
month to provide drug coverage, in addition to the monthly Part B premium 
(see Chapter 1 for more info on Part B). Medicare prescription drug plans 
(PDPs) that cover only drugs always charge premiums, which vary a great 
deal among plans. Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MAPDs) that 
cover both healthcare and drugs usually charge a single monthly premium 
for the whole package, though some have no premiums at all. If you’re 
married, you and your spouse must each pay a premium to be in Part D, even 
if you both join the same plan. In other words, there’s no price break for 
married couples.
Forking over the first financial 
slice: Annual deductible
The amount you may have to spend out of pocket on drugs each year before 
your coverage starts is the annual deductible. The maximum amount is set 
by law and increases each year ($275 in 2008, $295 in 2009). However, many 
plans charge lower deductibles or none at all. Most people in plans with 
deductibles spend this amount at the beginning of the calendar year. But 
if you join Part D later in the year, there’s no reduction — you still have to 
spend the required deductible amount before your coverage begins.
Sharing the pain: Co-payments 
and coinsurance
Co-payments and coinsurance are what you pay for your share of each cov-
ered prescription. Your share may be in the form of a co-pay, which is a flat 
dollar amount — say $20. Or it may be coinsurance, which is a percentage 
of the drug’s total cost — say 25 percent. Some plans use only co-pays and 
some only coinsurance; others use both, according to the type of drug.

33
 Chapter 3: The Big Question: What Will Part D Cost (And Save) You?
Leveling on costs: Tiers of charges
 
You may find that your plan charges you different co-payments (or coinsur-
ance) for different drugs. That’s because the plan arranges its covered drugs 
into three or four levels, or tiers, according to price:
 
 Tier One: This tier has the lowest co-pay because it covers the least 
expensive drugs, usually the generic kind. (Generics are low-cost copies 
of brand-name drugs that have been on the market long enough to have 
lost their exclusive marketing rights.) A few plans don’t charge any co-
pays for Tier 1 generics.
 
 Tier Two: This tier has a medium-priced co-pay because it covers the 
plan’s preferred brand-name drugs. The plan prefers you to use these 
drugs because it pays less for them after having negotiated good 
discounts with the drug manufacturers.
 
 Tier Three: This tier has a higher-priced co-pay because it covers non-
preferred brand-name drugs. The plan prefers you not to use these drugs 
because they’re expensive, or perhaps because the plan hasn’t managed 
to negotiate adequate discounts for them.
 
 Tier Four: This tier has the highest co-pay because it comprises very 
expensive or specialty drugs, such as anti-rejection drugs used after organ 
transplant surgery and drugs used to treat certain cancers. In most cases, 
plans charge coinsurance — a percentage of the total cost — for drugs in 
this tier. This percentage is usually 25 percent but can be 33 percent or 
higher.
These tiers are typical of many Part D plans. However, some plans arrange 
them differently — for example, putting preferred generics in one tier and 
nonpreferred generics in another. So a plan may have more than four tiers. 
Then again, some plans (those that charge the same cost percentage for all 
drugs) have only one tier.
Getting out your wallet: Full price
You pay full price for your drugs during the deductible (if your plan has 
one), in the coverage gap (if you fall into it; see Chapter 15), or if you’re 
taking a drug that your plan doesn’t cover. Full price actually means the 
price your plan pays for each drug. If the plan has negotiated a decent 
discount, its price may be quite a bit less than you’d pay retail at the phar-
macy. If the full price of your drug is lower than the co-pay for its associated 
tier, you pay full price, because that’s the lesser cost.

34
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Counting the cost: True out-of-pocket costs
True out-of-pocket costs is an odd bit of jargon — which bureaucrats shorten 
to the acronym TrOOP — that relates to the coverage gap (also known as the 
doughnut hole). If you fall into the gap, you can only get out of it when you’ve 
spent a certain amount out of your own pocket for drugs since the beginning 
of the year. This TrOOP amount ($4,050 in 2008, $4,350 in 2009; it increases 
every year) includes
 
 Your deductible (if any) before drug coverage starts
 
 Your co-pays in the initial coverage period
 
 Anything you’ve spent on prescriptions while in the gap, according to 
certain rules
Are there any “false” out-of-pocket costs? Yes, actually — premiums and 
some other payments that don’t count toward the TrOOP limit. (Wouldn’t 
you think bureaucrats would call these FrOOPs? But they don’t!) Details on 
what counts and what doesn’t are in Chapter 15.
Grasping How Costs Fit 
Together and Add Up
So when it comes to choosing the least expensive Medicare drug plan, you 
just pick the one with the lowest premium, right? Nope! This approach is a 
trap many people fall into, and it’s why most plans have tried to keep their 
premiums relatively low ever since the Part D program began. Low premiums 
are designed to lure you in the door. But if you’re smart, you want to know 
more about what’s inside before you cross the welcome mat. No, nothing bad 
is lurking behind that beckoning door. It’s just that — with one exception — 
the premium contributes much less to your overall out-of-pocket expenses 
than two other items that contribute far more: the medications you take and 
the way your plan is designed.
 
So what’s the exception to avoiding the plan with the lowest premium? If you 
take no drugs right now, or only the occasional one, then absolutely opt for 
the plan in your area that has the lowest premium. Overall, you’re still paying 
more in premiums than you get back in benefits. But what you’re buying at 
this point isn’t drugs but insurance. You’re playing safe because you don’t 
know what the future holds — it may bring some unforeseen illness that 
requires expensive medications. Choosing a plan with the lowest premium 
gives you the comfort of having insurance at the least cost (see Chapter 7).
This section focuses on the calculations everyone else — those who already 
take a number of drugs or a few costly ones — needs to make.

35
 Chapter 3: The Big Question: What Will Part D Cost (And Save) You?
The importance of the drugs you take
 
If you absorb just one bit of knowledge from this book, I want it to be the 
realization that the drugs you take are the most important part of choosing a 
Medicare drug plan. Your medications, their dosages, and how frequently you 
take them are the keys to how much you may spend out of pocket in any plan. 
Why? Two reasons:
 
 Huge differences exist among the co-pays for meds in different tiers, 
even among drugs used to treat the same medical condition. For exam-
ple, the co-pay for a nonpreferred drug in Tier 3 can be twice as much as 
a similar preferred drug in Tier 2; a generic version in Tier 1 can cost a 
fraction of either. So if you’re paying a hefty co-pay (say $60) for a Tier 3 
drug, and you realize an alternative Tier 2 drug costs $30 or that a Tier 
1 generic is available for $5, what are you going to do? Ask your doctor 
whether a lower-priced drug may work just as well for you. Well, why 
not? It’s your money!
 
 The co-pays that different plans charge for the same drug also vary a lot. 
Plan X’s co-pay (or coinsurance) for a particular brand-name drug may 
be quite a bit higher or lower than Plan Y’s. Each plan negotiates the 
price of each drug with the company that makes it. If Plan X wins a rela-
tively low price for a drug, it will charge you less for that drug (through 
a lower co-pay) than a plan that doesn’t get such a good deal. And if 
your costs are high enough to take you into the doughnut hole, where 
you pay full price (see Chapter 15), you’re still paying less under Plan 
X due to the steeper discount it has negotiated. This cost advantage is 
another good reason for comparing plans carefully before choosing one.
 
But wait a minute, you may say: What if one of my drugs is least expensive 
under Plan X, but another drug I take has the lowest price in Plan Y, and 
maybe a third is cheapest under Plan Z? You need to find out which single 
plan will cost you the least out of pocket for your whole batch of drugs 
throughout the entire year — including co-pays, premiums, deductibles, and 
possible costs in the doughnut hole. Don’t worry! Figuring out your potential 
cost savings isn’t as difficult as you may think. Flip to Chapter 10 for step-by-
step guidance on how to do so in a reasonably fast and efficient way.
Here’s another wrinkle regarding prescription drugs that baffles people. The 
law says Part D enrollees pay about 25 percent of the cost of their drugs 
during the initial coverage period. Yet I often hear from folks who say things 
like: “My plan charges me $28 for one of my drugs, but it only costs $35 full 
price at my local pharmacy — so I’m paying 80 percent, not 25.” In response, 
Medicare officials say a Part D drug plan can vary its charges and benefits 
any way it wants, but its total package must be at least actuarially equivalent 
to the standard benefit created by Congress.

36
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Translated into English, actuarially equivalent means that the whole amount a 
plan shells out for all of its enrollees — collectively, not individually — must 
be about 75 percent of the enrollees’ total drug costs, with the remaining 25 
percent paid by the enrollees themselves. If you’re in the type of plan that 
exactly mirrors the standard benefit, then you will pay a strict 25 percent 
of each prescription’s cost. But if you’re in a plan that has tiered co-pays or 
maybe offers extra benefits, such as a waived deductible or some coverage in 
the doughnut hole, you may pay more than 25 percent of the price for some 
drugs — or, in some cases, less. What you pay depends on the plan’s design.
The importance of the plan you choose
Each plan has its own mix of costs and benefits. And although this fact may 
make the plans seem harder to compare, their different designs allow you 
flexibility in finding one that best meets your needs. Here are some of the 
different designs Part D plans typically offer:
 
 A plan that mirrors the basic design for minimum Part D coverage 
outlined by Congress features a full deductible, 25 percent coinsurance 
for each prescription during the initial coverage period, a doughnut 
hole, and standard catastrophic coverage.
 
 A plan that charges no deductible (or a reduced one) and has tiered 
co-pays for prescriptions during the initial coverage period (probably 
with coinsurance for drugs in the highest tier), a doughnut hole, and 
standard catastrophic coverage.
 
 A plan that looks like either of the preceding designs, but charges 
nothing for drugs in Tier 1.
 
 A plan that looks like either of the first two designs, but also covers 
generic drugs in the doughnut hole.
 
 A plan that looks like either of the first two designs, but also covers 
generic and some brand-name drugs in the doughnut hole.
 
About the only aspect that stays the same in every plan is catastrophic cover-
age. The federal government heavily subsidizes this level of coverage, and its 
low co-pays are fixed each year by law. Otherwise, you can find many varia-
tions from plan to plan. Plenty have tiered co-pays and charge a full deduct-
ible. Some have three or five tiers of charges rather than four, some don’t 
use tiers at all, and a few charge nothing for generic drugs. To make matters 
even more confusing, plans can be here one year and gone the next. In 2006, 
one plan charged a straight 30 percent of the cost of all of its covered drugs 
throughout the year with no doughnut hole — but this plan vanished in 2007. 
Expect to see other creative plan designs come and go in the future.

Putting together drug costs and plan 
designs: Three common examples
So in one hand you have all these different costs, and in the other you have 
all these different plan designs. And you know what? None of it really matters! 
In this book, I give you a strategy for navigating the prescription drug plan 
maze that focuses on only the medications you take, as well as a few other 
personal preferences you may have. This strategy can help you whittle your 
choices down to just a few plans — the ones that will cost you the least out 
of pocket but cover all (or most) of your drugs. (Hooray!) You may then want 
to consider these options according to certain conveniences, like being able 
to buy your drugs at a favorite local pharmacy, receive them by mail order, 
or purchase them anywhere in the country. In other words, the process of 
choosing begins with you, not the plans.
I explain this strategy in detail in Chapter 10. In the meantime, it may help to 
know how the different costs and plan designs can work for different people. 
I provide some examples in the following sections — the people may not be 
real, but the math sure is!
Hearty Harry: Feeling healthy and happy
Hearty Harry is still in good shape. But years of energetic activity — hoop 
jumps, rock climbing, and daredevil skiing (not to mention chasing after 
his grandkids) — have proved tough on his joints, so he’s had knee and hip 
replacements. The only med he needs is something to keep his blood pres-
sure in check. Choosing a Part D plan felt a bit like searching for all the hiders 
in a 20-person game of hide-and-seek, but he finally settled on a plan with a 
low premium ($15 a month), a full deductible ($275), and 25 percent coinsur-
ance. Hearty Harry has to pay the plan’s full price for his blood pressure pills 
($32 a month) until he meets the deductible, and because his drugs don’t 
cost much, he doesn’t meet it until halfway through September. At that point, 
he starts getting coverage, and his drug payments drop to $8 a month (25 
percent of $32) for the rest of the year. Here’s what he pays out of pocket:
 
 January through August: $15.00 a month for premiums + $32.00 a month 
full price for drugs = $47.00 per month.
 
 September: $15.00 for premium + $21.66 for drugs = $36.66 for this 
month. (Meeting the deductible on September 20, Hearty Harry’s coin-
surance kicks in, reducing his drug payments to about $2.66 for the 
remaining ten days of the month.)
 
 October through December: $15.00 a month for premiums + $8.00 a 
month coinsurance for drugs = $23.00 per month.
 
 Grand total: Over the course of the entire year, he pays just under 
$482, which includes his monthly premiums ($15.00 × 12 = $180), annual 
deductible ($275), and coinsurance for the rest of the year ($8.00 × 3 = 
$24.00 + $2.66 = $26.66).

38
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Hearty Harry likes this deal almost as much as he likes seeing his favorite 
basketball team lose, because over the year he pays out about $97 more for 
his coverage than his single drug actually costs ($32 × 12 = $384). However, 
after a lifetime of close calls on cliff faces and ski slopes, he figures his risk-
taking days are over, so he settles for paying the extra to have insurance, just 
in case.
Normal Norma: Taking some medications regularly
Normal Norma isn’t the dynamo she used to be, but she remains in reason-
ably good health as long as she takes regular meds to control diabetes and a 
thyroid condition. She takes five drugs (four brand-names and one generic), 
which would cost her well over $4,000 a year retail without insurance. As a 
diligent consumer, she compared Part D plans carefully and found the least 
expensive one that covered all of her drugs. This plan has a premium of 
$23.50 a month and no deductible, so her coverage starts at the beginning of 
the year. For eight months she’s in the initial coverage period, with medium 
co-pays. But at the beginning of September, she hits the doughnut hole (the 
time when she pays full price for medications in the gap before coverage 
kicks back in), and her drug expenses jump to almost three times as much 
each month for the rest of the year. Here’s what Normal Norma pays out of 
pocket:
 
 January through August: $23.50 a month for premiums + $92.96 a month 
for drugs = $116.46 per month.
 
 September: $23.50 for premium + $309.37 for drugs = $332.87 for the 
month. (The total cost of her drugs that both she and her plan pay 
reaches the $2,510 limit of initial coverage very early in September, 
pitching her into the doughnut hole.)
 
 October through December: $23.50 a month for premiums + $312.81 a 
month for drugs (full price in the doughnut hole) = $336.31 per month.
 
 Grand total: Throughout the whole year, she pays just over $2,273, 
which includes her monthly premiums ($23.50 × 12 = $282). At the 
discounted prices this plan pays for her drugs ($3,756 for all of them), 
she saves $1,483.
Remaining cost-conscious, Normal Norma did some extra research in an 
effort to bring her costs down further. Unfortunately, no lower-cost versions 
of her four brand-name drugs exist yet, so that idea didn’t work. But she 
found that if she buys her drugs in 90-day supplies from the plan’s mail-order 
service, she can stave off the doughnut hole for another couple of weeks and 
pay less — $1,823 over the whole year — saving herself a total of $1,933.
Sickly Sam: Shelling out for expensive specialty drugs
Sickly Sam is hanging in there. He’s doing okay after a recent heart transplant, 
but he needs a cocktail of medicines to prevent rejection and deal with side 
effects. He chose a Part D plan that covers all of his drugs, features a $26.40 

39
 Chapter 3: The Big Question: What Will Part D Cost (And Save) You?
monthly premium, and has no deductible. At this plan’s full price, his meds 
cost a whopping $1,340.77 a month, a tough sum to pay when he goes into 
the doughnut hole. But he gets through the gap quickly and by mid-May he’s 
into the catastrophic phase of coverage, with low costs to the end of the 
year. Here’s what he pays out of pocket:
 
 January and February: $26.40 a month for premiums + $371.27 a month 
for drugs (in the initial coverage period) = $397.67 per month.
 
 March and April: $26.40 a month for premiums + $1,340.77 a month for 
drugs (in the doughnut hole) = $1,367.17 per month.
 
 May: $26.40 for premium + $676.90 for drugs = $703.30 in May. (Halfway 
through the month, his drug expenses from the beginning of the year 
reach $4,050, the limit of the doughnut hole, and he begins catastrophic 
coverage.)
 
 June through December: $26.40 a month for premiums + $72.64 a month 
for drugs (catastrophic coverage) = $99.04 per month.
 
 Grand total: Over the course of the year, Sickly Sam pays just over 
$4,926 out of pocket, including the monthly premiums ($26.40 × 12 = 
$316.80). The full price of his drugs under this plan amounts to $16,089 
over the course of the year, so he saves $11,163.
Although he has a hard time paying the bills during his two and a half months 
in the doughnut hole, Sickly Sam feels his low payments for the last seven 
months of the year are like seven months of opening birthday presents, 
eating cake, and playing games without having to turn any older.
Knowing the Costs That Plans Can (And 
Can’t) Change during a Calendar Year
Since Part D went into effect in 2006, a common complaint among consumers 
is that they’re normally allowed to change plans only once a year, whereas 
those plans can change their charges any time during the year. This state-
ment is only partly true; some regulations protect enrollees against the 
whims of any plan that wants to make changes. This section lists the rules 
on what plans can and can’t do during the year, from January 1 through 
December 31.

40
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
The costs your plan can’t change
Plans can’t change these costs during the year:
 
 The amount of the monthly premium.
 
 The amount of the annual deductible (if any).
 
 The overall design of the plan (for example, whether it covers any drugs 
in the coverage gap).
 
 The tier structure of co-pays. So if a plan has three tiers of co-pays rising 
from $5 to $28 to $60 through the different levels, and charges 25 percent 
coinsurance in the fourth tier, the charges in each tier must stay the 
same throughout the year.
 
 Any costs set by law. These costs include the maximum amount of the 
deductible, the minimum dollar limit of initial coverage, the maximum 
out-of-pocket limit that ends the coverage gap, co-pays at the cata-
strophic level of coverage, and all co-pays for people who receive Extra 
Help. (See Chapter 5 for more on this program.)
The costs your plan can change
Plans can change these costs during the year:
 
 The full price cost of drugs: A plan can change these prices on a 
weekly basis (see the earlier section “Decoding the Jargon of Medicare 
Drug Payments” to understand what this term means). These price 
fluctuations usually vary by only a few dollars or cents, but they can 
still add up. Such changes — up or down — may affect what you pay 
during the deductible period (if your plan has one) and in the dough-
nut hole (if you fall into it). These changes don’t affect you in the initial 
coverage period if your plan charges tiered co-pays for your drugs. But 
if you pay coinsurance in this coverage period, any changes will affect 
you because you’re paying a percentage of the full price.
 
 The co-pay for different drugs: A plan can move any drug into a higher 
or lower price tier, which consequently raises or reduces your co-pay. 
However, plans can’t make this change during the annual enrollment 
period (November 15 to December 31) or during the first 60 days of a 
new year.
Being aware of your rights
 
You have some rights and protections in relation to the costs of your drugs 
that are worth knowing about:

41
 Chapter 3: The Big Question: What Will Part D Cost (And Save) You?
 
 If one of your drugs is moved up to a higher tier of charges, you can’t 
be asked to pay a higher co-pay for it during the year. Say one of your 
medicines is in Tier 2 and your co-pay is $24. You’ll continue to pay that 
amount for the rest of the year, even if your plan moves the drug into 
Tier 3 where the co-pay is normally $56. However, if your drug is moved 
to a lower tier — yes, it can occasionally happen! — your co-pay drops 
to the lower level.
 
 If your doctor thinks a particular drug is the only one that will work for 
you but your plan places the drug in its tier of nonpreferred drugs and 
doesn’t offer a generic or a similar drug in its preferred tiers, you can 
request your plan to charge you a lower co-pay. (You’ll need your doc-
tor’s help in making this request; see Chapter 4.) You can’t ask your plan 
to do this if the drug you need is in the highest specialty tier of charges 
or if the requested change would put your co-pay in the lowest (usually 
generic) tier.
 
 If any of your plan’s changes will affect a drug you’re taking, your plan 
must notify you in writing at least 60 days in advance, unless the drug 
has been withdrawn from the market for safety reasons.
 
What should you do if your plan violates any of these rights? Contact the plan, 
point to the regulations in question, and ask for the mistake to be rectified by 
filing a coverage determination, which means asking the plan to look into the 
facts of your case. If that doesn’t work, you can appeal the plan’s decision. See 
Chapter 19 for details.
Understanding How Costs May 
Change from Year to Year
Drug plans have only so much wiggle room to hit you with higher costs 
during the year. But they do have the right to change everything from one 
year to the next. No, this privilege doesn’t necessarily mean raising all 
charges. But with the price of prescription drugs on the rise in general, Part 
D costs tend to creep up, not down.
Cost increases for enrollees in Part D aren’t solely related to drug plans rais-
ing their premiums and co-pays. Medicare, the federal program, also controls 
several costs and dollar caps that affect all enrollees, regardless of the private 
plan they’re in. These costs change by law each year and generally go up, 
because they’re tied to the rising cost of drugs in the whole Part D program.
Medicare typically changes these costs and benefits from year to year:
 
 The maximum amount of the annual deductible
 
 The limit to the initial coverage period

42
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
 
 The limit on out-of-pocket expenses that gets you out of the doughnut 
hole (if they ever get that high) and into catastrophic coverage
 
 Co-pays at the catastrophic coverage level
 
 Co-pays for people receiving Extra Help (see Chapter 5)
Drug plans can change the following costs and benefits from one year to the 
next:
 
 Monthly premiums
 
 Annual deductible (no higher than the maximum amount set by law)
 
 Co-pays for each tier of charges in the initial coverage period
 
 Percentage of coinsurance in the initial coverage period
 
 Full-price charges in the deductible or doughnut hole
 
 Covered drugs
 
 Overall plan design
 
Following are some recent trends in annual cost changes:
 
 Medicare-controlled costs have gone up steadily. For example, the 
maximum deductible rose from $250 in 2006 to $295 in 2009. The out-
of-pocket limit that triggers the end of the doughnut hole rose from 
$3,600 in 2006 to $4,350 in 2009, which means it costs more to get to the 
catastrophic coverage level. On the other hand, the annually raised limit 
on total drug costs in the initial coverage period — which went up from 
$2,000 in 2006 to $2,700 in 2009 — means you get a bit more coverage 
before hitting the doughnut hole than you did in previous years.
 
 Drug plan costs are more variable. Consumers certainly see the effects 
if their premiums or co-pays suddenly take a jump on January 1. But 
often changes are much more subtle — for example, more drugs moved 
to a higher cost tier. From 2007 to 2008, a few plans lowered their pre-
miums and/or co-pays, but most plans raised both, especially through 
increased charges for brand-name drugs. And in the most dramatic 
change of 2008, coverage for brand-name drugs in the doughnut hole — 
which in the previous two years had saved a lot of money for enrollees 
with high costs — all but vanished.
 
Your Part D plan must mail you a notice each fall (usually in October) to 
inform you of any changes it will make in costs and benefits for the following 
year. This mailing is called the Annual Notice of Change, and it’s important that 
you read it, as explained in Chapter 17. If you haven’t received this notice by 
early November, call the Medicare help line at 800-633-4227 (877-486-2048 for 
TDD users) and complain.

Delving into Drug Coverage 
under Part D
In This Chapter
 Getting a grip on formulary fundamentals
 Understanding plan limitations on some drugs
 Obtaining the drugs you need when they’re not covered
 Figuring out when drugs are covered by Part D or other parts of Medicare
T
he whole point of Part D is to help people with Medicare get the prescrip-
tion drugs they need to fight disease and maintain their health. The cost 
of meds under Part D, explained in Chapter 3, is only part of it. The other big 
concern is coverage — that is, which drugs a Part D plan helps pay for. In par-
ticular, you want to know if your drugs are covered and how easily you can 
get them.
Chances are high that your drugs are covered in several plans available to 
you, or even in most of them. But you can’t just assume that all of your drugs 
are covered in every plan. That’s because Part D plans are allowed to choose 
which drugs they cover in any given year, within certain Medicare rules. Just 
as plans vary in their charges, so do they vary in the drugs they help pay for.
Another aspect of Part D coverage to be aware of is that any plan can require 
you to ask permission before it will cover certain drugs your doctor has pre-
scribed. You may not encounter this hurdle — again, it all depends on the 
drugs you take and the plan you choose — but you should know that this 
obstacle exists and what to do if it happens.
In this chapter, I share how plans vary in their coverage of different drugs 
and how to find out which plans cover your meds. I also explain the ways 
that plans can restrict immediate access to some drugs and how to deal with 
this situation if it arises. I delve into the important role your doctor plays 
in how to get coverage for drugs that your plan doesn’t normally cover or 
restricts access to. Finally, I explain how the same drug may be covered 
under Part D, Part A (hospital care), or Part B (outpatient care) in different 
circumstances.

44
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Finding Out about Formularies
Formulary is a jargon word that becomes very familiar when you’re in Part 
D, because it directly affects your prescription drug coverage. A formulary 
is simply the list of specific drugs that each Part D plan has decided it will 
cover.
 
If the drugs you take are on your plan’s formulary, the plan will pay its share 
of the costs during the initial and catastrophic phases of coverage (see 
Chapter 2 for an introduction to these phases). If any drug isn’t on the formu-
lary, you pay full price for that drug in every phase of coverage — in the initial 
coverage period and at the catastrophic level, as well as during the deductible 
period and in the doughnut hole — unless you can persuade the plan to cover 
it in your case, as explained in the later section “Requesting an exception with 
your doctor’s help.”
As you can see, coverage is intimately entwined with cost. The difference in 
cost between a drug that’s on a plan’s formulary and that same drug when it 
isn’t on a plan’s formulary can amount to several hundred dollars. Consider 
this example for a drug prescribed to help people sleep when they’re in pain. 
The full price of this drug is the same in both Plan X and Plan Y. But Plan X, 
which covers the drug in the initial and catastrophic phases of coverage, 
charges $521 for it over the whole year. In contrast, Plan Y — which doesn’t 
cover the drug at all — charges $1,200 for it over the year. If my math’s right, 
that’s a difference of $679 for the identical drug!
 
Making sure that the drugs you need are on your chosen plan’s formulary 
is essential for another reason, too. If you fall into the doughnut hole (also 
known as the coverage gap; see Chapter 15), a drug that isn’t on the formulary 
doesn’t count toward your out-of-pocket limit that gets you out of the gap — 
unless, again, you’ve persuaded the plan to cover it for you.
So when you’re picking a Part D plan, both for cost reasons and because, darn 
it, you need these drugs for your health, your goal is to find a plan that covers 
all of your medications — or, failing that, almost all of them — on its formulary. 
(I explain how to find out which plans cover your drugs in Chapter 10.)
How many medications do Part D plans cover at any one time? The number 
varies a great deal among the plans, and some have many more than others. 
As a general indication, in 2008, the top ten plans (those with the greatest 
number of enrollees) averaged 2,285 distinct drugs on their formularies, 
according to an analysis by the health research group Avalere Health.
Despite this variation in the number of covered drugs, each Part D formulary 
must comply with Medicare rules in the following four areas:

45
 Chapter 4: Delving into Drug Coverage under Part D
 
 The drugs that plans must cover
 
 The drugs that Medicare doesn’t pay for
 
 The tricky issue of off-label drugs that are prescribed for unapproved 
treatments
 
 The rules on what plans can and can’t do when changing their formularies
I provide more info on each of these areas of regulation in the following sections. 
Later in this chapter I explain what you can do to get needed drugs that are 
affected by these conditions.
The drugs that Part D plans must cover
 
Medicare doesn’t require Part D plans to cover any individual prescription 
drug. But it does require plans to cover at least two in each class of medi-
cations. A class means all the similar drugs that are used to treat the same 
medical condition. Many plans cover more than two in a class.
For example, about half a dozen brand-name statins — drugs commonly used 
to counteract high cholesterol — are currently sold, as well as generic versions 
of some of these drugs. Many plans cover all the brand-name statins, and some 
don’t cover any. But plans that don’t have the brand-names on their formular-
ies do cover at least two of the generic statins, which have the same active 
ingredients and are just as effective at less cost to you. (I cover generic drugs, 
and why it’s worth talking with your doctor about using them, in Chapter 16.)
Every plan must also cover “all or substantially all” drugs in each of the 
following six classes of medications:
 
 Anticancer drugs (used to halt or slow the growth of cancers)
 
 Anticonvulsants (used mainly to prevent epileptic seizures)
 
 Antidepressants (used to counteract depression and anxiety disorders)
 
 Antipsychotics (used to treat mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, 
mania, bipolar disorder, and other delusional conditions)
 
 HIV/AIDS drugs (used to block or slow HIV infection and treat symptoms 
and side effects)
 
 Immunosuppressants (used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs 
and tissues, immune system disorders, and some inflammatory diseases)
Medicare requires every Part D plan to cover pretty much all drugs in 
these categories due to the clinical problems that can occur when patients 
abruptly stop such medications or switch to others.

46
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
The drugs that Medicare doesn’t pay for
By law, Medicare doesn’t pay for certain kinds of drugs. This directive 
doesn’t mean Part D plans are prohibited from covering them — just that, if 
they do, Medicare won’t reimburse its share of the cost. So, although a few 
plans (typically those with higher premiums) may cover some of these drugs, 
most plans don’t cover any. The types of drugs excluded by Medicare are
 
 Barbiturates (used for seizures and anxiety, such as Amytal, Nembutal, 
Seconal, and so on)
 
 Benzodiazepines (used for anxiety and sleeping problems, such as 
Serepax, Valium, Xanax, and the like)
 
 Drugs sold over the counter (nonprescription medicines)
 
 Drugs used for anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain
 
 Drugs used for cosmetic reasons and hair growth
 
 Drugs used to promote fertility
 
 Drugs used to treat sexual or erectile dysfunction
 
 Medicines to treat cough or cold symptoms
 
 Prescription vitamins and mineral products
Sometimes Medicare pays for medications in these categories if they’re used 
for a “medically accepted” purpose. Here are a few examples:
 
 Drugs to help people stop smoking are excluded when bought over the 
counter, but accepted if prescribed by a doctor.
 
 Prescriptions for drugs used to counteract severe weight loss in AIDS 
patients are accepted because they’re medically necessary and not 
regarded as the usual weight-gain drugs.
 
 Prescriptions for drugs used to treat skin conditions, such as acne and 
psoriasis, are accepted because they’re not considered cosmetic.
 
 Cough medicines are accepted when prescribed to alleviate medical 
conditions such as asthma.
 
 Drugs normally used to treat sexual or erectile dysfunction (impotence) 
are allowed if prescribed for a different but approved use, such as the 
treatment of certain conditions affecting veins and arteries.
 
If you need any of these drugs for medically accepted reasons, you need to 
ask your doctor to file for an exception with your plan, as explained in the 
later section “Getting the Drugs You Need When They’re Restricted or Not 
Covered.”

47
 Chapter 4: Delving into Drug Coverage under Part D
The off-label uses for some drugs
When a doctor prescribes a drug off label, she’s using that drug to treat a 
medical condition for which it hasn’t received official approval. The U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves drugs and allows them into 
the market to treat specific illnesses. But if scientists find that a drug is also 
effective for another illness, doctors are legally free to prescribe it off label 
for the other illness, even if it hasn’t received FDA approval for that purpose.
This practice allows doctors to use their clinical judgment and is officially 
endorsed by the American Medical Association. In fact, it’s so common that 
hundreds of thousands of off-label prescriptions are written every year, 
especially for patients with cancer, chronic pain, and rare disorders.
Medicare law says simply that Part D plans may only cover drugs approved 
by the FDA. That’s very clear, and it’s meant as a safeguard to patients’ health. 
But what if a doctor prescribes a drug that’s both on a plan’s formulary and is 
FDA-approved — but not for the condition prescribed? Can the plan cover it? 
Medicare regulations say that it can, but only if the off-label use is included in 
any of three medical compendia (directories of drugs that list their usages).
 
The snag is that some time may elapse between medical research finding a 
new use for an existing drug and that usage being listed in the compendia. 
As a result, Part D plans are prohibited from covering drugs in this twilight 
zone, and patients who’ve used them effectively before joining Part D must 
either pay the cost themselves or do without. However, there’s one important 
exception. Under a recent change in Medicare law, Part D plans are allowed to 
use authoritative medical literature (as well as compendia listings) to justify 
off-label use — for anticancer drugs alone — starting January 1, 2009. (The 
Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group, is suing the federal government 
to have the ban removed for all off-label uses.)
The rules of formulary changes
Every plan is allowed to take drugs off its formulary or add new ones to it at any 
time, subject to Medicare approval. If you’re in a plan that discontinues coverage 
for a drug you take, the plan must inform you of this action in writing at least 60 
days before removing it from the formulary. (Here’s an excellent reason for read-
ing the mail your plan sends you!) This written notice gives you the opportunity 
to ask the plan to make an exception and continue coverage in your case, if your 
doctor confirms that the drug in question is necessary to your health.
 
This rule doesn’t apply when a drug is removed from the market for safety rea-
sons — for example, if new research shows that its risks outweigh its benefits. 
In this case, you don’t receive a 60-day warning, and you can’t seek exceptions 
for coverage.

48
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Making Sense of Special Restrictions 
on Some Covered Drugs
Perhaps you’ve found a plan that covers all of your medications. Great! What a 
relief, huh? But wait a minute. Does the plan require you to ask its permission 
before it will cover some of your meds? And if so, what’s that all about? Well, 
Medicare allows Part D plans to place restrictions on some of their formulary 
drugs in the interests of safety or holding down costs.
 
Here’s what these special restrictions (which bureaucrats refer to as “utilization 
management tools”) are called and what they mean:
 
 Prior authorization: You’re required to ask your plan for permission 
before it will consider covering a drug placed in this category. These 
medications are usually powerful ones that may pose safety concerns 
when used inappropriately or for too long. The plan authorizes coverage 
for such a drug only if it accepts your doctor’s statement that the drug is 
necessary to treat your medical condition.
 
 Quantity limits: This phrase doesn’t mean that your plan will cover your 
prescriptions for a certain time and then stop. It means that your doctor 
has prescribed a dosage or number of pills per month that’s higher than 
the plan considers normal to treat your condition. For example, if your 
doctor prescribes a pill to be taken twice a day (60 a month), and the 
normal quantity is once a day (30 a month), the plan won’t cover the 
prescription unless your doctor shows that the higher quantity is 
necessary to treat you effectively.
 
 Step therapy: Your plan requires you to try other similar but lower-cost 
drugs before it will consider covering the more expensive one your 
doctor has prescribed. This situation can happen if the prescribed drug 
has a generic or older version (or even one sold over the counter) that’s 
much cheaper. To avoid step therapy, your doctor must show that 
you’ve already tried lower-cost drugs that didn’t work as well for you as 
the prescribed drug.
As you can see, some of these restrictions address safety concerns. So you 
may suppose that all plans restrict the same drugs according to some general 
Medicare regulation. But no, the system doesn’t work that way. Instead, each 
plan gets to decide which of its formulary drugs requires prior authorization, 
quantity limits, or step therapy. This fact raises a question: Couldn’t a plan 
use these restrictions to discourage people with certain illnesses and who 
require expensive drugs from joining the plan? Medicare says no. Officials 
say the agency reviews each plan’s proposed restrictions every year before 
approving its application to provide Part D services so that plans can’t use 
restrictions to steer the sickest people away.

49
 Chapter 4: Delving into Drug Coverage under Part D
Getting the Drugs You Need When 
They’re Restricted or Not Covered
Earlier in this chapter, I explain the basic rules about formularies and special 
restrictions on covered drugs. These restrictions may never affect you. But if 
they do, what can you do to get the drugs you need? You can start by know-
ing how to avoid having to jump through these hoops to begin with. Already 
in a plan that restricts or doesn’t cover your drugs? Fortunately, other estab-
lished rules give you the opportunity to get your plan to cover nonformulary 
drugs or to set aside its usual restrictions. I touch on all of these possibilities 
in the following sections.
Sidestepping the hoops
Although restrictions like prior authorization and step therapy may be of 
benefit in protecting people’s health or even saving them money, most 
Medicare beneficiaries regard them as a hassle — just more hoops to go 
through to get the drugs they need. But you may be able to sidestep these 
hoops by avoiding plans that restrict your drugs in the first place.
Each Part D plan chooses which restrictions it wants on which drugs, so 
these requirements vary a great deal. For example, the same drug may come 
with quantity limits under Plan W, step therapy under Plan X, both under 
Plan Y, and neither under Plan Z. This variation gives you a chance to find a 
plan that doesn’t restrict your particular drugs, or at least not all of them, in 
advance — when you’re choosing a plan.
 
You can find this critical information in any of the following ways:
 
 Compare Part D plans online at www.medicare.gov, as I explain in 
Chapter 10. Each plan’s details show which of your drugs, if any, have 
restrictions.
 
 Go to the “Formulary Finder,” also at www.medicare.gov. Here you 
can find out which plans in your state cover all of your drugs on their 
formularies, and which cover only some of your drugs. Clicking any plan 
name shows whether it has restrictions on any of your prescription 
meds.
 
 Call the Medicare helpline at 800-633-4227. Ask the customer rep-
resentative to find the plans that cover all of your drugs at the least 
cost and, among these, which have restrictions. TDD users should call 
877-486-2048.
 
 Go directly to any plan’s Web site and look up your drugs on its 
formulary. Restricted drugs are designated PA (prior authorization), 

50
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
QL (quantity limits), or ST (step therapy). You can also call the plan 
directly and ask a customer representative about drug restrictions, but 
be sure to keep a record of this conversation. If you enroll and then find 
you were given wrong information, you may be able to switch to another 
plan, as explained in Chapter 17.
Understanding the 30-day rule
 
If you’re newly enrolled in a Part D plan and are already taking any drug that 
isn’t on its formulary or has restrictions (such as prior authorization or step 
therapy), the plan must temporarily waive its rules and cover at least a 30-day 
supply of that drug. Medicare requires every plan to do so under a transition 
or first-fill policy to ensure that a patient’s treatment isn’t interrupted when 
first joining a plan. (People in nursing homes have the right to a 90-day 
transitional supply, as explained in Chapter 18.)
You can use this rule whether you’re joining a Part D plan for the first time 
or have just switched from one Part D plan to another. Just ask your pharma-
cist to fill your prescription on a transitional basis. Your pharmacist, or your 
plan, may contact your doctor to verify that you were already on this particu-
lar drug when you joined the plan. If your pharmacist denies you a 30-day fill, 
call your plan immediately. If the plan doesn’t help, complain to Medicare.
 
The 30-day rule is only a temporary respite, and you must take immediate 
steps to get the drugs you need when this period ends. Ask your doctor if the 
plan covers a similar drug that may suit you just as well (see the next section). 
Or contact your plan for an exception to its policy, as explained later in this 
chapter.
Trying another drug
 
Perhaps you can use a similar drug — one that’s on the plan’s formulary and/
or doesn’t come with restrictions — that may treat you just as effectively as 
the medicine you’re taking now. The possibility is worth asking your doctor 
about. A similar drug, which may be an older or generic version of your 
prescribed drug, will likely cost you less, too. (I explain the meaning of generic 
and older meds, and how they can slash your expenses, in Chapter 16.)
Requesting an exception 
with your doctor’s help
By law, you have the right to ask your plan to cover a needed drug that isn’t 
on its formulary. You can also ask the plan to waive any restrictions it has 

51
 Chapter 4: Delving into Drug Coverage under Part D
placed on any of your drugs. This process is called requesting an exception to 
the plan’s policy or, more formally, requesting a coverage determination. In 
the following sections, I explain the process of filing paperwork for an excep-
tion request, what your doctor can do to help, how you can help your doctor 
help you, and what happens when your request is granted or denied.
The paperwork you need
In some circumstances you may not have to go through this process yourself. 
Sometimes pharmacists resolve the problem themselves — by calling your 
plan and maybe your doctor — without you ever knowing about it. And 
occasionally your doctor deals with the issue directly. (In fact, it’s essential 
that your doctor send your plan a statement saying why the drug in question 
is medically necessary for you, as I explain in the next section.) But in most 
cases, you need to apply personally, too.
To request an exception, pick up your favorite pen, fill out the appropriate 
form, and send it to your plan. You can obtain a form by downloading the 
right one from your plan’s Web site, or by calling the plan and asking that one 
be sent to you. Medicare also provides an acceptable template form that you 
can download from www.cms.hhs.gov/MedPrescriptDrugApplGriev/
Downloads/ModelCoverageDeterminationRequestForm.pdf (so 
get those typing fingers ready!). This form, titled “Request for Medicare 
Prescription Drug Coverage Determination,” asks you to fill out the following:
 
 Your name, address, Medicare ID number, and plan ID number
 
 The name of the prescription drug you’re requesting an exception for, 
the strength of the drug (for example, 100 mg), and the prescribed 
quantities (for example, 2 pills a day)
 
 Your physician’s name, address, and phone number, and his medical 
specialty (such as internist, family practitioner, cardiologist)
 
 What type of coverage determination you’re requesting — the form 
provides a list of possibilities, so check off which one applies to you
 
 Any other information you want the plan to consider
You can attach your doctor’s statement to the form, unless he prefers to 
send it to the plan independently. Then just sign the form and send it to 
your plan. If you need exceptions for more than one drug, you can make the 
request on separate forms and send them all in together.
What your doctor can do to help
To have any chance of succeeding in an exception request, you need your 
doctor’s help. In fact, without his supporting statement, the plan may not 
even consider your request — or at least, not in a timely manner.
Under Medicare rules, your plan must respond within 72 hours of receiving 
both your request and your doctor’s supporting statement. (That’s 72 hours 

52
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
by the clock, not business hours.) If your doctor thinks waiting this long would 
endanger your health or life, he can ask for an expedited exception, a request 
that the plan must reply to within 24 hours (again, by the clock) or even less if 
your health depends on it. If the plan doesn’t respond within either time frame, 
you should immediately file an appeal, as explained in Chapter 19.
Table 4-1 shows you at a glance the different situations you may encounter, 
what you can do about them, and how your doctor can help.

How you can help your doctor help you
A doctor’s help is critical to obtain a successful exception request. If you 
think this process is a hassle for you, consider what it’s like for your doctor, 
who may have many patients seeking help for the same reason and who 
doesn’t get paid for providing this assistance. Medicare prohibits doctors 
from charging patients fees for helping to file for exceptions.
 
Fortunately, most doctors — even if they grumble about the extra work Part D 
has imposed on them — put their patients’ needs first and are willing to do the 
paperwork involved in filing for an exception. However, you can score major 
Brownie points with any doc if you do your part to lessen the work he is doing 
on your behalf. Your health permitting, call your doctor’s receptionist and ask 
whether it would help for you to provide any of the following materials:
 
 A copy of your plan’s formulary: Your doctor needs to know which similar 
drugs are covered by your plan in order to explain why they won’t work 
for you. You can download the formulary from your plan’s Web site or 
call to have it faxed to you or your doctor. (Some doctors have these 
formularies in their offices, and some use computer programs that allow 
them to look up any Part D plan’s formulary instantly.)
 
 The phone and fax numbers of your plan’s Clinical Review Department: All 
exception requests must be sent to this department. You can call your plan’s 
customer service number to verify the appropriate contact information.
 
 A blank exception request form: Providing this form for your doctor 
may make the process a bit smoother. Ask your plan to fax a copy of its 
own form to your doctor, or visit www.cms.hhs.gov/MLNProducts/
Downloads/Form_Exceptions_final.pdf to download the appropriate 
Medicare form. This form is useful because it asks doctors precise 
questions. However, under Medicare rules, no plan can insist that doctors 
use a form, but must accept any statement written on their letterhead.
 
 A set of instructions for doctors unfamiliar with the exception-request 
process: Obviously, a doctor who’s well versed in the process doesn’t 
need to see pointers. But if you’re the first patient your doc has helped 
file an exception for, you can find useful instructions from the Medicare 
Rights Center online at www.medicarerights.org/PartD_for_
Physicians_national.pdf.

Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
 
It’s almost inconceivable that a doctor would refuse to help you request a Part 
D exception, especially if you’ve gone to the trouble of getting together the 
information in the preceding list. But it can happen. For this reason, Medicare 
proposed new regulations in 2008 (not yet finalized as this book goes to press) 
that allow not only physicians but also other health professionals who are 
qualified to write prescriptions — such as nurse practitioners and physician 
assistants — to file Part D exception requests. So if your doctor refuses to 
help you, ask whether anyone else in his office can. Otherwise, you can’t do 
much — except perhaps report the refusal to Medicare and take your 
healthcare elsewhere.
What happens when your exception request is granted or denied
In most cases, if you win an exception it’ll be valid until the end of the 
calendar year — especially if the plan grants you an exception to cover a 
drug not on its formulary or to waive quantity limits and step therapy 
restrictions. But when plans approve prior authorization for a certain drug, 
they can (and sometimes do) require another request after an interval of time 
(like one month, three months, or six months). In this case, you and your 
doctor must go through the exception-filing process again, and may even be 
required to do so repeatedly throughout the year.
What happens at the end of the year? If you stay in the same Part D plan, 
your exception may continue to be valid throughout the following year, so 
you wouldn’t need to request another. However, that depends on the plan’s 
policy. Some plans require new exception requests for the same drug every 
year. If you switch to a different plan next year, you’d certainly have to file 
a new exception request — unless you choose a plan that doesn’t impose a 
restriction on your particular drug(s).
 
If your plan denies your request for an exception, you can pursue the matter 
further by asking for a reconsideration (asking the plan to reconsider its 
decision) and, if necessary, by taking the dispute to a higher level of appeal. 
You can also take these actions if your plan doesn’t respond to your request 
for an exception (or reconsideration) within the required time frames. I offer 
a detailed explanation of how to ask for a reconsideration or file an appeal in 
Chapter 19.
Obtaining excluded drugs
If you need a type of drug that the law excludes from Part D coverage (as 
listed in the earlier section “The drugs that Medicare doesn’t pay for”), what 
can you do? The ban on barbiturates and benzodiazepines is especially 
controversial. These drugs can lead to oversedation (especially in nursing 
homes), serious side effects, and addiction. But they’re also commonly used 
to treat older and disabled people for conditions such as muscle spasms, 
seizures, sleeplessness, panic attacks, and other forms of anxiety.

55
 Chapter 4: Delving into Drug Coverage under Part D
 
If your doctor says you need an excluded drug, your options for getting it 
covered under Part D are limited. You can’t file an exception request for any of 
these drugs, unless your doctor has prescribed them for what Medicare 
considers a medically acceptable reason, as explained earlier in this chapter. 
Here are some alternative possibilities:
 
 Although hardly any Part D plans pay for brand-name benzodiazepines, 
a few plans cover generic versions of these drugs — for example 
diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax). These are often enhanced-
benefit plans that have higher-than-average premiums. So check plan 
costs carefully. Generic benzos aren’t expensive, and it may be cheaper 
to pay their full cost each month than to pay a higher premium.
 
 State Medicaid programs often cover prescription drugs that are 
excluded from Part D; so do many State Pharmacy Assistance Programs 
(SPAPs). If you’re enrolled in either of these programs, and your doctor 
says you need one of these drugs, contact the program to see whether 
it’s covered. (See Chapter 6 for more info about these plans.)
 
 If you have other drug coverage that wraps around Part D (like coverage 
from an employer), you may be able to use those benefits to cover these 
drugs, as explained in Chapter 6.
 
 You may be able to obtain these drugs from the manufacturers through 
their patient assistance programs, depending on whether you qualify 
according to the programs’ conditions and income limits. To find out, go 
to www.pparx.org. (Check out Chapter 16 for the scoop on these 
programs.)
Getting drugs for off-label uses
Unless Medicare regulations change, Part D plans will continue to cover 
off-label prescriptions only if their usages are included in the specified 
medical compendia, as explained in this chapter’s “The off-label uses for 
some drugs” section. If the drug your doctor has prescribed as medically 
necessary doesn’t fall into this category, your chances of being able to 
appeal your plan’s coverage refusal are slim.
 
It may help to contact the Part D Appeals Project of the Medicare Rights 
Center, which helps Part D enrollees try to get the medications they need and 
has a special interest in off-label denials. Call the Center at 888-466-9050.
 
Also, your doctor may agree to argue the case with your Part D plan when 
requesting an exception by describing how an off-label use is the only means 
of alleviating your medical condition. She can do so by providing references 
to scientific research that demonstrates the drug’s effectiveness and has been 
published in authoritative medical journals. Success isn’t guaranteed, but the 
voice of a physician who can quote the relevant research carries weight.

56
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Knowing When Drugs Are Covered 
by Part D, Part A, or Part B
As confusing as it sounds, some prescription drugs may be covered not only 
under Medicare Part D but also under Part A (hospital insurance) or Part B 
(outpatient care), both of which I touch on in Chapter 1. Sometimes an iden-
tical drug may be covered by all three but charged under one or the other, 
according to different circumstances. That’s because certain drugs were 
covered under Part A or Part B before Part D came into existence, and that 
practice has continued.
 
Here’s the general rule of thumb on the differences:
 
 Part D covers outpatient drugs you administer to yourself at home, or 
that a caregiver administers to you at your home. (These drugs include 
self-injected insulin for diabetes, for example.)
 
 Part A covers drugs administered when you’re a patient in a hospital or 
skilled nursing facility.
 
 Part B covers drugs administered in a doctor’s office (such as injected 
chemotherapy drugs), hospital outpatient departments, and, in some 
circumstances, in a hospice or by a home healthcare professional.
These general rules are more complicated in some situations. For example, if 
your organ transplant is covered by Medicare, the immunosuppressant drugs 
you need afterward are covered by Part B. But if your transplant surgery isn’t 
covered by Medicare (perhaps because you received it before joining the 
program), the drugs are covered under Part D.
 
Part D doesn’t pay for drugs covered by Part A or B. So if any of your meds 
are in question, your Part D plan may require information from you and your 
doctor before covering them. Usually this info includes details of the related 
medical treatment (such as a transplant or cancer surgery). For this reason, 
plans often place a prior authorization restriction on such drugs, to determine 
whether they should be covered by Part A, B, or D. Your doctor may be able 
to settle this matter over the phone or may help you file a speedy exception 
request as explained earlier in this chapter. Either way, your doctor needs to 
explain why a prior authorization shouldn’t apply in this case.

P
remiums, deductibles, co-pays, and that huge chunk of change that is 
the doughnut hole — yes, a lot of consumer costs go along with Part 
D. And for many people, they’re just not affordable. That’s where Extra Help 
comes in. This is the name of the program-within-a-program that’s specifi-
cally designed for people with limited incomes and savings and has the most 
generous benefits that Part D provides. If you qualify, you’ll receive drug 
coverage throughout the year, and your out-of-pocket expenses will be much 
smaller than in the regular Part D program.
Millions of older Americans and those with disabilities are thought to qualify 
for Extra Help but, for one reason or another, they aren’t receiving it. Could 
you be one of them? It may be worth applying even if you’re not sure you’d 
qualify. Or do you think that someone you know — a relative, a friend, a 
neighbor — could use some Extra Help? If so, you may want to encourage or 
help that person to apply.
In this chapter, I explain how Extra Help works, depending on whether you 
qualify for it automatically or need to apply, and how it could affect other 
government assistance you may receive. I also explain Extra Help in the con-
text of choosing and enrolling in a Part D plan or switching to another, the all-
important question of continuing to receive Extra Help from year to year, and 
what to do if you’re denied or lose eligibility for Extra Help.

Understanding the Value of Extra Help
Millions of people in Medicare have been able to save many hundreds or 
even thousands of dollars a year on their drug bills under the Extra Help 
program. Even more crucially, Extra Help has allowed many folks who didn’t 
previously have any drug coverage to fill all the prescriptions they need for 
the first time. For them, Extra Help has been a godsend.
At the same time, there are many who aren’t much better off with Extra Help 
than they were before — and a few who may be worse off. People enrolled 
in Medicaid are automatically transferred to Part D for their drug coverage 
when they join Medicare. Those in states that require Medicaid recipients to 
pay small co-pays for their prescriptions won’t see much difference in their 
out-of-pocket expenses under Part D. However, people who are used to get-
ting their meds completely free from their state’s Medicaid program should 
expect to have small co-pays for the first time.
Is there much red tape to go through? Compared to many assistance 
programs, Extra Help is easy to get into. Some people qualify automatically 
and don’t have to apply. Others must apply, but navigating the application 
is fairly straightforward. On the other hand, after you’re in the program, you 
may have some hoops to jump through in choosing and joining a drug plan 
and, when you’re in a plan, getting all the meds you need. Also, no question, 
people who receive Extra Help one year but don’t qualify the next face big 
disruptions. I cover these specific topics later in this chapter.
But first, you need to know how you can qualify for Extra Help and, if you do, 
how it can help pay for your medications. Extra Help benefits are available at 
five levels, mainly according to income. Table 5-1 explains these levels at a 
glance.

 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
Checking out examples of Extra Help at work
Here are some examples of how Extra Help 
works in practice (at 2009 rates):
  Louisa is very frail and lives in a nursing 
home. The little income she has from Social 
Security goes to Medicaid, which pays 
her costs in the home, leaving her a small 
allowance for personal needs. The full 
price of her medicines runs to $370 a month. 
But because she gets Medicaid and lives 
in an institution, she automatically qualifies 
for maximum Extra Help (Level 1) and pays 
nothing for her prescription drugs.
  Edward and Sue’s combined income 
is $12,750 a year, and they get medical 
benefits from their state Medicaid program, 
so they qualify automatically for full Extra 
Help under Level 2. The total, joint cost of 
their drugs is $550 a month. Under Extra 
Help, Edward’s four brand-name drugs and 
two generics cost him $15 a month ($3.20 
× 4 = $12.80; $1.10 × 2 = $2.20). Sue’s one 
brand-name med and six generics cost her 
$9.80 a month ($3.20 × 1 = $3.20; $1.10 × 6 = 
$6.60). Together, their monthly out-of-pocket 
expense is $24.80, saving them $525.20 each 
month, or $6,302.40 over the year.
  Cora has many health problems, and the 
meds her doctor prescribes add up to $1,220 
a month, or $14,640 over the year — unafford-
able for her without Extra Help. Because her 
state pays her Medicare Part B premiums, 
she qualifies automatically for full Extra Help 
at Level 3. She uses four brand-name drugs 
(including an expensive one for cancer) and 
four generics regularly. Her out-of-pocket 
cost is $33.60 a month ($6.00 × 4 = $24.00; $2.40 
× 4 = $9.60) for the first five months of the year. 
But then, because her drug costs are high, 
catastrophic coverage kicks in, and from 
June through December, she pays nothing. 
Over the whole year, her total expense is 
$168 ($33.60 × 5), and she saves $14,472.
  Carlton is a widower with an income that 
entitles him to partial Extra Help (Level 
5). He pays half ($14) of his Part D plan’s 
regular monthly premium, a $60 annual 
deductible, and 15 percent of the cost of 
his drugs. At full price, his drugs would 
cost $350 a month, or $4,200 over 12 months. 
Under Extra Help, they cost $52.50 a month 
(15 percent of $350). His total out-of-pocket 
expense over the year is $858 ($14 × 12 = 
$168 in premiums + $60 deductible + $630 
share of drug costs). He saves $3,342 over 
the year.
These examples reflect the 2009 maximum 
co-pays set in law. People receiving Extra 
Help can’t pay more than these amounts. But 
in some Part D plans, they may pay less. For 
example, if a plan normally charges nothing 
for certain generic drugs, Extra Help enrollees 
in that plan don’t pay anything for them either. 
(So if Cora were in a plan like this, she’d get her 
four generics free and save $48 more over the 
year.) And if a plan has no deductible, people 
receiving partial Extra Help receive coverage 
right away and don’t have to pay their reduced 
deductible. (So Carlton would save a further $60 
in a no-deductible plan.)

Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
 
From Table 5-1, you see that
 
 People who receive full Medicaid benefits and live in nursing homes or 
other types of institutionalized long-term care (Level 1) automatically 
qualify for full Extra Help and pay nothing for their medications.
 
 People who receive benefits from Medicaid or some other government 
programs that pay their Medicare premiums or provide supplemental 
income (Levels 2 and 3) automatically qualify for full Extra Help and pay 
a small amount for prescriptions.
 
 Others who aren’t enrolled in any of these programs but whose monthly 
incomes are still below certain dollar amounts (Levels 4 and 5) must 
apply for Extra Help.
 
 People in Levels 4 and 5 have their assets (mainly savings), as well as 
their incomes, taken into account to qualify for Extra Help.
 
 People in Level 4 receive full Extra Help benefits and pay the same 
co-pays as those in Level 3, but don’t qualify automatically. They must 
apply for Extra Help.
 
 People in the highest qualifying income group (Level 5) receive “partial” Extra 
Help. They pay a share of their plan’s premium on a sliding scale according 
to income, a reduced annual deductible (about one-fifth of the regular Part D 
deductible), and up to 15 percent of the cost of each prescription.
 
 People in Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 pay nothing for catastrophic coverage, 
which kicks in after their drug costs reach a certain level in the year 
($4,050 in 2008; $4,350 in 2009). People in Level 5 have small co-pays 
after getting to that level. Everything the government contributes 
toward prescription costs through Extra Help counts toward the 
spending limit that triggers catastrophic coverage.
 
 Everybody, at all five levels, gets full drug coverage throughout the year. 
Nobody receiving Extra Help has to face the dreaded doughnut hole.
 
Income and asset limits increase every year. The Social Security Administration 
announces the new amounts in February or March, and they become effective 
immediately. These limits are higher in some circumstances — if you live 
in Alaska or Hawaii, have dependent relatives living with you, or have some 
earnings from work that aren’t counted. Any of these situations may give you 
a better chance to qualify for Extra Help than the income and asset limits in 
Table 5-1 suggest.
 
Extra Help co-payments (and the amount of the deductible for people in Level 
5 who receive the partial benefit) increase at the beginning of each calendar 
year and remain the same for that whole year.

63
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
Qualifying Automatically for Extra Help
 
You qualify automatically for Extra Help — without having to go through the process 
of applying for it or answering any questions about your income and savings — if 
you’re in Medicare and also receiving any of the following government benefits:
 
 Medicaid: This is the program in your state that provides healthcare 
benefits for people whose incomes are below a certain level. The 
program is generally known as Medicaid but may have other names 
in different states — for example, MediCal in California, MassHealth in 
Massachusetts, and TennCare in Tennessee. If you’re in Medicaid, you 
get Extra Help as soon as you become eligible for Medicare (Chapter 1 
explains the eligibility rules). Or, if you’re already in Medicare, you’d get 
it if and when you qualify for Medicaid.
 
 Supplementary Security Income: SSI is a federal program that provides 
monthly payments to people in certain categories (blind, disabled, or 65 
and older) whose incomes are very low.
 
 Medicare savings program: Three Medicare savings programs (offi-
cially designated QI, SLMB, or QMB) give varying help to people with 
low incomes and few resources to pay for the out-of-pocket costs of 
Medicare. If you’re in any of these programs, your state pays your 
Medicare Part B premiums (see Chapter 1 for Part B information).
 
 Medicaid medical spend-down programs: Some states have a system 
that allows people whose incomes are above the state limit for Medicaid 
to become eligible for it when their out-of-pocket medical expenses 
reach a certain level in a calendar year. If you’re receiving Medicaid in 
one of these medical spend-down programs, you automatically start 
getting Extra Help for drug coverage as soon as you become eligible for 
Medicare. Or, if you’re already in Medicare, you qualify for Extra Help 
as soon as your medical spend-down reaches the point of putting you 
in Medicaid. After you’re in the Extra Help program, you’ll continue to 
receive its benefits until the end of the calendar year. (See the later 
section “Determining Whether You’ll Qualify for Extra Help All Year and 
Next Year” for more about these programs.)
 
Jargon alert: People in any of these programs are known as dual eligibles in 
Medicare lingo, because they qualify for help from both Medicare and Medicaid.
If you automatically qualify for full Extra Help, Medicare should send you a 
letter telling you so. If you don’t receive this notice but are in one of the pre-
viously listed programs, call Medicare at 800-633-4227 to find out why.
 
Be aware that qualifying for Extra Help, even automatically, is only one step 
in the process. You still have to join a Part D private plan to get prescription 
drug coverage. You can sign up for a plan of your own choosing — but if you 
don’t do so, Medicare will pick one and enroll you in it, even though that plan 

64
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
may not be ideal for you. You’ll find more details about this in the section on 
choosing a plan later in this chapter.
It could happen that you qualify for Extra Help only after you’ve been in the 
regular Part D drug program for some time — for example, if your situation 
changes and you suddenly become eligible for Medicaid, Supplementary 
Security Income (SSI), or your state’s Medicare savings program. But be 
aware that it can often take months before the various government agencies 
get their paperwork sorted out and confirm your eligibility.
 
You have the right to be reimbursed for the money you spent on drugs dating 
back to the day you applied for Medicaid, SSI, or the Medicare savings pro-
gram. Your Medicare drug plan must return the difference between what you 
would’ve paid under Extra Help rules during this period and what you actually 
paid. But you can’t rely on your plan to automatically refund that money to 
you. Instead, you should contact the plan and ask for the appropriate refund, 
explaining the circumstances. If you still don’t get the money, call Medicare at 
800-633-4227 and report it. Or, if necessary, file a grievance against the plan, as 
covered in Chapter 19.
Applying for Extra Help
Perhaps your income and resources are limited but you’re not enrolled in 
one of the programs that qualify you for Extra Help automatically, as I explain 
in the previous section. In this case, you need to apply for Extra Help. You 
can apply at any time — when you first join Medicare; when you lose a job, 
become widowed or divorced, or experience any other change that lowers 
your income; or if you’re already in Part D and have only just realized that 
you may qualify for Extra Help.
Applying involves filling out a form and sending it to the Social Security 
Administration (not Medicare), which will then decide whether you qualify. I 
walk you through the process in the following sections.
Obtaining an application form
 
You must apply for Extra Help in writing on the official printed form or online 
on the Social Security Web site. Don’t use a photocopy or a form printed from 
the Web site — these can’t be scanned by computers, so they’ll just delay 
your application.
You can obtain a form in any of the following ways:
 
 By mail (without requesting it): You’re likely to receive an Extra Help appli-
cation in the mail soon after you sign up for Medicare. Social Security seems 

65
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
to send them out to virtually all new beneficiaries, even people who are still 
working and earning far more than the Extra Help income limits.
 
 By phone: Call Social Security toll-free at 800-772-1213. (If you’re hard of hear-
ing, call the TDD number at 800-325-0778.) Tell the representative that you 
want to apply for Extra Help to pay for Medicare prescription drug costs. You 
can ask for the form (in English or Spanish) to be sent to your home, or you 
can arrange to pick one up at your nearest Social Security office.
 
 Online: Go to www.ssa.gov and click “Medicare” on the top panel, then 
click “Apply for help with prescription drug costs.” You can use this 
form to apply directly online, but only in English. Before downloading 
the application form, it’s helpful to click the link headed “How the Online 
Application Works.” This page explains the process, including instruc-
tions on how you can save your work so you can leave the form partially 
completed and return again later.
 
 You can’t print out the form and mail it in — but a printout may be 
useful for a practice run before you make the proper application. (For 
more information about applying online, see the later section “Signing 
and sending in the application.”)
 
 In person: You can obtain a form (and help filling it out, if you need it) 
at your local Social Security office or State Health Insurance Assistance 
Program (SHIP) office. (To make an appointment at a Social Security 
office, call 800-772-1213. To call your SHIP, see the contact info in 
Appendix B at the end of this book.) Forms are also sometimes available 
in pharmacies, doctors’ offices, and senior centers.
Helpful tips for filling out the application
The Extra Help application contains four pages of questions, mainly about your 
income and savings. I provide tips for answering them in the following sections.
 
Don’t panic if you can’t answer all the questions! Answer as many as you can 
and send in the form. Someone from Social Security will be in touch to help 
you complete it. However, if you apply online, you must answer every ques-
tion before you can submit the form.
Getting instructions
You can get detailed instructions in English and 15 other languages (Arabic, 
Armenian, Chinese, Farsi, French, Greek, Haitian-Creole, Italian, Korean, 
Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese) by calling 
Social Security or by visiting its Web site. If you want these instructions 
mailed to you, ask for form SSA-1020B-INST plus the language you need. But 
you must fill out the actual application in English or Spanish only.

66
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Gathering information you need
 
Before you start, pulling together some information is useful. This info 
includes your Social Security number and recent financial records relating to 
any earnings, pensions, savings, life insurance, and investments you may have. 
You need to refer to these records to answer questions about your income 
and savings. You do not have to send in any documents to support what you 
say about your finances, but that doesn’t mean you can be untruthful! Social 
Security will likely compare what you say with information from tax records 
and other government sources.
Single or married status
Income levels are for either single people or married couples “who are living 
together.” If you’re married and living with your spouse, you can both apply 
on the same form. If only one of you is applying, you still have to provide 
your spouse’s income and resources. You count as single if
 
 You’re married but living apart.
 
 Your spouse is living permanently in a nursing home or another type of 
long-term care.
 
 You have a domestic partner or are in a common-law or same-sex marriage.
 
If you’re not sure whether you count as single or married for this purpose — 
for example, if it isn’t clear that your spouse will be in a nursing home perma-
nently — call Social Security for clarification.
Income
The income limits for qualifying for Extra Help go up slightly each year and 
are announced in February or March. The application form doesn’t actually 
say what these dollar limits are, mainly because they’re somewhat flexible. 
For example, the limits are higher if you
 
 Have relatives living with you who depend on you for at least half of 
their support
 
 Live in Alaska or Hawaii (where the cost of living is higher than in other 
states)
 
 Have some earnings that aren’t counted as income
 
 Have certain expenses related to disability that allow you to work
Otherwise, if none of these circumstances are applicable, the upper income 
limits in 2008 and the early part of 2009 are $15,600 a year for a single person 
and $21,000 a year for a married couple living together.
 
You should include the following as income:

67
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
 
 Pretax wages or earnings from self-employment
 
 Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, before deductions
 
 Veterans benefits
 
 Pensions and annuities
 
 Workers’ compensation
 
 Net income from rental property
 
 Alimony
 
 Payments from anyone (other than a government agency) to help pay 
for certain household expenses, as explained later in this chapter
You can leave out the following:
 
 Cash or credit acquired from a loan or through a reverse mortgage
 
 Federal income tax refunds and earned income tax credit payments
 
 Victim’s compensation
 
 Education grants and scholarships
 
 Help from food stamps or Meals on Wheels
 
 Help from a housing agency, energy assistance program, or public relo-
cation program
 
 Help paying for medical treatment and drugs
 
 Disaster assistance
 
If you’re not sure whether you qualify for Extra Help because your income 
may be a bit over the top, it’s still worth applying. Social Security doesn’t 
count every dollar of income toward the limits, so you may find that you qual-
ify after all. Also, remember that the income limits increase a little each year 
in February or March. You can find updated levels by calling Social Security 
or Medicare or by going to the chart in Section 3 of “Your Guide to Medicare 
Prescription Drug Coverage,” available online at www.medicare.gov/
Publications/Pubs/pdf/11109.pdf. You can apply for Extra Help at any 
time, so if a new level suddenly brings your income within the limits, you can 
apply at once.
Assets
Assets (also called “resources”) are the value of certain things you may own, 
mainly savings. The upper limit of this value increases from time to time. In 
2008 and early 2009, it’s $11,990 for a single person and $23,970 for a married 
couple living together.

68
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
 
You should include the following as assets:
 
 Bank accounts, including checking, savings, and certificates of deposit
 
 Proceeds of a loan if saved beyond the month they are received
 
 Cash kept at home or anywhere else
 
 Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s
 
 Stocks and bonds
 
 Mutual funds
 
 Real estate (other than your primary home)
You can leave out the following:
 
 Your primary home and the land it stands on
 
 Your vehicle(s)
 
 Personal possessions, including jewelry and furnishings
 
 Property you need for self-support, such as land used to grow your own food
 
 Burial plots
 
 Up to $1,500 (or $3,000 for a married couple living together) of the cash 
value of life insurance policies
 
Social Security rules for Extra Help don’t prevent you from spending down 
or giving away some of your savings to reduce them below the asset limit. 
Only what you have during the month you apply is counted. However, bear 
in mind that spending down may affect your eligibility for other assistance 
programs — especially Medicaid, which has strict rules about this — if you 
should need them within a few years.
Life insurance
The cash value of a life insurance policy means the amount you’d receive if 
you cashed it in right now. This is less than the face value of the policy, which 
is what you’d receive if it went to term. Most people have no idea what their 
policies’ cash value is, you’ll probably need to call your insurer to find out. 
Some types of life insurance — such as policies that can’t be cashed in before 
they come to term, or burial insurance where the benefit can be used only for 
funeral expenses — don’t count as assets. Note: Starting in 2010, life insurance 
will no longer count as an asset under Extra Help.
Funeral expenses
 
The application asks whether you expect to use money from your savings or 
investments to pay for funeral or burial expenses. Answering “yes” simply means 
you expect to do so, not that you have some amount ready and waiting for that 
purpose. Answering “no” will reduce your asset limit for qualifying for Extra Help 
by $1,500 if you’re single or $3,000 if you’re married and living together.

69
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
Dependent relatives
 
If you have any relatives — related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption — 
who live with you and depend on you (or your spouse) for at least half of their 
financial support, be sure to answer the question on household size. Every 
extra person raises the income limits and increases your chances of qualifying 
for Extra Help.
Help toward household expenses
The application asks whether anyone else (other than a government 
agency) helps you pay for food, mortgage, rent, heating fuel or gas, electric-
ity, water, and property taxes. If you answer “yes,” a part of the amount you 
specify will count as income. For example, if you live with someone who 
pays all these expenses each month, you’d add the amounts together and 
divide by the number of people in the household — then subtract from the 
total any contribution you normally make. The result is the amount you 
report on the application. Social Security will decide what portion of that 
amount would count toward your income. You don’t have to show proof of 
such help. Note: Starting in 2010, this assistance will no longer count as an 
asset under Extra Help.
Getting a hand with applying
 
Many circumstances — like being sick or recently widowed, to name just 
two — may make you feel that dealing with this application on your own is 
beyond you at this time. In that case, don’t hesitate to get help. All sorts of 
people can lend you a hand in applying:
 
 Someone you know: Anybody can help you fill out the application, or 
even apply on your behalf — a family member, a friend, a legal 
representative, a social worker, or anyone you choose to act for you.
 
 Free, expert personal help: Counselors at State Health Insurance 
Assistance Programs (SHIPs) are specially trained to personally assist 
people in sorting through their Part D options, including helping them 
apply for Extra Help or applying on their behalf. For the number of your 
local SHIP, see Appendix B at the end of this book.
 
 Help from Social Security: If you’re filling out the application on your 
own and need help on how to answer specific questions, you can call 
Social Security at 800-772-1213 (or the TDD number at 800-325-0778 if 
you’re hard of hearing) or visit your local Social Security office.
 
 Community groups: You may be a member of a church, senior center, 
or other community group that can assist you in filling out the form. If 
English isn’t your first language, an organization or group for people of 
your own nationality may be especially helpful in this regard. (Also, see 
Appendix B for sources of help in other languages.)

70
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Signing and sending in your application
Signing the form means you’re legally declaring that all the information 
you’ve given is true to the best of your knowledge. If you’re married and 
living together, your spouse must also sign the application, even if he or 
she isn’t applying for Extra Help at this time. If someone else signs on your 
behalf, that person should complete the section provided on the form for his 
or her name, address, and personal or professional relationship to you. Then 
you can submit the form by
 
 Using the printed application form: After you’ve completed and signed 
the form, just put it in the preaddressed envelope and mail it in. If the 
envelope is missing, send the form to the Social Security Administration, 
Wilkes-Barre Data Operations Center, P.O. Box 1020, Wilkes-Barre, PA 
18767-9910.
 
 Applying to Social Security online: Go to www.ssa.gov and click 
“Medicare” on the top panel. Then click “Apply for help with prescrip-
tion drug costs.” Remember to look at the instructions, as explained in 
the previous section “Getting an application form,” before filling out the 
form. You must answer all the questions before signing the form 
electronically and submitting it.
 
 Applying on the BenefitsCheckUp Web site: You can apply for Extra 
Help at www.benefitscheckup.org using the same Social Security 
online form. The advantage of going this route is that the site automati-
cally screens your information and lets you know whether you qualify 
for other benefits to help pay for prescription drugs and other living 
expenses. (I give more information about this Web site in the later 
section “Looking for help to pay other expenses.”)
Knowing what happens next
So you’ve sent in your application and crossed your fingers, waiting for a 
decision. What happens next?
 
 Social Security should send you a notice saying it has received your 
application and is processing it. If you don’t receive this notice within 
a couple weeks of applying, call Social Security to let it know you sent in 
an application for Extra Help, just in case your form has gone missing.
 
 You may hear from Social Security by phone or mail if it has addi-
tional questions. The agency will contact you if your application is 
incomplete or if some of your financial information doesn’t match other 
government records, for example.
 
 How do you know that the person on the end of the line is actually from 
Social Security and not just some scam artist trying to steal your Social 
Security number and financial data? If the call is legitimate, the person 

71
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
won’t normally ask for your Social Security number — unless the one 
you’ve given on your application appears incorrect — or for your credit 
card or bank account numbers. If you have any suspicions, hang up and 
call Social Security right away to check that the call was really from some-
one in that agency. (For more tips on avoiding scams, see Chapter 11.)
 
 You may receive what’s called a “Pre-Decisional Notice” saying that 
your application is likely to be turned down. This document specifies 
what information on your application will cause you to be denied — for 
example, that your income is too high or that your assets are above the 
limit. If this information is wrong, receiving the notice allows you time 
to correct it. You must do so within ten days of the date of the notice, 
by calling or visiting your local Social Security office at the number or 
address given on the notice.
 
 Social Security will decide whether you’re eligible for Extra Help. You 
should hear within 60 days of Social Security receiving your applica-
tion, maybe sooner. You’ll receive either a “Notice of Award” saying that 
you qualify for either full or partial Extra Help (see the earlier section 
“Understanding the Value of Extra Help” to find out how to tell the differ-
ence) or a “Notice of Denial” saying that you don’t qualify.
 
 If you’re told you don’t qualify, you can appeal the decision, as 
explained in the later section “Taking Action if You’re Denied or Lose 
Your Eligibility for Extra Help.” That section also looks at alternative 
ways of reducing costs outside of Extra Help.
Figuring Out Whether Extra Help 
Affects Other Assistance
You may hesitate about Extra Help if you think it may cause you to lose or 
reduce other benefits you’re receiving. Sometimes it can, but maybe not to 
your disadvantage. The money you save through Extra Help should far out-
weigh reductions in other benefits. In other words, you end up better off and 
with more cash in hand, even if you receive less in other assistance. Take a 
look at these situations:
 
 Food stamps and housing assistance: Medical expenses are taken into 
account in receiving food stamps and government housing subsidies. So 
if you pay less for your drugs under Extra Help, your food stamps will 
be reduced, and you’ll pay a larger share of your subsidized rent. But 
you’re still likely to be better off.
 
 Here’s an example: Sarah was paying $400 a month out of pocket for her 
prescription drugs before joining Medicare. But when she began receiv-
ing Extra Help, her monthly drug expenses dropped to $40. This meant 
losing $40 in food stamps. And under the formula used by her housing 

72
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
assistance program to calculate her new benefit — not a dollar-for-dollar 
reduction — she paid $108 more in rent. But what she saved on medicines 
($360) was more than her extra expenses for food and rent ($148). Overall 
she saved $212 a month, making her $2,544 better off over the year.
 
 Home heating/cooling assistance: Eligibility for the Low-Income Home 
Energy Assistance Program is based on income, without regard to 
medical expenses. So Extra Help does not affect it.
 
 Supplementary Security Income (SSI): Medical expenses aren’t taken 
into account in calculating eligibility for SSI. So even though Extra Help 
reduces what you spend in drugs (effectively giving you more cash in 
hand), you’ll continue to qualify for SSI.
Choosing a Drug Plan, Signing Up, 
and Switching Plans
Qualifying for Extra Help is just one step in the process. You still have to 
be in a Medicare drug plan to get coverage for your drugs. If you qualify for 
Extra Help automatically and don’t immediately sign up for a Medicare drug 
plan on your own, Medicare enrolls you in one. Medicare does this to make 
sure you continue to get your medications, especially if you’re being moved 
from Medicaid to Medicare for your drug coverage. Medicare may sign you 
up with a plan a month or two before you’re switched from Medicaid to 
Medicare — a move that’s intended to ensure your details are entered into 
the computer system and that everything will go smoothly at the pharmacy. 
(If it doesn’t go smoothly, you have a right to a 30-day supply of drugs to tide 
you over, as explained in Chapter 14.)
 
However, Medicare enrolls Extra Help people in plans at random. This is the 
computerized version of taking your name out of a hat and matching it to 
the name of a plan taken out of another hat. In other words, there’s no effort 
to put you into a plan that suits your needs, or even to ensure that the plan 
you’re assigned to actually covers your drugs. So you may find yourself in a 
plan that’s not ideal for you — unless you take action and choose a plan for 
yourself. You can switch to another plan immediately or whenever you want 
to, as explained in the next section.
 
You have the right to enroll in a Medicare drug plan of your own choosing — 
and you should do so by comparing plans carefully according to the drugs you 
take — just like anyone else (see Chapter 10 for details). But you should know 
about some details specific to Extra Help. I give you the nitty-gritty in the 
following sections.

73
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
Before you choose: Realizing that some 
plans may cost you more than others
In the earlier section “Understanding the Value of Extra Help,” I point out that full 
Extra Help entitles you to a zero premium. But there’s a catch. You can get that 
benefit only if you join a plan with premiums below a certain dollar amount.
 
Under Medicare rules, you don’t pay a premium if you’re in a plan with a 
premium that’s generally below the average of all plan premiums in your 
region in any given year (see Chapter 3 for an explanation of premiums). But 
if you join a more expensive plan — one with a premium above that regional 
average — you have to pay the difference between the average premium and 
the full premium. For example, if the average premium in your region is $30, 
and the premium in the plan you join is $37, you’d pay $7 each month for your 
drug coverage. (This rule doesn’t affect your low-cost Extra Help co-pays for 
prescriptions — they remain the same.)
 
This regional average (which bureaucrats call the benchmark) changes every 
year. That’s why, each fall, Medicare sends letters to some Extra Help benefi-
ciaries, warning them that if they stay in the plan they’re in for the following 
year, they’ll no longer be able to claim zero premiums, or in some cases, the 
letter tells them they’ve been automatically switched to a new plan that has 
zero premiums. So be sure to read any letters that come from Medicare or 
your plan during the fall (September to November) so you’re not caught off-
guard in January having to pay a premium you didn’t expect.
What were they thinking . . . when 
they created the asset test?
Well over 2.5 million people on Medicare have 
incomes limited enough to qualify for Extra 
Help — yet fail because of the asset test. Not 
surprisingly, many feel the test is deeply unfair 
because it penalizes those who, despite limited 
incomes, have managed to save a small nest egg 
toward their retirement.
Medicare never had any type of asset test before 
Part D began in 2006. But Congress created the 
test for Extra Help as a cost trade-off — without 
it, the program would’ve cost $35 billion more.
Lawmakers in favor of the test pointed out that 
other assistance programs, such as Medicaid, 
have long taken people’s assets into account 
when deciding eligibility. Nonetheless, consumer 
advocates have consistently lobbied against the 
Extra Help asset test from the beginning, and some 
members of Congress are working to eliminate it 
or raise its limits so that more people with low 
incomes can qualify.

Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Finding a plan with the premium you 
want and the drugs you need
In general, the process of comparing plans to find the least expensive one 
that covers all or most of your drugs is the same in Extra Help as it is for folks 
in the regular Part D program, as explained in detail in Chapter 10. But there 
are some differences, depending on whether you’re receiving full or partial 
Extra Help.
Using an online comparison tool if you’re getting full Extra Help
Under full Extra Help, your co-pays (being set in law) are the same under any 
Part D plan. But the premium you pay depends on whether you choose a plan 
with a premium above or below the regional average, as explained in the preced-
ing section. How can you tell which plans have these higher or lower premiums?
 
Fortunately, you can see this information at a glance on Medicare’s online 
Prescription Drug Plan Finder. (If you don’t have access to the Internet, you 
can get the same info in other ways, which I explain later in this chapter.) 
Before using the plan finder, you may want to look at the step-by-step instruc-
tions given in Chapter 10 on how to navigate it. Here are the variations if 
you’re on full Extra Help:
 
1. Go to www.medicare.gov and click “Medicare Prescription Drug 
Plans.” Then click “Find and Compare Plans,” and then “Begin 
General Search.”
 
2. Type in your zip code and answer the questions — in particular, the 
ones at the bottom of the page that establish what kind of Extra Help 
you qualify for.
 
3. Enter the names of all of your drugs, plus their dosages and how often 
you take them.
 
 You’ll then see a list of drug plans, starting with the least expensive.
 
4. Look under the Monthly Premium column to the right of each plan’s name.
 
 A zero dollar amount means you won’t have to pay a premium under that 
plan. A dollar amount shows what part of the premium you’ll pay if that 
plan’s premium is above the regional average. Click the name of any plan 
to see its details — in particular, whether it covers all of your drugs.
Using an online comparison tool if you’re receiving partial Extra Help
If you receive partial Extra Help, you pay 15 percent of your drugs’ full price 
under any plan. And your premium is a percentage of the plan’s regular pre-
mium — such as 25, 50, or 75 percent — calculated on a sliding scale accord-
ing to your income. How can you tell what you’ll pay for drugs and premiums 
under any given plan?

75
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
 
Again, you can use Medicare’s online plan finder to see instantly how much 
you’ll pay for your drugs. (You may want to look at the step-by-step instruc-
tions in Chapter 10 on how to navigate it though.) Go to www.medicare.gov 
and follow the steps outlined in the preceding section. But when you’re asked 
in Step 2 whether you receive full or partial Extra Help, click “Partial.” After 
you’ve entered the names of your drugs (plus their dosages and how often 
you take them — this is important in determining the price), you’ll see the 
list of plans in descending order of out-of-pocket expense. The premium you 
see given for any plan is what you pay, according to what percentage of the 
regular premium your partial Extra Help entitles you to. Click a plan’s name to 
bring up its details, and you’ll see what you’d pay for each of your drugs under 
that plan. This price is 15 percent of the plan’s full price. In other words, your 
premium and co-pays for drugs are automatically calculated for you.
Comparing plans if you don’t have Internet access
Comparing plans carefully is so important that this would be a good time to 
ask a relative or friend who’s savvy about computers to search the Medicare 
plan finder for you. Or you can get the same info in the following ways:
 
 By phone: Call the Medicare help line toll-free at 800-633-4227. Tell the 
customer representative that you’re qualified for full or partial Extra 
Help and give the names of your drugs, plus their dosages and how often 
you take them. (If you’re on full Extra Help, say whether you want only 
plans that will accept you for a zero premium or whether you’re willing 
to consider paying your share of a premium for more expensive plans. 
You can also ask for a full list of plans that won’t charge you a pre-
mium.) Ask for printouts of the most suitable three or four plans to be 
sent to you.
 
 In person: Counselors at your local State Health Insurance Assistance 
Program (SHIP) can help you find the plan that suits you best. To find 
your SHIP phone number, see Appendix B at the end of this book.
Moving forward if no affordable plan covers all of your drugs
Medicare doesn’t cover all medications. Some Part D plans cover most drugs 
that Medicare has approved and even some that Medicare doesn’t pay for, 
as explained in Chapter 4. But these are mostly “enhanced” plans that have 
higher premiums. In general, the lower-premium plans cover fewer drugs — 
and some of these plans cover brand-name drugs only if they have no lower-
cost, generic equivalents. So some people on Extra Help who are seeking 
less expensive plans — especially those needing a zero premium — may find 
themselves without access to some of the drugs they need.
 
This won’t necessarily happen to you — it all depends on the drugs you take. But 
if you do find yourself in this situation, what can you do? Consider these options:

76
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
 
 If you’re receiving Medicaid, your state may pay for the drugs your Part 
D plan doesn’t cover, or even those that Medicare doesn’t cover. To find 
out, and to get help applying, call your State Heath Insurance Assistance 
Program (SHIP). (See Appendix B for contact numbers.)
 
 If you’re in a State Pharmacy Assistance Program (SPAP), it may pay for 
drugs your Part D plan doesn’t cover. Contact the program to find out. (I 
cover these programs in more detail later in this chapter.)
 
 Ask your doctor whether switching to a similar drug (or drugs) that your 
plan does cover would be just as effective for you. This may lower your 
co-pays as well as give you coverage, as explained in Chapter 16.
 
 You have the right to ask the plan to cover a particular drug — by 
requesting an exception to the plan’s rules — if your doctor considers it 
necessary for your medical condition, as described in Chapter 4.
 
 You can choose to pay an extra share of the premium of an “enhanced” 
Part D plan that does cover all of your drugs.
 
 You can switch to another plan that does cover all of your drugs. In 
Extra Help, you have the right to switch plans at any time of the year, as 
explained in the next section.
Joining and switching plans
Joining a plan is easy. After you’ve picked the plan of your choice, you can 
sign up by calling the Medicare help line at 800-633-4227 (877-486-2048 for 
TDD users) or by visiting www.medicare.gov, as described in Chapter 12.
But there are some things to keep in mind about switching plans. Unlike most 
folks in the regular Part D program, you won’t be limited to enrollment peri-
ods or locked into a Medicare drug plan for a whole year. Extra Help gives 
you the flexibility to join or switch to another plan at any time of the year. 
Table 5-2 shows when you can switch from one Part D plan to another, and 
when your coverage begins in different circumstances.

You need to compare plans carefully to find one that suits you to begin with so that 
you won’t want to change, unless it becomes necessary. Why? Because it’s possible 
that switching (and especially switching often) could cause any of these problems:
 
 It may take time for your new plan to be entered in Medicare’s comput-
erized record system, which could cause delays in getting your meds at 
the pharmacy. (But see Chapter 14 for ways to avoid delays.)
 
 If you’ve requested and received from your present plan an exception 
that allows you to use a drug not on its formulary — or a prior autho-
rization before the plan agreed to cover a drug — you may have to go 
through the same process again in the new plan.
 
 If you’re paying any premiums at all, and these are being taken out of 
your Social Security check, you may find yourself paying two premiums 
for a while — for both the old plan and the new one. Why? Because com-
munication between Medicare (which knows you’ve changed plans) and 
the Social Security Administration (which cuts your checks) doesn’t 
always work as rapidly as it should. If this situation happens to you, call 
Medicare at 800-633-4227 immediately to complain.
An option to consider: Participating in a 
State Pharmacy Assistance Program
About 30 states have State Pharmacy Assistance Programs (SPAPs) in 2008, 
though over time new ones are introduced and others disappear. All help 
people whose incomes are limited (but too high to qualify for Medicaid) pay 
for prescription drugs. Some SPAPs have income limits above Part D’s Extra 
Help maximums and/or no asset tests.
Benefits vary a great deal among these programs. Some — including the long-
established and excellent programs in New York (EPIC) and Pennsylvania 
(PACE and PACENET) — provide comprehensive services that wrap around 
Extra Help and offer additional benefits, as well as assisting many Part D 

78
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
enrollees who don’t qualify for Extra Help. Other SPAPs focus on drug 
assistance for patients with a particular medical condition (such as HIV-AIDS 
or cancer) or offer discount cards to use at pharmacies.
For details on SPAPs, go to www.medicarerights.org/searchframeset.
htm or www.medicare.gov/spap.asp. You also can call 800-633-4227 and 
ask for a brochure to be mailed to you, or you can call your State Health 
Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) for this information. (See SHIP phone 
numbers in Appendix B.)
Determining Whether You’ll Qualify for 
Extra Help All Year and Next Year
I’m going to assume that you didn’t just win the lottery or suddenly inherit great 
riches from some distant relative you’ve never heard of. So you’re hoping you’ll 
continue to get Extra Help throughout this year and next year too. The following 
sections explain the circumstances that can cause you to lose Extra Help (or get 
a lesser benefit) and how you’ll know where you stand for next year.
How you could lose Extra Help
 
In most cases, you’ll still receive Extra Help until the end of the year — once 
qualified, you’re likely to receive the benefit until midnight December 31 of 
the same year, regardless of whether your financial circumstances changed 
during the previous 12 months. But there are some exceptions. If any of the 
following marital events happen during the year, you’re expected to report 
them immediately so your eligibility for Extra Help can be reviewed:
 
 Your spouse dies.
 
 You and the spouse you’ve been living with start living apart, divorce, or 
have your marriage annulled.
 
 You and your spouse start living together again after being apart.
 
 You get married.
These events wouldn’t necessarily result in losing Extra Help during the 
year. In fact, they could mean that you qualify for more Extra Help than you 
received before, if your income reduces. Any benefit changes — whether a 
decrease, increase, or loss of Extra Help — take place the month after you 
report your new circumstances.
 
Continuing to get Extra Help next year, starting January 1, depends on whether 
you’ve become financially better off this year. You can lose Extra Help (or 
receive less benefit) next year if

79
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
 
 Your income rises above the limits for Extra Help
 
 The value of your savings and other countable resources rises above the 
asset limits for Extra Help
 
 You cease to qualify for one of the programs that makes you automatically 
eligible for Extra Help — Medicaid, SSI, having your Medicare premium 
paid by your state, or being in a state Medicaid spend-down program
Finding out where you stand
What will happen next year, and how you’ll find out, depends on how you 
qualified for Extra Help in the first place, as follows:
 
 If you qualified for Extra Help automatically: If nothing has changed — 
that is, if you continue to receive Medicaid or SSI benefits, or are still having 
your Medicare Part B premiums paid by your state — you don’t need to do 
anything. You’ll continue to receive Extra Help. If you no longer get help 
from any of these programs, Medicare will send you a notice (headed “Loss 
of Extra Help”) saying that you no longer automatically qualify for Extra 
Help next year but that you can still apply for it. An Extra Help application 
should be enclosed with this notice.
 
 If you qualified for Extra Help through a Medicaid medical spend-
down program: As long as you continue to qualify for Medicaid benefits, 
you’ll still receive Extra Help. So if your medical expenses this year — 
for example, being in the hospital, going to the doctor, having lab tests, 
and so on — have been high enough to keep you on Medicaid at the 
end of the year, you’ll still get Extra Help next year. But if those medical 
expenses are no longer high enough to qualify you for Medicaid, then 
you’ll probably get a letter from Medicare saying you’ll no longer receive 
Extra Help starting January 1. However, even if you lose your Medicaid 
spend-down, you may still receive Extra Help automatically next year, 
depending on the timing of when you met your spend-down this year. 
If your name is in the system in July, when Medicare compiles its list of 
people automatically eligible for Extra Help next year, you’ll continue to 
receive Extra Help for all of next year.
 
 If you qualified for Extra Help by applying: In August or September, 
you may receive a letter and a form from Social Security asking whether 
your financial circumstances have changed. Not everybody receives 
this letter (which is headed “Review of Your Eligibility for Extra Help”), 
but if you do, you must fill out the form and return it to Social Security 
within 30 days. If you don’t return it, your Extra Help will end on December 
31. Social Security reviews your information and will notify you, saying 
whether you’ll still qualify for Extra Help next year and, if so, whether 
your benefits will change. For example, if your income has gone down, 
you may get lower co-pays next year — or, if it has risen above a certain 
level, you may get “partial” instead of “full” Extra Help. Any changes will 
begin on January 1.

80
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Taking Action if You’re Denied or Lose 
Your Eligibility for Extra Help
Being told “No — you don’t qualify” is a bummer. And it’s even more of a 
blow to lose Extra Help at the end of the year after you’ve already been 
receiving it. But in either event, you may still want to persist in getting Extra 
Help or exploring other ways to ease your expenses. The following sections 
explain some options.
Appealing a “no” decision
You can always appeal Social Security’s decision if you don’t agree with it. 
Here’s what to do, depending on whether you’ve been denied Extra Help or 
been told you’ll no longer be eligible next year.
If you’re denied Extra Help
 
You must appeal within 60 days of receiving a decision. (This deadline may 
be extended if you have good reason to miss it, such as being too sick to deal 
with it on time.) You can appeal in one of two ways:
 
 Request a telephone hearing. Call your local Social Security office or 
the SSA national help line (800-772-1213); or print an appeal request 
form from its Web site (www.ssa.gov), fill it out, and mail it in. You’ll 
receive a letter confirming the date of your hearing and the number to 
call. (You can ask for a conference call if you want someone who’s help-
ing you to be on the phone at the same time.) The letter also explains 
how to send in documents showing evidence that supports your case.
 
 Request a “case review.” This means having a Social Security agent 
review your application and any additional information or evidence 
you’ve sent in, but without being able to present your case in person.
After Social Security has reviewed your appeal, you’ll receive a letter notify-
ing you of the decision. If you win, you’ll receive Extra Help backdated to the 
first day of the month in which you originally applied for the benefit. If you 
lose, but still disagree with the decision, you can file a further appeal in a 
federal district court within 60 days of receiving the decision.
If you’re told that you’ll lose eligibility
Mistakes are often made in vast bureaucracies. So if you think you’ve lost 
eligibility by error or an unfair judgment, don’t hesitate to speak out. For 
example, if you’ve been told that you’ve lost your automatic right to Extra 
Help next year when you know you’re still enrolled in one of the programs 
that give you that right (Medicaid, SSI, having your Medicare premiums paid 

81
 Chapter 5: Extra Help: A Better Deal if Your Income Is Low
by your state, or being in a Medicaid spend-down program), call Medicare 
at 800-633-4227 immediately. If you got Extra Help by applying and are now 
told — wrongly, in your view — that your income or assets are too high to 
continue receiving the benefit next year, you can appeal to Social Security by 
the procedures explained in the previous section. The notification letter you 
receive from Social Security should also explain the process.
 
In general, if you received Extra Help automatically, you should contact 
Medicare to resolve problems. If you applied for Extra Help, you should 
contact Social Security.
Getting Extra Help another way
Even if you’re denied Extra Help or lose eligibility, you may still be able to get 
benefits in another way. Take a look at your options.
 
 If you lose your automatic right to Extra Help: You may still qualify 
by applying for it. The income and asset limits for Extra Help are higher 
than the qualification limits for Medicaid or SSI. You should apply as 
soon as possible after being notified that you won’t qualify automati-
cally next year, following the procedures explained in the earlier section 
“Applying for Extra Help.”
 
 If you applied for Extra Help but are denied or lose eligibility: One 
of the ways to qualify for Extra Help automatically is by having your 
Medicare Part B premiums paid by your state under one of the Medicare 
savings programs. The income and asset limits for eligibility vary state 
by state. But some may be a little higher than the limits for Extra Help, 
and some states don’t require an asset test at all. So if you’re denied 
Extra Help (or lose eligibility) because your income or assets are a bit 
over the top, you might consider applying for this assistance. There’s 
no guarantee that you’ll get it, because enrollment for these programs 
is often limited to the funds a state has available. But it may be worth 
trying — and if you get this state assistance, you’ll get full Extra Help 
automatically. Contact your State Health Insurance Assistance Program 
(SHIP) for information and help in applying.
 
 If you lose Extra Help but qualify again in the future: It may happen 
that you lose Extra Help on January 1, but become eligible again later 
in the year or in a future year. That’s possible if your income or assets 
once again dip below the limits, or if the new limits (which Social 
Security announces in February or March of each year) make you eli-
gible again. As soon as this situation happens, you can again apply for 
Extra Help. Or, if you’re in a Medicaid medical spend-down program 
and lose both your Medicaid and Extra Help benefits on January 1, you 
may qualify for both programs again later in the year as soon as your 
expenses once again rise to the required level.

82
Part I: The Nuts and Bolts of Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage 
Seeking other help to pay for drugs
 
If none of the options in the preceding section work out, you may be able to 
get other kinds of help to pay for your medications.
 
 A State Pharmacy Assistance Program (SPAP): If your state has an 
SPAP, contacting it to find out whether you qualify is well worth it. 
These programs vary, but some of them give additional help to people 
of limited means who are enrolled in the Medicare Part D program — 
sometimes with income limits that are much higher than those required 
in Extra Help and with no asset tests. (For more details, see “An option 
to consider: Participating in a State Pharmacy Assistance Program” 
earlier in this chapter.)
 
 Private and local pharmacy assistance programs: Some companies 
that manufacture drugs, some national organizations for patients with 
certain medical conditions, some charities, and some local assistance 
groups offer help paying for drugs. For details on these, as well as other 
ways of reducing prescription costs, check out Chapter 16.
 
 Falling back on the regular Part D program: The costs are higher and 
the benefits aren’t nearly as generous as under Extra Help, but you’ll still 
have insurance and pay less for your drugs than being outside of Part D.
Looking for help to pay other expenses
If you can’t obtain help paying for drugs, consider other federal, state, and 
local or private programs that might lower your other daily living expenses. 
Many people with low incomes are entitled to help in paying for food, hous-
ing, utility bills, and taxes, and they often don’t even realize they’re eligible.
 
The best and quickest way to figure out whether you qualify for any of these 
programs is to go to www.benefitscheckup.org. You don’t have to give 
your name. Just enter your zip code and answer questions about your income 
and circumstances. Details of all programs that you may be eligible for, and 
how to contact them, appear on the screen. These may include the Medicare 
savings programs and State Pharmacy Assistance Programs mentioned earlier 
in this chapter, among many more. If you don’t have computer access, you 
can get similar details from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program 
(SHIP; for contact info, see Appendix B).

Part II
Deciding Whether 
to Sign Up for Part D

In this part . . .
I
 make it easier for you to make a critical decision — 
should you sign up for Medicare prescription drug 
coverage?
For many of you, the question is whether you even need 
to consider Part D. That’ll be the case if you already have 
drug coverage from elsewhere, for example, from a cur-
rent or former employer or union; from a federal program 
for veterans, the military, or Native Americans; or from 
state assistance programs. In these situations, you may 
not need Part D — but you always need to check to be 
sure. I show you how to do that, as well as suggest impor-
tant factors to consider when deciding whether to switch 
to Part D or stay with the coverage you already have — 
and, in certain circumstances, how you can use Part D 
with your current coverage.
If you have no other coverage, you may be wondering 
whether you need Part D if you don’t take any prescrip-
tion drugs (or only the occasional one) right now. It’s a 
reasonable question. I help you arrive at your own answer 
by inviting you to consider all the angles.
And finally, I explain what the Part D late penalty means 
and how it may be a weighty factor in deciding whether — 
and when — to sign up for Medicare drug coverage.

Taking Other Drug Coverage and 
Sources into Account
In This Chapter
 Determining whether your other drug coverage is creditable under Medicare rules
 Choosing between your current coverage and Part D
 Using your current coverage to fill gaps in Medicare drug coverage
 Factoring in free or low-cost drugs from other sources
I
f you’re one of the millions of Americans who already have insurance for 
prescription drugs, it’s of utmost concern to know what will happen when 
you become eligible for Medicare. Will you lose your current drug coverage? 
Can you keep it? And if so, do you need to give Part D a second thought? This 
can be a head-scratching time, and maybe even a cause for real anxiety.
But don’t reach for the Valium yet (regardless of whether your prescription 
plan covers it). In this chapter, I explain the importance of finding out where 
your current coverage stands in relation to Part D — a step that’s essential in 
figuring out what to do next. Maybe you won’t have to do anything and can 
forget about Part D for now — but you can’t assume this without first finding 
out the facts of your own situation and how Part D rules apply to it. If you 
need to decide whether to stay with your present coverage or switch to Part 
D, I suggest some pros and cons to think about. I also explain the different 
kinds of drug coverage that can be used at the same time as Part D and how 
they fit together.
 
But first, you need to understand what counts as “other prescription drug 
coverage.” I’ve heard people talk about “my coverage” or “my plan” when 
what they mean is some method of obtaining low-cost drugs that isn’t actually 
coverage at all. Coverage equals insurance — in other words, a system that 
guarantees you protection from some of the costs of prescription drugs in the 
future as well as now. For quick reference, look at Table 6-1. It shows which 
methods of obtaining drugs count as coverage and which don’t. I highlight 
those that are not coverage, and how they compare with Part D, in the last 
section of this chapter.

Finding Out Whether Your Current 
Drug Coverage Is Creditable
Creditable is another of those Part D–speak words that you’ve probably never 
come across before. Creditable — not to be confused with credible (mean-
ing believable) — means something that can be credited or counted. Under 
Medicare rules, your current drug coverage is creditable if it counts as being 
at least as good as Part D coverage. This rule really matters. If the coverage 
you have now is creditable, you probably don’t need Part D. If it’s not 
creditable, you’ll need to make some careful decisions.
 
Bear with me for a moment while I explain more accurately what creditable 
coverage actually means. The common definition I just used — “at least as 
good as Part D” — is a convenient shorthand, but it’s also misleading. For 
example, I’ve heard people wonder why their employer drug coverage is 
regarded as “better than Medicare’s” when it’s actually costing them more — 
“If it’s better, shouldn’t I be paying less?” Or, conversely, wondering why their 
coverage isn’t creditable when it seems a whole lot better than Part D — “Hey, 
mine has no doughnut hole!” The answer is that creditability has nothing to 
do with whether you, as an individual, get a better deal under your own plan 
than you would under Part D. Instead, it’s a matter of accountancy. Your plan 
is considered creditable if whoever sponsors it pays at least as much money 
overall for everybody in the plan as Medicare would.
So in the following sections, I consider each kind of drug coverage listed in 
the first column of Table 6-1, how it fits in with Part D, and how to find out 

87
 Chapter 6: Taking Other Drug Coverage and Sources into Account
whether it’s creditable. What you need to do as a result of this information is 
detailed in the later section “Deciding Whether to Stay with the Coverage You 
Have or Switch to Part D.”
Drug coverage from a current or 
former (nonfederal) employer
I’m assuming in this section that you’re an employee or retiree who has drug 
coverage based on employment in a private company, nonprofit organization, 
or state or local government. If you’re a federal employee or retiree, whether 
military or civilian, you can go to the later section “Drug coverage for federal 
employees and retirees.”
What happens to your drug coverage when you retire?
Ever since Part D began in 2006, employers or unions have had a choice of 
several different drug coverage options for their retirees.
 
 The great majority of employers have continued their own coverage, not 
least because, under Medicare law, the federal government pays them 
large subsidies to do so.
 
 Some employers have modified their coverage so it fits in with Part D. 
(See the later section “Having It Both Ways: Using Part D as Well as Your 
Own Drug Insurance” for more details.)
 
 Relatively few employers have dumped drug coverage entirely, obliging 
their retirees to fall back on Part D — though this may occur more in the 
future.
So what may happen when you retire? Possible options include
 
 Your current coverage remains available to you.
 
 Your current coverage ends, but your employer or union agrees to wrap 
around Medicare drug coverage by paying some or all of your out-of-
pocket expenses in any Part D plan that you choose.
 
 You’re required to join a specific Part D plan as a condition for con-
tinuing to receive healthcare benefits from your employer or union. 
These benefits may or may not cover some or all of your out-of-pocket 
expenses in Part D.
 
 Your current coverage ends, but your employer or union contributes a 
lump sum annually toward your Part D expenses. This amount is subject 
to tax.
 
 Your current coverage ends, and your employer or union makes no 
contribution to your out-of-pocket expenses in Part D.

Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
As you approach Medicare age, the administrator of your health plan or your 
employer’s human resources department should let you know your options 
for health and drug coverage in retirement.
What happens if you retire before age 65?
Remember that you can’t join Medicare before turning 65 (unless you qualify 
at an earlier age because of disability), as explained in Chapter 1. So if you 
retire before you reach 65, you need to find out what health and drug cover-
age (if any) your employer or union will make available to you in the years or 
months that remain until you can join Medicare and enroll in a Part D plan.
 
If you won’t be covered at all during this period, you may qualify for the 
COBRA program, which allows people to buy between 18 and 36 months of 
continuing coverage after they’ve left or lost jobs that provide health 
insurance. To find out more about COBRA, go to the U.S. Department of 
Labor’s Web site at www.dol.gov or call the agency in your state that deals 
with labor and employment.
What happens if you work beyond age 65?
In many cases, employees with health and drug coverage who remain 
employed after they reach retirement age continue to receive their ben-
efits until they retire, regardless of age. However, some employers require 
employees to switch to Medicare (and to Part D for drug coverage) as soon 
as they become eligible at age 65, even though they’re still working. (If you 
work for a company or organization with 20 or fewer employees, you’ll prob-
ably be required to enroll in Medicare when you reach 65, as explained in 
Chapter 1.) Sometimes employees’ spouses who are younger than 65 
continue to receive the plan’s coverage until they, too, reach Medicare age. 
Your employer will notify you of any required changes before you turn 65.
How do you find out whether your drug coverage is creditable?
If you continue to receive full employer- or union-sponsored drug coverage in 
retirement or while working after age 65, you need to find out whether your 
coverage is creditable. You also need to know this information if you turn 
65 when you’re receiving COBRA temporary health insurance after losing 
or leaving a job. COBRA counts as employment-based coverage, so it comes 
under the same Part D rules.
The Medicare law requires your employer or union (or COBRA insurer) to 
inform you in writing whether your current drug coverage is creditable and, 
if so, whether it continues to be creditable from year to year. Your plan may 
provide this info in a letter, in its regular annual brochure, or in its Evidence of 
Coverage document that gives details of your coverage for the following year.

89
 Chapter 6: Taking Other Drug Coverage and Sources into Account
 
 If the notice says your coverage is creditable (or “at least as good as 
Medicare Part D coverage,” which is intended to convey the same thing), 
you don’t need to join Part D at this time.
 
 If the notice says your coverage is not creditable, it may or may not 
describe alternative options for you, but either way, you need to think 
carefully about what you do next. I cover points for you to consider in 
the later section “Deciding Whether to Stay with the Coverage You Have 
or Switch to Part D.”
 
This notice about creditability is hugely important. If you don’t receive it, call 
the plan administrators or your benefits department and insist that they 
provide this info in writing, as the law requires. (Most retiree plans can be 
relied on to send such notices, but employers sometimes forget to send them 
to employees who are still working.) If you’re told your drug coverage is 
creditable, make sure you keep the written confirmation in a safe place — 
together with any follow-up mailings in subsequent years saying that your 
coverage continues to be creditable. Hanging on to these notices is a sensible 
precaution, because if you lose your creditable coverage, you may need to 
prove that you had it in order to join Part D without incurring a late penalty. 
(I explain the late penalty and its implications in Chapter 8.)
Drug coverage for federal 
employees and retirees
If you qualify for medical coverage through current or former employment 
with the federal government, you receive prescription drug coverage in one 
of two ways:
 
 Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP): Drug coverage 
under this program for civilian federal workers, retirees, and their 
dependents is considered creditable. (For information or help on FEHBP 
benefits, go to www.opm.gov [or to www.opm.gov/retire if you’re 
retired] or call toll-free 888-767-6738.)
 
 TriCare for Life (TFL): This Department of Defense healthcare program 
is for active duty and retired members of the military who are enrolled 
in Medicare, and for their dependents. Drug coverage under this pro-
gram is considered creditable. (For information or help on TFL benefits, 
go to www.tricare.mil or call toll-free 800-538-9552.)
With drug benefits from either of these programs, you do not need to join 
a Medicare Part D plan. And if you lose this coverage, you can join a Part D 
plan without penalty as long as you begin Medicare coverage within 63 days 
of losing FEHBP or TFL benefits, as explained in Chapter 8.

90
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
 
You can be in either of these programs and have Part D at the same time 
(without losing FEHBP or TFL benefits) if there’s any reason to do so. One 
reason may be if your income is low and you qualify for Extra Help under Part 
D. For more details on using both sets of drug coverage, see the later section 
“Having It Both Ways: Using Part D as Well as Your Own Drug Insurance.”
Veterans drug benefits
If you’re a veteran and enrolled in the healthcare system run by the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), your prescription drug coverage is 
creditable. You do not need to join a Part D plan. This is also true of the 
CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs) program, which is available to a spouse, widow or widower, 
or child of certain veterans who were killed or disabled in the line of duty. 
In either program, if you lose this coverage, you won’t pay a late penalty on 
joining Part D as long as your Medicare coverage starts within 63 days of 
losing VA coverage.
However, Medicare rules allow you to be enrolled in the VA system (includ-
ing CHAMPVA) and in Part D at the same time. This can be an advantage, as I 
explain later in this chapter.
 
For more information or help on VA health and pharmacy benefits, go to www.
va.gov/healtheligibility, visit a local VA medical facility, or call the VA 
Health Benefits Service Center toll-free at 877-222-8387. For CHAMPVA 
information, go to www.va.gov/hac or call 800-733-8387.
Medicaid drug coverage
 
If you’ve been getting drugs from your state under Medicaid (also known by 
other names in some states, such as MediCal in California, MassHealth in 
Massachusetts, and TennCare in Tennessee), you can’t continue to do so after 
you become eligible for Medicare. Medicaid coverage is certainly creditable. 
But under the law, as soon as you turn 65 (or qualify for Medicare at an earlier 
age through disability), you must receive your drugs from Medicare Part D, 
not Medicaid.
You’ll also automatically qualify for very low-cost coverage under Part D’s 
Extra Help program. If some of the drugs you need aren’t covered under your 
Part D plan, you may still be able to get them from Medicaid. Both of these 
scenarios are explained in detail in Chapter 5.

91
 Chapter 6: Taking Other Drug Coverage and Sources into Account
Drug coverage from a State Pharmacy 
Assistance Program
Many states have programs to help people pay for prescription drugs. But 
only some State Pharmacy Assistance Programs (SPAPs) offer drug cover-
age comprehensive enough to be regarded as qualified (which is different 
from creditable) under Part D rules. SPAPs become qualified if they meet 
Medicare requirements, the most important one being that they must 
coordinate with Part D by wrapping around it any extra benefits that they 
provide. (In 2008, 23 states have qualified SPAPs, according to Medicare: 
Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North 
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, 
Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands.)
 
Coverage from a qualified SPAP is definitely creditable. But this doesn’t mean 
you can choose to get coverage from an SPAP instead of Part D. If you’re 
already in a qualified SPAP, you’ll be expected to join Part D — and, most 
likely, to apply for Extra Help — as soon as you become eligible for Medicare.
That’s hardly a problem. Being enrolled in a qualified SPAP may greatly 
improve your Part D coverage in some or all of the following ways, depending 
on the specific program:
 
 Lowering your out-of-pocket costs: Some SPAPs pay some or all of Part 
D premiums, deductibles, and/or co-pays.
 
 Offering low-cost coverage even if you don’t qualify for Part D’s Extra 
Help program: SPAPs’ income limits are generally higher than those 
required for Extra Help — and usually there are no asset tests — so you 
have a greater chance of qualifying, as explained in Chapter 5.
 
 Providing coverage in the doughnut hole even if you don’t qualify for 
Extra Help: Any payments an SPAP makes for your drugs in the cover-
age gap count toward your Part D out-of-pocket limit, as explained in 
Chapter 15.
 
 Covering needed drugs that aren’t covered in your Part D plan: Some 
SPAPs also cover drugs that Medicare excludes, such as barbituates and 
benzodiazepines, as explained in Chapter 4.
 
 Coordinating coverage with Part D as seamlessly as possible: I explain 
the ins and outs of this later in this chapter.
If you become eligible for Medicare while you’re in an SPAP, the program will 
inform you of what you need to do about Part D, help you enroll in a plan, 
and, if appropriate, help you apply for Extra Help.

92
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
Drug coverage for Native Americans
If you’re an American Indian or an Alaskan Native Elder who gets prescription 
drugs from the Indian Health Service, a Tribal Health Organization, or the 
Urban Indian Health program, your drug coverage is creditable. You’ll be able 
to join a Medicare Part D plan down the road without paying a penalty. (But 
be sure to get a letter from your Indian healthcare provider saying that you 
have creditable coverage.)
 
Right now you may be getting your drugs free or at low cost from an Indian 
health pharmacy if you’re enrolled in one of these programs, and this won’t 
necessarily change when you become eligible for Medicare. You aren’t required 
to join a Part D plan. However, it would be a big help to your community if you 
do. That’s because the drug plan pays part of the cost of your prescriptions — 
and pays almost all of the costs, in fact, if you qualify for Part D’s Extra Help 
program. This stretches the precious federal dollars that support your local 
clinic, allowing it to provide needed care for more people in your community.
As you approach age 65, visit your clinic or contact the benefits coordinator 
of your health program to talk over what it would mean for you to join a 
Medicare Part D plan and, if your income is limited, to apply for Extra Help.
Drug coverage from Medigap insurance
Medicare beneficiaries can buy private insurance policies to cover some out-
of-pocket expenses of Medicare Part A and Part B and to fill in some gaps in 
Medicare coverage. These policies, known as Medicare supplementary insur-
ance or Medigap, are explained in Chapter 1. Until Part D began on January 
1, 2006, some of the policies included coverage for prescription drugs. But 
the Medicare law prohibited new policies with drug coverage from being 
sold after that date; it also barred people from having this kind of policy and 
being enrolled in a Part D plan at the same time. So if you still have a Medigap 
policy with drug coverage, it means you bought it before 2006 and haven’t 
yet joined Part D.
Most Medigap policies aren’t considered creditable compared with Part 
D. The standardized policies that include drug coverage — designated H, 
I, and J — are definitely not creditable. But some plans in Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, and Wisconsin (and some older policies dating from the 1980s 
and earlier in other states) may be creditable. You’ll have received a notice 
from your insurer saying whether yours is creditable. If it isn’t, you have the 
right to keep your policy — but you’d have to pay a late penalty (as explained 
in Chapter 8) if and when you decide to join a Part D plan for your drug 
coverage. I cover the implications of this in the later section “Understanding 
the Medigap dilemma.”

93
 Chapter 6: Taking Other Drug Coverage and Sources into Account
Drug coverage from individual insurance
People who are self-employed or who receive no group health coverage from 
their employers sometimes purchase individual health insurance policies. 
Such policies are the most expensive kind of health coverage on the market, 
so even people who can afford them are often relieved to give them up when 
they become eligible for Medicare.
If your coverage includes prescription drugs and you want to continue it after 
joining Medicare, you need to contact your insurer to find out whether it’s 
creditable under Part D rules. If it is creditable, you don’t need to join Part 
D. If it’s not creditable, joining a Medicare drug plan now would allow you to 
avoid a late penalty if you were to join one later on, as explained in Chapter 8. 
You can have individual insurance with drug coverage and be enrolled in Part 
D at the same time, as described later in this chapter.
Deciding Whether to Stay with the 
Coverage You Have or Switch to Part D
Stay or switch? Strangely enough, this decision doesn’t only affect people 
whose coverage isn’t creditable compared with Part D. As the costs of health 
insurance in general, and prescription drugs in particular, continue to climb, 
many retirees who are on fixed incomes but have employer or other cover-
age are beginning to find their health insurance less and less affordable. In 
some cases, Part D may offer a less expensive option. (See the nearby sidebar 
“What were they thinking . . . when they ‘allowed’ employers to dump drug 
coverage?” for more information.) But if you’re in either of these groups, you 
need to be aware of all the consequences before deciding which way to go. 
Look before you leap — and look before you stay.
In the following sections — assuming that you already know whether your 
current drug coverage is creditable — I outline what you need to consider 
when deciding what to do next. For quick reference, Table 6-2 shows at a 
glance whether different types of drug coverage are creditable and what 
action you may need to take, if any.

What were they thinking . . . when they “allowed” 
employers to dump drug coverage?
Employers can generally do what they want 
about health and drug coverage, unless 
they’re bound by a cast-iron union contract. 
Most employee health insurance comes with 
a caveat — the employer reserves the right 
to change the terms from year to year or end 
coverage completely. And as the cost of health-
care has risen inexorably, employers have been 
faced with three choices — eat the costs them-
selves, pass on more costs to employees and 
retirees, or terminate benefits. The result is that 
employer health insurance and retiree benefits, 
traditionally the cornerstone of the American 
health system, are steadily shrinking.
So what has been Part D’s impact? Experts on 
health benefits are unanimous in saying that 
without it the situation would be far worse 
for retirees. That’s because Congress didn’t 
“allow” employers to dump drug coverage. 
Far from it. Congress actually gave a big incen-
tive to employers to continue offering credit-
able retiree drug coverage after Part D went 
into effect — in the form of tax-free subsidies 
(continued)

96
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
Considering the other factor: 
Medical benefits
 
If you’re thinking about switching to Part D at all, your number-one 
priority is to find out what will happen to your medical benefits if you do so. 
Most employer or union health insurance combines medical and drug cov-
erage into one package — for you alone, or comprehensively for you, your 
spouse, and any dependent children — with a single premium. Of course, 
there are many variations. But whatever kind of deal you have, these are the 
questions you should get answers to, depending on your circumstances, as 
soon as possible:
(continued)
amounting to an average of 28 percent of their 
retirees’ drug costs. The result was that 82 per-
cent of large employers took the subsidy and 
continued drug benefits.
After Part D began in 2006, I invited 
readers of the AARP Bulletin to recount what had 
happened that year to their own retiree drug 
coverage. Hundreds sent in their stories. At 
one end of the spectrum was a fortunate 
retiree in California who said he was still 
getting the same generous coverage he’d been 
promised on retirement in 1990 — zero 
premiums, deductibles, and co-pays. At the 
other end were people who’d lost drug cover-
age they’d had for years and understandably 
blamed Part D: “We were thrown to the wolves,” 
said one. Between these two extremes were 
many experiences that threw light on some 
developments that retirees hadn’t expected.
Although some reported their premiums had 
gone down, many others said they were 
paying more — and sometimes the premium 
hike had been so great that some suspected a 
deliberate attempt to force them out of the 
plan and into Part D. Naturally, they wondered 
why their insurance was costing more when 
their companies were now getting fat federal 
subsidies. One reason, benefits experts say, is 
that the Medicare law didn’t require the sub-
sidy to be used to reduce retirees’ share of the 
costs — or even specify how it should be used 
at all. Another reason is that in recent years 
many employers and unions have put caps on 
healthcare spending, so when it passes a cer-
tain point, the extra costs automatically trigger 
a rise in premiums for everybody in the plan.
Some of these retirees, even with creditable 
coverage, chose to drop their employer’s 
plan and join a Medicare drug plan; and some 
reported saving enough money on premiums 
that they hoped would exceed any expenses 
they’d encounter in the doughnut hole, which 
hadn’t existed in their company plans. Others 
found that they couldn’t give up their drug 
coverage without also terminating their health 
coverage, not only for themselves but for 
spouses under age 65. And some found them-
selves in a single company-designated Part D 
plan that they were obliged to join as a condition 
for continuing to receive health insurance. “It’s 
been a learning experience,” one man said with 
feeling. Even so — at a time when benefits are 
shrinking and out-of-pocket costs are rising — 
Part D now provides a safety net for retirees that 
wasn’t there before.

97
 Chapter 6: Taking Other Drug Coverage and Sources into Account
 
 If I drop just my drug coverage, will I also lose my (and my family’s) 
medical benefits?
 
 If I drop my drug coverage, will my spouse (and/or dependent children) 
lose medical and/or drug benefits if he or she is under age 65?
 
 If I drop my drug and/or medical coverage, will I be able to get it back 
again if I want to return to my present plan?
 
 If I enroll in a Part D plan because my drug coverage isn’t creditable, will 
I (and my family) automatically lose my/our medical benefits?
 
 If I’m expected to enroll in a specific Part D plan as a condition of 
continuing to receive drug coverage, will I lose my (and my family’s) 
medical benefits if I choose to enroll in a different Part D plan?
These are critical questions. Chances are that your plan’s benefits manager 
will send you a notice before you turn 65 and each year afterwards inform-
ing you of your options for the next year under the plan’s rules. But if you 
haven’t received such a notice, or remain unsure of the rules, contact the 
plan immediately to find out where you stand.
If this all sounds too gloomy, let me say that some employer and union plans 
are more flexible than these questions may suggest. Some do allow enrollees 
to continue receiving medical benefits even if they drop drug coverage. Some 
plans will continue benefits for a spouse under age 65 who isn’t eligible for 
Medicare, even if the enrollee is no longer covered by the plan. And some 
plans allow enrollees who have dropped out to return at a later date. But, in 
general, these dispensations are more likely for Medicare-age people who are 
still working than for retirees.
 
If you have federal drug coverage under FEHBP, TFC, or the VA, you can choose 
to have Part D without risking any of your benefits. But be aware that if you’re a 
retiree with FEHBP or TFC and you cancel it entirely, you can’t get it back.
In the following sections, I delve into the details of two typical situations: 
when your drug coverage isn’t creditable but switching to Part D is scary 
because you’ll lose your medical benefits, and when your drug coverage is 
creditable but difficult to afford.
If your coverage isn’t creditable but switching is risky
 
What if your employer or union drug coverage isn’t creditable, but dropping 
it means losing your medical benefits as well? This is a real Catch-22 situation. 
Basically, you have three options:
 
 Stay with your plan and hope that its drug coverage will continue 
for as long as you need it. If drug benefits, or the plan itself, are termi-
nated in future years, you’ll face a late penalty upon joining Part D, as 
explained in Chapter 8.

98
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
 
 Stay with your plan and also enroll in a Part D plan (which means 
paying an additional premium) to avoid a late penalty in the future if 
you lose or drop your current coverage.
 
 Check with your plan to be sure that enrolling in Part D doesn’t 
automatically terminate your current drug and medical coverage. If it 
does, this isn’t really an option.
 
 Drop out of your plan and switch to Part D for your drug coverage and 
Medicare for your medical benefits. Before doing this, look closely at 
your plan’s medical coverage and compare it with your potential costs 
and benefits under the traditional Medicare program (on its own or with 
a Medigap supplementary policy) or a Medicare Advantage health plan, 
as explained in Chapter 9.
If your coverage is creditable but hard to afford
 
Before throwing out your creditable drug coverage, you’d be wise to carefully 
compare what you have now with what you’d get under Part D. Maybe your 
current benefits are difficult to afford because the premiums are much higher 
than they used to be — probably a lot higher than Part D premiums. But be 
cautious here and consider these points:
 
 If you’re married and your spouse is covered under your plan, you’re 
probably paying a single premium for both of you. In contrast, under 
Part D you’d each have to pay a separate premium.
 
 Part D has a gap in coverage (the so-called “doughnut hole,” which I 
cover in detail in Chapter 15), and your present coverage almost 
certainly doesn’t. If your costs are high enough to take you into the 
doughnut hole, this can greatly affect what you pay out of pocket for 
your drugs over a whole year. So you need to compare your likely over-
all drug costs under your present plan with those in the Part D plans 
that are available to you. I explain how to do this in Chapter 10.
And what about your medical benefits? This question isn’t as crucial for some 
people as others. Some retirees say that medical coverage under their union 
or employer plan isn’t worth much anyway. But you still need to compare 
those benefits with traditional Medicare, with or without a Medigap policy, or a 
Medicare Advantage health plan, as described in Chapter 9 — especially if, under 
the rules of your current plan, you can’t get it back after you’ve given it up.
Determining whether Extra Help can help
The Extra Help program provides comprehensive coverage that’s less expen-
sive than almost any drug benefits you could get elsewhere. (I say “almost” 
because a lucky few still pay absolutely nothing for their drug coverage under 
employer or union retirement plans.) So if your income is low, it’s worth find-
ing out whether you qualify for Extra Help, which I cover in detail in Chapter 5.

99
 Chapter 6: Taking Other Drug Coverage and Sources into Account
 
If you think you may qualify, don’t do anything about your current coverage 
until you’ve applied for Extra Help and received a letter saying that you’re 
eligible — because you don’t want to jump out of the plane (or in this case the 
plan) without a parachute. Also, you need to know whether you qualify for full 
or partial Extra Help. Compared to your current drug coverage, full benefits 
may give you a better deal, but partial benefits may not.
What if you do qualify? Remember that you can get Extra Help only if you join 
a Part D plan. So all the questions I raised in the earlier section “Considering 
the other factor: Medical benefits” about how joining Part D may affect the 
medical side of your health coverage apply here too. If they do, you should 
ask your benefits administrator whether any exceptions are made for people 
who qualify for Extra Help.
 
But the most important factor in considering Extra Help is whether you’d have 
to drop your current coverage and, if so, whether you could get it back again 
if you needed to in the future. Some employer and union plans allow people to 
return. For example, the federal health plans (FEHBP, TFL, VA, and CHAMPVA) 
don’t require enrollees to drop drug coverage if they join Part D, whether or 
not they receive Extra Help. Anyone else should check with their current plan, 
because Extra Help doesn’t automatically continue year after year. If your 
circumstances change — for example, if your income rises above the limits — 
you could lose it.
Understanding the Medigap dilemma
If you still have Medigap supplementary insurance that includes coverage for 
prescription drugs, and you know that this coverage isn’t creditable under 
Part D rules, you already face a late penalty if you switch to a Medicare drug 
plan now. (Ouch!) So should you stay with your Medigap policy or cut your 
losses and switch to Part D? Here are some points to consider:
 
 The premium for your Medigap policy will probably increase a lot as 
the years go by. This is because no new policies that include drug 
coverage have been sold since the end of 2005 and, by law, can’t be sold 
in the future. Also, the majority of people who had these policies before 
2006 switched to Part D then. So over time, fewer and fewer people will 
be enrolled in your plan. As the enrollment pool dwindles, premiums for 
those who remain in the plan are likely to increase.
 
 The longer you postpone signing up for Part D, the more expensive 
it’ll be when you do finally join the program. The late penalty becomes 
larger each year that you delay, as explained in Chapter 8.
 
 Medigap plans with drug coverage are expensive, and premiums may 
rise as you get older. If you switch to a Medigap plan without drug cover-
age, your premium would be reduced substantially. You’d save more than 
you’d have to pay for Part D premiums, which don’t vary according to age.

Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
 
If you decide to switch to a Part D plan, remember that you can normally do so 
only during open enrollment from November 15 through December 31 each year. 
So if you miss this window one year, you’d accrue another 12 months of added late 
penalties before being able to sign up for Part D the next year. However, if you lose 
your Medigap coverage through no fault of your own — such as the plan ceasing 
business — you can sign up for a Part D plan at other times of the year.
What about the medical benefits of your Medigap policy? If you drop drug 
coverage from your current Medigap plan, you can choose to stay in it for 
your medical benefits on the same guaranteed terms. Alternatively, you can 
change to a different Medigap plan. Doing so may mean paying a higher 
premium, especially if you have a pre-existing health condition, though some 
insurers may voluntarily waive such requirements in these circumstances. 
(To find out more about the Medigap plans available to you, go to www.
medicare.gov and click “Compare Medigap policies in your area.”)
Having It Both Ways: Using Part D as 
Well as Your Own Drug Insurance
Having health insurance that wraps around Part D is useful because it fills in 
some or all of the gaps in Medicare drug coverage. Under current Medicare law, 
you can’t buy specific wraparound coverage for Part D in the same way that you 
can buy Medigap insurance to use with Medicare Parts A and B. Getting such 
coverage depends entirely on the health benefits you already receive.
In the following sections, I explain how different types of insurance fit with 
Part D. In most cases, you enter a complex and sophisticated system known 
as coordination of benefits. This is intended to streamline the process so Part 
D enrollees with other drug coverage pay what they should for prescriptions 
at the pharmacy without having to file separate claims. Medicare’s automated 
system records the details of each person’s coverage under different insurers, 
and pharmacists can access this information instantly by computer. (To see 
what to do if this system doesn’t work as intended, turn to Chapter 14.)
 
Medicare will send you a questionnaire, soon after you join the program and 
once a year afterwards, asking what other health and drug insurance you 
have, if any. You absolutely must fill out this form (legally, you’re required to) 
and return it. Providing this info ensures that all the details of any extra 
coverage you have are entered into the system so your benefits and required 
payments can be coordinated properly. (This applies to medical cover-
age as well as drug benefits.) Medicare encourages plan sponsors (such as 
employers) to file this information too, but doesn’t require it. So filling out the 
Medicare questionnaire is an important safeguard. It helps ensure that you 
won’t pay more than you need to. If you don’t receive this form, or if you lose 
it, call Medicare at 800-633-4227 to ask for one.

101
 Chapter 6: Taking Other Drug Coverage and Sources into Account
Employer or union coverage
If your employer or union plan no longer provides full drug coverage of its 
own, it may offer help by paying any (or all) of these expenses:
 
 All or some of your Part D premium
 
 All or some of your Part D deductible
 
 Your Part D co-pays (in total or up to a dollar limit)
 
 All or some of your out-of-pocket costs in the Part D coverage gap
 
Many employers or unions that provide wraparound coverage coordinate 
with Medicare. But some may require enrollees to pay out of pocket at the 
pharmacy and then claim reimbursement. Even if your plan coordinates with 
Medicare, keeping your pharmacy receipts is a good idea — at least until 
you know the coordination system is working smoothly, and especially after 
you’ve joined a Part D plan for the first time. The Explanation of Benefits 
statements that you receive from your employer/union plan and your Part D 
plan should reflect who has paid for what.
Federal drug benefits
Drug coverage from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) 
or from the military’s TriCare for Life program (TFL) is much more generous 
than Part D. However, you and any covered dependents of Medicare age can 
be in a Part D plan at the same time if it would be an advantage — for exam-
ple, if you qualify for Extra Help, because neither program offers additional 
benefits for enrollees with low incomes. If you do join Part D, your coverage 
will be coordinated with Medicare in the following ways:
 
 FEHBP: If you’re retired, Medicare is the primary payer. This means 
that your Part D plan pays for covered costs first; your FEHBP plan pays 
whatever remaining costs it agrees to pay under its rules. If you (or your 
covered spouse) are still working, FEHBP is primary.
 
 TFL: Medicare is the primary payer, whether you’re retired or still on 
active duty. TFL does not pay Part D premiums. But it does pay your 
out-of-pocket expenses for drugs that are covered under the TFL 
formulary. These include deductibles, co-pays, and the costs of drugs 
not covered by your Part D plan. If you should fall into the doughnut 
hole (as explained in Chapter 15), your TFL coverage becomes primary; 
you then pay the standard TFL co-pays for your prescriptions.

102
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
Veterans drug benefits
VA drug coverage, like the federal drug benefits in the preceding section, is 
also much more generous than Part D. The VA system covers more drugs 
than any Part D plan, has no premiums and much lower co-pays, provides 
coverage all year round (no doughnut hole), places an annual cap on co-pays 
for some veterans, and charges no co-pays for those with limited incomes 
who qualify. The only snag is that generally you must go to a VA facility to 
have a VA doctor write a prescription, and many vets live hundreds of miles 
from the nearest facility. Also, eligibility rules for getting VA healthcare 
(including prescription drugs) change from time to time.
The CHAMPVA program is somewhat different. You can fill prescriptions at 
retail pharmacies for 25 percent of the allowable cost, or get maintenance 
drugs free through the Meds by Mail program. No additional benefits are 
available for enrollees with low incomes.
Both programs allow you to enroll in Part D if you want to. Here’s how each 
fits in with Part D:
 
 VA: You can choose whether to have Part D or the VA help pay for your 
drugs on a prescription-by-prescription basis. There is no coordination 
of benefits between the VA and Medicare, but all you need to do at the 
pharmacy is show either your Part D plan card or your VA health 
benefits card. Of course, you can’t use both for the same prescription. 
The VA doesn’t pay Part D plan premiums.
 
 CHAMPVA: Medicare is the primary payer, but CHAMPVA pays up to 75 
percent of the cost of your Part D co-pays at retail pharmacies, or 100 
percent after you’ve met an annual $3,000 out-of-pocket limit. You aren’t 
eligible for the no-cost Meds by Mail program. CHAMPVA doesn’t pay 
Part D plan premiums.
Coverage from State Pharmacy 
Assistance Programs
State Pharmacy Assistance Programs (SPAPs) that are qualified under 
Medicare rules (as explained earlier in this chapter) are required to 
coordinate benefits with Medicare. If you’re in one of these programs, any 
extra benefits you receive are wrapped around Part D coverage, and SPAPs 
generally try to make the process as seamless as possible.
You should be able to get your prescriptions filled without having to bother 
about whether Part D, Extra Help, the SPAP itself, or, in some cases, Medicaid 
is actually helping to pay for them. If you have any reason to think you’re 
being charged incorrectly, contact your SPAP for help.

103
 Chapter 6: Taking Other Drug Coverage and Sources into Account
Individual health insurance
Is there is any reason to stay with health insurance you buy yourself instead 
of switching wholesale to Medicare and Part D? There may be, if you have 
dependents not yet of Medicare age and if dropping coverage yourself may 
mean having to apply again for insurance for the rest of the family, maybe on 
less favorable terms. You need to check the consequences with your insurer.
 
If you decide to stay with your policy and enroll in a Medicare drug plan, you 
need to contact your insurer to see how it fits in with Part D — for example, 
whether your insurance is primary or secondary and whether your policy will 
cover some or all of your out-of-pocket Part D expenses. If the insurer doesn’t 
coordinate benefits with Medicare, you may have to keep your pharmacy 
receipts and send them to your insurer for whatever reimbursement is 
allowed.
Factoring in Drugs from Other Sources
In the absence of insurance for prescription drugs, people turn to a variety 
of other sources to get them at less than retail cost. Often this happens in 
that twilight zone where uninsured folks in their late 50s and early 60s begin 
to develop health problems requiring medications but have not yet reached 
Medicare age. If you’ve been in this situation but are now approaching 65, 
you may be of two minds about what to do next. Perhaps you can’t wait to 
leap into the Medicare prescription drug program and start getting some 
help with costs. Or you may be among those who are just plain suspicious 
of Part D, or concerned that it’ll cost too much or be too much of a hassle to 
navigate — so why not stay with the system you’ve got?
I consider each of these alternative sources in some detail in Chapter 16 and 
cover how you might use them together with Part D, especially if you fall into 
the doughnut hole. But here I ponder a different question: Should you 
continue using them instead of joining Part D?
Certainly, doing nothing may seem easier than going to the trouble of 
choosing a Part D plan. But some other considerations may be more 
important: cost and certainty, for example. Here are some questions to ask 
yourself about your current method of obtaining prescription drugs:
 
 Will it provide the drugs I need reliably and indefinitely?
 
 Will it pay most of the costs if I suddenly need very expensive 
medications?
 
 Will it pay most of the costs if my income is very limited?

104
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
 
Most noninsurance sources aren’t reliable in the long term. Low-cost drugs 
from medical clinics, patient programs, charities, and state drug discount 
programs may decline through lack of funding. Free samples from doctors 
depend on which drugs, and for how long, the drug manufacturers offer them. 
Free or low-cost drugs directly from the manufacturers often come with time 
limits — and there’s no guarantee they’ll supply another drug you may need in 
the future. Pharmacy discounts — even those $4-per-prescription offers from 
some supermarket pharmacies — cover only a limited selection of drugs. Even 
drugs from Canada or other countries may be disrupted if the drug manufac-
turers succeed in blockading the trade, or the source countries try to stop it, 
or U.S. Customs intercepts supplies to American customers — all of which has 
happened.
Nor do any of these methods provide catastrophic coverage against very 
high drug costs, or continuous help for people with low incomes in need of 
multiple drugs, as Part D does. Not that Part D is perfect — far from it. But on 
the whole, except for the doughnut hole, it provides the certainty of insurance 
coverage. Having Part D and using one or another of these alternative sources 
to supplement it if necessary, as explained in Chapter 16, may be a better way 
of covering all the bases long term.

Chapter 7
Considering Coverage if You Take 
Few or No Drugs Right Now
In This Chapter
 Taking the insurance factor into account
 Finding a possible compromise — coverage at the lowest cost
H
ere you are in the pink of health and lucky enough not to be taking any 
prescription drugs — or perhaps only an antibiotic now and again. 
Maybe you’ve never needed anything beyond the occasional aspirin. And — 
even though you have no other drug coverage — you’re asking yourself why 
on earth you should pay out good money every month to a Medicare drug 
plan when you’d be getting zip in return.
No doubt about it, this is a major dilemma for healthy people. Of course, you 
have every right not to join Part D. Maybe even the threat of a late penalty — 
the higher rate you’d pay for drug coverage if you delay enrolling in Part D, 
as explained in Chapter 8 — doesn’t cut much ice with you. But I’m guessing 
that you also know, in your heart of hearts, that this isn’t really the point.
The real question is whether you can afford to be without drug coverage 
when you also lack a crystal ball — or any way of peering into the future 
to see whether you’ll fall prey to some unforeseen disease or injury that 
requires expensive meds to treat. That’s the insurance factor, and although 
Part D provides less-than-comprehensive coverage (unless you qualify for 
Extra Help, described in Chapter 5), it does offer protection against cata-
strophically high drug expenses that you may face if you’re diagnosed with a 
serious illness. It covers you if you need it and when you need it.
In this chapter, I assume you’re healthy, have no other drug coverage, and 
aren’t inclined to enroll in Part D, or at least not for now. I highlight factors 
to think about when weighing the current state of your health against future 
risks. And I also suggest a compromise — how to find a Part D plan that will 
cost you the least money while still giving you an umbrella for insurance.

106
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
Balancing Today’s Good Health 
against Tomorrow’s Risks
On the whole, human beings are optimistic by nature, and it’s often said that 
Americans are the most optimistic on earth. We don’t expect bad things to happen 
to our bodies, and we’re confident that, if ill health does hit us sometime in the far-
off future, medical science will be able to fix it. Well, increasingly, medical research 
is finding answers — and very often they come in the form of prescription drugs.
In this section, I play devil’s advocate. If you’re on the fence about joining Part D, 
then you’re figuring on being without any insurance against possible drug costs 
for months and perhaps years to come. So here I raise several “what ifs” about 
your chances of becoming ill and the potential costs of being without coverage.
The odds of getting sick
Around the time when the Part D drug benefit went into effect in 2006, I talked 
with a man in his 70s who passionately — and sincerely — argued against 
signing up. He described how healthily he’d lived, never smoking or drinking 
alcohol, always eating natural foods, and getting plenty of exercise and sound 
sleep. He believed that this long-held regimen would see him through, and 
he’d never need prescription drugs. I don’t know what happened to this man, 
though I hope his excellent health continues. But a few months later, a good 
friend of mine who’d pursued an equally healthy lifestyle — to the extent of 
never letting red meat pass his lips — suddenly developed Parkinson’s disease 
in his mid-60s. It seemed tragically unfair. But that’s the point of this parable. 
Life can be unfair. Lightning strikes out of the blue. Stuff happens.
Living healthily is always the best way of preventing or postponing the 
common maladies that come with the aging process. And yes, it’s also the best 
method of averting the need for many kinds of prescription drugs! Yet even the 
healthiest lifestyle can’t completely protect you against all medical setbacks. 
These certainly include
 
 Genetic diseases that medications can help alleviate
 
 Physical injuries that are treated with painkillers, muscle relaxants, and 
other medications to help restore body parts to working order
 
 Surgeries that require medications for postoperative care and complications
But let’s face it; most of us don’t lead rigorously healthy lives. We smoke; we 
drink; we sit on our fannies all day; we choose a salad and pour bacon bits 
and fatty glop all over it. Along the way, our bodies are silently clocking the 
damage and doing their best to repair it — until one day, in our later years, 

107
 Chapter 7: Considering Coverage if You Take Few or No Drugs Right Now
the bill comes due. Warning signs appear. And then the doctor confirms we 
have some condition we need to do something about. Sometimes that just 
means changing our bad habits. Often it means taking prescription drugs to 
minimize the problem’s effects or hold at bay a more serious medical event, 
such as a heart attack or stroke, that may otherwise occur.
 
I don’t want to belabor this point unduly, but when you’re figuring the odds 
against getting sick over the age of 65, it’s useful to know what the odds are. 
Here are just a few facts, culled from statistics collected by the Alliance for 
Aging Research on its Web site, www.silverbook.org:
 
 At least 80 percent of Americans age 65 and over have at least one 
chronic condition (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, 
arthritis, or vision disorders), and more than half have at least two.
 
 More than 1 in 5 Americans age 60 or older has diabetes.
 
 Among Americans age 65 to 74, 60 percent of men and 73 percent of 
women have high blood pressure.
 
 More than 37 million Americans 65 and older have one or more types of 
heart disease. The average age for a first heart attack is just under 66 for 
men and just over 70 for women.
 
 About 77 percent of all cancers are diagnosed in people age 55 and over, 
most often around age 70. More than two-thirds of prostate cancer cases 
occur in men age 65 and older. The greatest risk for ovarian cancer is to 
women in their late 70s.
 
 Alzheimer’s disease affects 1 in every 10 Americans over 65 and 
nearly half of those over 85. Parkinson’s disease affects 1 in every 100 
Americans over age 60.
The cost of going without drug coverage
One of the costs of waiting to enroll in Part D until the time you think you 
need it is the late penalty, which increases the amount you’d pay for Part D 
coverage for every month that you delay. You may think that delaying offsets 
the penalty if you save money by not having to pay premiums in the mean-
time. I delve into this very point, along with everything else you need to know 
about the late penalty, in Chapter 8.
 
But you have to remember that — except for certain circumstances, also 
explained in Chapter 8 — after you’ve missed your deadline for enrolling in 
a Part D plan, you can sign up only once a year during the open enrollment 
period in November and December. Missing that window doesn’t just mean 
another 12 months of added penalties. More importantly, it means another 12 
months without coverage.

108
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
If you fall sick and need prescription drugs during that time, you’ll pay the 
full cost out of your own pocket. That’s obvious — duh! But do you have any 
idea how much you’d pay compared to the cost of being in a Part D plan? Of 
course not — it would depend on the drugs you had to take. (Where’s that 
crystal ball when you need one?) But I can give you examples that illustrate 
the cost differences, and they may surprise you.
Retail drug costs versus out-of-pocket Part D costs
In Table 7-1, I show four brand-name drugs.
 
 I chose Fosamax because it’s commonly used to prevent or treat osteoporo-
sis, a condition that makes bones more fragile and likely to break. It affects 44 
million Americans (1 in 2 women, 1 in 8 men), most often after the age of 60.
 
 I deliberately chose the other three drugs as examples of those used to 
treat “lightning-strike” medical problems — the serious kind that can 
creep up on you without warning, until you get the diagnosis. Gleevec, for 
example, is used mainly to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a 
cancer that attacks bone marrow. Most of the 4,500 Americans who are 
diagnosed with CML each year are middle-aged or older, according to the 
National Cancer Institute. Gleevec is the most expensive drug on this list, 
but many anticancer meds cost a lot more, especially the new biologic 
ones that target cancers more specifically than older drugs.

I looked up the mail-order cost of each of these brand-name drugs at three 
online chain pharmacies, where you may well be buying your meds if you 
have no drug insurance. The results, in column three of Table 7-1, reflect the 
lowest cost for a full year’s supply.
Then I ran the numbers to see what you’d pay for the same drugs (whether 
purchased from a retail pharmacy or by mail order) under the Part D plan that 
showed up as the least expensive in my own state of Maryland. (Costs vary 
among states because the same plan may charge a different premium in dif-
ferent states. Also, the plan that proved the least expensive turned out to be 
different for each drug.) And, believe me, I played fair! The results, shown in 
column four, reflect not only what you’d pay for just one of these drugs over a 
whole year (including co-pays, deductible, and full price in the coverage gap, 
which I cover in Chapter 15), but also the plan premiums. (And remember, the 
premium stays the same, no matter how many drugs you buy.)
 
In other words, Table 7-1 shows the difference between the price of each drug 
when purchased retail and what you’d pay for the whole insurance caboodle 
under Part D. The results speak for themselves. In each case, the Part D plan 
works out much cheaper — and for the most expensive medicine, you’d save 
more than half the cost.
I also took the comparison one step further, in a way not shown in Table 7-1. 
I wondered whether the price of these drugs would be lower at Canadian 
online pharmacies than the American ones shown in the table. So I checked 
out a reputable Canadian pharmacy that advertises itself as having the 
lowest mail-order prices (and often does). Here are its prices for four batches 
of 90-day supplies over a year (including $40 a year for shipping charges):

110
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
 
 Fosamax: $476
 
 Prograf: $1,480
 
 Avastin: Not available
 
 Gleevec: $13,027
As you can see, only Fosamax is less expensive at the Canadian mail-order 
price ($476) than under the Part D plan ($556). Yet this plan’s overall cost 
would drop to $459 if the drug were bought in similar 90-day supplies by mail 
order instead of at a retail pharmacy. For the two other available drugs, Part 
D worked out far cheaper than Canada, even without mail order. And the 
price of Gleevec was nearly three times as much as the total out-of-pocket 
costs under the Part D plan. (If you’re curious about buying prescription 
drugs abroad, flip to Appendix C for details on how to do it safely.)
The high cost of stopping maintenance drugs without coverage
 
Ignoring Part D brings another potential cost. Without coverage, people 
are less likely to take the drugs they may need to actually keep themselves 
healthy. These so-called maintenance drugs are taken regularly to keep certain 
conditions in check — for instance, high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, 
osteoporosis, arthritis, and so on. Without those treatments, the risk of seri-
ous illness or injury rises hugely.
To take just one example: Untreated osteoporosis, which weakens bone 
tissue and greatly increases the risk of falling, is the most common cause 
of hip fractures. Such an injury can cause permanent disability or require 
hip replacement surgery that is extremely expensive. That too is a possible 
future cost — both physically and financially — of being without drug insur-
ance. And ultimately a much higher one.
Compromising on Coverage 
at the Lowest Cost
If you read the earlier sections in this chapter, you know that turning your 
back on Part D is at best a gamble on your future good health. But, naturally 
enough, you still may be disgruntled when you think about forking over 
money each month — possibly out of a Social Security check that buys less 
and less each passing year — and not getting anything back.
 
Here’s a possible compromise you can consider: Purchase coverage at the least 
possible cost by choosing a Part D plan that has the lowest premium in your area.
How low is low? That depends on where you live and the kind of Part D cov-
erage you choose:

111
 Chapter 7: Considering Coverage if You Take Few or No Drugs Right Now
 
 Part D stand-alone plans (PDPs) — the kind that provide coverage 
only for drugs and are usually purchased as an add-on to traditional 
Medicare medical coverage — vary a lot in the monthly premiums they 
charge. The same plan can charge different premiums in different states, 
but each plan must offer the same premium to all enrollees within a 
state. In 2008, every state has at least one plan with a premium of under 
$20 a month, and 28 states have at least one under $15 a month. Only 
Arizona has a plan costing less than $10. (Puerto Rico has a PDP with a 
premium of $2.60, and the U.S. Virgin Islands has one costing $4.30.)
 
 Medicare Advantage plans that include drug coverage (MAPDs) — the 
kind that combine medical and drug coverage in a single package — 
also vary a lot in their premiums. Many MAPDs charge zero premiums 
for both medical and drug benefits. In 2008, all states, the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico have at least one (and often many) MAPDs 
with zero premiums, though these plans aren’t offered in all counties 
or zip codes. (None of the other U.S. territories have any Medicare 
Advantage plans.)
 
You can easily find out the lowest premiums of plans in your area for 2009 
and subsequent years. This information is contained in the Medicare & You 
handbook that is sent to everybody on Medicare in October each year. You’ll 
find the list of PDP and MAPD plans that will be available to you in the follow-
ing year toward the end of the handbook. You can also find these details by 
going to the Medicare Web site at www.medicare.gov and clicking “Learn 
More About Plans in Your Area.” See Chapters 9 and 10 for more details about 
deciding on an MAPD or a PDP.
To give you a general idea, Table 7-2 shows the lowest premiums for PDPs in 
several states and how many MAPDs offered zero premiums in 2008. (Note: 
The asterisks in the MAPD columns indicate that the plans weren’t available 
in all counties.)

Among PDPs in the states, the lowest premiums range from $9.40 a month 
in Arizona to $18.00 in Alaska and Tennessee in 2008. These minimums are 
likely to rise in future years. Gone are the days of the $1.87 premium, which 
one plan offered in seven states in 2006, the first year of the Part D program, 
as a come-on to people to enroll.
 
MAPDs are likely to continue offering zero premiums as long as they keep get-
ting the extra federal subsidies that allow them to do so. Paying no premiums 
(except for the standard Part B premium) is attractive to people who can’t (or 
don’t want to) pay premiums for drug coverage, including those who don’t use 
prescription drugs right now. If you consider joining an MAPD plan for this 
reason, remember that the way you receive medical benefits is different from 
traditional Medicare, usually with restrictions on the doctors and hospitals 
you can go to and sometimes higher costs for certain services, as explained in 
Chapter 9.
 
One more thing: If paying the kind of premiums listed among PDPs in Table 
7-2 would be a hardship to you, you should look into whether you qualify for 
the Part D Extra Help program. If you qualify for full Extra Help benefits, you 
wouldn’t pay a premium at all, and qualifying for even partial benefits would 
reduce the premium. I explain the Extra Help program in detail in Chapter 
5. You can also check out whether you’re eligible for help under a State 
Pharmacy Assistance Program (SPAP) if your state has one. These too provide 
prescription drug coverage at a low cost.

Confronting the Late Penalty
In This Chapter
 Steering clear of the late penalty by enrolling in Part D when you should
 Understanding what you pay if you don’t sign up on time
T
he Part D late penalty basically sets a deadline. It’s a device for persuad-
ing you to join a Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible — 
and not just when you happen to feel like it. If the date of your personal Part 
D enrollment deadline passes and you enroll in Part D months or years later, 
prepare to
 
 Pay a penalty in the form of a surcharge that’s added to every monthly 
Part D premium for as long as you stay in the program.
 
 Face a higher penalty the longer you delay signing up for Part D.
 
 Experience a probable increase in your penalty cost each year.
 
 Pay a lot more for the same drug coverage over time than if you’d signed 
up for Part D as soon as you were able.
Heavy stuff, huh? People considering Part D often think the late penalty is 
unfair, though actually it exists for several reasons (see the later sidebar 
“What were they thinking . . . when they created the late penalty?”). Medicare 
strictly enforces the late penalty — and takes the view that being confused 
about Part D is no defense for signing up late. If you have no other prescrip-
tion drug insurance that’s at least of equal value to basic Medicare drug cov-
erage (or creditable; see Chapter 6), or if you’re not receiving Extra Help (see 
Chapter 5), every month that you delay enrolling in Part D makes the penalty 
bigger. That’s why I’m sharing its implications in the context of deciding 
whether you need to sign up for Part D right now. Very often, the late penalty 
is an important part of that decision — or a consequence of it.
So in this chapter, I explain how to avoid the penalty by signing up at the 
right time — depending on your individual circumstances. Then I describe 
how the penalty is calculated, how it grows ever larger over time, and 
whether putting off joining Part D is worth risking it.

114
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
Avoiding a Late Penalty by Signing Up 
for Part D at the Right Time
The only way to avoid a late penalty is to meet your own particular deadline. 
Getting the timing right depends on your situation, which is probably one of 
the following:
 
 You’re joining Medicare right now (or are about to do so) but don’t have 
good drug coverage.
 
 You already have good drug coverage from another source (such as an 
employer health plan) but are about to lose it or drop it.
 
 You’re just returning to live in the United States after living abroad.
 
 You’ve just been released from prison.
What were they thinking . . . when they 
created the late penalty?
If you’re like many people, you probably feel 
indignant about the late penalty. How can 
joining the Medicare drug program be voluntary 
if you’re going to be penalized for not signing up 
on time? Why can’t you wait to join Part D until 
you need it, or when you choose to? Here are 
the arguments:
  Part D gives protection against future risks, 
just like any other form of insurance. You 
buy home insurance in case the basement 
catches fire; you buy car insurance in case 
you total the station wagon.
  If no one joined Part D until she needed 
prescription drugs, the system couldn’t 
function. Here comes that insurance 
concept again: Healthy people must be in 
the system to spread the financial risk and 
hold down costs. If only sick people enrolled, 
drug coverage would be so expensive that 
most people wouldn’t be able to afford it.
  Part D isn’t the only Medicare program 
that has a late penalty. So does Part B, 
which imposes an extra 10 percent on the 
premiums for every year you delay signing 
up, for the same reasons given previously. 
But because almost everyone signs up 
for Part B as soon as they’re eligible, the 
fact that a late penalty exists often goes 
unnoticed. (Part B helps you pay to see a 
doctor and use other outpatient services; 
see Chapter 1 for details.)
Of course, Part D isn’t entirely insurance in the 
ordinary commercial sense. It’s also a benefit, 
and that’s why the late penalty seems a bit 
confusing. The federal government subsidizes 
your drug coverage in various ways — to a 
certain degree in the initial coverage period, 
and to a very large extent if your income is low 
enough to qualify you for Extra Help (which 
I explain in Chapter 5) or your drug costs are 
high enough to take you into the catastrophic 
phase of coverage. Nonetheless, Part D is built 
on insurance principles, with the late penalty as 
a cornerstone.

115
 Chapter 8: Confronting the Late Penalty
In the next few sections, I consider each of these circumstances and also 
provide a tip for sidestepping an obstacle hidden in the fine print that may 
trip you up if you don’t know about it.
 
If you miss your personal deadline for joining a Part D plan, your next chance 
to join is the annual enrollment period between November 15 and December 
31 (with coverage beginning January 1). See the later section “The Price of 
Missing Your Personal Enrollment Deadline” to find out about the costs you 
have to pay for letting your deadline slide.
When you join Medicare and don’t 
have creditable drug coverage
 
You can get Part D as long as you’re enrolled in Medicare Part A (hospital 
insurance) and/or Part B (doctor and outpatient services), as explained in 
Chapter 1. Whether you need to enroll in Part D at the same time as you sign 
up for Medicare depends on whether you have other drug coverage regarded 
as creditable under Part D rules. (Coverage is creditable when it provides at 
least as much value as minimum Medicare drug coverage. I explain this con-
cept and how it affects decisions about joining Part D in detail in Chapter 6.) If 
you have creditable drug coverage when you sign up for Medicare, you don’t 
have to sign up for Part D at the same time.
But what if you don’t have such coverage?
 
 If you’re turning 65 soon and don’t have creditable drug coverage from 
another source, you need to enroll in a Part D drug plan at the same time 
as you enroll in Part A or Part B to avoid a late penalty. That means sign-
ing up within the span of your seven-month initial Medicare enrollment 
period, which starts three months before the month you turn 65 and ends 
three months after it. For example, if your birthday is in April, your enroll-
ment period runs from the beginning of January to the end of July, and 
you need to enroll in a Part D plan in July at the latest (and start receiving 
Medicare drug coverage on August 1) to guarantee avoiding a late penalty.
 
 If you’re joining Medicare at a younger age because of disability and don’t 
have creditable drug coverage from elsewhere, the same rules apply. 
But in this case, your seven-month initial enrollment period begins three 
months before your 25th month of receiving disability 
payments and ends three months later. So, as in the preceding example, if 
your 25th month on disability falls in April, you need to sign up for a Part 
D plan in July at the latest to dodge a late penalty.
 
 If you join Medicare at a younger age due to a disability and incur a late 
penalty because you didn’t sign up for Part D at the same time, you get 
another chance when you turn 65. You can use the regular seven-month 
Medicare enrollment period around your 65th birthday to re-enroll in 
Part D and get rid of the late penalty.

116
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
 
 If your income is limited and you qualify for Extra Help (as explained in 
Chapter 5), by law you won’t be hit with a penalty if you sign up late.
When you lose or drop your current 
creditable drug coverage
 
If you have creditable drug coverage from another source, you don’t need to 
enroll in Part D when you sign up for Medicare, as explained in Chapter 6. But 
what if you lose that coverage? Or your coverage suddenly ceases to be 
creditable? Or you decide to drop it?
 
 If you lose creditable coverage involuntarily, meaning that you lose it 
through no fault of your own — for example, if your employer’s plan 
terminates or begins offering benefits that overall are of less value than 
Medicare drug coverage — you’ll qualify for a special enrollment period 
in which you can sign up for Part D without incurring a late penalty. 
That period lasts for 63 days after you’re notified that your creditable 
coverage will end or 63 days after the date it actually ends (whichever’s 
later). See the later section “What the 63-day rule really means” for some 
crucial details if you’re in this boat.
 
 If you deliberately drop your creditable coverage, perhaps if it becomes 
too expensive to maintain, you won’t receive a special period to enroll 
in Part D. Instead, you must sign up during the annual enrollment, which 
runs from November 15 to December 31 each year. To avoid a late 
penalty, you can’t go for more than 63 days without creditable cover-
age. So you’d have to keep your current coverage at least until the end 
of October, because your Part D coverage wouldn’t begin until January 
1. (Ideally, however, you’d keep your own coverage until the end of the 
year so you continue to be protected by insurance.)
 
You may find out that your previous sponsored coverage (which you’ve 
already lost or dropped) wasn’t creditable only when you enroll in a Part D 
plan. Then, almost certainly, you’ll be slapped with a late penalty. At that 
point, you’ll need to ask the plan for a reconsideration — a review during which 
your claim of not realizing that your previous coverage wasn’t creditable will 
be investigated. I cover this situation, as well as other circumstances in which 
people feel they’ve received a late penalty unfairly, in Chapter 13. That’s where 
I also explain in detail how to go about asking for a reconsideration.
When you return to the United 
States after living abroad
You can’t receive Part D coverage while living abroad, and you aren’t 
expected to sign up for it until you return to live in the United States 

117
 Chapter 8: Confronting the Late Penalty
permanently. (This rule is different from the one for Part B enrollment when 
you’ve been living abroad, which I clarify in Chapter 1.) When you return to 
the U.S., you can join Part D without risking a penalty in one of two ways, 
depending on your circumstances:
 
 If you turned 65 while living abroad: You get a special initial enrollment 
period (IEP) to sign up with a Part D plan on your return. This period 
lasts seven months — three months before the month of your return to 
the U.S., the month of your return, and three months after your return. 
Enrolling in a plan no later than the end of the month before you return 
ensures you can use your Part D coverage as soon as you arrive back.
 
 If you were eligible for Part D before moving abroad: You get a special 
enrollment period (SEP) on your return. You can enroll in a plan without 
having to apply for an SEP (as I explain in Chapter 17). The SEP begins 
on the date of your return to the U.S. and ends 63 days later. (See the 
later section “What the 63-day rule really means” for details.)
When you’re released from prison
You can’t receive Part D coverage while incarcerated in a prison or any other 
correctional institution, and your stay doesn’t count toward the Part D late 
penalty. In this situation, the rules are the same as for someone returning 
from abroad, as I explain in the previous section. If you turned 65 in prison, 
you get a seven-month initial enrollment period (IEP) to sign up for a Part D 
plan, lasting from three months before the month of your release to three 
months after. Otherwise, you get a special enrollment period (SEP) to sign 
up for a Part D plan, beginning on the day of your release and ending 63 days 
later. (See the following section for more on the 63-day rule.)
What the 63-day rule really means
 
The 63-day rule is usually explained as the time you have during a special 
enrollment period to enroll in a Part D plan and avoid a late penalty. But this 
explanation isn’t precisely accurate. Rather, you must be actually receiving 
Part D coverage within 63 days to avoid a penalty.
Say you lose your current creditable drug coverage on March 31. Counting 63 
days from that date brings you to June 2. If you leave it to the last minute and 
sign up with a Part D plan on June 1 or 2, you’re still within the 63-day time 
frame. But you’re not avoiding the late penalty because, under Part D rules, 
your drug coverage actually begins on the first day of the month after you 
enroll — in this example, July 1. You’re then penalized for one month without 
coverage, which may not amount to much money at first but can increase 
quite a lot with time, as I explain later in this chapter. So think in terms of 60 
days instead (or 59 if the time frame includes February), and you’ll be okay.

118
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
The Price of Missing Your Personal 
Enrollment Deadline
The purpose of this section isn’t to scare you half to death, but to give you 
a practical awareness of what the late penalty means so that — if it figures 
at all in the decisions you make about joining Part D (and it may not) — you 
can make an informed choice. Here, I explain how the penalty is calculated 
and how it can grow over the years. In the end, only you can decide whether 
ignoring the late penalty is worth the risk.
Looking at how the late 
penalty is calculated
The basis of the late penalty is something called the national average premium 
(NAP). Every fall, Medicare works out the average of all the premiums that Part 
D plans nationwide will charge during the following year. This dollar amount 
becomes the NAP for that next year. If you incur the late penalty, you’ll pay 1 
percent of the NAP for every month you were without creditable coverage and 
didn’t sign up for Part D. This formula works out at 12 percent a year.
 
If you miss your personal deadline for joining a Part D plan, your next chance 
is the annual enrollment period that runs from November 15 to December 31 
(with coverage beginning January 1). If you also miss that window, you have 
to wait another 12 months to sign up, increasing your penalty amount by 
another 12 percent. Every extra year of delay adds 12 percent to the penalty. 
Check out the following examples to see the math for yourself:
 
 Rebecca turned 65 and signed up for Medicare in March 2007. But by 
the time her personal enrollment period expired at the end of June, she 
hadn’t signed up for Part D (and had no comparable drug coverage). 
Her next chance to join Part D was during the open enrollment period 
between November 15 and December 31, 2007. She decided to do it, and 
her drug coverage began January 1, 2008. By then she was six months 
over her deadline (July through December). So her late penalty in 2008 
was 6 percent (1 percent × 6 months) of the 2008 NAP, which was $27.93. 
One percent of that amount is 28 cents. So Rebecca’s monthly late pen-
alty was calculated at 28 cents multiplied by 6 (her months without cov-
erage), which came to $1.68. Medicare rounds the penalty to the nearest 
10 cents, so Rebecca actually paid $1.70 a month in 2008, or $20.40 for 
the whole year, on top of her plan’s premiums.
 
 Brad was 70 years old and already in Medicare when Part D drug 
coverage began in 2006. Because the program was just starting, the 
initial enrollment period for that year was extended into May. But Brad 
couldn’t figure out what to do about Part D, and he let the deadline pass. 

119
 Chapter 8: Confronting the Late Penalty
He had another chance to sign up during open enrollment at the end 
of 2006, but he let that go by, too. Finally, he enrolled in a Part D plan 
at the end of 2007. By then, he’d been without drug coverage for 19 
months (June 2006 to December 2007). So in 2008, he paid a 19 percent 
penalty — 28 cents multiplied by 19, which came to $5.32. This amount 
was rounded to the nearest 10 cents, so Brad paid $5.30 a month, or 
$63.60 over the whole year, on top of his plan’s premiums.
Understanding how the late penalty 
can add up over time
Maybe the amounts in the preceding section’s examples don’t sound like too 
big of a deal. But that isn’t the end of it. Rebecca won’t pay the same penalty 
amount she was first assessed — $1.70 a month in 2008 — for all the years to 
come. Nor will Brad pay his penalty — $5.30 a month in 2008 — for as long as 
he’s in the Part D program. They’ll both pay a new penalty amount each 
successive year, and so will anyone else who has a late penalty. That’s 
because Medicare recalculates the NAP annually. If the NAP changes, the 
crucial 1 percent also changes — and so does everyone’s penalty amount.
One part of the calculation doesn’t change — the number of months anyone 
goes without drug coverage. For example, Brad will continue to pay a pen-
alty of 19 percent of the NAP due to the 19 months he lacked drug coverage. 
But the dollar amount of that 19 percent will change each year as the dollar 
amount of the NAP changes. So in 2009, he’ll pay 19 percent of the 2009 NAP, 
and the next year he’ll pay 19 percent of the 2010 NAP, and so on every year.
I cover the NAP’s yearly variation and provide some estimates of the effect of 
NAP changes over time in the following sections.
Wondering how much the NAP will change each year
If the NAP rises, everybody with a penalty pays more as time goes by. But 
the truth is, nobody knows how much the NAP will change annually. Even 
Medicare doesn’t know until September of each year when it works out the 
average of all Part D plans’ premiums for the following year. Whether the NAP 
rises or falls depends entirely on the plans.
 
Certainly you can find out what the NAP will be for next year. That informa-
tion is included in the Medicare & You handbook that Medicare sends to all 
of its beneficiaries every October. The last section in the handbook explains 
Medicare costs for the following year, including the Part D national average 
premium (referred to more bureaucratically in the handbook as the national 
base beneficiary premium) and the 1 percent penalty amount. (You can also 
read the Medicare & You handbook online at www.medicare.gov.)

120
Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
As this book goes to press, the 2009 NAP is unknown. So to date, only one 
NAP change, from 2007 — the first year the penalty was imposed — to 2008, 
has occurred. Between those two years, the NAP rose only 58 cents (from 
$27.35 in 2007 to $27.93 in 2008), which was far less than anyone expected. 
Will it always stay so low? Nobody knows. But it’s worth remembering that 
in these days of Part D’s infancy, the plans have tried to keep their premiums 
relatively low in order to attract customers. If the market shakes out in the 
future, with fewer plans competing, you can expect premiums to rise, taking 
the NAP upward as well.
Estimating how the late penalty may grow long-term
At this point, presenting a chart that shows exactly how much penalty 
amounts can grow over 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or more would be useful. 
Of course, that’s impossible due to the annual reassessment of the NAP. But, 
what the heck, I’m going to do some educated guesswork so you can at least 
get an idea of how those amounts can accumulate long-term.
The NAP may creep up very gradually by a dollar or less every year through-
out the next decade or so. Or it may jump around all over the place — going 
up by $5 or $10 one year, or even going down by a few dollars or cents the 
next. But here I make very conservative assumptions. In fact, in Table 8-1, I 
make a totally unrealistic assumption — that the NAP doesn’t rise at all, but 
remains basically the same ($28) as in 2008. Even so, you can see how the 
penalties mount up and become substantially higher with every year you 
delay joining Part D. (Note: These figures are raw calculations that haven’t 
been rounded to the nearest 10 cents.)

Now I’m going a bit further out on a limb, but still very conservatively. In

2009 through 2018 — so it becomes $30 in 2009, $36 by 2012, and $48 by 2018. 
And since these numbers are just raw calculations, I haven’t rounded to the 
nearest 10 cents.

Part II: Deciding Whether to Sign Up for Part D 
Deciding whether to risk 
ignoring the late penalty
 
I know what you’re thinking. You’re looking at that last figure in Table 8-2 — 
$1,411.20 as the possible accumulated ten-year penalty for someone who 
delayed signing up for more than three years — and wondering whether it’s 
less than what you’d have paid in premiums for those 40 months. It may well 
be. But before deciding to ignore the late penalty and stay out of Part D for a 
few more years, consider the following:
 
 Table 8-2’s numbers aren’t real. They’re purely a guesstimate. The actual 
penalty amounts may be higher.
 
 Table 8-2’s numbers only account for the next 10 years. Penalties accumu-
lated after 15 years or more — when you may be in your 80s and on a fixed 
income that doesn’t go as far as it once did — are going to be a lot higher.
 
 At present the monthly late penalty is calculated on 1 percent of the 
NAP. But Medicare law allows for this amount to be increased to 2 
percent at some unspecified future date. If that happens, the penalties 
would be doubled.
So delaying Part D enrollment is your choice — but recognize that it’s a 
gamble. Remember the famous line from Dirty Harry where Clint Eastwood is 
facing down a bad guy who doesn’t know whether Clint still has a bullet left 
in his .44 Magnum? He says, “I know what you’re thinking . . . [and] you’ve got 
to ask yourself a question: ‘Do I feel lucky?’ Well, do ya, punk?” Well, do you?

Part III
Choosing and 
Enrolling in the 
Right Part D Plan 
for You

In this part . . .
F
or many people, the most daunting part of Medicare 
prescription drug coverage is choosing a single 
Part D plan from among the scores that are available. But 
never fear. I walk you through the process with a focus on 
how to find the one that works best for you.
In Chapters 9 and 10, I help you whittle down all those 
plan choices to a manageable few so you can make an 
informed decision on the final one to pick. I explain why 
it’s important to first decide how you want your Medicare 
medical benefits delivered — either through the tradi-
tional Medicare program or through one of Medicare’s 
private health plans — and how this decision affects your 
choices for prescription drug coverage. Then I take you 
step by step through the process of comparing Part D 
plans — a strategy that focuses on your own individual 
needs and preferences and is less difficult than you may 
think, after you know how to do it.
Chapter 11 is something of a red alert. It warns you about 
scams and hard-sell marketing pressures to be on your 
guard against, and details how to avoid them. Finally, in 
Chapter 12, I explain how to enroll in a Part D plan if 
you’re doing so for the first time.

hoices, choices, choices. Part D has an abundance of them, and for 
many people, selecting just one drug plan seems a daunting task. But 
before you begin comparing drug plans (which Chapter 10 delves into), you 
really need to be clear about how you want your Medicare medical benefits 
delivered. This is a critical first step in the Part D plan selection process — 
and one that affects and automatically narrows your drug coverage options.
Broadly, Medicare medical benefits are available through two very different 
delivery systems:
 
 Traditional Medicare: The original government system, in place since 1966, 
traditional Medicare works on a fee for service basis — Medicare directly 
pays a portion of the costs of any medical service it covers to any provider 
that accepts Medicare patients. You, the patient, pay a percentage of the 
cost, or in some cases a fixed amount, for each covered service you receive.
 
 Private Medicare health plans: Collectively known as the Medicare 
Advantage (MA) program, these plans provide alternatives to the 
traditional system and are run by private, Medicare-approved insurers. 
Medicare pays each plan a monthly amount for each enrollee’s medical 
care. You receive your medical benefits through the plan of your choice 
and pay the charges required by the plan. Because plans vary greatly in 
their costs and benefits, you need to compare them carefully to pick the 
one that most suits your needs.

126
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Whichever type of coverage you choose, you’re still part of Medicare. But 
be aware that traditional Medicare and private Medicare health plans have 
big differences. Oh yeah, and then there are all the variations among the five 
types of Medicare Advantage plans — Health Maintenance Organizations 
(HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), Private Fee-for-Service 
(PFFS) plans, Medicare Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), and Special Needs 
Plans (SNPs). Not to mention yet another type of plan that isn’t strictly part 
of the Medicare Advantage program — an HMO known as a Medicare Cost 
plan. Complicating matters further, Medicare even has rules about which 
kind of drug coverage you can choose depending on how you receive your 
Medicare medical benefits.
If you’re already sure you want either traditional Medicare or a private 
Medicare health plan for your medical benefits — or are already in one or the 
other and want to remain in it — pass this chapter over and head straight to 
Chapter 10, which explains how to compare drug plans. But if you’re 
undecided, read on.
In this chapter, I explain the differences between traditional Medicare and 
the various kinds of health plans that fall under the Medicare Advantage 
umbrella, as well as a few other individual programs. I also suggest items to 
consider when making a choice between traditional Medicare and a private 
Medicare health plan. And finally, if you opt for the Medicare Advantage 
system, I explain how to compare the MA plans available in your area to find 
the one that suits you best.
The Features of Traditional Medicare and 
Medicare’s Private Health Plans
Your choice of medical care directly affects how you receive drug coverage:
 
 You can choose a stand-alone Part D plan — the kind that provides 
coverage only for prescription drugs — if you’re enrolled in one of the 
following:
 
• Traditional Medicare
 
• A Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plan that doesn’t offer drug coverage
 
• A Medicare Savings Account (MSA) plan
 
• A Medicare Cost plan that doesn’t offer drug coverage
 
 You can choose a Medicare HMO, PPO, SNP, PFFS, or Cost plan that provides 
both medical care and prescription drug coverage in a single package.
 
 You can’t have a stand-alone Part D plan while you’re enrolled in a 
Medicare HMO or PPO plan, even if it doesn’t provide drug coverage.

127
Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
Your choice of medical care also reduces the quantity of your drug coverage 
choices. For example, if your area offers 50 stand-alone Part D plans and 50 
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans that include drug coverage (by no means an 
uncommon scenario in urban areas), your options are instantly halved.
Good news: Nobody’s going to ask you to take a quiz on all of this information! 
But you do need to do some homework to make an informed decision about 
getting your healthcare from either traditional Medicare or a private health 
plan — and, if you choose the latter, about the kind of Medicare Advantage 
plan you prefer. The more thoroughly you understand the differences among 
all of these choices, the more likely you’ll be content with the one you pick.
Table 9-1 shows at a glance the main differences among traditional Medicare 
and the three types of private health plans most commonly chosen by 
Medicare beneficiaries. The following sections go further, with detailed 
information on all the plan choices available to you. In each case, I explain 
how each type of plan works with prescription drug coverage, to what extent 
you can choose the doctors and hospitals you go to, the eligibility rules, 
whether extra benefits (more than traditional Medicare covers) may be 
available, and what kind of out-of-pocket expenses to expect.

Traditional Medicare
Also known as original Medicare, traditional Medicare is the program you’re 
in, unless you opt for one of the private plans I describe later in this chapter.
 
 Eligibility: You must have Medicare Part A (hospital care) or Part B 
(outpatient care) or both, as explained in Chapter 1. To receive services, 
you can live anywhere in the United States or its territories.
 
 Choice of doctors and hospitals: You can go to any doctor or hospital 
that accepts Medicare patients (and is accepting new ones) anywhere 
in the country. You don’t need a referral from a primary care doctor 
to see a specialist. (To find a doctor enrolled in Medicare, visit www.
medicare.gov and click “Find a Doctor” on the home page. You can 
use this tool to search for a doctor by name, area, or specialty. Or you 
can always call Medicare at 800-633-4227 and ask for a list to be mailed 
to you.)
 
 Out-of-pocket costs: For outpatient care, you pay the standard Part B 
monthly premium ($96.40 in 2008 for most people; higher if your income 
is above $82,000 a year in 2008), annual deductible ($135 in 2008) and a 
percentage of the cost (20 percent in most cases, but possibly higher) of 
each Medicare-covered service. For hospital care, you pay a deductible 
($1,024 in 2008) for each stay up to 60 days in a benefit period and co-
pays for extra days, as explained in Chapter 1. There’s no limit on out-of-
pocket costs. You can buy private Medigap supplementary insurance for 

130
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
an extra premium to cover deductibles and co-pays in full or in part (see 
Chapter 1 for more about Medigap).
 
 Extra benefits: Traditional Medicare covers many kinds of healthcare, 
but by no means does it cover all the services you’re likely to need. For 
example, it doesn’t cover routine vision, hearing, and dental care. Medigap 
insurance may provide a few extra benefits, such as emergency care abroad 
and limited preventive care, depending on the policy you purchase.
 
 Prescription drugs: Traditional Medicare solely covers drugs used in 
hospitals or administered in doctors’ offices and clinics. You need to 
join a private stand-alone Part D plan, for an additional premium, to get 
coverage for outpatient drugs.
Medicare Advantage plans
You can choose among several very different types of plans within the 
Medicare Advantage program. Some types, such as HMOs and PPOs, have 
been part of Medicare for many years. (You’ll be familiar with the way 
these work if you’ve previously been in an HMO or PPO sponsored by an 
employer.) Other types of MA plans are much newer: Private Fee-for-Service 
(PFFS) plans, though available earlier, only became widespread from 2006 
onward. Medicare Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) and Special Needs Plans 
(SNPs) have been available in Medicare only since 2004. The following 
sections explain the key features of each type of MA plan.
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) offer managed care. This is a 
healthcare delivery system designed to hold down costs, typically by requiring 
primary care doctors to act as gatekeepers in referring patients to specialists 
and other services. HMOs operate locally in limited geographical service areas — 
usually a county or even a zip code. The same HMO may offer costs and ben-
efits different in one service area than in another that may be right next to it. 
Following are the main features of HMOs:
 
 Eligibility: You must have Medicare Part A and Part B and live within 
the service area of the plan you select. You can’t join an HMO if you 
have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) — but if you develop it when 
already enrolled, you can remain in the plan.
 
 Choice of doctors and hospitals: You must be treated by doctors and 
hospitals within the plan’s network of contracted providers in the service 
area, except in an emergency or if you urgently need care. You usually need 
a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist. (If the plan 
offers a Point of Service option, however, you can go out of network for a 
higher co-pay.) An HMO can supply you with its list of providers to help you 
find out in advance whether it covers your preferred hospitals and doctors.

131
Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
 
 Out-of-pocket costs: Whether you pay a premium in addition to the Part B 
premium depends on the plan. Co-pays for specific services are often less, 
but sometimes higher, than those in traditional Medicare. Some plans set 
a limit on out-of-pocket spending in the year, usually on specified services. 
If you go outside of the plan’s provider network (unless you have a Point 
of Service agreement), you’re responsible for the full cost of treatment, 
except in emergencies.
 
 Extra benefits: Some plans offer vision, hearing, and/or dental services 
(though the extent of this coverage varies a great deal among plans); 
routine checkups; and other extras, like health club memberships. 
These bonuses are usually reflected in higher premiums.
 
 Prescription drugs: Not all HMOs offer prescription drug coverage. If you join 
a plan that doesn’t, you can’t get coverage from a stand-alone Part D plan.
Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)
MA plans that offer managed care with fewer restrictions than HMOs are 
known as Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). Regional PPOs cover large 
areas, maybe several states. Local PPOs operate within smaller areas, such as 
in one or several adjacent counties. Their features include the following:
 
 Eligibility: Like HMOs, you must have Medicare Parts A and B and live 
within the service area of your selected plan. You can’t join a plan if you 
have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but you can stay in a plan if you 
develop this illness after enrollment.
 
 Choice of doctors and hospitals: You can go to a doctor or hospital outside 
of the plan’s provider network — but, if you do, it’ll cost you more in co-
pays. You don’t need a referral to see a specialist. A PPO can give you its 
list of network providers so you can see in advance whether your preferred 
doctors and hospitals are covered.
 
 Out-of-pocket costs: The plan you select determines whether you pay a 
premium in addition to the Part B premium. Co-pays for specific services 
are different from those in traditional Medicare (often less, but sometimes 
higher). Some plans set a limit on out-of-pocket spending in the year, 
usually on specified services. Naturally, going to out-of-network providers 
(except in emergencies or for urgently needed care) costs more, often a 
lot more, though typically not the full cost.
 
 Extra benefits: Some plans offer vision, hearing, and/or dental services 
(though the extent of this coverage varies a great deal among plans); 
routine checkups; and other extras, like health club memberships. 
These are usually reflected in higher premiums.
 
 Prescription drugs: Not all PPOs offer prescription drug coverage. If you 
join a plan that doesn’t, you can’t purchase coverage from a stand-alone 
Part D plan.

132
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans
Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans don’t offer managed care. They directly 
pay providers for each covered service, similar to the way traditional 
Medicare works (which sometimes leads consumers to confuse the two). 
Here are the main features of PFFS plans:
 
 Eligibility: You must have Medicare Part A and Part B and live in the 
service area of the plan you select. You can’t join a plan if you have 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) — but if you develop it when already 
enrolled, you can remain in the plan.
 
 Choice of doctors and hospitals: You can go to any doctor or hospital 
that accepts the plan’s conditions and payment rates, anywhere in the 
country, and you don’t need a referral to see a specialist. But many 
providers don’t accept PFFS plans, and it isn’t easy to find out in advance 
which do, except by asking doctors and hospitals directly. (However, 
starting in 2011, PFFS plans must have written contracts with providers.) 
In addition, providers are allowed to accept or reject the plan for each 
service visit. So if the plan covers your care from a particular doctor or 
hospital once, there’s no guarantee that you’ll be covered next time.
 
 Out-of-pocket costs: Whether you pay a premium in addition to the Part 
B premium depends on the plan. Co-pays for specific services may be 
different from those in traditional Medicare — either lower or higher. 
Some plans set a limit on out-of-pocket costs in the year, usually on 
specified services. If you’re treated by a provider who doesn’t accept 
the PFFS plan’s payment rates, you’re responsible for the full cost of 
treatment, except in emergencies.
 
 Extra benefits: Some plans offer vision, hearing, and/or dental services 
(though the extent of this coverage varies a great deal among plans); 
routine checkups; and other extras, such as health club memberships. 
These add-ons are usually reflected in higher premiums.
 
 Prescription drugs: Not all PFFS plans offer prescription drug coverage. 
If you join a plan that doesn’t, you can enroll in a stand-alone Part D plan 
to obtain coverage (unlike HMOs and PPOs).
Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plans
Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plans work very differently from 
other Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare gives an MSA plan a certain 
amount of money for each of its enrollees; the plan then deposits a portion 
of this money into a special health savings account for you. You draw on 
the money in the account to pay for medical care. If you use up the entire 
amount, you then pay 100 percent of your medical costs until you’ve reached 
the plan’s deductible limit. Beyond that limit, the plan pays all of your costs 
for Medicare-covered services for the rest of the year.

133
Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
MSAs offer the following features:
 
 Eligibility: You must have Medicare Part A and Part B. You can’t enroll 
in an MSA if
 
• You have health coverage through Medicaid, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA or CHAMPVA benefits), the Department of 
Defense (TRICARE military benefits), or the Federal Employees 
Health Benefits program
 
• You have other heath coverage (like a retiree plan) that would 
cover all or part of the MSA deductible
 
• You have end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
 
• You’ve already chosen to receive Medicare hospice care for a 
terminal illness (which is covered under Part A; see Chapter 1)
 
• You’ll live in the U.S. for fewer than 183 days in the year
 
 Choice of doctors and hospitals: You can go to any doctor and hospital, 
but the cost may be lower if you choose a provider that has a contract 
with the MSA plan to treat its enrollees. If the MSA offers this option 
(and not all do), you can ask the plan for a list of providers.
 
 Out-of-pocket costs: This type of Medicare Advantage plan has no premium 
(aside from the Part B premium) and no co-pays. You pay the full cost of a 
medical service out of the money deposited in your health savings account. 
After this money is used up, you pay 100 percent out of pocket until you 
meet your deductible. The account deposit and deductible amounts vary 
from plan to plan. For example, if the deposit is $1,500 and the deductible is 
$4,000, your maximum out-of-pocket expenses in the year would be $2,500. 
(Some other examples for account deposits/deductibles in 2008 include: 
$1,000/$2,750; $1,250/$2,275; $1,300/$3,000; $1,575/$5,000.)
 
 As long as you use the money in your account to pay for services that 
are covered by traditional Medicare, they count toward your deductible. 
After meeting the deductible, you pay no more for the rest of the year. If 
you don’t use all the money in your account, the balance rolls over and 
is yours to use the following year — regardless of whether you enroll in 
the same plan or another plan.
 
 Extra benefits: You’re free to use the money in your account for 
services not covered by Medicare (for example, routine eye and hearing 
exams), but these payments don’t count toward your deductible.
 
 Taxes: MSA accounts aren’t taxed, as long as they’re used for what the 
IRS calls “qualified medical expenses.” Each year you must report your 
account withdrawals to the IRS, using Forms 1040 and 8853, even if you 
aren’t otherwise required to file an income tax return.
 
 Prescription drugs: MSA plans don’t cover prescription drugs. You can 
enroll in a stand-alone Part D plan to receive drug coverage. You can 
use your MSA account to pay for your Part D premiums and co-pays, but 
these expenses don’t count toward your MSA deductible.

134
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Special Needs Plans (SNPs)
Special Needs Plans are relatively new additions to the Medicare Advantage 
program and aren’t available in all areas. They’re similar in structure to 
HMOs or PPOs (which I describe earlier in this chapter), but each individual 
SNP serves people in only one of the following specific categories:
 
 People who live in institutions (such as nursing homes)
 
 People who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid
 
 People who have at least one chronic or disabling condition (such as 
congestive heart failure, mental illness, diabetes, or HIV/AIDS)
I cover SNPs in more detail in Chapter 18. Here are their key features:
 
 Eligibility: You must have Medicare Parts A and B and live in the service 
area of your selected plan. To be accepted into an SNP, you must fall 
into the single category (one of the three previously described) that the 
plan serves. You can’t join an SNP if you have end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD), unless the plan specifically offers care for this condition.
 
 Choice of doctors and hospitals: If the SNP works like an HMO, you 
must go to the doctors and hospitals within the plan’s provider network, 
except in emergencies or for urgently needed care, and you need a pri-
mary care doctor to refer you to a specialist. If the SNP works like a PPO, 
you can go out-of-network for a higher cost and don’t need a referral to 
see a specialist. The plan may assign a care manager to help coordinate 
your needs for healthcare and other services in the community.
 
 Out-of-pocket costs: The plan you select determines whether you pay a 
premium in addition to the Part B premium. Co-pays for specific services 
are often less, but sometimes higher, than those in traditional Medicare. 
Some plans set a limit on out-of-pocket spending in the year, usually on 
specified services. If your plan requires you to see only in-network 
providers, going outside of it would make you responsible for the full 
cost of treatment, except in emergencies or for urgently needed care. If 
you have Medicaid as well as Medicare, your Medicaid program may not 
pay the SNP’s premium (if it has one), and you may pay different co-pays 
than those charged in traditional Medicare and Medicaid.
 
 Extra benefits: SNPs come with a built-in extra benefit in that they focus 
on your special circumstances or health condition and coordinate the 
services you need accordingly. Some plans offer vision, hearing, and/
or dental services (though the extent of this coverage varies a great 
deal among plans); routine checkups; and other extras, like health club 
memberships or fitness classes. These bonuses are usually reflected in 
higher premiums.
 
 Prescription drugs: All SNPs must offer prescription drug coverage.

135
Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
Three other types of Medicare health plans
Three types of plans don’t fall within traditional Medicare or the Medicare 
Advantage program and aren’t available in all parts of the country:
 
 Medicare Cost plans: These plans work like HMOs (which I describe 
earlier in this chapter), but, unlike MA plans, you can join a Medicare 
Cost plan if you have only Medicare Part B. If you go to doctors and 
hospitals outside of the plan’s provider network for Medicare-covered 
services, traditional Medicare pays for your services, leaving you 
responsible for paying the usual costs and deductibles that apply in 
traditional Medicare. You can join a Medicare Cost plan at any time (if 
it’s accepting new members), and you can also disenroll from it and 
return to traditional Medicare at any time. If the plan doesn’t offer 
prescription drugs, you can enroll in a stand-alone Part D plan.
 
 Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE): These plans 
combine medical, social, and long-term care for frail people age 55 and 
older who are eligible for nursing home care but live in the community. 
All of them cover prescription drugs. PACE programs are covered in 
more detail in Chapter 18.
 
 Medicare demonstration and pilot programs: These are special projects 
that Medicare uses from time to time in specific parts of the country to 
test improvements in Medicare health coverage. If you want to know 
whether any demos or pilots are available in your area and how they 
work, call Medicare or your State Health Insurance Assistance Program 
(SHIP). See Appendix B for contact information.
Deciding between Traditional Medicare 
and a Private Medicare Health Plan
Knowing the key differences among Medicare’s various health delivery systems — 
the traditional program and each type of private health plan, as described in 
the previous section — is essential in deciding which one to choose. Only you 
can make that decision. However, in the following sections, I highlight broader 
points to keep in mind when considering whether traditional Medicare or a 
private health plan is right for you. (I exclude PACE plans and demonstration 
or pilot programs here because their availability is limited.) I also touch on a 
situation that may not allow you a personal choice — being in a specific health 
plan chosen by an employer or union.

136
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Weighing the systems
When you join Medicare and intend to rely on it for your medical needs (that 
is, if you aren’t going to be receiving full benefits from elsewhere, such as an 
employer or union health plan), you automatically receive your care from the 
traditional Medicare program unless you specifically choose to switch to one 
of Medicare’s private health plans. Similarly, if you’re already in either 
traditional Medicare or one of the private health plans, you remain in that 
plan unless you take action to switch. In other words, you make the call.
 
Usually you can make this switch only during the annual open enrollment 
period from January 1 to March 31. (If you have Part D drug coverage, you 
also have from November 15 to December 31, as explained in Chapter 17.) 
Medicare allows some special circumstances for changing at other times of 
the year (see Chapter 17 for details). Also, you may have an opportunity to 
change your mind about the plan you join in certain situations, which I cover 
later in this chapter. Otherwise, you may find yourself locked into your choice, 
whether traditional Medicare or a private plan, for a whole year. So taking 
some time to consider which system you want is invaluable.
 
When making your decision, it may help to consider a wider perspective — how 
traditional Medicare and the Medicare Advantage program stack up generally 
in delivering healthcare. I take a big picture standpoint in the next several 
sections to touch on a range of issues: overall costs, premiums, co-pays, the 
long-term stability of costs and care, choice of providers and whether care is 
coordinated, extra benefits, and geographical service areas.
Thinking through these issues, and applying your personal preferences, 
enables you to settle on the Medicare system that works best for you. If you 
choose to go with a private health plan, see the later section “Comparing 
Medicare’s Private Health Plans and Making Your Pick” for details on 
comparing individual plans in your area. You can also use the online search 
tool suggested in that section to compare the details of individual plans with 
traditional Medicare’s standard offerings.
Overall costs
On the whole, most private plans offer lower costs to the consumer — sometimes 
charging no extra premiums — than traditional Medicare, for two reasons:
 
 Managed care plans (HMOs, PPOs, SNPs, and Medicare Cost plans) keep 
costs low by restricting care to their provider networks or by charging 
enrollees more to go out of those networks. They may also require enrollees 
to ask for prior authorization before covering certain kinds of treatment.
 
 Since a change in the law in 2003, Medicare has paid the private plans 
more on average for enrollees’ care than it pays for people enrolled in 
the traditional system. The extra payments allow the plans to charge 
enrollees less and/or offer better benefits than traditional Medicare.

Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
(This fact accounts for most of the advantages in the Medicare 
Advantage system, but these extras could be much reduced if Congress 
acts to remove the extra payments, as some lawmakers and consumer 
groups are pushing for. I touch on this possibility in Chapter 21.)
 
However, Medicare’s private plans may not be a less expensive option for 
everyone. The Government Accountability Office, which investigates public 
spending for Congress, recently reported that private plans generally charge 
enrollees more than traditional Medicare for services used by people with 
greater healthcare needs — those who require more (or longer) stays in 
hospitals and skilled nursing facilities or who use home healthcare services.
Premium costs
Many people in traditional Medicare pay three premiums: one for Part B, one 
for prescription drug coverage (Part D), and one for a Medigap supplemental 
insurance policy (see Chapter 1 for the basics of Medigap). Medigap insurance 
can’t be used to cover out-of-pocket expenses in private plans, so dropping 
that premium to join one may save you money. But unless you have a private 
health plan that provides drug coverage and charges no premium of its own 
(as some do), you still pay three premiums — for Part B, for Part D, and for the 
health plan itself.
Co-pay costs
Private plans usually charge fixed dollar co-pays for doctor visits, which may 
be less expensive and more convenient than the percentage of the cost that 
traditional Medicare charges. But in comparing all plans, look carefully at 
the hospital co-pays. Traditional Medicare has a standard deductible ($1,024 
in 2008), which is the limit you’d pay whether you’re in the hospital for one 
day or up to 60 days in a benefit period. (I explain hospital benefit periods 
in Chapter 1.) The private plans usually charge a daily co-pay for a certain 
number of days in the hospital and often no co-pays between that number 
and up to 90 days or more. If you’re in the hospital for five days and your 
plan charges a co-pay of $100 a day for the first six days, your bill would be 
$500 — or less than half what you’d pay under traditional Medicare at 2008 
rates. But if the plan charges $250 a day, the bill for five days would be $1,250 — 
or $226 more than traditional Medicare.
Furthermore, if you need to go back into the hospital within 60 days of being 
discharged, you won’t pay anything under traditional Medicare, because the 
deductible you’ve already paid for this benefit period covers your readmission 
stay. But under a private plan, you’re charged new daily co-pays for the number 
of days specified by the plan.
 
You can purchase a Medigap supplementary policy that pays your hospital 
deductible, Part B deductible, and co-pays in traditional Medicare, making 
your costs more predictable. Under Medicare rules, you can’t use Medigap to 
cover out-of-pocket expenses in a private health plan.

138
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Cost and benefit stability
Private plans can change their costs and benefits each year — for better or 
for worse. Traditional Medicare is more stable, but it increases the Part B and 
hospital deductibles each year, and the 20 percent coinsurance it charges for 
most services also tends to rise as healthcare costs in general go up. Services 
that traditional Medicare covers generally don’t change, although from time 
to time new ones are added.
Care stability
 
Traditional Medicare is there, year after year. Private health plans can choose 
annually whether to stay in Medicare or withdraw, or whether to enter or exit 
a particular service area. Occasionally Medicare doesn’t renew a particular 
plan’s contract. If any such changes occur, affected enrollees are notified in 
advance and can switch to another private plan or to traditional Medicare, but 
this change can be a disrupting experience.
Provider choice
The main reason people give for choosing traditional Medicare (or staying in 
it) is that they can go to any doctor or hospital they please. Or at least any that 
accept Medicare patients, and most providers still do. In contrast, the Medicare 
Advantage plans that offer managed care limit the choice of providers to those in 
their networks. However, this may be considered a benefit rather than a 
restriction if care is properly coordinated, as explained in the next section.
 
The growth of PFFS plans in recent years offers an alternative to managed care 
in that PFFS plans allow you to go to any doctors or hospitals that accept their 
payment terms. That’s fine if all the providers you want in your area accept 
the terms. But not all do, and it’s not easy to find out which ones accept a 
PFFS plan’s terms in advance of joining it.
Care coordination
Managed care has generally gotten a bad rap, because many people see it as 
too restrictive, especially in terms of provider choice. But when care is 
coordinated properly, as it’s supposed to be in HMOs, SNPs, and Medicare 
Cost plans, it can be of great benefit to the consumer. Because your care 
is handled and monitored by a single local system, you’re more likely to 
be encouraged to get tests and screenings early enough to prevent serious 
health problems later on, and less likely to be prescribed drugs that may 
interact badly with each other, for example. PPOs may offer elements of 
coordinated care, but not if you exercise your right to go to out-of-network 
providers or see specialists without a referral. Traditional Medicare, PFFS, 
and MSA plans don’t feature coordination of care.

139
Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
Extra benefits
 
All private plans must provide the same medical services as traditional 
Medicare. But they can also include extra benefits in their packages that are 
well worth having. Some plans with these extras don’t charge higher premiums, 
but most do — often quite a lot more. Look at any extra benefits carefully 
when comparing plans, because some provide significant coverage and others 
are very limited.
Geographical area
 
Considering your geographic location is important if you travel a lot or live in 
another state for part of the year. Traditional Medicare covers you anywhere 
in the U.S.; so do PFFS plans (at least in theory) and MSAs. However, HMOs, 
local PPOs, SNPs, and Medicare Cost plans require you to either go to providers 
within their local service areas or get preapproval to go outside the network. 
In a regional PPO, you can go to providers throughout the service region 
(sometimes several adjacent states) or get preapproval to go outside the 
network. Fortunately, all plans must cover emergency treatment or urgently 
needed care anywhere in the country. Some Medigap policies and health plans 
also cover emergency care abroad.
Recognizing when you may 
not have a choice
You may not be free to make a choice — either between traditional Medicare 
and the private plan system or among the private plans themselves — if you 
have health coverage from a current or former employer or union. Following 
are some of the ways this limitation can occur:
 
 Your current plan is a special one offered only to employees or retirees 
of the employer or union that sponsors it.
 
 Your current plan pays the premiums for a Medigap supplementary 
insurance policy. (This type of policy can be used only with traditional 
Medicare, not with a Medicare Advantage plan.)
 
 Your current plan gives you coverage under a specific Medicare Advantage 
plan — an HMO, PPO, PFFS, or an MSA plan — meaning you can’t also be 
enrolled in the traditional Medicare program or any other MA plan.
 
Be aware that if you enroll in an alternative plan (unless it’s an alternative 
specifically offered by your employer or union) you may automatically lose 
your current coverage for you and your dependents and may not be able 
to get it back. Always check with your current plan’s benefits administrator 
before taking this step so you know the consequences.

140
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
Some people in this situation are faced with a real dilemma. For example, an 
increasing number of employers and unions are contracting with Medicare 
PFFS plans to cover their retirees. This move makes sense to sponsoring 
organizations with retirees all over the country, because in theory PFFS 
enrollees can go to doctors or hospitals anywhere. But some retirees have 
found that the only providers that accept their PFFS plan are far from their 
homes. If this Catch-22 happens to you, you can either put up with the plan or 
give up the retiree health benefit you’ve paid into for years. But first, why not 
holler loudly to the administrators of your employer or union plan to let them 
know what’s going on and see whether they can fix it?
Comparing Medicare’s Private Health 
Plans and Making Your Pick
The different types of Medicare private health plans (see the earlier section 
“Medicare Advantage plans” for details on each) aren’t just single plans. 
Rather, each type is offered by a number of different insurers. And a single 
insurer may offer several plans in one or more of these categories. The 
result? A lot of different plans to choose from, each with its own mix of costs 
and benefits.
I’m not going to pretend that making this choice is necessarily easy. If you’ve 
had experience making two or three plan choices under employer coverage 
in the past, you know the score. Well, sort of — deciding between two or 
three plans pales before the choices in Medicare. And if you’ve never had to 
choose a plan before, the number and range of choices may come as a big 
shock. After all, you’re not comparing apples to apples here. I mean, how do 
you compare one plan’s flat dollar co-pay for visiting a doctor with another 
plan’s percentage of the cost? How do you figure the trade-off between a 
relatively high co-pay for a hospital stay against a low premium?
 
Still, the difficulty of making that choice is no argument for not comparing 
plans. Whichever plan you choose may be a bit of a gamble, but insurance 
always is. And taking a hard look at the differences among the plans available 
to you makes your final decision an informed one. Regardless of the outcome, 
you can know you gave it your best shot.
In the following sections, I delve into how many private health plan choices 
you may face. Then I explain how to compare the details of the ones that 
interest you — either by making an online search that I walk you through, 
step by step, or by obtaining personal help. I also suggest ways of using this 
information to choose a final plan. Finally, I explain three circumstances in 
which you may be able to change your mind after enrollment and switch to 
traditional Medicare.

141
Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
Determining how many plan 
choices you have
The number of Medicare private health plans for you to choose from depends 
very much on where you live. If you live in a heavily populated place, you 
probably have at least 50 plans available to you, including all the different 
types of Medicare plans. If you live in a very rural area, fewer than 15 plans 
may be available, and you may have far less choice among plan types. Rural 
areas often have no HMOs, local PPOs, or SNPs. They generally have one or 
two regional PPOs, one MSA plan, and a vast majority of PFFS plans.
 
Not all of these plans include drug coverage, so if you’re looking for a plan that 
combines medical and drug benefits in one package, this preference reduces 
your number of plan choices.
You can get a very rough idea of how many Medicare health plans are 
available to you by looking at your Medicare & You handbook that Medicare 
sends out to all beneficiaries in October with information for the following 
year. Flip toward the back of the book to find a list of health plans in your 
state. (You can also read Medicare & You online at www.medicare.gov.)
 
However, you can’t always tell from the handbook which plans are available 
in your neck of the woods. Plans’ service areas may be described as being in 
select counties, or in a particular region of your state without specifying its 
borders. In other words, some of the plans listed may not operate in your zip 
code at all. What’s more, the handbook’s list gives only scant details about the 
plans — far too little info to make a reasoned choice among them. Fortunately, 
a better resource exists. Keep reading!
Finding a list of plans online
The fastest and most effective way of finding out your Medicare health plan 
options is to go to the Web site Medicare provides for this purpose. This 
useful tool allows to you compare plans head-to-head. (If you don’t have 
access to the Internet, fast-forward to the section “Getting personal help to 
compare plans” later in this chapter.)
To navigate the Web site, follow these steps, which represent consecutive 
pages on-screen:
 
1. On the www.medicare.gov home page, under Search Tools, click 
“Compare Health Plans and Medigap Policies in Your Area.”
 
2. In the box on the left-hand side, click “Find & Compare Health Plans.”
 
3. Click “Begin General Plan Search” on the right.

142
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
4. Enter your zip code, ignore the request for age and health status, 
answer the following questions, and click “Continue.”
 
5. Read this page if you want to review the details you’ve provided or 
see the general information offered, then click “Continue.”
 
6. Click “Continue to Plan List” to compare only the health plans’ 
medical benefits at this stage. You can compare the plans’ drug cov-
erage later.
 
7. Examine the list of all the Medicare health plans available in your 
area by scrolling down the page.
 
 The total number of available plans appears at the top. Table 9-2 gives 
a few examples of the kind of broad information, labeled Plan Summary, 
you’ll encounter.

Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
As you can see in Table 9-2, the Plan Summary page gives a quick snapshot of 
each plan. The page shows at a glance the plan’s name, its type, its premium 
(in addition to the Part B premium), and whether it includes drug coverage, 
restricts doctor choice, or covers vision/dental services and physical exams.
 
One column that appears in the Plan Summary on-screen, but is excluded in 
Table 9-2, is headed “Estimated Annual Cost for People Like You.” This is a 
very rough estimate based on any information you give as to your age and 
health status in Step 4 of the previous list. A dollar amount is shown, even if 
you haven’t provided this detail. This tool doesn’t (and can’t!) provide a 
reliable guide to your out-of-pocket medical expenses over the year in any 
plan.
 
The plan descriptions in Table 9-2 are only examples. Plenty of plans within 
each type charge premiums higher or lower than those shown, or vary in their 
inclusion of drug coverage and extra benefits. The only type that’s always the 
same is the Original Medicare row, which shows details that are standard to 
the traditional Medicare program.
If you want, you can cut down the number of plans on-screen to show only the 
kind you’re looking for. Go to the top of the page and click the “Show” button next 
to Select Criteria to Reduce Number of Plans Shown (optional). A menu of options 
will appear. Click the small box next to each kind of plan you want to see — for 
example, “Plans that include drug coverage.” Then click “Apply Limits.”
 
Be cautious of using this device to lessen the number of plans. For example, if 
you indicate that you want to see only plans that include drug coverage, you 
automatically exclude the traditional Medicare program from the list — yet it 
may be very useful to know what this program offers, as a kind of yardstick, 
when you’re comparing specific medical benefits among plans. Similarly, if you 
specify a premium limit, you exclude all plans with premiums over that dollar 
amount. So you don’t see plans that overall may give you a better deal — for 
example, somewhat higher premiums but lower co-pays. However, if you’re 
looking specifically for an SNP or an MSA, checking those options reduces the 
number of plans that appear on-screen to those you wish to see.
Digging for plan details
After obtaining your Medicare plan options (see the preceding section for 
tips on doing so), you’re now ready to look at the nitty-gritty details neces-
sary to compare plans properly. These details include what the plan charges 
for visits to a primary care doctor or specialist, stays in a hospital, having an 
X-ray, or using an ambulance. Clicking any of the plan names in the left-hand 
column on the list brings up all of these details, and many more, for that plan.
Each details page provides a lot of information. Here are some guidelines to 
help you sort through it all:

144
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
 Comparing plans’ benefits side by side is useful. Fortunately, you can do 
so for up to three plans at a time. On the main list page, click the little box 
that appears alongside the name of each plan you want to see, then click 
“Compare” at the top or bottom of the page.
 
 The three-plan comparison device is also very useful for comparing details of the 
traditional Medicare program (always called Original Medicare on this site) with 
some of the private health plans you’re considering. Scroll down the main plan 
list until you see Original Medicare and click the box beside it.
 
 The first chunk of information you see for any private plan is a quality 
assessment titled Plan Ratings. This section features stars, ranging from one 
(poor) to five (excellent), to grade how well the plan performs in categories 
like Getting Care from Your Doctors and Specialists and Managing Chronic 
Conditions. Select the “Click to view more details on Plan Ratings” link to see 
how Medicare arrived at these ratings.
 
 This information can be useful in deciding which plans to avoid or in breaking 
a tie after whittling down your plan options to just two or three.
 
 In the next section, headed Important Information, you can see the plan’s 
monthly premium, as well as if you have a choice of doctors and hospi-
tals, need a referral to see a specialist, or must limit yourself to the plan’s 
provider network. Look to see if the plan sets a cap on your out-of-pocket 
expenses — but be aware that this limit may apply only to certain services. 
You need to call the plan to find out which ones count.
 
 Pay special attention to the section headed Inpatient Care. Plans vary a great deal 
in the co-pays they charge for hospital stays — sometimes by hundreds of dollars. 
You should also compare these charges with the hospital deductible required 
under traditional Medicare. Look to see if you or your doctor must notify the plan 
before checking into the hospital for a nonemergency surgery or treatment.
 
 The Outpatient Care section gives details of costs to visit doctors and spe-
cialists, have outpatient surgery, or use an ambulance. It also states whether 
the payment method is a flat co-pay or a percentage of the cost. The follow-
ing section gives similar details for outpatient tests, X-rays, lab services, and 
medical equipment (like wheelchairs). Look to see if you’re required to ask 
the plan for prior authorization before receiving any of the services listed in 
this section.
 
 If the plan includes Part D prescription drug coverage in its package, details 
appear in the Additional Benefits section. You can see lots of stuff here about the 
plan’s formulary, deductible, and co-pays for different kinds of drugs.
 
 Here’s a special tip: Ignore these details! It’s impossible to tell what your drugs 
will cost under the plan from this information, or if they’ll be covered. Instead, 
you need to do a different search according to the specific drugs you take. You 
can do this by going back and entering your drugs, their dosages, and frequency 
in Step 6, and then clicking on “View Drug Benefits” at the top of the main page. 
Or you can follow the more detailed instructions for comparing drug plans on 
Medicare’s Part D plan finder tool that I walk you through in Chapter 10. Either 
way, you’ll find out more precisely what your out-of-pocket drug expenses 
would be over the whole year in a plan.

145
Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
 
 If the plan includes coverage for extra services — such as dental, 
hearing, and eye care — these details appear at the bottom of the 
Additional Benefits list. You may notice that some co-pays are given 
for Medicare-covered services. Traditional Medicare provides for a few 
medically justified services in these areas — for example, eye exams for 
people who have diabetes or are at high risk for glaucoma; eye glasses 
for people who’ve had cataract surgery; hearing tests for people who 
may need medical treatment as a result; and dental work required for a 
medical procedure, such as jaw surgery after an accident. But the 
private plan may offer checkups and procedures (like teeth cleaning) 
that aren’t covered by traditional Medicare.
Getting personal help to compare plans
If you don’t have access to the Internet, or just don’t feel up to doing an 
online search yourself, you can still get the information you need to compare 
Medicare health plans properly. These alternatives include the following:
 
 Asking a family member or a friend to do an online search for you
 
 Calling the Medicare help line, your State Health Insurance Assistance 
Program (SHIP), or your Area Agency on Aging — which all give free help
 
 Talking to trained volunteers from a consumer group or senior center
These sources are the same as the ones I explain in Chapter 10’s “Finding 
Personal Help to Compare Plans” section. So go there for details and contact 
information.
Watching out for hard-sell marketing 
pressures and scams
Of course, you can obtain details in ways other than the options I mention in 
the previous sections. For example,
 
 You may receive advertising materials from Medicare health plans 
through the mail.
 
 You may chat with a sales representative by phone or at a pharmacy, 
shopping mall, or senior center.
 
 You may consult an independent insurance agent or broker.
Just remember that fancy direct mail pieces and energetic sales reps 
are pitching the health plan they’re supposed to sell. They’re not going 
to compare their plan point by point with their competitors’ plans! The 
same is true for some independent insurance agents, because they’re paid 

146
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
higher commissions for some plans than others. So the plan they pitch 
may not be the right one for you.
 
Selling Medicare health plans is a ferociously competitive business — so 
stay on your guard against being pressured into buying a plan you don’t 
want or don’t understand fully. Yes, regrettably, you can be persuaded into 
buying a plan that’s not right for you! That’s why I urge you to read Chapter 
11, in which I explain how to protect yourself against unethical hard-sell 
tactics, as well as downright illegal scams. There, I break down Medicare’s 
marketing rules for plans, a list of matters to think about and check out 
before enrolling in a plan, and actions you can take if you’re misled into 
joining a plan you don’t want or understand.
Asking questions before you 
make your final choice
If you’re here, I’m assuming you’ve now decided on a Medicare health plan 
for your medical care rather than traditional Medicare, and also that you’ve 
narrowed your plan choices to a manageable two, three, or four. Now all you 
need to do is get down to that final one.
 
Getting all of your information in order helps a great deal. If you research 
plans using Medicare’s online comparison tool, you can print out the details 
of the few that interest you. If you call the Medicare help line at 800-633-4227 
for the same information, you can ask the customer representative to mail you 
printouts for the plans you want to consider. You can also call the plans to ask 
for their info packets or visit their Web sites.
After you have this information, notice how the options can become tons 
clearer when you write down the key details alongside each other. The 
following questions are also reproduced in Worksheet 3 in Appendix A, 
along with spaces for writing out the answers for up to four plans. In the 
following list, I explain what action to take to find out specific answers to 
some of the questions. In all other cases, you can find the answers in your 
Medicare printouts, in the plan’s info packet, or on its Web site.
 
Dive into the decision-making process by asking the following:
 
 Will the providers (doctors and hospitals) that I prefer accept this plan?
 
 You can obtain provider network lists from HMOs, PPOs, SNPs, and 
Medicare Cost plans by mail on request or from their Web sites. In the 
case of PFFS plans, you need to ask your local doctors and hospitals.
 
 Will this plan allow me to go to out-of-network providers for a higher 
co-pay?

147
Chapter 9: The First Cut: Deciding How You Want to Receive Your Medical Benefits
 
 Will this plan cover my nonemergency healthcare needs outside of my 
home area?
 
 In the case of HMOs, PPOs, SNPs, and Medicare Cost plans, you have to 
ask the plan precisely what its service area is, and in what circumstances 
it may cover treatment outside that region. (Information on service area 
boundaries isn’t given on the Medicare Web site or in the Medicare & You 
handbook.) PFFS and MSA plans don’t have defined service areas.
 
 What will my fixed costs (monthly premium on top of Part B premium; 
annual deductible in the case of an MSA) be in this plan?
 
 Does this plan put a limit on my out-of-pocket expenses in a year?
 
 You can get the cap amount from Medicare, the plan’s Web site, or the 
plan’s brochure. But you need to call the plan to find out which services 
count toward the cap.
 
 What will I pay to visit my primary care doctor in this plan?
 
 What will I pay to visit a specialist in this plan?
 
 What will I pay to stay in a hospital in this plan?
 
 What are this plan’s ratings for quality of care?
 
 You can only find this information on Medicare’s online health plan 
finder or by calling the Medicare help line (800-633-4227).
 
 Does this plan offer benefits for vision, hearing, or dental care?
 
 Does this plan offer preventive care (screenings, scans, tests) that 
meet my needs?
 
 Does this plan cover routine physical exams?
 
Notice one question missing from this list: Does this plan cover prescription 
drugs? Yes, it’s an important question. But, as I explain earlier in this chapter, 
the type of Medicare health plan you choose directly affects how you can get 
drug coverage. So remember that
 
 If one or more of the health plans on your shortlist includes prescription 
drugs in its benefit package, you need to compare the drug coverage 
details separately.
 
 If you’re thinking about an HMO or PPO that doesn’t include drug coverage, 
you can’t add a stand-alone Part D plan to it. So if you want drug coverage, 
strike this health plan off your shortlist.
 
 If you’re pondering a PFFS, MSA, or Medicare Cost plan that doesn’t 
include drug coverage, you can enroll in a stand-alone Part D plan.
 
 If you’re considering traditional Medicare, which doesn’t include 
outpatient drugs, you can enroll in a stand-alone Part D plan.

148
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Chapter 10 shows you how to compare drug plans effectively. Afterward, you 
can use Worksheet 2 in Appendix A to note the differences. Then, you can 
use this info together with Worksheet 3 to see which plan works best for you 
in terms of medical and drug coverage. When you reach that point, it’s time 
to enroll, as explained in Chapter 12.
Knowing if you can make a change
 
What if you find, after you’re in a Medicare private health plan, that you don’t 
like it? Medicare allows you to switch plans outside of the regular open 
enrollment period only for several specific reasons, and unhappiness isn’t one 
of them! However, here are some escape clauses (which are all explained in 
more detail in Chapter 17):
 
 If your coverage in a Medicare health plan starts January 1: You have 
the right to switch to traditional Medicare or to another health plan 
during the first three months of the year, through March 31. However, 
you can’t use this opportunity to drop or add drug coverage.
 
 If you receive Extra Help: You can change to another Medicare health 
plan that offers drug coverage, or to traditional Medicare and a stand-
alone drug plan, at any time during the year.
 
 If you joined a Medicare health plan as soon as you enrolled in 
Medicare at age 65: Medicare considers this first year in the program 
as a trial period. So you have the right to disenroll from the plan at any 
time within 12 months of first receiving coverage from it in order to 
switch to traditional Medicare and a stand-alone Part D plan. You also 
have a guaranteed right to buy a Medigap policy within 63 days of your 
plan coverage ending.
 
 If this is your first time in a Medicare health plan and you dropped 
a Medigap policy to join it: You have the right to return to traditional 
Medicare and be reinstated in Medigap at any time during your first 12 
months in this plan.
 
 If you joined a Medicare Cost plan: You have the right to disenroll from 
it and switch to traditional Medicare at any time. If you received drug 
coverage from this plan, you can also switch to a stand-alone Part D plan 
at the same time.

edicare advises people who are choosing a Medicare prescription drug 
plan to consider the three Cs — cost, coverage, and convenience. That’s 
perfectly true. But I say add three more Cs — compare, compare, compare! And 
even a fourth: Do it carefully! I can’t emphasize this point enough: Comparing 
plans carefully is the single most important step you can take in finding the 
Part D plan that’s best for you. It may save you unexpected hassle. It’ll cer-
tainly save you money.
“Well, yeah,” you say. “But what about the fact that I’m faced with more than 
80 drug plans in my area? And they’re all different!” I know that the number of 
plans makes choosing just one — let alone the right one — seem a daunting 
prospect. But take heart, because you don’t have to grope your way through 
the multitude of all of those plans. In this chapter, I demonstrate a strategy 
for navigating the Part D maze that focuses only on your needs.
First, I explain why comparing plans properly is better than the less-than-ideal 
alternatives you may be considering. I also share how to make two simple (yet 
essential!) lists of your needs and preferences to help you get the most out of 
an invaluable tool: the online Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder. I walk 
you through this tool step by step so you can whittle all those plans to a 
manageable few in the fastest and most effective way. I then show you how 
to drill down into a plan’s details to help bring you to a final choice. Finally, I 
suggest ways of getting personal assistance comparing plans, if you need it. In 
essence, this chapter’s purpose is to help you avoid that queasy feeling that 
often comes after making an important decision — did I do the right thing?

Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Understanding the Need to 
Compare Plans Carefully
There’s a famous scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where Indy 
and his enemy choose what each thinks to be the Holy Grail from an array 
of goblets. The evil Nazi picks a gold one, and instantly dies a horrible 
death. “He chose . . . poorly,” observes the ancient knight who’s been on 
guard duty for about 700 years. Indy picks a simple wooden cup. “You,” 
intones the knight, “have chosen . . . wisely.”
Well, maybe the Part D plan that’s best for you isn’t the Holy Grail exactly. 
But you still need to choose wisely to get it. And there are so many poor 
ways of choosing. Like these:
 
 Picking the same plan as your spouse, your best friend, your next-door 
neighbor, or your second cousin. (Why? Because they’re not you! They don’t 
take the same prescription drugs as you.)
 
 Choosing the plan with the lowest premium in your area. (Why? Because, 
unless you don’t take any drugs right now, premiums are far less important 
than co-pays in adding to your out-of-pocket expenses under any plan.)
 
 Agreeing to enroll in a plan that a sales agent pitches to you at a 
shopping mall, local pharmacy, senior center, or anywhere else. 
(Why? Because the agent’s talking up the plan he’s paid to sell, without 
a thought to your personal needs or preferences.)
 
 Picking a plan from the marketing brochures that plans send to your 
home. (Why? Because these are advertising materials designed to make 
a sale, again without regard to your own circumstances and needs.)
 
 Deciding on the plan with the most familiar name. (Why? Because it 
won’t necessarily cover your drugs at the least cost.)
 
Using any of these methods to choose a plan isn’t much better than closing 
your eyes and jabbing a pin in a list, because none of them account for the 
prescription drugs that you take. Your own set of drugs — down to the exact 
dosage of each and how often you take them — is the most important factor in 
picking the plan that’s right for you. It’s the essential key to choosing wisely.
In the next two sections, I explain how to recognize the best plan for your 
needs and why comparing plans carefully is worth the effort.
What’s the best plan, anyway?
In theory, the best plan is the one that provides any prescription drug you may 
conceivably need, not just now but also in the unforeseeable future. But that’s 

151
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
not how Part D works. No plan covers every drug, as I explain in Chapter 4. 
And unless you can find out the drugs that each plan covers and count them all 
up — a daunting task considering many plans have thousands of drugs on their 
formularies — it’s impossible to know which plan covers the most.
 
I believe that the best plan has to be the one that covers all, or almost all, 
of the drugs you’re taking now — meaning the time when you’re deciding 
which plan to sign up for — at the lowest out-of-pocket cost and with the 
fewest hoops to jump through to get those drugs. If it turns out later on that 
you need a drug that’s not on your plan’s formulary, you can ask your doctor 
whether an alternative formulary drug may work as well for you (as explained 
in Chapter 16). Otherwise, you can try using the exceptions process to ask the 
plan to cover your prescribed drug (see Chapter 4) or, if you’re turned down, 
you can appeal the decision (see Chapter 19).
 
You can also change to another Part D plan at the end of the year during 
open enrollment (or during the year in certain circumstances, as explained in 
Chapter 17). In fact, it’s wise to compare plans annually, because they change 
their costs and benefits each year, so the plan that’s best for you this year 
may not be as good for you next year.
Is comparing plans worth the effort?
Comparing plans carefully is definitely worthwhile! Doing so tells you
 
 Which are the three or four plans that cover all of your prescription 
drugs but cost you the least out of pocket over the whole year.
 
 Which of these plans has the fewest or no restrictions for your drugs. 
(Different kinds of restrictions — prior authorization, quantity limits, or 
step therapy — are described in Chapter 4.)
 
 Which of these plans gives you the best discounts if you choose generic 
drugs or want to receive your meds by mail order.
 
 Which of these plans has the most reasonable co-pay structure — that 
is, the different amounts you pay in each tier of charges — in case you 
need more meds later in the year. (For example, Plan X may charge a 
co-pay of $45 for all of its nonpreferred brands, whereas Plan Y may 
charge more than $100 for drugs in its own nonpreferred brand tier.)
 
 Whether you’re going to fall into the doughnut hole (also known as the 
coverage gap; see Chapter 15 for full details) with the set of drugs you 
take now and, if so:
 
• At which point in the year that’s going to happen.
 
• Whether that’s going to occur later under one plan than another.
 
• Whether any of these plans cover your drugs in the doughnut hole.

152
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
 Which of these plans have network pharmacies convenient for you.
 
 Which of these plans have a mail-order option, if you want one.
 
 Which of these plans allow you to fill your prescriptions in any state if 
you travel or live away from home for part of the year.
Certainly, you can find the answers to a few of these questions just by review-
ing the Medicare & You handbook, which gives some details of all Part D plans 
in your area. (Medicare mails this publication to you each October.) Or you can 
look at individual drug plans’ marketing brochures and Web sites. But you won’t 
find answers to all of your questions, or even to the most important one of all — 
which plans cover your drugs at the least cost.
 
The only really effective way of getting that critical information is to create 
the lists of your meds and plan preferences and use the online Medicare 
Prescription Drug Plan Finder, or get someone else to use it for you, as 
explained later in this chapter. This tool is also the safest way of choosing a 
plan. Why? Because when you do the comparison, you remain in control. You 
can’t fall for a sweet sales pitch — or worse, fall prey to a scam or a hard sell 
from some unscrupulous person who exploits your uncertainty for personal 
gain. (See Chapter 11 for the scoop on marketing scams and hard sells.)
Will you avoid Part D buyer’s remorse?
Most folks don’t compare Part D plans before choosing one, period. Surveys 
show that most often they rely on word-of-mouth recommendations or 
choose a plan sponsored by an insurer with a familiar name. So I’m guessing 
millions of Part D enrollees out there are paying far more than they need to 
for their drugs. Here are a few examples of how comparing plans carefully 
can save you money — and how failing to do so can teach you a hard lesson.
Bill’s story: Going by a well-known name
Back in November 2005, a few weeks before Part D started, I was having 
dinner at a friend’s house when another guest, Bill, told me he’d signed up 
with a plan. I asked how he’d chosen it. Well, he’d picked an insurer whose 
name he knew and felt he could trust. Fine, I said, but let’s do a comparison. 
We borrowed a laptop, and I ran the information for his six meds through the 
online Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder. It took about 15 minutes. The 
least expensive plan — also provided by a well-known insurer — turned out 
to cost about $1,000 a year less than the one he’d chosen. Because we were 
still within the open enrollment period, he was able to switch plans. Every 
year since then I’ve run the numbers for Bill. And every year the plan that 
worked out best for him was different than the plan he’d had the year before.

153
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
Joel’s story: Choosing the same plan as your spouse
Before he retired, Joel had health insurance from his company that covered 
drugs for both himself and his wife, Mae. When they needed Part D, Joel left 
it to Mae to pick a plan for both of them, because she took a lot of drugs, and 
he rarely took any, and they felt more comfortable being in the same plan. So 
Mae chose Plan X, which covered all of her drugs for a monthly premium of 
$61, and signed them both up. Mae was okay, but Joel was actually wasting 
money. Because he almost never needed drugs, he’d have been better off on 
Plan Y, which had a premium of $12.10 (the lowest in his area) and would’ve 
saved him $48.90 a month, or $586.80 over the course of the year.
Joanne’s story: Failing to research a sales pitch
Joanne was in the mall buying gifts for her grandkids when a sales rep invited 
her to sit down, have a cup of coffee, and talk about Part D. Joanne already 
had a plan and wasn’t thinking of changing it, but she was happy to take a 
load off and listen for a few minutes. What the rep said about Plan X sounded 
like a better deal than her current plan, so Joanne signed up on the spot. 
What she didn’t know was that for her set of drugs (two brand-names and 
two generics) Plan X ranked 27th in expense out of the 51 drug plans in her 
area. If she’d compared the plans according to the drugs she took, instead of 
listening to a sales pitch, she’d have found Plan Y. This plan had higher 
premiums than Plan X. But Plan Y charged lower co-pays for her generics ($4 
per prescription rather than $8) and placed her brands in its preferred brand 
tier (with co-pays of $25), whereas Plan X placed them in its nonpreferred 
tier with co-pays of $55. So over the course of the year, Joanne paid $1,764 
with Plan X, whereas she’d have paid $996 under Plan Y — a savings of $768.
Getting Organized with Two Crucial Lists
The information you must have at hand before comparing Part D plans 
properly — whether you hop online and use the Medicare Prescription Drug 
Plan Finder yourself or get someone else to do it for you — is very simple. All 
you need (besides your zip code, which you already know) is
 
 An accurate list of your prescription meds
 
 A list of personal preferences that may make you lean toward one plan 
rather than another
In the following sections, I explain how to make your drug list complete and 
accurate in all of its details and how to note the kinds of preferences that 
may be important to you.

154
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Creating an accurate list of your meds
Take a sheet of paper or use the worksheet provided in Appendix A. Have 
in front of you all of those bottles that contain the prescription medications 
you’re currently taking — tablets, capsules, liquid solutions, sprays, creams, 
or whatever form they come in. Then make a list of their exact names, their 
dosages, and how often you take them (frequency), using the information 
provided on the pharmacist’s labels. Alternatively, you can ask your 
pharmacist for a printout of all of your prescription drugs.
Whichever method you choose, your list should look something like Table 10-1 — 
but with details for your own drugs, of course, in place of my examples.
Table 10-1 
What a Detailed Drug List May Look Like
Exact Medication Name
Dosage
Frequency
Verapamil HCL ER
120 mg
1 a day
Fosamax
70 mg
1 a week
Carbidopa/levodopa
25/100 mg
3 a day
Xalatan SOL 0.005%
2.50 ml bottle
1 bottle a month
Santyl OIN 250u/gm
30 gm tube
1 tube every two months
I’m not just being persnickety in saying you should note down these three items — 
name, dosage, and frequency — exactly as they’re written on the container label. 
Following are some good reasons for being strictly accurate with each one:
 
 Exact medication name: Many prescription drugs have the same name 
but come in different forms, with their differences marked by a second 
word or combination of letters following the name.
 
 For example, verapamil hydrochloride, a generic drug used to treat high 
blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and chest pain, is shown in Table 
10-1 as verapamil HCL ER. The ER stands for extended release, but this 
drug is also available in three other variations: a plain form (without 
additional letters); an SR form (sustained release); and a CR form 
(controlled release), meaning the drug is absorbed into the body at 
different rates. Because this drug is a generic, a plan’s co-pays for 
any of these forms are likely the same — but the full price of the SR 
form is generally twice as much as the ER or CR forms, which makes 
a difference in the deductible or doughnut hole. So using the wrong 
initials in a plan search can distort your overall out-of-pocket cost 
results.

155
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
 
 Dosage: Using the wrong dosage in a plan search may also distort your 
cost results. Part D plans often charge the same co-pay for different 
strengths of the same drug — but not always. Even the full price may 
be the same for different dosages — but sometimes it isn’t. In this case, 
you pay more for a higher dosage in the deductible period (if you have 
one) or in the doughnut hole (if you fall into it), and also if the plan you 
choose charges coinsurance (a percentage of the price) for your drugs in 
the initial coverage period rather than fixed co-pays. (I explain the 
difference between co-pays and coinsurance in Chapter 3.)
 
 How often you take your drugs: Of the three factors that can alter your 
out-of-pocket costs during a plan search, frequency is the most 
important. If, by mistake, you say you take a pill once a day when in 
fact you take it twice a day, the search results will show a cost that’s 
half as much as you’ll actually pay when filling your prescription at the 
pharmacy. That’s one surprise you don’t want! The converse is just as 
distorting. If, for example, you take a drug once a week, but by mistake 
say in a plan search that you take it once a day, the results will show an 
out-of-pocket cost seven times higher than what you’d actually pay.
 
The accuracy of the costs you’re quoted in a plan search depends very much 
on the accuracy of the drug names, dosages, and frequencies you enter into the 
plan finder. These details are equally important if you ask someone else — such 
as a customer representative on the Medicare telephone help line, or a coun-
selor at your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) — because this 
person, too, is going to use Medicare’s plan finder to assist you. (I explain how 
to find personal help with comparing plans later in this chapter.)
Drawing up a list of your plan preferences
 
Finding a plan that covers all of your drugs and costs you the least out of 
pocket may be top on your list of priorities. But chances are high that you’re 
going to identify several Part D plans that cover your drugs and vary by only a 
few dollars in the overall amount they charge. So consider some other factors 
that may be important to you, like these:
 
 Are the pharmacies in this plan’s network convenient to where I live? 
Each plan has its own network of pharmacies, and going to a pharmacy 
outside that network costs you a lot more (maybe even full price) for 
your drugs. (See Chapter 14 for more on this topic.) Before finally 
selecting a plan, you need to be sure it has network pharmacies within 
a reasonable distance of your home.
 
 Does this plan have a mail-order option? If you prefer to receive all 
or some of your prescriptions by mail order in 90-day supplies (which 
costs less in many plans), you need to be certain that the plan offers a 
mail-order service. Some plans don’t. (I discuss mail order in more detail 
later in this chapter.)

156
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
 Does this plan restrict any of my drugs? Any plan may require you 
to ask permission before it’ll cover certain drugs through restrictions 
known as prior authorization, quantity limits, or step therapy. (I explain 
these requirements and how to deal with them in Chapter 4.) Because 
plans impose restrictions on different drugs, you’ll want to look for a 
plan that has the fewest restrictions on your drugs, or none at all.
 
 Will this plan cover my prescriptions when I’m away from home? If 
you expect to travel during the year or live in another state for part of 
the year, you want a plan that covers your prescriptions at network 
pharmacies throughout the United States. Some plans offer a national 
service and some don’t. (None cover drugs purchased abroad.) See the 
later section “Searching for pharmacies if you travel or live away from 
home for part of the year” for more information.
 
 Does this plan have a good customer service track record? Plans 
that answer calls without keeping you on hold forever, respond to 
questions properly, pay their share of prescriptions correctly, and 
deal with complaints promptly are obviously preferable. Some plans 
provide more satisfactory customer service than others. See the later 
section “Assessing customer service” for details.
So how do you sort out the wheat from the chaff on all of these questions? 
The answers are available through Medicare’s online plan finder, and I 
show you how to find them later in this chapter. If you’d rather not go 
online yourself, you can get a hand comparing plans as explained in the 
later section, “Finding Personal Help to Compare Plans.”
Introducing the Medicare Prescription 
Drug Plan Finder
Medicare’s online prescription drug plan finder is an interactive Web site 
that allows you to plug in details of your own prescription drugs to find out 
which plans cover them and approximately what each plan will charge you. 
In other words, this tool makes light work of an otherwise difficult calculation 
by doing the math for you automatically. I walk you through the process step 
by step later in this chapter.
You can use the plan finder to compare Part D coverage and costs within
 
 Stand-alone plans (PDPs), which provide only drugs and are the type of 
plan you need if you’re enrolled in traditional Medicare for your medical 
coverage
 
 Medicare Advantage plans (MAPDs) that provide prescription drugs and 
medical coverage in one package

157
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
 
 Special Needs Plans (SNPs), which in some areas offer comprehensive 
care for people in certain situations, such as living in a nursing home, 
being chronically ill, or receiving Medicaid services
 
Using the plan finder to compare coverage and costs for your drugs is essentially 
the same process within all these groups. But if you’re considering a Medicare 
Advantage or Special Needs plan, you need to compare details of the medical 
services they provide as well as drug coverage. I explain why in Chapter 9.
Everybody who wants impartial information about Part D plans uses the 
online plan finder. And I mean everybody! Not only people in Medicare 
but also doctors, pharmacists, social workers, counselors, advocates, and 
help groups. Gee, that sounds an awful lot like anybody who’s assisting a 
Medicare beneficiary in finding a Part D plan! Clearly, everyone depends on 
the plan finder. So it’s reasonable to ask: How reliable is it?
The plan finder is a complex and sophisticated computer program. And it’s 
unique: No other insurance system offers consumers a way to compare plans 
head-to-head to find the best deal. But of course such comparisons are only 
as reliable as the pricing information fed into them — in this case, by the Part 
D plans themselves.
Medicare officials say they rigorously monitor the accuracy of plan prices and, 
when errors are detected, remove all information about that plan from the 
Web site until corrections are made. Medicare also includes pricing accuracy 
as one of the measures in its quality assessment system, which rates individual 
plans from one star (poor) to five stars (excellent). Officials say the ratings, 
displayed on the plan finder, are based on Medicare’s own regular reviews and 
the number of complaints it receives from consumers.
 
Nonetheless, the plan finder isn’t free from glitches and errors. Here are some 
tips for avoiding, or minimizing, your chances of choosing a plan based on 
misleading information, as well as how to deal with it if you accidentally do:
 
 Know that Medicare posts new plan information for the following year 
in mid-October. This is when the potential for pricing errors is most 
likely, because every plan changes its costs and benefits from year to 
year, and huge amounts of detail are being uploaded onto the system. 
If you do a plan search at this time, recheck the information after open 
enrollment starts on November 15.
 
 After you’ve used the plan finder to choose the plan you like best, but 
before enrolling in it, it’s sensible to
 
• Double-check the accuracy of the drug information you entered 
into the plan finder — especially dosages and frequency.
 
• Print out the plan’s complete details for your set of drugs and 
keep this hard copy with your records.

158
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
• Call the plan to verify the full price it charges, or will charge for 
next year, for each of your drugs (at the dosages and quantities 
you specify) and your co-pay or coinsurance amounts during the 
initial coverage phase. If you’re considering getting your drugs by 
mail order, ask for those prices and co-pays too because they may 
be different. Keep notes of this conversation; the plan likely won’t 
confirm the details in writing.
 
 Bear in mind that although plans’ fixed costs, such as premiums, 
deductibles, and co-pay tiers, are invariably accurate on the plan finder, 
the prices quoted for drugs are an estimate. The exact prices can vary 
according to the pharmacy you go to and may fluctuate during the year.
 
 If you discover errors, report them to Medicare. Your information will 
be investigated and fed into its quality rating system. (See the later 
section “Discovering omissions or discrepancies on the plan finder” for 
some scenarios to watch out for and how to resolve them.)
 
 If you believe you were misled into enrolling in a plan due to 
erroneous pricing information on the plan finder, you have the right to 
ask Medicare for a special enrollment period to switch to another plan. 
This scenario is when keeping a printout of the details you got from the 
plan finder comes in handy, because you probably need to show evidence.
 
The plan finder is now vastly more user-friendly than when it first went 
live in October 2005, and every year Medicare introduces improvements. 
So it’s possible that adjustments made for 2009 and beyond will slightly 
alter the navigation steps I explain in the rest of this chapter. I don’t expect 
such alterations to be great enough to trip you up as you follow the steps, 
though some of the link details may change. However, if you get stuck, 
know that every fall I update my “Quick Route Through the Medicare Drug 
Plan Finder” guide on the AARP Bulletin’s Web site. You can find it at 
bulletin.aarp.org/yourhealth/.
Moving Step by Step through the 
Medicare Plan Finder — The Fast Way
The Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder is loaded with information and 
offers several different kinds of searches. But in this section, I focus on a 
quick way of getting to a plan comparison without you having to give out 
your Medicare ID number or any other personal details, except for your zip 
code and drug list. This procedure is a totally anonymous process.
 
On a technical note, it’s also a process that’s best tackled with high-speed 
Internet access. You can do it with a dial-up connection, but your search will 
be slower and, for that reason, more frustrating. Perhaps you can use 
high-speed access at a friend’s house, a library, or a local senior center.

159
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
If you don’t have access to the Internet or just don’t feel up to doing an online 
search yourself, you can skip this section and go directly to the later section 
that suggests ways of getting personal help to find the same info.
 
If you have yet to create the all-important lists of your current prescriptions 
and your drug plan preferences, flip back to the earlier section “Getting 
Organized with Two Crucial Lists.” Without this information at your fingertips, 
you can’t use the plan finder to full effect and won’t obtain accurate enough 
information to be able to compare plans properly.
The following 15 simple steps are designed so that you can sit at your 
computer and use them to navigate the plan finder, keystroke by keystroke. 
Sometimes I tell you to ignore certain questions or information. This is stuff 
you don’t need right now, but that you can return to later when you begin to 
compare plans in detail, according to your circumstances and preferences. 
(I consider those details in the next section.)
 
1. Go to www.medicare.gov and click “Compare Medicare Prescription 
Drug Plans” on the home page.
 
 If you’re doing this search anytime from mid-October through December 
31, you’ll see two links — one that leads you to plan information for this 
year and the other to plan information for next year. Just click the one 
you need.
 
2. Click “Find & Compare Plans.”
 
3. Click “Begin General Search” in the right-hand box.
 
 Ignore “Begin Personalized Search” in the left-hand box.
 
4. Enter your zip code.
 
5. Ignore the age and health status boxes.
 
6. Select the “No” buttons for the next three questions and click 
“Continue.”
 
 Note: If you qualify for Extra Help, you need to click the third button and 
answer the questions that appear in order to obtain accurate information 
about your costs as you progress through the plan finder. So look at the 
specific information about choosing a plan in Chapter 5 before going further.
 
 If you live in an area with a zip code that spans more than one county, 
you may now be directed to a page that asks you to select the county 
you live in.
 
7. Ignore this page (Review Current Coverage and Consider Options) and 
click “Continue.”
 
8. Click “Enter My Drugs.”

160
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
9. Enter the name of your first drug in the box and click “Search for Drug.”
 
 Another box appears, showing several drug names. Click the one you 
take and then click “Add Selected to Your Drug List.” (You can also use 
the alphabetical list to search for your drug.) The drug you’ve selected 
then appears in a list box. This box also tells you whether a generic ver-
sion of each drug is available.
 
10. Repeat this search for each drug you use and click “Continue.”
 
 When all of your drugs are on the list (but before clicking “Continue”), 
click the little box below the list to remove the check mark to ensure that 
lower-cost generics aren’t automatically substituted for your specific 
meds. (I explain how you can use the plan finder to discover more about 
using generics or other alternatives to lower your drug costs later in this 
chapter.)
 
11. Change the listed dosages and quantities to exactly match what you take.
 
 This is the most critical step in the process in terms of finding out what 
you’ll pay for your drugs in different plans, as explained in the earlier 
section “Creating an accurate list of your meds.”
 
• Dosage: If your exact dosage doesn’t appear beside each drug name 
on the screen, use the dropdown menu to find it and click that 
dosage. For example, if Lipitor is one of your drugs, you’ll see the 
default given as 10 mg, but you can change this dose to 20, 40, or 80 
mg. (If no menu appears, only one dosage exists for that drug.)
 
• Exact form of drug: If your drug comes in different forms (such as 
extended or controlled release), these variations are identified by 
their initials and appear together with dosages on the same drop-
down menu. Click the exact form you take.
 
• Quantities: Plug in how many doses you take each month. For 
example, if you take two pills a day, delete the default of 30 a 
month and type in 60. If you take a drug less frequently — say 
once every three months — use the dropdown menu to make that 
change. Click “Continue.”
 
12. Choose whether to save your drug list.
 
 Saving your list is a good way to avoid having to enter your information 
all over again if you lose it through a computer crash, or if you want to 
resume your drug plan search later on.
 
 Select a password date that’s easy to remember, such as your birthday, 
and click “Continue.” You’ll then receive a 10-digit ID number to use 
when retrieving your list. Make a note of the number and then click 
“Continue.” (If you don’t want to save the list, click “Skip this Step.”)

161
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
 
13. Ignore the invitation to select a pharmacy and click “Continue.”
 
 Selecting a pharmacy is unnecessary at this stage and may prevent you 
from finding plans that are the least expensive for your drugs. Searching 
for pharmacies separately, at a later stage, is a safer method. (I explain 
this search in the later section “Examining retail pharmacy choices.”)
 
14. Arrive at the page headed Your Personalized Plan List.
 
 What you now see is a list of five stand-alone drug plans, which the plan 
finder has ranked as the five least expensive plans for you at pharmacies 
in your area. The ranking automatically takes into account the cost of 
premiums and the drugs you’ve entered under each plan. If you want to 
see drug information for Medicare Advantage or Special Needs plans in 
your zip code instead, click those links at the top of the page.
 
 To see more plans in your area, click the “10 per page,” “20 per page,” 
or “All one page” links at the bottom of the plan list. All the plans are 
ranked in ascending order of your likely total out-of-pocket costs for the 
year, so the plan shown first is the least expensive.
 
15. Pat yourself on the back for getting to where you can start narrowing 
down your options.
This page is actually the beginning, not the end, of your search, because it 
shows only the broadest information. But you can see — as the simplified 
version used as an example in Table 10-2 also shows — that it already gives 
you, in the second and third columns, an idea of what you can expect to pay 
out of pocket over the whole year in each plan, either at retail pharmacies 
or by mail order. (The dollar amount includes premiums, drug co-pays, and 
costs in the deductible and coverage gap phases, if applicable.)
 
The plan finder’s rankings are based on the expense of drugs purchased at 
the various plans’ in-network retail pharmacies, as you can see in the second 
column of Table 10-2. But the plan finder also shows likely costs for the same 
drugs when purchased through each plan’s mail-order service. These amounts 
are often (though not always) lower than the retail pharmacy cost. As a result, 
the order of the plans in terms of overall expense changes. Plan X may be the 
least expensive under the retail pharmacy option, but Plan Y may be least 
expensive under mail order. Note: The “Lower this cost” link in these two 
columns refers to alternative drugs that you may be able to take to reduce 
your costs further, as I explain later in this chapter.

Careful, though — this page doesn’t give the whole picture. So don’t stop now. 
To make an informed choice among your plan options, you need to get cozy 
with their details, as I explain in the next section.
Drilling Down to Drug Plan Details
The list of plans — which I call the main plan list — described in the 
preceding section’s Step 14 gives only a general idea of coverage and costs. 
Now you need to look at the details of each plan — or at least of the four or 
five plans that head the list.

163
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
To start, click the name of the first plan at the top of the left-hand column. This 
action brings up a page headed Plan Drug Details, which gives a lot of informa-
tion about your drugs and costs under the selected plan. When you’re finished 
looking at this plan’s details, click your browser’s back button to return to the 
main plan list. You can then click the next plan’s name to bring up its details.
 
You can also look at the details of up to three plans side by side at the same 
time. Click the little box to the left of each plan’s name on the main list and 
then click the “Compare” button above.
 
Notice that this format is more compressed and doesn’t display the particulars 
as clearly as the full plan details pages. It also omits two important bits of 
information — whether your drugs come with any restrictions (such as prior 
authorization, quantity limits, or step therapy) and bar graphs that show your 
monthly out-of-pocket expenses over the year. That’s why I recommend look-
ing at each details page in turn rather than taking the shortcut offered by this 
side-by-side comparison.
Here’s an explanation of what’s on each details page as you scroll down:
 
 Plan quality ratings: This rating system uses stars to indicate a plan’s 
performance in certain areas — such as customer service, getting pre-
scriptions filled, accuracy of quoted prices, responsiveness to complaints, 
and so on — based on Medicare reviews and consumer complaints. Stars 
range from one (poor) to five (excellent).
 
 Fixed costs: These expenses refer to the plan’s monthly premium and 
annual deductible, if applicable.
 
 Estimated out-of-pocket cost over the whole year (including premiums): 
This info appears in two dollar amounts — one shows your total costs if 
you buy all of your drugs from preferred retail pharmacies in your plan’s 
network (30-day supplies), and the other shows your total costs if you 
buy meds by mail order (90-day supplies). Mail order is usually (though 
not always) less expensive, but some plans don’t offer this option. (If 
you’re looking at this page partway through the year, the right-hand 
column shows total costs for the remainder of the year.)
 
 Drug coverage information: This breakdown shows the list of drugs you 
entered into Medicare’s online plan finder and the tier (level of charges) 
that applies to each drug. Tiers typically range from 1 (least expensive) 
to 4 or 5 (most expensive), as explained in Chapter 3. (To find out the 
actual co-pays for these tiers, click “View Important Notes and Benefit 
Summary” on the menu at the top left of the page.)
 
 If any of your drugs aren’t covered under this plan, the phrase NOT ON 
FORMULARY appears in the Tier (Formulary Status) column.
 
 The columns farther to the right are very important. They show whether 
the plan places restrictions on any of your drugs — that is, whether you 
need to obtain the plan’s permission before they’ll be covered. These 
restrictions are prior authorization, quantity limits, or step therapy (as 

164
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
explained in Chapter 4.) When you make a final choice among plans, you 
may want to choose one with few or no restrictions.
 
 Monthly drug cost details at preferred network retail pharmacies: This 
chart shows what each of your drugs, if purchased from a preferred 
retail pharmacy in your plan’s network, will cost on a monthly basis at 
four different coverage levels:
 
• The period before you meet your annual deductible (if the plan 
has one)
 
• The initial coverage phase when you pay co-pays or coinsurance
 
• The coverage gap (doughnut hole) when you pay 100 percent of 
the cost of your drugs, unless this plan covers them in the gap or 
your costs aren’t high enough to reach it
 
• The catastrophic phase of coverage when you pay low co-pays 
after reaching a certain out-of-pocket expense limit
 
 The left-hand column on this chart shows the full price of each of your 
meds under this plan — that is, the price the plan has negotiated with 
the manufacturers. You pay this price before meeting your deductible 
or while you’re in the coverage gap. If the full price also appears in the 
Initial Coverage Level column, it can mean one of two things — either 
the drug isn’t covered on the plan’s formulary or the full price is less 
than the co-pay would be, so the plan charges you the lower of the two. 
If you see a co-pay rather than the full price in the Gap column, it means 
the plan covers this drug in the gap.
 
 Monthly drug cost details when purchasing drugs by mail order: To 
see a similar chart showing mail-order costs, click the “Show” button 
on the right-hand side. (If the plan doesn’t offer mail order, this option 
doesn’t appear.) Although mail-order drugs are always bought in 90-day 
quantities, this chart shows costs by the month (30-day quantities) to 
make comparisons easier.
 
 The local pharmacies within this plan’s network: Knowing which of 
your local pharmacies are in the plan’s network is important, because 
going out of the network costs you a lot more, possibly even full price. 
If you follow the instructions in the previous section, you won’t see any 
pharmacies listed. So how can you find out which of your local pharma-
cies participate in the plan? I explain how in the “Finding the pharmacies 
in a plan’s network” section later in this chapter.
 
 Out-of-pocket costs at a month-by-month glance: The bar chart at the 
end of the details page is a useful way to see how your expenses may 
change from month to month under this plan and whether (or when) 
you’re going to fall into the doughnut hole. (For examples, see Chapter 
15.) If the plan has no deductible and your drug costs are too low to 
take you into the doughnut hole, the cost for each month is the same. 
Otherwise, different monthly amounts appear according to coverage 
level. For a detailed breakdown, click “Show explanation of these costs.”

165
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
 
 The bar chart you see on this page shows monthly costs if you buy your 
drugs at the plan’s in-network retail pharmacies. To see a similar bar 
chart for mail-order costs (if the plan offers this option) click the “Show” 
button on the Cost Estimator for Mail Order Pharmacy panel.
 
 I go into more detail on these bar charts as they relate to the doughnut 
hole in Chapter 15.
 
 Filling prescriptions outside your home area: If you travel or live in 
another state for part of the year, you need a plan that covers your pre-
scriptions at its network pharmacies anywhere in the U.S. To find this 
information, click “View Important Notes and Benefit Summary” on the 
menu at the top left of the page. The summary indicates whether you 
can use this plan to get your prescription drugs outside its service area.
 
 How this plan’s costs next year compare to its costs this year: When 
you’re doing a plan search during open enrollment (November 15 
through December 31), the plan finder shows the details of next year’s 
costs and benefits by default. To see this year’s information, click “Click 
here to display [year] plan data” at the top of the page. This option 
disappears on January 1.
 
If you click “View Important Notes and Benefit Summary” and nothing 
happens, your Web browser may be blocking pop-ups. Disable your pop-up 
blocker to access this information.
Making Additional Worthwhile 
Searches to Help Pick a Plan
If you’ve looked at the details of the first several plans on the main plan list, 
you may now have a rough idea of which ones seem the most promising. But, 
once again, don’t stop here. You need more information before making a well-
educated choice among the handful of plans you’re now considering. In the 
following sections, I suggest other worthwhile searches, along with some 
relevant tips and warnings. These sections explain how you can use the 
online Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder to explore the following six 
topics in depth: examining drug coverage details, lowering your drug costs, 
determining mail-order prices, making pharmacy choices, assessing 
customer service, and filling prescriptions away from home.
 
When you’ve done these additional searches and are ready to make a final 
selection, print out the details of your top four plans and compare them, point 
by point. You can use the worksheet in Appendix A to make the comparison 
easier.

166
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Looking at the nuances of 
drug coverage details
The plan finder shows a lot of information about drug coverage on each 
plan’s details page. But as you dive in, consider the info in the following 
sections to help you understand some nuances that aren’t immediately 
apparent or that may puzzle you.
Reviewing the pricing of covered drugs
When examining a plan’s details page for the prices of your covered drugs, 
some items may strike you as odd. Here are the explanations:
 
 If a drug is covered but shown as full price in the initial coverage period, 
that’s probably because the full price is lower than the co-pay, so the 
plan charges you the lesser of the two amounts. You can check this by 
looking at the plan’s usual co-pay for the relevant tier of charges — click 
“View Important Notes and Benefit Summary” on the menu at the top 
of the page. For example, if the full price of your Tier 2 drug is $15.50, 
but the normal co-pay for Tier 2 drugs is $20, you’re charged the lesser 
amount.
 
 If you see that Drug X is charged as a co-pay in the Gap column, whereas 
Drug Y is charged at full price, then Drug X is one of the drugs that this 
plan covers in the doughnut hole, but Drug Y isn’t.
 
 If you see an odd-looking price in the initial coverage column — for 
example, $23.97, rather than a nicely rounded dollar amount like $24 — 
it means that this plan charges coinsurance, not a flat co-pay. (Flip to 
Chapter 3 for more on coinsurance and co-pays.) So the price shown is a 
percentage of the full price.
 
 If you see that the cost of a drug in the Catastrophic Coverage column is 
higher than the standard catastrophic co-pay — $2.25 per prescription 
for generics or $5.60 for brand-names in 2008 ($2.40 and $6.00 
respectively in 2009) — it means that you’re being charged 5 percent of 
the drug’s cost instead of the co-pay. Under Part D law, you pay either a 
co-pay or a maximum 5 percent of the full price, whichever’s the higher 
amount.
 
 If the full cost of your drugs is very high, you may see what seems to be 
a most peculiar profile for your monthly out-of-pocket expenses on the 
bar chart at the end of each plan’s details page. The chart may show 
a very large amount in the first month’s column (amounting to several 
thousand dollars) and very small amounts for the rest of the year. That’s 
because your drug costs are so high that you go through the deductible 
(if any), the initial coverage period, and the doughnut hole in the very 
first month. The small amounts thereafter are low-cost catastrophic 
coverage.

167
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
 
 If you look at the bar charts for drugs purchased by mail order, you may 
notice a strangely uneven profile in your out-of-pocket expenses over the 
year — for example, $400 in months 1, 4, 7, and 10, and $25 in the other 
months. That’s because you’re buying your drugs in three-month 
supplies, in advance. During the second and third month of each quarter, 
you have no outlay, except for the plan’s premium ($25 in this example).
Finding the pricing for drugs a plan doesn’t cover
Be aware that you can’t tell just by looking at the main plan list whether all of 
your drugs are covered by any particular plan — or whether a plan imposes 
restrictions on any of them. For that, you have to go to each plan’s details list 
and look at the Drug Coverage Information section (see the earlier section 
“Drilling Down to Drug Plan Details”). Drugs that a plan doesn’t cover have 
NOT ON FORMULARY next to their names. But wait, there’s more!
The main plan list and each plan’s details page show a dollar amount rep-
resenting your estimated annual cost under each plan. But that amount 
includes the full price of any drug that the plan doesn’t cover. The plan finder 
presents the information this way because, if it excludes the price for an 
uncovered drug completely, the overall cost of that plan appears lower than 
what you actually pay. Including the full price of an uncovered drug in the 
overall estimate gives you a better idea of what your out-of-pocket expenses 
are likely to be under that plan, especially when you’re comparing it with the 
costs of a plan that covers this drug.
 
A plan may cover a specialty drug (usually Tier 4 or higher) if you purchase it 
from a network pharmacy — but may not if you get it from the plan’s mail-order 
service. So when looking at mail-order prices, be sure to check out this info.
Discovering omissions or discrepancies on the plan finder
 
When you can’t find something you’re looking for, or the information seems 
wrong, there may be an explanation or it may be the result of a glitch or error 
on the plan finder. In the following scenarios, if you need to report the 
problem to Medicare, call the help line at 800-633-4227:
 
 You enter the name of a drug, and the plan finder doesn’t find it. First, 
check that the name you’re entering is spelled correctly or try to find 
it on the alphabetical list provided. Verify that the med in question is a 
prescription drug and not an over-the-counter drug or a vitamin — Part 
D doesn’t cover these kinds of medication. If nothing checks out, call 
Medicare to report the error, or to see whether there’s a reason this 
drug isn’t on the list.
 
 The plan finder doesn’t allow you to enter the dosage of your drug. 
First, check that the dosage you’re trying to enter is correct, according to 
the medication label. If it’s right, report the omission to Medicare imme-
diately. In the meantime, enter the dosage that’s nearest to yours — very 
often a plan’s co-pays are the same for similar dosages.

168
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
 The name of one of your drugs doesn’t appear in the cost details of the 
plan you’re looking at. First, check in the Drug Coverage column that the 
drug is in fact on your list of selected drugs. If it’s not, scroll down the 
page and add it to your list. If the drug is already on the list, but not show-
ing up in the cost details, Medicare may have temporarily removed the 
information after discovering that this plan submitted incorrect pricing. 
Check back a day or two later. If it’s still not there, call Medicare to report 
the omission.
 
 The price given for a drug under one plan is very different from the 
price given under several other plans. Prices vary a good deal among 
plans, but mistakes happen. For example, occasionally plans submit the 
generic price to the plan finder rather than the specified brand-name 
price. You can check this by entering the name of the generic version on 
your drug list and seeing whether its price is the same as the price given 
for the brand-name. If it is, report that to Medicare immediately.
Checking to see whether the numbers add up
Many people like to do their own math to see if the calculations made on 
the plan finder actually add up properly. In some cases, checking the math 
yourself is easy to do. For example, if a plan has no deductible and your drug 
costs aren’t high enough to take you into the doughnut hole, your out-of-
pocket costs will be the same each month. Just add the cost of the premium 
to your monthly co-pays — then look at the bar chart at the bottom of the 
plan’s details page to see whether the monthly totals displayed there are the 
same. Multiply this monthly total by 12 to check the annual out-of-pocket 
cost shown at the top of the page.
 
Calculating costs on your own is much trickier if the plan has a deductible 
and/or your drug costs are high enough to take you into the coverage gap — 
or through the gap and into catastrophic coverage. In these situations, your 
monthly costs fluctuate according to the coverage level — and the change 
from one to another most often doesn’t fall neatly at the end of any given 
month. The calculation is possible. But quite frankly — and I speak from 
experience — you can go nuts trying to figure it out with pen and paper, or 
even with a calculator. In these circumstances, you probably need to have 
faith that the figures on the plan finder are pretty much correct.
Lowering costs with alternative drugs
You can dramatically reduce your costs if any of the brand-name drugs you 
take now have a generic version or a similar, older alternative that your 
doctor thinks would work just as well for your medical condition. I discuss 
these kinds of medications and why they’re less expensive than brand-name 
drugs in detail in Chapter 16. But in this section, I show you how to find 
lower-cost alternatives and their comparative prices on the plan finder.

169
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
In Step 10 of my navigation guide in the earlier section “Moving Step by Step 
through the Medicare Plan Finder — The Fast Way,” I advise you to remove 
the check mark from the little box at the end of the list of drugs you’ve 
entered. That’s because, if you leave the box checked, the plan finder 
automatically replaces the names of your drugs with generics, if any exist. 
It can be a shock to see a totally unfamiliar name appear in your drug list 
without realizing what’s happened. And it seems to me that you’d prefer to 
find out the prices of your prescribed drugs before looking to see whether 
any lower-cost alternatives exist. That way, you know how much you’d save if 
you switch to the alternatives.
Here, I assume that you’ve searched plans on the basis of the drugs you’re 
taking now and have a shortlist of the plans that work out least expensively. 
Now you can see whether those costs can be brought down further. Choose 
a plan on the main plan list and click “Lower this cost” in the second column. 
Or click the plan’s name to get to the plan details page and click “Lower 
My Cost Share” on the menu at the top left. The page that appears on your 
screen will look like the example in Table 10-3.

Do your drugs have any lower-cost alternatives?
As you can see in the example in Table 10-3, the plan finder shows you which 
brand-name medication has a similar drug that can be used instead, which 
has a generic version, or which has no alternative. (Not all brand-name drugs 
have alternatives to date, as I explain in Chapter 16.) The list shows the 
percentage and dollar differences in co-pays or coinsurance between the 
brand-name drugs and the suggested alternatives. And it shows the savings 
over a month — in this case, almost $100.

170
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
If these cost savings sound too good to be true, let me assure you that this 
example is the result of an actual search using this set of drugs. What’s 
more, Zoloft isn’t covered on the formulary of this particular plan — the 
odd figure in the second column shows the full price — but the generic is 
covered, at a fraction of the price. (Under a different plan, which covers 
Zoloft as a nonpreferred Tier 3 drug with a co-pay of $54 a month, using the 
Tier 1 generic version reduces the co-pay to $4.)
 
On-screen, this page shows drug costs at retail pharmacies. You can also see 
the mail-order costs by clicking “Show Mail Order (90-Day Supply) Prices” at 
the top of the list. Opting for mail order may bring down your costs even 
further. Under the plan used for the example in Table 10-3, the similar drug 
(for Lipitor) and the generic (for Zoloft) each cost nothing under the 
mail-order option, reducing the overall monthly cost by half, to $15 a month.
 
As usual in Part D, savings on lower-cost drugs vary a great deal among plans. 
So after examining these details under one plan, look at similar cost savings 
for other plans on your shortlist by using the same steps. As a result, a 
different plan may now work out as the least expensive for you.
And what about that fourth column on the right-hand side of Table 10-3? This 
column shows whether any of the drug manufacturers’ patient assistance 
programs offer this drug for free or at low cost for eligible people with limited 
incomes. (I describe these programs as a possible way of lowering costs in 
the coverage gap in Chapter 16.) If a “No” appears in that column, it means 
the drug isn’t available under an assistance program. If a “Yes” appears, you 
can click it for details about the program — including the income limits for 
qualifying and how to apply.
One more useful bit of information is on this page. Notice the State Programs 
heading above the chart. These are State Pharmacy Assistance Programs 
(SPAPs) that are offered in some states for people whose incomes are limited 
but who don’t qualify for Medicaid. Clicking the link takes you to a page that 
provides details of the program in your state and how to contact it.
Which drugs would lower the cost?
If you find you can lower your costs with some alternative drugs, be sure 
to know their names and whether they require different dosages from the 
brand-name drugs you take now. You can locate this information on the plan 
finder by clicking the “Similar drug” or “Generic” link in the third column of 
the Lower My Drug Cost Share list. Doing so brings up a new list, which looks 
similar to the example in Table 10-4.

This example shows Lipitor, one of a group of drugs called statins widely 
used to treat high cholesterol. Currently, it doesn’t have a generic form. But 
some older statins, such as Crestor and Zocor, do have generic versions, and 
these generics are the lower-cost options shown in the left-hand column.
 
Generics and similar older drugs sometimes require different dosages and/or 
quantities to achieve the same clinical effect as the brand-name drugs they’re 
copying. As you can see in Table 10-4, someone taking 20 mg of Lipitor once a 
day needs to take 40 mg of simvastatin once a day or 40 mg of pravastatin or 
lovastatin twice a day for these alternatives to work as effectively. Most plans 
charge the same co-pays for generics regardless of dosage or quantities (as 
this one does), but some may not. So be sure to check the co-pays when 
looking at your own drug list.
This chart also shows whether a drug manufacturer’s patient assistance 
program will cover the drug in question. When the given alternatives to the 
brand-name drugs are generics, as in this example, the answer is “No.” If a 
given alternative is an older brand-name drug, the answer may be “Yes.”
How do you use the information you find?
 
If you discover an opportunity for lowering your costs through this kind of 
search and decide that you want to try any of the suggested alternative drugs, 
you need to talk to your doctor about whether the substitute may work well 
for you. Printing out the page that gives the names, dosages, and quantities for 
these alternatives and showing it to your doctor is a good idea.

Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Considering mail order
The third column of the main plan list shows at a glance an estimate of what 
each plan charges for your meds over the whole year if you buy all of them 
by mail order. If the plan offers a mail-order service — and if most of your 
drugs are maintenance medications you take regularly, which makes getting 
them in 90-day supplies worthwhile — you may find that this option lowers 
your costs. (You can find examples of mail-order savings in Chapter 16.)
 
The savings generated by using this option vary a great deal among plans. You 
may find that the whole ranking of least expensive plans changes. For example, 
a plan that’s shown as the fifth least expensive under the retail pharmacy option 
may actually be number one under mail order. That’s because one plan may 
charge exactly the same for your set of drugs, whether by retail or mail order; 
another may charge a lot less for mail order over the whole year. For this reason, 
having a quick look at the mail-order costs for more than five plans is worth-
while. Some plans charge lower co-pays (as well as a lower full price) for mail 
order — for example, nothing for Tier 1 generic drugs, compared with $5 for 
retail. To see specifics, go to the details page of each plan you’re considering and 
click the “Show” button on Monthly Drug Cost Details at Mail Order Pharmacy.
 
If you’re considering mail order, reviewing the detailed list of monthly costs in 
the mail-order list for each plan is sensible. Some plans charge higher co-pays 
for mail order — for example, $7 for mail-order generics compared with $4 for 
generics from a retail pharmacy.
 
And here’s another important pitfall to watch out for: Some plans don’t cover 
certain drugs under their mail-order option at all, even though the same 
drugs are covered at a retail pharmacy. These are often specialty drugs — the 
rarest and/or most expensive meds that are placed in a plan’s highest tier of 
charges — which you must buy at a pharmacy that stocks them. For example, 
one plan charges a monthly co-pay of $270 for a cancer drug purchased at 
retail pharmacies, but it charges full price — $743 — when the same drug is 
bought by mail order. The plan finder (at least in 2008) doesn’t highlight this 
fact. You have to look carefully at the mail-order cost list to find out. If the 
price of a drug shown in the Initial Coverage Level column on that list is the 
same as in the Full Cost of Drug column, the drug isn’t covered by mail order.
Examining retail pharmacy choices
Being able to use your plan coverage at retail pharmacies within a convenient 
distance from your home is obviously an important consideration when 
choosing a plan. (Even if you prefer mail order for your regular meds, sooner 
or later you may need a short-term drug, such as an antibiotic, purchased 
locally so you can start taking it immediately.) Most Part D plans, especially 
those offered by big insurance companies, have a wide selection of network 

173
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
pharmacies, including large chains and smaller independent pharmacies. And 
many of the same pharmacies are within the networks of different plans.
 
When you’re enrolled in a Part D plan, you must go to one of the pharmacies 
within its network to ensure paying the price you expect. Going out of the 
plan’s network costs a lot more (unless you do so for an unavoidable, 
legitimate reason that your plan accepts, as explained in Chapter 14), and 
these payments don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit that lifts you out of 
the doughnut hole (see Chapter 15).
The plan finder provides tons of info on pharmacy choices, but you need to 
tread carefully in your search, as I explain in the following sections.
Identifying the pharmacies in a plan’s network
 
In Step 10 of the earlier section “Moving Step by Step through the Medicare 
Plan Finder — The Fast Way,” I advise you to ignore the invitation to select a 
pharmacy at that stage. Here’s why:
 
 If you click “Yes” (when asked “Do you want to select a specific pharmacy 
or pharmacies from which you prefer to purchase your drugs?”), a list of 
pharmacies in your area appears on-screen. But you have no way of 
telling which of these pharmacies are in any plan’s network.
 
 If you select a pharmacy on this list, the plan finder’s search engine 
looks first for plans that include the pharmacy in its network; your out-
of-pocket costs are a secondary consideration. In other words, you may 
not find the least expensive plan.
 
 This list may include names that aren’t regular pharmacies, but may be 
doctors’ offices or hospital departments that dispense specialty drugs 
(such as medications used to treat cancer). Most plans don’t include 
these dispensers in their networks. If you select such pharmacies at this 
stage, the out-of-pocket costs that appear on the plan details page are 
going to be based on the full price of all of your drugs.
A better way to identify in-network pharmacies is to go to the individual plan 
details pages first, before searching for any pharmacy information, to get 
an idea of which plans are best for your set of drugs. Then you can find out 
which pharmacies are in the network of any plan you’re considering.
Click “View Pharmacy Network” on the menu at the top left of the plan details 
page to reveal a list of pharmacies within a certain distance of your zip code. 
(If this link doesn’t work, turn off your pop-up blocker.) In densely populated 
urban areas, this distance may be as little as half a mile. In rural areas, it 
may be seven miles or more. To widen the mileage radius, alter the distance 
shown in the box and click “Find Pharmacies.”

174
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
The resulting list shows the pharmacies within the plan’s network, meaning 
that the plan covers any of its formulary drugs that you purchase there. The 
Pharmacy Type column to the right indicates which pharmacies supply certain 
kinds of drugs — for example, those that are home infusion (self-injected) or 
specialty drugs (like some cancer medications). In the column at the far right, 
a Yes or No indicates whether pharmacies are preferred by the plan, meaning 
you may purchase your drugs at these locations at somewhat lower prices.
Comparing prices among in-network pharmacies
Even within the same plan’s network, different pharmacies may offer 
varying prices for your drugs. The out-of-pocket annual totals shown on the 
main plan list or at the top of each plan’s details page reflect the average of 
the prices offered by the plan’s preferred pharmacies in your area — that is, 
all those pharmacies with which the plan has negotiated the best discounts.
To see price differences for your set of drugs among specific pharmacies in 
each plan, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the main plan list, scroll down to the My Pharmacies section, 
and click “Change Pharmacy Selection.”
 
 The result is a list of all the pharmacies within the smallest mileage 
distance of your zip code.
 
2. Expand the mileage radius to see more pharmacies farther away by 
scrolling down the page until you see the Change Criteria to Revise 
List of Pharmacies section.
 
 You can alter the distance shown in the box by using the dropdown 
menu and clicking the distance you want. Then click “Update List.” If the 
new list of pharmacies is large, you must click the “All one page” link to 
see them all.
 
 Be aware that this list shows all the pharmacies in your area and doesn’t 
specify which ones are in the network of any particular plan.
 
3. Select your desired pharmacy by clicking the little box alongside its 
name and then click “Continue.”
 
 You can check up to two boxes, if you prefer. Either way, this step 
returns you to the main plan list.
 
4. Choose one drug plan by clicking its name.
 
 The details page of your selected plan now appears with the prices 
charged at your chosen pharmacy. Its name is shown in the Full Year 
Cost and Monthly Drug Cost Details sections. If you selected two phar-
macies, both appear in the Full Year Cost section. To see monthly cost 
details of the second pharmacy, click the “Show” button on the panel 
displaying that pharmacy’s name.
 
5. Observe whether your selected pharmacy is in this plan’s network.

175
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
 
 If it isn’t, note the warning message (above the Monthly Drug Cost 
Details section) that states: “You’ll pay 100% of the cost for drugs at this 
pharmacy because it is not in the plan’s network.” In this case, only the 
full price of your set of drugs is displayed.
 
6. Return to the main plan list and repeat the process step by step to see 
prices at other pharmacies.
 
Comparing pharmacy prices this way can be a laborious procedure. So I 
recommend that for each plan you’re considering, check that a few familiar 
pharmacies are in the plan’s network (by clicking “View Pharmacy Network,” as 
explained in the previous section) before doing anything else. Then select those 
pharmacies, one by one, as explained in Step 3. Make a note of each pharmacy’s 
annual overall costs for each plan you’re considering so you can compare them 
more easily. Remember that the prices of most pharmacies within each plan’s 
network vary only a little, but these prices can change during the year.
 
The most important step is to make sure that the Part D plan you choose has 
at least one pharmacy in its network within a convenient distance of your 
home. And no, after you’re in a plan you don’t have to stick with one pharmacy 
from which to buy all or any of your drugs. If you have plenty of network 
pharmacies to choose from, you can always shop around among them when 
filling your prescription.
Knowing what to do if you already have a favorite pharmacy
You may especially like a certain pharmacy and you’d prefer to continue 
using it. Chances are pretty high that this pharmacy is in the network of at 
least one of the Part D plans on your shortlist, or even in all of them.
But what if it’s not? You can make a new search (using the pharmacy 
selection tool explained in the preceding section) to find another plan that 
has this pharmacy in its network. Then you need to compare this new plan’s 
costs with the prices of your shortlist plans. The difference may amount to 
only a few dollars over the year. On the other hand, the difference may be 
quite large. In that case, you need to consider whether cost outweighs 
convenience, or vice versa.
Assessing customer service
Naturally, some plans are better than others when it comes to providing good 
customer service and other kinds of performance. Medicare’s online plan 
finder helps you assess this, before you join a plan, by publishing quality 
ratings for each plan on its details page. This page includes an overall quality 
rating expressed in the form of stars and ranging from poor (one star), through 
fair (two stars), good (three stars), and very good (four stars), to excellent 
(five stars). This rating system gives a broad idea of how Medicare and plan 
enrollees have rated the plan overall.

176
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
But you can also drill down further to see how the plan rates on a range of 
specific performance measures — from how long it takes to get a live person 
on the phone to how well the plan handles appeals. To see this detailed 
breakdown, click the link labeled “Click to view more details on Plan Ratings” 
immediately above the stars. Doing so brings up a page showing three main 
areas of performance:
 
 Drug plan customer service: This category includes statistics on how 
long a plan keeps you or your pharmacist on hold during a call, how 
often such calls are disconnected in mid-conversation, how helpful the 
plan is in providing information, and how many complaints are filed 
about the plan.
 
 Using your plan to get your prescriptions filled: This category indicates 
how easily enrollees get their prescriptions filled, complaints about the 
plan’s benefits and access to medications, complaints about problems 
met in joining or leaving the plan, and the frequency with which the plan 
delays making timely coverage determinations or appeals decisions.
 
 Drug pricing information: This category focuses on the accuracy of 
prices submitted to the plan finder, the frequency with which a plan 
changes prices, and complaints about out-of-pocket costs, for example 
being charged the wrong amount for a prescription or a premium.
To see all the details in these three categories, click “Show All Plan Ratings” 
at the top of this page. Click “View Numbers” at the top left to see the actual 
numbers on which a plan’s stars are based (for example: time on hold — 25 
seconds, or complaints about drug plan — 2.5 per 1,000 enrollees).
Medicare arrives at this information through regular monitoring of the plans, 
complaints from consumers enrolled in each plan, surveys among enrollees, 
and some independent assessments. You can see more details of how each 
point is measured by clicking “Click to view Data Sources” under each of the 
three category headings. If a plan is new to the Part D program, you may see 
the phrase “Insufficient data” next to some of the measures.
 
The more often enrollees let Medicare know how their plan is doing, the more 
useful these quality ratings become for people choosing a plan. So if you have 
a legitimate complaint about the plan you’re enrolled in, tell Medicare! Just 
call the Medicare help line at 800-633-4227 (877-486-2048 for TDD users) and 
say you want to file a grievance — the Medicare term for a complaint. (I cover 
how to file a grievance in Chapter 19.)

177
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
Searching for pharmacies if you travel or 
live away from home for part of the year
If you travel a lot, you need a plan that allows you to fill prescriptions anywhere 
in the country. You can initially find out which plans do by clicking the “View 
Important Notes and Benefit Summary” link in the top-left menu on each plan 
details page. To confirm this information, check directly with the plan you select 
before enrolling in it, because some plans may allow this service for medical 
necessity only and not as a matter of convenience.
 
If you’re a snowbird or have any other reason to spend a large chunk of the 
year away from home in a particular place, you certainly need a drug plan you 
can use in both regions. So you probably want to search for pharmacies in both 
zip codes. If so, spare yourself a deal of confusion by saving your list of drugs 
when doing an initial search to find plans in your home area. Don’t use your 
retrieval ID number to look at plans in the other zip code. Instead, enter your 
list of drugs all over again and save it a second time to get a different ID number. 
When the plan finder saves your original search, it automatically embeds the 
first zip code, along with the pharmacies located in that area. So if you use the 
same ID retrieval number for the other zip code, where pharmacies are different, 
the information can be distorted. For example, you may see a message saying, 
“You’ll pay 100% of the cost for drugs at this pharmacy because it is not in the 
plan’s network” — even if you haven’t selected a particular pharmacy. Creating a 
second search prevents this confusion from happening.
Finding Personal Help to Compare Plans
Not everyone has a computer or access to the Internet. Not everyone is familiar 
or comfortable with online searches. And you know what? That’s a-okay. Don’t 
feel badly if you’ve glanced at the previous sections on navigating the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Plan Finder and think “she may as well have written in 
hieroglyphics.” You can find the same information by getting help from a live 
person.
Yes, at this point it may seem easier to choose a Part D plan by one of the 
unwise methods I mention earlier in this chapter — you know, signing up for 
the same plan as your spouse, opting for a plan with a well-known name, or 
listening to a sales pitch. But don’t go wobbly on me now.
The whole point of this chapter is to help you find the plan that’s best for you — 
the one that covers your drugs at the lowest cost. So don’t be put off when 
I say the plan finder is the most efficient way of getting there. The following 
sections list people you can turn to for help.

178
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Asking family or friends for assistance
You may not be into computers, but I’m willing to bet someone in your family 
or circle of friends is. And, no matter how antsy you feel about asking for 
help, finding the right Part D plan is an excellent reason to do just that.
Maybe you have teenage grandchildren who are whizzes at electronics — 
and wouldn’t they be thrilled if you asked them to help! Never underestimate 
the ability of youngsters to pick their way through a complicated database 
without turning a hair. They’ve grown up with this stuff and know perfectly 
well that they’re more expert than you. (Even folks nifty on computers dread 
the day when their last child leaves home, depriving them of on-the-spot tech 
support.) Some families now make the process of helping their older 
members pick a Medicare prescription drug plan for the following year into 
an annual event. Lucky coincidence that Thanksgiving falls slap in the middle 
of the Part D open enrollment period, eh?
Of course, you don’t want to pitch even your favorite relative or best friend 
into the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan finder cold turkey — especially at 
Thanksgiving! Fortunately you can help her out. Give her your list of prescription 
drugs and the previous sections of this chapter to read and let her take it from 
there. After she finds a shortlist of two or three likely plans and prints them out, 
you can compare the options to make your final pick . . . for this year anyway.
Seeking help from professionals
By professionals I don’t mean people who are necessarily making a whole 
career out of giving Part D advice. I mean people who are trained to help, 
whether they’re being paid or they’re volunteering. By contacting any of the 
following three services, you can talk to someone who can use the plan finder 
to identify a Part D plan that suits you — and, best of all, the services don’t 
cost you a penny.
Calling the Medicare help line
You can call the official Medicare help line toll-free at 800-633-4227 (or 
877-486-2048 for TDD users with impaired hearing) and ask a customer 
representative to find the two or three plans that best meet your needs 
and to mail printouts of their details to you. The rep just needs to know 
your Medicare ID number, your zip code, and the names of the prescription 
drugs you take, plus their dosages and how often you take them. Remember, 
making an accurate list of your drugs is essential. Flip to the section titled 
“Creating an accurate list of your meds” for help organizing this crucial
information.

179
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
How helpful is the help line? Medicare uses contracted workers as customer 
representatives and gives them basic training, though their knowledge of Part 
D isn’t extensive. Feedback from consumers (and others who call the number 
to test the quality of the service) is mixed, as you may expect. Some callers 
get through to a rep in a jiffy; others remain on hold for ten minutes, or much 
longer. Some are satisfied with the information they receive; others aren’t.
 
So when you’re looking to find a Part D plan, it helps to be as specific as 
possible. Use the following steps to explain what you want:
 
1. Tell the rep whether you’re looking for drug coverage through a 
stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP), a Medicare Advantage plan 
(MAPD), or a Special Needs Plan (SNP), as explained in Chapter 9.
 
2. Ask the rep to run a plan search using the details of your prescribed 
drugs — without substituting generics for them at this stage.
 
3. Tell the rep whether you qualify for Extra Help.
 
 If you’re eligible for full Extra Help (as explained in Chapter 5), say 
whether you want a plan that doesn’t charge a premium, or whether 
you’re prepared to pay part of the premium for a plan that may suit you 
better.
 
4. Ask the rep to do an initial search for the least expensive plans that 
cover your drugs before talking about pharmacy preferences or ways 
to lower your drug costs.
 
5. When the rep has completed this initial search and has a shortlist of 
possible plans, ask him to check whether each plan
 
a. Covers all your drugs
 
b. Places any restrictions (prior authorization, quantity limits, or step 
therapy — see Chapter 4) on any of your drugs
 
c. Has in-network pharmacies that are convenient to you
 
d. Offers a mail-order service that covers 90-day supplies of your 
drugs (if this option is important to you)
 
e. Covers your prescriptions at its network pharmacies in all 50 
states and/or the territories (if this option is important to you)
 
6. Ask the rep to check the mail-order prices of your drugs in several 
plans to see whether these prices generate more savings.
 
7. Ask the rep to check whether you can reduce your expenses by using 
lower-cost drugs in each plan on the shortlist and, if so, by how much.

180
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
8. Ask the rep to mail you printouts of the three plans that best meet 
your needs.
 
 The printouts should include full details of mail-order service, a list of 
each plan’s network pharmacies in your area, and details of the costs 
of lower-priced drugs in each plan. Ask the rep to confirm that these 
details are captured before mailing the printouts to you.
 
 If the customer service rep refuses to give you all the info you ask for, 
ask to speak to the rep’s supervisor. You have a right to ask as many 
questions as you like to find a Part D plan that suits your needs. If the 
rep gives the impression that finding a plan for you is tedious or taking 
too much time, you also have the right to complain.
When you receive the printouts, you can compare each plan to make a final 
choice by using the worksheet in Appendix A, if desired.
Calling your State Health Insurance Assistance Program
State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, called SHIPs, provide expert 
free counseling services — specifically for people in Medicare — in all 50 
states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. Nationwide, more than 12,000 SHIP counselors (mainly trained 
volunteers) assist more than 2 million people every year with a wide range of 
Medicare problems, including how to choose a Part D plan. Go to Appendix B 
to find contact information for your local SHIP.
When you call your SHIP, you can schedule a face-to-face meeting with a local 
counselor or arrange to talk over a toll-free phone line. If English isn’t your 
first language, you can ask to speak with someone who knows yours. A SHIP 
counseling session may resolve a comparatively simple situation quickly and 
can be especially valuable if your circumstances are complicated.
When helping you choose a Part D plan, the SHIP counselor needs to know
 
 The names of your drugs, their dosages, and how often you take them in 
order to search the plan finder
 
 Whether you’re looking for drug coverage through a stand-alone pre-
scription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage health plan
 
 Whether you’re eligible for Extra Help
The counselor can also help you choose a Medicare Advantage plan or apply 
for Extra Help, if necessary.
Calling your Area Agency on Aging
Every state and U.S. territory has an Area Agency on Aging (AAA) that 
provides a multitude of local services for people age 60 and over, including 
assistance with Medicare issues. In many cases, local AAAs rely on the SHIPs, 
described in the preceding section, to provide counseling on Medicare and 

181
 Chapter 10: Making a Smart Choice among Medicare Prescription Drug Plans
Part D. But some have their own trained volunteers who can give personal 
help in finding a Part D plan.
Find the number of your local AAA by calling the national Eldercare Locator 
toll-free at 800-677-1116. Calls are accepted on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Eastern time. You can speak with someone in one of 150 languages, including 
Spanish. For more information on local services, visit www.eldercare.gov.
Taking advice from other sources
You may well be able to get advice on picking a Part D plan from a variety 
of other sources. For example, many people report that they turn to their 
doctors, pharmacists, and insurance agents. Others receive help at senior 
centers, seminars, and info sessions of many kinds. Others are turning to new 
Part D plan-finding businesses that are popping up on the Internet.
Which of these info distributors can you trust to find a plan that meets your 
personal needs? Essentially, when can you believe what you hear — and when 
should you be skeptical? Following are some rules of thumb that may help:
 
 Just because someone is a professional doesn’t necessarily mean he 
knows enough about Part D to be of use to you in picking a plan. Doctors 
and pharmacists are professionals in their own fields and may be 
absolutely terrific at their jobs. But unless they’re able to run your 
particular set of drugs through the plan finder to search for the plan that 
covers your drugs and costs you least, they can’t really help you.
 
 Insurance agents are also professionals, and many of them are very 
knowledgeable about Part D. Others aren’t, and some are paid high com-
missions to sell a particular Part D plan (as explained in Chapter 11). 
If you have an agent who’s handled other insurance for you in the past 
and whom you trust, you may naturally turn to him to find a Part D plan. 
However, you should ask whether he’s able to use the plan finder to 
search for your best bet. If not, going to someone who can may be wiser.
 
 People on Medicare are often invited to info sessions at senior centers, 
retirement communities, hotels, or other venues and offered help in 
finding a Part D plan. Some of these sessions are an excellent value — 
for example, the ones run by volunteers from SHIP or other consumer 
groups. These trained people either show you how to use the plan finder 
yourself or run the numbers for you to help you pick a plan.
 
 Other sessions are basically sales pitches for a single insurance company, 
promoting only the Part D plans it sells. If you hear information that dwells 
on a plan rather than your personal needs — or someone tries to sign you 
up for a plan on the spot — consider that an immediate red flag. And if 
whoever’s sponsoring the session offers you dinner on the house or other 
freebies, get out of there fast! These sneaky hard-sell tactics are real, as are 
outright scams, but I give you the tools to avoid them in Chapter 11.

182
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
 Wherever an opportunity opens up, some entrepreneur steps in to fill 
it. So the number of enterprising businesses offering to find Part D plans 
for seniors, usually for a fee, really isn’t surprising. If these operations 
are legitimate, whether offered through the Internet or by mail, they rely 
on the Medicare plan finder for their results. And if the results are good, 
you may consider your money well spent. But as of this writing, these 
plan-finding businesses are too new to assess whether they’re all 
legitimate or whether at least some may involve a new type of scam. In 
any case, why pay for a service you can get for free from someone you 
know you can trust, such as a family member, friend, or SHIP counselor?
What were they thinking . . . when they created so 
many Part D plans?
Strangely enough, nobody expected there’d 
be so many Part D plans. In fact, members of 
Congress were uncertain whether enough 
private insurers would offer enough Part D 
plans to provide competition, especially in rural 
areas. Some insurance honchos even predicted 
that the industry wouldn’t be interested in 
offering stand-alone plans — the kind that 
provide only drugs and no other healthcare — 
because such plans had never existed before 
and were regarded as unprofitable. (The chief 
executive officer of one leading insurance 
company went so far as to call stand-alones 
“a harebrained idea” that just wouldn’t fly.) So 
when the law was written in 2003, it included 
a clause allowing the federal government to 
provide its own fallback drug plan in any area 
where fewer than two private plans entered the 
market. In other words, Congress guaranteed 
that at least two drug plans would be available 
to everyone on Medicare.
At least two! How quaint that seems today, with 
at least 50 stand-alone plans and dozens of 
Medicare Advantage plans plying their wares 
in every locality. What happened? As it turned 
out, the insurance industry — drawn by large 
federal subsidies — saw Medicare prescription 
drug coverage as a money-making bonanza. 
The result was much like the California Gold 
Rush of the mid-1800s, with scores of insurers 
scrambling to carve out their share of a huge 
new market. That’s how Medicare beneficia-
ries came to be confronted with a bewildering 
number of choices.
So will there always be so many plans? Some 
experts anticipate that over time the market 
will shake out, with only a few of the largest 
plans — those that have attracted the greatest 
number of enrollees — remaining in business. 
This scenario would reduce the choices but, 
with less competition, probably also increase 
enrollees’ costs. Another potential turnaround 
is if Congress reduces or eliminates federal 
subsidies to plans, causing many of them to 
pull out of Part D. And yet another possibility, 
favored by some members of Congress and 
health policy experts, is to simplify plan choices 
by standardizing their designs — limiting them 
to maybe ten different options, each provided 
by a number of insurers at varying costs — in 
the way that Medigap supplementary insurance 
works today. Meanwhile, until any of those 
scenarios happen (or some entirely different 
development occurs), it’s safe to say the days 
of a Part D plan plethora won’t be over anytime 
soon.

Chapter 11
Buyer Beware: Avoiding Scams 
and Hard-Sell Marketing
In This Chapter
 Protecting yourself against outright scams
 Resisting aggressive and unethical sales tactics
M
edicare Parts C and D are commercial marketplaces where products 
(in this case, Medicare health plans and prescription drug plans) are 
sold to consumers (Medicare beneficiaries). And like every other market-
place, they attract their share of swindlers and rip-off artists whose sad aim 
in life is to separate unsuspecting customers from their money.
But you aren’t going to be easy meat! You aren’t going to give those creeps 
any chance to exploit your uncertainties and trust! You may not come up 
against any of them at all, but if you do, you’ll be prepared. Why? Because I’m 
going to show you how to see through their deceptions and sweet talk so you 
know when to show them the door, hang up the phone, or walk away.
In this chapter, I explain how to be on your guard against two quite different 
types of deceptive practices: the outright scam and the hard sell. I also 
suggest what you can do — maybe even to reverse the situation — if you do 
get ripped off.
Steering Clear of Outright Scams
An outright scam is when some thief pretends to be from Medicare, Social 
Security, or a Part D plan and asks for sensitive information — such as your 
Social Security, credit card, or bank account number — in an attempt to steal 
your identity or money.

Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Outright scammers have nothing to do with Medicare. They’re just using 
Medicare (and most often Part D) as a pretext to cheat you of your hard-
earned cash. The scam may be relatively simple — like trying to con you into 
paying a nonexistent enrollment fee for a false Part D plan. Or it may be a 
much more serious attempt to commit identity theft.
 
Identity thieves hunt for key pieces of personal information — Social Security 
numbers (or Medicare IDs, which are the same thing), credit card or bank 
account numbers, and even dates of birth and mothers’ maiden names if they 
can get them. Whatever personal data they pull about you, identity thieves 
use it to buy merchandise, apply for new credit cards in your name, or make 
a profit by selling it to other identity thieves. Many of them have managed to 
buy big-ticket items, like houses, cars, and even expensive medical care, by 
successfully pretending to be someone else.
This crime not only robs people of money but also of their good credit rating, 
which is a much more worrying loss. Restoring your credit rating can take 
months or years of effort. Clearly, identity theft is a nightmare you want to avoid 
at all costs. That’s why I explain what you need to know in the following sections.
Red flags to watch out for
 
Scams happen unexpectedly. You answer the phone or the doorbell and find 
someone who sounds or looks perfectly respectable offering to help you. How 
can you tell whether to trust this person? Here are some pointers you should 
recognize as instant red flags:
 
 A person at your door saying he’s from Medicare or Social Security: 
The real agencies never send anyone to your home on official business 
without an appointment.
 
 A person claiming he represents a particular Part D plan: No one can 
come to your home uninvited to sell any kind of Medicare insurance. 
Doing so is illegal. Also, Medicare prohibits plans from cold-calling you 
on the phone. They can call only at your request. So if someone calls 
without your permission, it’s probably a scam.
 
 A person asking for an enrollment fee or an advance premium 
payment: You should never have to pay for someone to enroll you in a 
Medicare health or drug plan. Nor should you pay any one-time 
payment that supposedly takes care of your premiums for months, 
years, or forever. Neither the enrollment fee nor the advance premium 
payment exists, so asking for either is illegal.
 
 A person requesting your personal financial or identification 
information: Never ever give out your Social Security or Medicare ID 
number, or any details about your credit cards, bank accounts, or other 
financial information — especially on the phone. Legitimate callers don’t 
ask for this info.

185
 Chapter 11: Buyer Beware: Avoiding Scams and Hard-Sell Marketing
A few lies already reported to Medicare
Con artists dream up new and creative ideas all the time for ways to target 
older Americans and steal their money and/or identities. Following are some 
typical scams involving Medicare and Part D that seniors have reported:
 
 The loss of Medicare coverage threat: The caller claims to be a 
government official needing to check your Social Security (or Medicare 
ID) number — and threatens or implies that if you don’t provide it, you’ll 
lose your Medicare coverage. Medicare already has these numbers. You 
can’t lose Medicare benefits by refusing to give them out.
 
 The Medicare refund tactic: The caller claims to be from Medicare, says 
you’re due for a refund, and asks for your bank account number in order 
to deposit your money. This refund doesn’t exist; if it did, Medicare 
wouldn’t contact you this way.
 
 The “no more cash” routine: The caller claims to be from Medicare or 
another agency that sounds official and says that under a new Medicare 
rule you’ll no longer be able to pay cash for your Part D co-pays at the 
pharmacy. Instead, you must pay by credit or debit card, so of course 
the caller needs your card number on file, for security purposes. No 
such Medicare rule exists. You can pay for your drugs any way you 
please.
 
 The bogus Part D enrollment fee: The caller claims to be from a Part D 
plan, offers to enroll you for a fee, and asks you to pay by credit card. No 
plan or fee exists. Asking for a Part D enrollment fee is illegal.
 
 The automatic premium deduction trick: The caller claims to be from 
a Part D plan, supposedly enrolls you on the phone, and asks for your 
credit card or checking account number so the premiums can be 
automatically deducted every month. This plan doesn’t exist. No real 
Part D plan can enroll you on the phone — unless you make the call — 
or ask for payments or financial information over the phone.
 
 The ol’ “Medicare’s going out of business” line: The caller claims to be 
a federal official, tells you that Medicare is discontinuing its services, 
and says that you can buy a plan that provides a similar service. This 
scam’s a real whopper! Medicare isn’t going away.
 
You’re probably not going to encounter any of these scenarios. But it’s wise 
to be alert to the possibilities, because being forewarned is good protection. 
And what if one of these situations does happen? You can hang up the phone 
or shut the door. You can say firmly that you’re not interested. Yes, you can, 
even if you feel doing so is impolite! Don’t be deceived by a friendly voice, a 
charming smile, a willingness to chat, or an apparent interest in your health 
and lifestyle. Con artists are experts at controlling the conversation to win 
your confidence and keep you on the phone or get invited inside. These 
people don’t care about you. They’re criminals who see you as a potential 
sucker. So show them you’re not.

Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Who to contact to report a scam
 
The scams in the previous section are known only because seniors on the 
receiving end took the trouble to report them. Authorities who hear such 
reports send out alerts so the scams become widely known and more 
consumers are put on their guard. So if someone tries to scam you, do 
everyone a favor by reporting the incident to any of these offices:
 
 Your state’s attorney general or insurance commissioner. (Their phone 
numbers are in the state pages of your phone book.)
 
 Federal Trade Commission — the official consumer protection agency.
 
• Call its toll-free help line at 877-382-4357 (TDD: 866-653-4261).
 
• Write to FTC, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
NW, Washington, DC 20580.
 
• File a complaint online at www.ftc.gov.
 
 Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.
 
• Call 800-447-8477 (TDD: 800-337-4950).
 
• Write to the Inspector General, HHS, Attention: Hotline, 330 
Independence Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20201.
 
• Send an e-mail to HHSTips@oig.hhs.gov.
Actions you can take if you’re ripped off
Suppose you fall for a scam, despite your best intentions. You may be able 
to stop a payment by contacting your bank or credit card company immedi-
ately, before the transaction clears. Similarly, if you give your credit card or 
checking account number to someone who uses it to buy items without your 
consent, the credit card company or bank usually refunds the money — even 
if it has already been taken out of your account — after you report the theft 
and the company investigates it.
 
If you give out any personal information — such as your Social Security or 
Medicare ID number, or your credit card or bank numbers — you should 
seriously assume that you may be a victim of identity theft, even if you don’t 
immediately see any evidence of it. The following can give you excellent 
advice on what to do next:
 
 The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse: This California-based, nonprofit 
consumer organization provides assistance and information to likely 
or actual victims of identity theft. For fact sheets on identity theft, call 
619-298-3396 (or write to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 3100 Fifth Ave., 
Suite B, San Diego, CA 92103). You can also read the fact sheets online at 
www.privacyrights.org/identity.htm.

Hotline for consumers (877-438-4338) and a guide, Take Charge: Fighting 
Back Against Identity Theft. You can call the hotline for a free copy (in 
English or Spanish) or find it at www.ftc.gov/idtheft. Go to the same

Stories from the front lines
Soon after the hard-sell tactics used by some 
sales agents became publicly known, I invited 
readers of the AARP Bulletin to let us know if 
they’d encountered any. Here are a few of their 
stories:
  Bobby, a 75-year-old retired construction 
worker living in Oklahoma, was happy with 
his coverage from traditional Medicare and 
veterans benefits. “I’d been in Medicare 
since 1985,” he said. “I wasn’t going to 
do anything to jeopardize that.” But he 
listened when the saleswoman came to 
his home and sold him what he thought 
was a Medigap policy. “She said it was 
supplementary insurance that paid what 
Medicare didn’t,” he recalled. “She lied 
to me.” Soon afterwards, he was rushed 
to his local hospital in a coma and spent 
ten days there. It was only then that he 
discovered she’d actually signed him up 
for a Medicare HMO. Bobby’s hospital 
wasn’t in the HMO’s provider network, and 
the plan refused to pay his $45,000 bill. It 
did pay finally, because plans must cover 
emergency care. But Bobby — while still 
believing he was in traditional Medicare 
and able to go to any hospital — had already 
started a course of radiation treatment 
costing $16,000, which the plan also refused 
to pay. Eventually, after disenrolling from the 
HMO and enduring months of hassle, Bobby 
was able to get Medicare to pay for his 
treatment retroactively.
  Elinor, a 79-year-old retired nurse living 
in Florida, had recently been widowed 
and was stressed out after caring for her 
husband through a long, difficult battle 
against cancer. She knew she didn’t want 
the Medicare HMO plan the saleswoman 
was pitching. “But she kept pushing,” 
Elinor said. “And because I wasn’t in the 
best frame of mind at that time, in order to 
get her the heck out of the house, I signed 
the paper.” Soon after checking with her 
doctors and finding they didn’t accept the 
plan, Elinor wrote canceling the enroll-
ment (as the agent had told her she could) 
and thought that was that. But the first 
time Elinor tried to fill a prescription, using 
her old stand-alone Part D plan card, the 
pharmacist told her she wasn’t covered 
by it any more — she was in an HMO. It 
took six months of constant calls before 
Elinor was finally able to disenroll from the 
HMO and return to her original coverage 
from traditional Medicare, the Part D plan, 
and Medigap insurance. “I should never 
have had to go through this nightmare, 
all because of that insensitive, fraudulent 
agent,” she said. “Normally, I never sign 
things. But I got caught at a bad time when 
I was vulnerable, and she used it.”
  Eva and her husband, who live in North 
Carolina, had a Medigap supplementary 
policy that was becoming increasingly 
expensive. It had reached almost $300 
a month for both of them by the time she 
got a call from someone asking about 
supplementary insurance. So she agreed 
for a salesman to come to their home to 
talk about it. “This man came and said he

Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Resisting Hard-Sell Marketing Tactics
The hard sell is when a plan’s salesperson or an independent insurance agent 
uses aggressive or unethical tactics — such as bait-and-switch — to try to 
push you into signing up for a plan you don’t want or whose consequences 
you don’t understand.
Part D plans and Medicare health plans aren’t supposed to pressure or 
mislead you into buying one plan versus another. Medicare has rules to 
prevent such practices — though arguably not enough — and some of the 
plans themselves have voluntarily agreed to a code of conduct designed to 
stop what they call “rogue” salespeople from making hard sells. Still, hard 
sells can (and do!) happen.
You may never meet the kind of hard-sell tactics I warn about in the following 
pages. But whether you’re a Medicare beneficiary or someone looking out for 
an older relative, being alert to the possibilities and knowing how to protect 
yourself (or your loved one) against such pressures is wise.
In the next several sections, I describe types of salesmanship to be aware 
of and suggest three lines of defense for resisting marketing pressure. The 
most important of which is understanding at least the main differences 
among kinds of Medicare insurance and the consequences of changing from 
one type to another. I also share the rules on what plans can and can’t do 
when trying to make a sale — and checks you can make before signing on 
the dotted line. Finally, I explain what you can do to reverse the situation if 
you’re tricked or misled into joining a plan you don’t want or understand.
Assessing different kinds of salesmanship
 
You need to be able to distinguish among three kinds of salesmanship, ranging 
from the acceptable through the unethical to the downright illegal:
(continued)
could offer insurance for $98 a month,” 
she said. “It was the $98 that sold me, I 
guess. But never once did he say it was a 
Medicare Advantage plan.” In fact, it was 
a Private Fee-for-Service type of MA plan. 
And although the salesman told her it was 
“good anywhere,” Eva quickly found that 
none of her local doctors or hospitals would 
accept it. Getting disenrolled from the plan 
was “the worst rigmarole I’ve ever seen.” 
And she met others who’d had the same 
experience. Like them, she said, “I 
just thought I was buying a cheaper 
supplementary policy.”

 Chapter 11: Buyer Beware: Avoiding Scams and Hard-Sell Marketing
 
 Straightforward salesmanship: Agents accurately describe the plan 
they’re paid to pitch (whether a stand-alone Part D plan, Medicare 
Advantage health plan, or Medigap policy) and clearly explain how it’ll 
add to, or change, the consumer’s existing insurance. This plan may not 
be the best one for the consumer — only an impartial comparison of 
several plans can determine that, as explained in Chapters 9 and 10 — 
but the agents are doing their job fairly.
 
 Unethical bait-and-switch: The consumer is interested in a stand-
alone Part D plan or Medigap insurance. But the agent is trying to sell a 
Medicare Advantage plan without being honest about the consequences 
of making that change. The consumer may be persuaded to sign up for 
the MA plan, not understanding that it can mean losing her current 
doctors and hospitals in traditional Medicare, her existing drug plan, her 
Medigap insurance, or in some cases, her retiree health coverage.
 
 Illegal enrollment: In the worst cases — not common, but known — 
agents say or do anything to get a signature, usually for enrollment in a 
Medicare Advantage plan. This sales approach includes the following:
 
• Saying consumers will lose Medicare or Medicaid benefits if they 
don’t sign or saying that Medicare’s ending
 
• Entering nursing home rooms uninvited
 
• Signing up very frail or mentally ill people who can’t properly make 
a decision
 
• Telling people their signatures are needed only to confirm that 
they’ve met with the agent
 
• Forging signatures on the enrollment form
 
 All of these tactics are exploitative and prohibited by law. Selling Medigap 
insurance to anyone already enrolled in an MA plan is also illegal.
How can such scenarios happen? After these sorts of tactics first became 
publicly known in 2007, Medicare announced a crackdown on abuses and set 
tougher rules for the hiring and training of sales agents. In 2008 Congress pro-
hibited certain practices. Perhaps these regulations (described later in this 
chapter) are now curbing the most disgraceful kinds of exploitation. But one 
underlying problem hasn’t changed, at least at the time I’m writing this book.
Plans are still allowed to pay agents higher commissions for selling Medicare 
Advantage plans than stand-alone drug plans. For example, agents may be 
paid $40 to $80 for each stand-alone Part D plan they sell, but up to $500 for 
each Medicare Advantage plan. (That’s because MA plans are far more 
profitable for the insurers.) So it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that 
the system encourages abuse. Unless Medicare requires individual insurers 
to offer the same commission for every type of plan they sell, it’s difficult to 
see how hard-sell tactics can be outlawed completely. Unscrupulous agents 
will always be attracted by bigger bucks.

190
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Understanding the various types 
of Medicare insurance
How is it possible for sales agents to persuade people to sign up for Medicare 
Advantage plans they don’t want? Are these folks dumb, or what? Absolutely 
not! Sometimes their signing can be the result of bullying tactics that take 
advantage of a senior’s vulnerability, as in some of the experiences described 
in the nearby sidebar “Stories from the front lines.” But often it happens 
because people simply aren’t armed with their first line of defense: They 
don’t understand the differences among varying types of Medicare insurance. 
And who can blame them?
Just think how many types are out there, all with Medicare in their names. 
Traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage. Medicare Medical Savings 
Accounts. Medicare (Medigap) supplementary insurance. Medicare drug 
coverage. And those types are just the broad divisions. You can’t even rely 
on the names of the insurers to tell them apart. Many large insurers sell 
Medicare Advantage plans, Medigap policies, and stand-alone Part D plans.
Now’s a good time to take another look at Table 1-1 in Chapter 1, where you 
can see at a glance the broad differences between each type of Medicare 
insurance. I explain in more detail how the different types of Medicare 
Advantage plans vary from each other, and from traditional Medicare, in 
Chapter 9.
Here, I focus on what you need to know to avoid being misled by a sales 
agent. I emphasize misled because there’s nothing wrong with choosing a 
Medicare Advantage plan when you know what you’re buying. Millions of 
people enrolled in them are satisfied with their coverage. But if you’re in 
traditional Medicare now and someone actively tries to enroll you in an MA 
plan, be aware of the following consequences of switching:
 
 You’ll receive your Medicare benefits through the MA plan — not 
through traditional Medicare — and must accept the plan’s conditions.
 
 You may not be able to go to the same doctors and hospitals that treat 
you now in the traditional Medicare program.
 
 If you enroll in a Medicare HMO or Special Needs Plan that restricts your 
choice of doctors and hospitals to those in its network, and you go 
outside of that network, you’ll be responsible for the full cost of the 
treatment — except in an emergency. (In an emergency, the plan must 
cover your treatment anywhere.)
 
 If you enroll in a Private Fee-for-Service plan and are treated by a doctor 
or hospital that doesn’t accept the plan’s terms and conditions, you’ll be 
responsible for the full cost of the treatment — except in an emergency. 
Also, a provider can decide whether or not to accept the plan’s coverage 
on each visit a patient makes.

191
 Chapter 11: Buyer Beware: Avoiding Scams and Hard-Sell Marketing
 
 If you enroll in a Medicare Medical Savings Account Plan (MSA), be aware 
that after you use up the money deposited into your account, you’ll be 
responsible for the full cost of any medical services until you meet your 
deductible. One or two days in the hospital can completely gobble up the 
typical deposit amount. (The structure of an MSA is similar to a Part D 
plan in that they both have a gap in coverage in the middle. In a drug plan, 
it’s the doughnut hole; in an MSA, it’s the deductible.)
 
 If you have standard Medigap supplementary insurance, you can’t use 
it to cover your out-of-pocket expenses in an MA plan. Medigap policies 
can be used only with traditional Medicare.
 
 If you’re enrolled in a stand-alone Part D plan, this coverage is 
automatically canceled as soon as you’re enrolled in an MA plan — even 
if the MA plan doesn’t provide drug coverage.
 
 If you have retiree health insurance from an employer or union, you may 
lose this coverage by being enrolled in an MA plan. (For more about this 
possibility, see Chapter 6.)
In addition, here are a couple of tidbits to be aware of when listening to 
pitches for Medigap supplementary policies or stand-alone Part D plans:
 
 Medigap policies typically cover out-of-pocket expenses in traditional 
Medicare no matter which hospital or doctor you choose, anywhere 
in the country. Medigap SELECT policies are the exception. They have 
lower premiums but require you to use specific hospitals, clinics, and 
doctors within a geographical area (except in an emergency) in order to 
receive the insurance benefits.
 
 Individual insurers typically offer two or three different stand-alone Part D 
plans. The one with the highest premium is usually an enhanced plan with 
extra benefits (for example, some coverage in the doughnut hole, also 
known as the coverage gap; see Chapter 15 for an introduction). If you 
don’t need these extras, the higher premium may not be worthwhile. 
The only way to decide — and avoid undue pressure to buy the most 
expensive plan — is to compare plans properly according to the drugs 
you take, as explained in Chapter 10, instead of relying on a sales pitch.
Getting familiar with Medicare 
marketing rules
Knowing the can’s and can’ts of what plan sponsors or their sales agents 
are allowed to do when selling their products is your second line of defense 
in spotting whether a sales pitch is out of line and should be mistrusted. 
Medicare has had most of the following regulations in place for several years, 
but some are tougher rules put into effect after the marketing abuse scandal 
erupted. All refer to both Medicare Advantage health plans and stand-alone 
Part D plans, unless otherwise stated.

192
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Medicare allows plan sponsors to
 
 Send promotional materials to you through the mail — but not 
enrollment forms.
 
 Send sales reps to your home — but only with your prior permission 
and only to discuss the single type of coverage (for example, stand-alone 
drug plan, Medicare Advantage plan, or Medigap insurance) that you 
specify when making the appointment.
 
 Give sales presentations in public places like shopping malls or hotels.
 
Medicare doesn’t allow plan sponsors to
 
 Send salespeople to your home uninvited.
 
 Telephone you directly to make a sales pitch — unless you invited the 
call or already have a relationship with the plan.
 
 Tell you that a home visit is required for the purpose of explaining 
details of the plan or for you to enroll in it.
 
 Ask for personal information on the phone, including your address, 
prescription meds, Social Security number, credit card or bank account 
numbers, or any other financial information.
 
 Enroll you in a plan on the phone — unless you call the plan.
 
 Give sales presentations or distribute enrollment forms in doctors’ 
offices, hospitals, pharmacies, long-term care facilities, or anywhere 
patients go to receive healthcare-related services (except in common 
areas such as public lounges at such facilities).
 
 Give sales presentations at educational events such as health 
information fairs and community meetings.
 
 Offer free gifts, cash, meals, or other giveaways to encourage you to 
enroll in a plan
Medicare requires plan sponsors to
 
 Explain clearly in their marketing materials and verbal sales pitches that 
not all doctors and hospitals accept their Medicare Advantage plans.
 
 Ensure that any independent sales agents they hire are licensed by the 
state in which they work.
 
 Guarantee that sales agents are paid the same commission for each MA 
plan the sponsor sells in any given year. Also, that agents are paid the 
same commission for each stand-alone Part D plan the sponsor sells. 
(But a sponsor can pay commissions for MA plans that are different 
from stand-alone drug plans.)

193
 Chapter 11: Buyer Beware: Avoiding Scams and Hard-Sell Marketing
 
 Train sales reps, independent insurance agents, and brokers who sell 
their products, and hire only those candidates who score at least 80 
percent on a written test of their knowledge of the Medicare program, its 
rules, and the details of the plan(s) they’ll sell.
 
 Ensure that sales agents who meet with consumers to discuss a 
particular type of plan (such as Medigap insurance) can’t also, at the 
same meeting, discuss other types of plans (such as MA health plans or 
stand-alone Part D plans) but must instead schedule a separate 
appointment, at least 48 hours after the first, to discuss another.
 
 Call consumers who sign up for any MA plan to check that they 
understand its conditions and consequences, and allow them the 
opportunity to withdraw from the enrollment if they want to.
Thinking and checking before you sign
Taking the time to think and verify information is most certainly your third 
line of defense against signing up for the wrong plan. Never let anyone rush 
you into enrolling in a plan. If a sales agent tries to push you into signing on 
the dotted line before leaving (or before you leave a sales presentation) — 
well, that’s a red flag right there. If the agent asks for your signature just to 
confirm that he has met with you, that red flag’s on fire. A legitimate agent 
doesn’t ask. A legitimate agent respects your desire to think it over.
Ask for the agent’s name and contact information. Then take your time, 
preferably several days, to consider the plan carefully. You can also use this 
time to do some checking so you can make an informed decision:
 
 Read any sales material carefully, especially the fine print.
 
 Check that the plan is the kind you want — a Medicare Advantage 
health plan, a stand-alone Part D plan, or Medigap insurance. If it’s a 
Medicare Advantage health plan, check what type. (I explain each type 
of Medicare health plan in Chapter 9.) The sales material should say 
clearly what kind of plan it is. (Starting in 2010, the type of plan must be 
incorporated in each plan name.) You can also
 
• Look up its name and ID number in the back pages of your 
Medicare & You handbook.
 
• Call the Medicare help line at 800-633-4227.
 
• Go online to www.medicare.gov and click “Learn More About 
Plans in Your Area.”
 
 If you’re considering a Medicare HMO, PPO, or Special Needs plan, but 
want to continue going to your preferred doctors and hospitals, verify 
that the plan covers them. You can call the plan and ask for its provider 
directory, or you can look at the directory on the plan’s Web site. You 
can also ask your doctors and hospitals whether they accept the plan.

194
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
 If you’re considering a Private Fee-for-Service plan, check with your 
local doctors and hospitals to find out whether they accept the plan. 
(PFFS plans currently aren’t required to have a provider network. 
Starting in 2011, they must have written contracts with providers so 
that consumers will then be able to find out more easily which provid-
ers accept specific PFFS plans.)
 
 If you’re considering any kind of Medicare health plan, and want 
prescription drug coverage as well, confirm that it covers drugs. Many 
MA plans don’t.
Knowing what to do if you’re misled into 
joining a plan you don’t want
 
Medicare has some consumer protections for people who believe they were 
tricked or misled into enrolling in a Medicare Advantage health plan they 
don’t want, or joined without understanding the consequences. Here’s what 
you can do:
 
 Call the Medicare helpline at 800-633-4227 (TDD: 877-486-2048), explain the 
circumstances, and say you want a special enrollment period to disenroll 
from the plan and either switch to another MA plan or be reinstated in 
traditional Medicare. Your case will probably be investigated.
 
 If you have medical bills that the plan refuses to pay — for example, 
if you were treated by doctors and/or a hospital outside of the plan’s 
provider network when you thought you were still covered by 
traditional Medicare — call the Medicare help line and ask to be 
reenrolled into traditional Medicare retroactively — that is, dating back 
to the time you joined the plan. Medicare will then pay any outstanding 
bills at its usual rate, and you’ll pay the usual share of the cost.
 
 If calling the Medicare help line doesn’t bring results, call again and ask 
to be put in touch with a caseworker at your regional Medicare office. Or 
ask the help line for the phone number of the regional office that serves 
your state. Then call that office to explain what happened.
In certain situations, you have the right to disenroll from your present MA 
plan and either join another one or switch to traditional Medicare, even if 
you can’t show that you were misled by a plan. I explain these circumstances 
in Chapters 9 and 17.
You can also get in touch with your State Health Insurance Assistance 
Program (SHIP — check out Appendix B for contact info) for help if you need 
to. And you can report sales agents who use unethical tactics to the offices of 
your state’s insurance commissioner or attorney general (these phone 
numbers are in the state pages of your telephone directory).

P
hew! The hard part’s over. You’ve chosen a Part D plan — either a

coverage. In contrast, signing up for that plan’s usually a cakewalk.
In this chapter, I assume you’re joining Medicare Part D for the first time. 
Even so, people may be plunging into the Part D pool from a number of 
points, so I consider these different circumstances in explaining when to 
enroll in a plan. Then I suggest some last-minute checks you can — and 
should — make before signing up. After that (at last!), I show you how to 
enroll and give you some tips on the process. Finally, I explain how an 
enrollment application may occasionally be delayed or denied.
Stay Informed: Knowing 
the Right Time to Enroll
The right time to enroll in Part D is when you can sign up without incurring a 
late penalty — extra payments that add to your premiums for as long as you 
stay in the program. In Table 12-1, the white area shows when you can enroll 
in Part D for the first time to avoid a late penalty. The shaded area shows 
when you can sign up if you delay and miss these deadlines, or deliberately 
drop your current drug coverage — in which case you should probably 
prepare to face a late penalty.

In the following sections, I describe the three kinds of enrollment periods in 
Table 12-1 in more detail and explain why you shouldn’t wait until the last 
minute to enroll in a Part D plan. For the full scoop on how you can avoid the 
late penalty, head to Chapter 8.
Distinguishing among different 
enrollment periods
Medicare permits three types of enrollment periods:
 
 Initial enrollment period (IEP): Medicare assigns you a seven-month IEP 
around the time of your 65th birthday or, if you’re younger and have a 
disability, around the time you receive your 25th Supplemental Security 
Income (SSI) check. You can use this time frame to sign up for Medicare 
Parts A and B, according to your circumstances, as explained in Chapter 
1. You can also sign up at this time for a Part D plan if you don’t have 
creditable drug coverage. Basically, this term means drug coverage from 
elsewhere (like an employer or union) that’s considered at least as good 
as Part D. (Still baffled? Take a look at Chapter 6, which covers creditable 
drug coverage in detail.) If you lived abroad or were in prison at the time 
of your 65th birthday, you get a special IEP, also lasting seven months, 
to sign up for Part D upon your return to the U.S. or upon your release, 
as explained in Chapter 8.
 
 Special enrollment period (SEP): Medicare allows you an SEP to join 
Part D in certain circumstances — if you lose creditable drug coverage 
through no fault of your own or have an unavoidable break in coverage. 
You get an SEP if your employer terminates your drug benefits or 
reduces coverage so it’s no longer creditable. You also receive an SEP if 
you turned 65 before moving abroad or going to prison and want Part D 
coverage after your return or release.
 
 If you’re eligible for an SEP, all you have to do is sign up with your 
chosen Part D plan and make sure that your coverage starts within the 
allotted time. You don’t have to apply for an SEP in any of the 
circumstances shown in Table 12-1.

198
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
 Annual enrollment period (AEP): If you don’t have creditable coverage 
and fail to sign up for a Part D plan before your IEP or SEP expires, you 
can’t sign up for a plan until the next AEP that starts November 15 and 
ends December 31. As a result, you’ll be without drug coverage until 
January 1 and will face a late penalty. Also, if you deliberately dropped 
creditable drug coverage (instead of losing it involuntarily), you can sign 
up for Part D only during an AEP.
 
If you qualify for low-cost drug coverage under Part D’s Extra Help program 
(see Chapter 5), you can enroll in a Part D plan any time you want during the 
year. Your coverage starts on the first day of the month after you enroll. You 
won’t incur a late penalty, even if you sign up late.
Recognizing why you shouldn’t 
sign up at the last minute
Your Medicare prescription drug coverage begins on the first day of the 
month after you enroll in a plan. Technically, you can sign up on the very last 
day of an initial or annual enrollment period (for example, December 31) and 
still be covered the next day (in this case, January 1).
 
But — and this is an alert for the chronic procrastinators — putting off 
enrolling until the last minute isn’t the best idea. In fact, Medicare 
recommends signing up at least two weeks before your deadline. Here’s why:
 
 The plan needs time to verify the information you provide on the 
enrollment form (such as your eligibility to receive drug coverage) or to 
get back to you if the information is incomplete (see the later section “If 
your enrollment is delayed” for more).
 
 You want to be able to mosey over to the pharmacy and pick up your 
meds without hassle after your Medicare drug coverage begins. Giving 
your Part D plan enough time to upload your data into the computer 
system increases the odds of this process going smoothly. (Flip to 
Chapter 14 for the basics on filling your prescriptions.)
 
 If you have a special enrollment period, you must receive Part D 
coverage before the 63 days are up to avoid a late penalty. If you wait 
longer than 60 days to enroll, you can incur a penalty, depending on 
where your SEP falls in the calendar, as explained in more detail in 
Chapter 8.
 
 Here is a different reason for signing up as early as you can: If you have a 
seven-month IEP and enroll in a Part D plan during the first three months 
of that period, your coverage starts on the first day of the month in 
which you turn 65 or in which you become eligible through disability — 
even if those dates fall at the end of the month.

 Chapter 12: Signing Up for a Part D Plan for the First Time
Play It Safe: Making a Few Final 
Checks before You Sign Up
 
Yes, I know — you’ve had enough of all this rigmarole by now and just want to 
join the darned plan! I sympathize. But remember that after you’re enrolled, 
you’ll probably be locked into the plan for the whole year. So I don’t feel 
comfortable saying, “Okay, go ahead,” without suggesting a few practical, final 
precautions. Following them is entirely up to you, of course, but playing it safe 
never hurts, and sometimes it pays off big-time.
 
 Make sure you live in the plan’s service area. If you live outside this 
area, your enrollment won’t be accepted.
 
 Keep the plan details as a record of why you chose the plan. If you 
chose it from the online Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder, print 
out all the details that show your likely costs and keep them safe. If you 
called the Medicare help line for the same information, keep the printout 
the customer rep sent you. You need this record if, after enrollment, 
you believe the plan’s charging more for your drugs than it quoted on 
the plan finder and you want to change to another plan as a result, as 
explained in Chapter 17.
 
 Double-check the details of your costs under the plan. Make sure 
the drug information you entered into the plan finder is correct, as I 
describe in Chapter 10. If the details you entered — especially each 
drug’s dosage and how often you take it — aren’t accurate, the quoted 
costs aren’t going to be accurate either. Verify your likely costs by 
looking at your printout and/or calling the plan.
 
 Make sure that this plan is the one you want and that you understand 
its conditions. This check is especially important if you chose this plan 
on the advice of a salesperson or insurance agent, or from marketing 
materials sent through the mail. If you’re not sure this plan is “the one,” 
call it — not the salesperson — to confirm you understand exactly what 
you’re buying. When people are misled into joining an inappropriate 
plan, it’s often because they didn’t fully understand the plan’s 
conditions and consequences, as explained in Chapter 11.
 
 If the plan is a Medicare HMO or PPO, make sure it includes drug 
coverage. If you join an HMO or PPO that doesn’t cover drugs, you won’t 
be able to get drug coverage any other way for the rest of the year, as I 
describe in Chapter 9.
 
 If the plan is a Private Fee-for-Service plan or a Medicare Cost plan, 
confirm that it includes drug coverage. If it doesn’t, and you want drug 
coverage, you should choose and enroll in a stand-alone Part D plan 
before your enrollment period expires. The same is true of Medicare 
Medical Savings Account plans, which don’t cover drugs.

200
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
 
If you chose your plan through a search of Medicare’s online plan finder, 
you won’t have to verify whether the plan is in your service area or includes 
drug coverage. Because you must enter your zip code at the beginning of this 
search, all the plans that appear on-screen are available in your area, and all 
of them cover prescription drugs. Otherwise, you can call Medicare at 800-633-
4227 to check these details.
Take the Plunge: Enrolling in a Plan
Actually enrolling in a plan is the easy bit. You still have choices on how 
to do it, but they’re simple ones. The process is the same whether you’re 
enrolling in a stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP) or a Medicare health 
plan that includes drug coverage (MAPD). All you need are your Medicare ID 
number and the name of the plan you want to join. Then you can sign up, or a 
legal representative can do so on your behalf, in any of the following ways:
 
 Calling Medicare’s help line toll-free at 800-633-4227: Tell the customer 
representative you want to enroll in a Part D plan. Have at hand your 
Medicare ID number and the name of the plan.
 
 Visiting Medicare’s Web site at www.medicare.gov: On the home 
page, look for a menu headed Prescription Drug Plans in the top 
right-hand corner and click “Enroll.” Doing so takes you to the 
Medicare Part D enrollment center. Most plans allow enrollment 
through the center, but a few may not. If your chosen plan doesn’t, 
the customer representative at the center can give you that plan’s 
phone number.
 
 Calling the plan directly: You can find the plan’s customer service 
number in its marketing materials, on its Web site, or on the top right of 
its plan details page (if you chose the plan on Medicare’s plan finder or 
asked Medicare to mail you details of the plan).
 
 Visiting the plan’s Web site: If the plan offers online enrollment (not all 
do), you can find its Web site address in its marketing materials and on 
the top right of its plan details page on Medicare’s online plan finder. Or 
you can do an Internet search for the plan’s name.
 
 Completing a paper application: Call the plan and ask it to send you 
an application. Fill out this paperwork, sign it, then mail or fax it to the 
address or number provided.
And that’s it! Well, almost. Whichever way you choose to sign up, you’ll be 
asked a number of questions you must answer before your enrollment can be 
completed. Be prepared by having this info ready:
 
 Your name, address, and phone number
 
 Details of your Medicare coverage, as shown on your Medicare ID card

201
 Chapter 12: Signing Up for a Part D Plan for the First Time
 
 Details of any other drug coverage you may have
 
 Circumstances indicating that you may qualify for Extra Help
 
 How you want to pay your premiums
 
 If you live in a long-term care facility, such as a nursing home
 
A Part D plan can’t ask you for your bank account or credit card information 
during the enrollment process, regardless of whether you enroll on a paper 
form, by phone, or online.
 
Enrollment is a legal contract between you and the plan. So if you can’t 
manage the enrollment process yourself, either through incapacity or illiteracy, 
the person who enrolls you must be someone who has the authority to do 
so under your state law. This person can be a legal representative, a court-
appointed guardian, or a family member or caregiver who has durable power 
of attorney — that is, someone authorized to make medical decisions on your 
behalf. When making the enrollment request — whether on paper, online, or 
on the phone — your representative must attest that she has the appropriate 
legal authority and can show documentary proof if the plan requests it. She 
must also provide her contact information.
In the following sections, I tackle in detail three important issues that may 
arise during the enrollment process.
Grasping the importance of your address
No, your Medicare prescription drug plan doesn’t care a scrap whether you 
live in a mansion or a minivan. But the address you provide determines
 
 If you live in the plan’s service area: No plan will accept your enrollment if 
you don’t live in its service area. For stand-alone drug plans, that means 
living in the state the plan serves. For Medicare health plans, this area is 
defined as the region (a state, county, or zip code) that the plan serves. 
Even for plans that don’t have defined service areas, you must sign up 
for the one that’s offered in the area where you live.
 
 Where your permanent residence is: You can’t be enrolled in two plans 
at the same time, so if you live in different states during the year, you 
can’t have one plan per address. When enrolling in a plan, you must give 
the address of your permanent or primary residence — the place 
considered to be your normal home (for example, the one used on tax 
forms). If you provide a post office (PO) box number as your address, 
the plan must contact you to confirm that you live in its service area.
 
If you’re homeless or don’t have a fixed address, the Part D plan you want may 
accept the address of a shelter or clinic, a PO box number, or anywhere else 
that you receive mail.

202
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
Deciding how to pay the premiums
When enrolling, you’ll be asked how you want to pay your monthly premiums 
to the plan. Here are your options:
 
 Ask the plan to bill you directly and pay the premiums every month by 
check, money order, or credit card.
 
 Have the premiums deducted automatically from your monthly Social 
Security checks. (The plan arranges this deduction for you.)
 
 Agree for the premiums to be automatically sent to the plan each month 
by Electronic Funds Transfer from your bank, or charged to your credit 
card. (The plan will ask you to fill out and return a form, along with a 
voided check from your bank account or your credit card details.)
 
Many people choose to have their plan premiums taken out of their Social 
Security checks, in the same way that Medicare Part B premiums are 
deducted. But this payment method can cause difficulties. There have been 
many instances of Social Security failing to make plan premium deductions for 
the first two or three months, and then taking them all out of a single check. 
Or, in the case of people who’ve switched from one plan to another, deducting 
two premiums rather than one for several months. Similar errors can occur in 
automatic payments from a bank account or credit card.
Disclosing other drug coverage you have
During the enrollment process, you’ll be asked whether you have any other 
drug coverage — for example, coverage from an employer or union, veterans or 
military benefits, private individual insurance, or a State Pharmacy Assistance 
Program (SPAP). The Part D plan needs this info for two main reasons:
 
 To protect you: In some cases, joining a Part D plan can automatically 
cancel your other medical and drug coverage, as explained in Chapter 6. 
If you have creditable drug coverage from elsewhere, the plan may 
contact you to confirm that you understand the consequences of joining 
Part D. You’ll have 30 days to respond. If you don’t respond within this 
time frame, your enrollment will be denied, as I explain later in this 
chapter.
 
 To coordinate your benefits properly: Listing any other benefits you’re 
entitled to means that the plan can log them into its computer system so 
that when you go to fill your prescriptions, the pharmacist knows what 
to charge you and whom to bill. Otherwise, you may pay more than you 
should. I explain more about how this coordination of benefits works 
(and how it sometimes doesn’t) in Chapter 14.

203
 Chapter 12: Signing Up for a Part D Plan for the First Time
Don’t Give Up: Understanding Why Your 
Enrollment May Be Delayed or Denied
Your enrollment isn’t complete until your chosen plan accepts it. Within ten 
calendar days of receiving your enrollment request, the plan must send you 
one of these items:
 
 A notice acknowledging your completed application, together with a 
copy of it, and details about the plan’s costs, benefits, and conditions
 
 A request asking for more information to complete the application
 
 A notice saying your application has been denied
If you receive only the acknowledgment, your enrollment probably will be 
confirmed very soon, and you’ll receive your membership card and Evidence 
of Coverage, as explained in Chapter 13. Read the following sections if your 
plan sends you either a request for more information or a denial notice.
If your enrollment is delayed
 
Enrollment can be delayed if
 
 You haven’t completed all the information required on the enrollment 
form, and the plan needs to get back to you
 
 You don’t submit additional information as soon as you’re asked
 
 Medicare doesn’t immediately confirm that you’re eligible
 
 The plan discovers you have coverage from elsewhere (such as 
employer or union health benefits) and contacts you to be sure you 
understand the consequences of joining the plan
 
In all of these cases, the plan will contact you either by mail or phone. So it’s 
important to look out for a letter from your plan, or to return messages it 
has left on your answering machine. If you’re asked for more information and 
don’t provide it within 30 days, the plan has no choice but to consider your 
application incomplete and reject it.
What if your enrollment’s delayed past the date when your coverage should 
begin? In this situation, the plan covers you until the matter is resolved. 
(During this time, you can use a copy of your enrollment form or the plan’s 
acknowledgment as proof of coverage at the pharmacy until your plan 
membership card arrives, as explained in Chapter 13.) But if your enrollment 
is ultimately denied for any of the reasons in the next section, you’d have to 
repay the plan for any services used.

204
Part III: Choosing and Enrolling in the Right Part D Plan for You 
If your enrollment is denied
If you’re in Medicare, you have an absolute right to Part D coverage. So if a 
plan turns you down, you need to know why. Here are the possibilities:
 
 Your eligibility for Medicare can’t be found in the official records.
 
 You didn’t answer all the questions on your enrollment application, 
didn’t complete it within the required time, or failed to respond to the 
plan’s request for additional information.
 
 You don’t live within the plan’s service area.
 
 Your enrollment period has expired.
 
 You applied outside the time frames for initial or annual enrollment, and 
you don’t qualify for a special enrollment period.
 
 You have creditable drug coverage from an employer or union, and you 
didn’t respond within 30 days to the plan’s request for confirmation that 
you understand how joining Part D can affect this coverage.
 
 You’ve applied to a Medicare Advantage plan but don’t have Medicare 
Part A and Part B. (Both are required for MA plans. To join a stand-alone 
Part D plan, you need only one or the other. To join a Medicare Cost 
plan, you need only Part B.)
 
 You’ve applied to a Medicare Advantage plan but already have end-stage 
renal disease. (ESRD patients can’t join an MA plan.)
 
 You’ve applied to a Medicare Advantage plan that isn’t currently 
accepting new enrollees.
 
 You’ve applied to a Special Needs Plan but don’t fall within the category 
of people it serves, as explained in Chapter 9.
 
 You’ve applied for a Medicare Medical Savings Account plan but don’t 
meet its eligibility requirements, as explained in Chapter 9.
 
If your enrollment’s denied, the Part D plan or Medicare must send you a letter 
explaining why. You don’t have the right to appeal against an enrollment denial. 
But if you think the given reasons are incorrect, call the number on your denial 
notice as soon as possible. Provide information showing why you think the 
denial is incorrect. If that doesn’t work, contact your regional Medicare office to 
explain the problem. (For the office number, call Medicare at 800-633-4227.) You 
can also get expert advice and help from your State Health Insurance Assistance 
Program (SHIP) or the Medicare Rights Center; see Appendix B for contact info.

Part IV
You’re In! 
Navigating Part D 
from the Inside

In this part . . .
N
ow that you’re in a Part D plan, I help you deal with 
many situations that can arise. For those of you 
who’ve joined a plan for the first time, I begin by explain-
ing what happens immediately after enrolling. Then I con-
sider in detail many aspects of receiving Medicare drug 
coverage — things you need to know about filling your 
prescriptions, falling into or avoiding the coverage gap 
(the infamous “doughnut hole”), lowering your drug costs, 
switching from one Part D plan to another or being 
dropped from a plan, using your Part D coverage in a long-
term care facility, filing complaints against your plan, and 
appealing against decisions your plan makes that you 
don’t agree with.
Whether you’re new to Part D or already a veteran of the 
program, you’ll find a lot of useful information and tips 
here to help you. This part is your go-to reference section 
for navigating Part D from the inside in all sorts of 
circumstances.

Y
ou’re in. Medicare has confirmed your enrollment, and you’re going to 
get drug coverage under Part D. Whether that makes you feel elated, 
relieved, or wary, you’ve overcome the hurdle of making several important, 
and perhaps difficult, decisions. Congratulate yourself!
So what happens next? This chapter explains what to expect from your drug 
plan the first time out. I begin with the question of when your drug coverage 
actually starts, according to your circumstances. Then I describe what you’ll 
receive from your plan — namely, your membership card and a lot of 
important documents to read. I also explain what to do if you’re told you 
need to pay a late penalty. Finally, I clue you in on why keeping good records 
pays off in tracking your coverage and expenses, and in protecting yourself 
in case of disputes. Even if this isn’t your first time in a Medicare prescription 
drug plan, you may find some of this information helpful.
Knowing When Your Coverage Will Start
Can’t wait to get that drug coverage? It’s what you’ve signed up for, after 
all. You won’t have to wait long — less than one month in most cases. But 
your coverage doesn’t start until the date it becomes effective, meaning the 
very first day you can fill a prescription under your Part D plan, even if you 
receive your membership card in the mail before then.

208
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
When you’re joining a Part D plan for the first time, the date your coverage 
begins depends on the following circumstances:
 
 You’re just coming into the Medicare program because you’re turning 65 
or qualifying through disability.
 
 You’re just coming into the Medicare program after a delay due to 
turning 65 while living abroad or in prison
 
 You’ve received a special enrollment period because you lost your 
creditable drug coverage from an employer or some other plan, or 
because you recently came out of prison or have returned to the U.S. 
after a period living abroad.
 
 You failed to join Part D when you were first eligible and now need to 
enroll in a drug plan during the annual enrollment period at the end of 
the year.
 
 You qualify for Part D’s Extra Help because your income is limited.
Table 13-1 shows when your coverage begins in all of these situations.
Table 13-1 
When Your Drug Coverage Starts
Your Situation
When Your Coverage Begins
If you sign up for a plan during your 
initial Medicare enrollment period 
upon turning 65
On the first day of the month in which 
you turn 65, if you enrolled in the plan 
during the previous three months. Or on 
the first day of the month after enroll-
ment if you signed up in the month of 
your birthday, or during the following 
three months.
If you sign up for a plan because of 
disability during your initial Medicare 
enrollment period
On the first day of the month in which 
you receive your 25th disability pay-
ment, if you enrolled in the plan during 
the previous three months. Or on the 
first day of the month after enrollment 
if you signed up in the month you 
received your 25th check, or during the 
following three months.
If you sign up for a plan during a spe-
cial initial enrollment period due to 
turning 65 while abroad or in prison
Immediately after your return to the 
U.S. or your release from prison, if you 
enrolled in the plan during the previous 
three months. Or on the first day of the 
month after enrollment if you signed up 
in the month of your return or release, 
or during the following three months.

209
 Chapter 13: You’ve Just Signed Up — What Happens Now?
Your Situation
When Your Coverage Begins
If you sign up for a plan during a 
special enrollment period
The first day of the month after you 
enrolled in the plan.
If you sign up for a plan during annual 
enrollment from Nov. 15 to Dec. 31
January 1.
If you qualify for Extra Help under Part 
D
The first day of the month after you 
enrolled in the plan. You can sign up for 
or change Part D plans in any month of 
the year when you receive Extra Help.
As you can see in Table 13-1, the longest you can wait to start coverage after 
enrollment is six weeks. And that’s only in one particular situation: if you 
delay joining Part D beyond when you were first eligible and need to wait for 
open enrollment at the end of the year. If you sign up on the first day of that 
period, November 15, your coverage starts six weeks later on January 1.
The shortest wait can be as little as one day. If you enroll in a plan on the last 
day of a month, your coverage becomes effective the first day of the following 
month — in other words, the next day. (However, I don’t advise cutting it 
that fine. Loading your coverage info into Medicare’s computer system takes 
a while, so enrolling at the last minute can cause delays when filling your first 
prescriptions, as explained in Chapter 14.)
Of course, if you’re already in Part D, your current coverage lasts until the 
end of the calendar year — midnight on December 31. If you decide to switch 
plans and sign up for another during open enrollment (November 15 through 
December 31), coverage in your new plan starts January 1. (See Chapter 17 
for details about switching plans.) If you stay in the same plan, your coverage 
just rolls on through the following year.
Receiving Your Plan’s Card and Other 
Important Stuff You Need to Read
Soon after you enroll, your plan will send you a bunch of stuff through the 
mail. So watch for its arrival and get out your glasses! This is important 
information you must read — even if you’ve been in a Medicare drug or 
private health plan before. In the next several sections, I show you what to 
expect and check up on when you receive your plan’s membership card, its 
Evidence of Coverage document, and other information. I also touch on the 
form you should send back to the plan showing what other types of coverage 
you may have for prescription drugs or medical care. And I explain what to 
do if you’re told you need to pay a late penalty on your Medicare prescription 
drug coverage.

210
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
You receive a membership card and information about coverage regardless 
of whether you’re joining Part D for the first time, have just switched from 
one drug plan to another, or are remaining in the same plan you had last year. 
In this last situation, even though you don’t need to re-enroll, you still get a 
new card and Evidence of Coverage (EOC) document for the new year. That’s 
because some details of your coverage have likely changed since the previous 
year. (Your plan sends advance warning of any changes in its Annual Notice 
of Change [ANOC], mailed in the fall, and incorporates them in your new EOC 
document. So if you didn’t read the ANOC, be sure to read the EOC.)
The membership ID card: 
Your key to coverage
The very first mailing you receive from your new Part D plan is an 
acknowledgment of your enrollment request, which the plan must send 
you within ten calendar days of receiving it. This mailing also tells you 
when you can expect your coverage to become effective, as explained in 
the previous section. The plan sends your membership ID card either with 
this mailing or soon afterward, and you can start using it at the pharmacy 
as soon as your coverage begins.
 
If you don’t receive your card by the time your coverage starts, you can use 
what your plan calls its proof of coverage to fill your prescriptions until your 
card arrives. This proof may be a copy of your enrollment form, the plan’s 
acknowledgment of your enrollment request, or a letter from the plan stating 
that you’re entitled to coverage, starting on the effective date. (See Chapter 
14 on what to do if you encounter problems obtaining your prescriptions the 
first time out.) Note that proof of coverage isn’t the same as the Evidence of 
Coverage document, which may arrive either with your membership card or 
several weeks later.
When you receive your plan’s membership card, keep it safe. The card is 
your key to getting prescription drugs and letting your pharmacist know 
what you should pay, as I explain in Chapter 14. You need to present it at the 
pharmacy each time you fill a prescription. So keep it in your wallet. (If you 
were in a different Part D plan previously, destroy your old card — but be 
sure to do so only after your new coverage begins.)
In the following sections, I explain the details you need to check when you 
receive your card and give you pointers on how to keep track of different 
Medicare cards you may have.

211
 Chapter 13: You’ve Just Signed Up — What Happens Now?
Double-checking the details
 
Verify that the information on your card is correct. It should include
 
 The plan’s name
 
 Your name and membership ID number
 
 The plan’s customer service phone number(s)
 
 The plan’s mailing address
Make sure this plan is the one you signed up for. If you’re not certain, take a 
look at your plan’s info packet (which it must send you soon after it receives 
your enrollment request, ideally before your coverage begins). You can 
also check the plan’s name and identification number that appears on your 
membership card against information in your Medicare & You handbook or 
on Medicare’s online plan finder tool. Or you can call Medicare’s help line to 
check what kind of plan it is. If it turns out you’re enrolled in the wrong plan — 
for example, this plan’s a private Medicare health plan rather than the drugs-
only plan you wanted — flip to Chapter 17 to find out what to do.
Playing your cards right
You may find yourself with several cards entitling you to different Medicare 
services. And sometimes it isn’t easy to see at a glance which card is which, 
or to remember what each is used for. It can be especially confusing if, for 
example, you have a prescription plan and a Medigap policy that are 
provided by the same insurance company, and its name appears on both 
cards.
 
Presenting the correct card when you show up at a doctor’s office or hospital, 
or use any other medical service, is critically important. That’s because the 
card tells your provider whom to bill. For example, if you’re in a Medicare 
private health plan, you must show the plan’s card and not your Medicare ID 
card. If by mistake you show your Medicare card instead, the provider will bill 
Medicare and not the plan. Medicare will then deny your claim, and you or 
the provider will have a lot of hassle sorting it all out. So it pays to know your 
cards and use them appropriately.
Here’s how to identify and use each of the Medicare cards you may have:
 
 Your red-white-and-blue Medicare ID card: Use this card to obtain 
medical services if you receive your health benefits through traditional 
Medicare. The card shows your name and Medicare ID number. It says 
whether you’re entitled to Medicare Part A, (hospital services) or Part B 
(doctor visits and other outpatient care), or both, as well as the date(s) 
on which your coverage became effective. The card also provides the 
phone number of the Medicare help line.

212
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 Your Medicare private health plan card: Use this card (not your 
Medicare ID card) to get medical services if you’re enrolled in a 
Medicare private health plan (such as an HMO, PPO, Special Needs Plan, 
Private Fee-for-Service plan, a Medicare Cost plan, or a Medicare Medical 
Savings Account; see Chapter 9 for details on these plans). If your plan 
includes drug coverage, you may be able to use the same card at the 
pharmacy when filling your prescriptions, or you may be given a 
separate card to use at the pharmacy, depending on the plan. Either 
way, the plan’s name, its identification number, and contact information 
appears on the card. So does your name and membership number.
 
 Your Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plan card: Use this card 
to get your prescriptions filled under Part D if you receive your 
medical benefits from traditional Medicare or a Medicare private health 
plan that doesn’t cover drugs (Medicare Medical Savings Accounts, as 
well as some Private Fee-for-Service plans and Medicare Cost plans). The 
card shows your name, your plan membership number, the plan’s name, 
its identification number, and its contact information. Your card likely 
has wording that indicates you’re entitled to Medicare prescription drug 
coverage. It may simply say PDP — initials that stand for Prescription 
Drug Plan, the phrase Medicare uses for stand-alone Part D plans.
 
 Your Medigap supplementary insurance card: Use this card to prove 
that you have separate insurance to help cover your co-pays for 
medical services when you’re enrolled in traditional Medicare. Show it 
every time you receive services from a doctor, hospital, or other 
provider. (Medigap insurance can’t be used to cover out-of-pocket costs 
in Medicare private health plans, as explained in Chapter 9. Nor can it 
be used for prescription drug expenses, as explained in Chapter 15.) 
The card shows your name and membership number, the name of the 
insurance company, its contact information, and the type of Medigap 
plan you have (marked with a letter of the alphabet, A through L) — for 
example, MEDIGAP F.
Information about your plan: Your new 
bedtime reading material
Sooner or later (either together with your plan’s membership ID card or 
separately) you’ll receive a sizeable information packet that should include 
the following documents about your new plan:
 
 Evidence of Coverage: This booklet is your legal contract with the plan, 
so be sure to keep it in a safe place. It contains masses of stuff you can 
use for reference when you first join the plan and throughout the year. 
Here are some examples:
 
• Phone numbers: Call if you have any questions or problems.

213
 Chapter 13: You’ve Just Signed Up — What Happens Now?
 
• An explanation of how the plan works, its conditions, and its 
rules: This part lays out the plan’s responsibilities in giving you 
coverage and the rules you must accept. It shows the plan’s costs 
and benefits for this year, which may be different from those the 
same plan provided last year.
 
• Details of the plan’s benefits and costs: If this is a drugs-only plan, 
the Evidence of Coverage explains what the plan charges for 
different kinds of covered drugs. If it’s a Medicare private health 
plan, you’ll find this info, plus details of how much you’ll pay for 
every covered medical service, like doctor visits, hospital stays, 
and many more.
 
• An explanation of your legal rights if you have a complaint 
against the plan or disagree with a decision it makes: This 
section includes detailed instructions on how to file a complaint 
or make an appeal. (I cover the general process of doing both in 
Chapter 19.)
 
 The plan’s drug formulary: The formulary is a list of all the medications 
the plan covers. It shows which drugs come with restrictions such as 
prior authorization, quantity limits, and step therapy. (I explain what 
these restrictions mean, and what you can do about them, in Chapter 4.)
 
 The plan’s pharmacy network: The pharmacy network is a list of all the 
pharmacies in your area that accept your plan’s card. This list shows 
which ones are preferred pharmacies (where your drugs may cost less) 
or specialist pharmacies (which stock special drugs, like those that are 
injected or require careful handling), as explained in Chapter 14.
 
 The plan’s provider directory: If your plan is a Medicare managed 
care plan (HMO, PPO, Special Needs Plan, or Medicare Cost plan), this 
provider directory is a list of doctors, hospitals, and other facilities in 
your area that are in the plan’s network and have agreed to treat its 
members.
 
 The plan’s service area: The service area is a list of all the zip codes 
that your plan (if it’s a Medicare managed care plan) covers.
 
Everything in your plan’s info packet is critical. If any of the items listed here 
are missing, call the plan and ask for them, according to your type of plan:
 
 If you’re in a Medicare managed care plan that covers prescription 
drugs, you need all these items. (Private Fee-for-Service plans and 
Medicare Medical Savings Accounts don’t have limited service areas or 
provider directories.)
 
 If you’re in a stand-alone plan that covers only prescription drugs, you 
just need the first three items on the preceding list.

214
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
A form for disclosing other coverage: Your 
chance to put it all out there
Your plan’s packet includes a form asking whether you have other coverage 
for prescription drugs and/or medical care. The plan may have already 
requested this information on your enrollment form, as explained in Chapter 
12, but the separate form in your info packet probably requires more details. 
Filling out this form and returning it to the plan as instructed are in your best 
interests.
 
The plan needs to know of other coverage so all of your benefits can be 
coordinated properly. This coordination of benefits means you don’t pay more 
than you should, and, in most cases, you don’t have to make separate claims, 
as explained in Chapter 14. So if you’re entitled to drug and/or medical 
coverage from any of the following, enter that on the form:
 
 A current or former employer or union (or COBRA insurance)
 
 The Veterans Affairs (VA or CHAMPVA) health program
 
 The Department of Defense (TRICARE)
 
 The Federal Employees Health Benefits program (FEHB)
 
 The Indian Health Service, a Tribal Health organization, or the Urban 
Indian Health Program
 
 A qualified State Pharmacy Assistance Program (SPAP)
 
 An individual health insurance policy
I explain each of these programs, and how they fit in with Medicare prescription 
drug coverage, in Chapter 6.
A late penalty assessment: Your price for 
missing your enrollment deadline
Not long after you enroll in Part D for the first time, you may receive a letter 
from your plan saying you need to pay a late penalty. This scenario should 
happen only if you miss your deadline for joining Part D and go for more 
than 63 days without creditable coverage — drug coverage that’s at least as 
good as Part D, such as you may have had from an employer or union. (If 
you haven’t the faintest idea what I’m talking about here, you need to read 
Chapter 6 to get familiar with creditable coverage and Chapter 8 to find out 
about the late penalty — and fast!)

215
 Chapter 13: You’ve Just Signed Up — What Happens Now?
How your plan decides whether you should be penalized
Every plan is responsible for finding out whether any new enrollees should 
have a late penalty. Plans can do so by obtaining the information from 
Medicare, making their own inquiries, or sending an attestation form to new 
enrollees. If you receive this form, you have up to 30 days to respond and 
indicate whether you’ve had creditable coverage for drugs and, if so, where 
you got it from.
 
This is the time when any notices you’ve kept about former creditable 
coverage come in very handy, as covered in Chapter 6. However, if you’ve lost 
this proof, be aware that Medicare requires your plan to accept letters from 
any former employer or union confirming the creditable coverage you once 
had. So when you return your attestation form, be sure to add the name of 
and contact info for your former employer or union and, if possible, the dates 
when your creditable coverage began and ended so your plan can verify them. 
Or, if you prefer, you can ask the benefits department of your former employer 
or union to send you a similar letter, and you can attach a copy to your 
attestation form. (But be careful not to miss that important 30-day deadline 
for returning the form. Send it in on time, even if the requested letter hasn’t 
arrived.)
If the plan decides you have an unexplained gap in your drug coverage, it 
informs Medicare, and someone there does the math to work out the amount 
of your late penalty. The plan then notifies you of this amount and tells you 
how it was calculated (according to a formula I explain in Chapter 8).
How your plan may be wrong
What if your plan slaps you with a late penalty you don’t think you deserve? 
That’s a real curve ball. But your plan may have gotten it wrong. Here are 
some of the ways mistakes can happen:
 
 Your record of coverage hasn’t been verified due to computer glitches 
or other screw-ups in the system. People have occasionally received 
these letters after being in Part D ever since it began — and therefore 
couldn’t possibly deserve a late penalty! Gotta love technology.
 
 You had drug coverage but didn’t know it wasn’t creditable because the 
plan that provided it didn’t clearly inform you of this fact.
 
 During the time in question, you were living abroad or in prison and 
therefore couldn’t sign up for Part D. Provided you started receiving 
Part D coverage within one of the special enrollment periods granted 
after your return or release, as explained in Chapter 12, you shouldn’t 
face a late penalty.
 
 You went without creditable coverage for a certain length of time, but 
not for as many months as the letter claims. The length of time without 
coverage determines the amount of your late penalty, as explained in 
Chapter 8.

216
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 You qualified for Extra Help (see Chapter 5) and joined a Part D plan 
between May 15, 2006, and December 31, 2008. The late penalty was waived 
during this period for people eligible for Extra Help and without creditable 
coverage. Congress has now made this waiver permanent, so starting on 
January 1, 2009, nobody eligible for Extra Help faces a late penalty.
 
 During the time in question, you were living in an area affected by 
Hurricane Katrina. Medicare allowed a special enrollment period 
extending from May 15 to December 31, 2006, and waived the late 
penalty for this six-month period for people living in certain parishes on 
the Gulf Coast when the hurricane hit in August 2005.
What your rights are if you think your plan is wrong
When your plan sends you a letter regarding your late penalty amount, it 
encloses a notice headed “Your Right to Ask Medicare to Review Your Part D 
Late Enrollment Penalty,” which explains your right to challenge the ruling. 
It also encloses a form you can use to request a reconsideration — in other 
words, an independent review of the decision. You have 60 days from the 
date on the letter to complete and return the form to the address provided. 
(You can authorize someone else to fill out the form on your behalf if you 
want; follow the instructions on the form.) If you choose to request a 
reconsideration, you must still pay the late penalty throughout the process 
until a decision is made.
On the form, check off any circumstances that apply to you or write other 
reasons on a separate sheet. Add copies (not the originals) of any documents 
that support your case, which may include proof of creditable coverage from 
a former employer or union, or a previous plan’s benefits summary that 
didn’t explain whether the plan’s drug coverage was creditable, for example.
 
Be sure to meet all deadlines or, if you have a good reason why you can’t, 
request an extension by following the instructions on the form. Otherwise, 
your case will be dismissed, and you’ll have no further opportunity to argue it.
You should receive a decision from the Independent Review Entity (IRE), the 
official panel that conducts the reconsideration, within 90 days of the IRE 
receiving your request. (The decision may come a lot sooner, but it depends 
on how many similar cases the IRE is dealing with.) The IRE can extend the 
reconsideration process for up to 14 days for good reason, such as to examine 
more evidence. Here’s what happens next, based on the IRE’s decision:
 
 If the decision goes in your favor: You no longer face a late penalty. 
Your plan must then refund any late penalty fees you’ve already paid 
during the reconsideration process. Or, if the penalty is reduced, the 
plan must refund any overpayments you’ve made.
 
 If the decision goes against you: You’re stuck with the late penalty 
amount. You can’t appeal against a negative decision.

217
 Chapter 13: You’ve Just Signed Up — What Happens Now?
How to pay the late penalty
If your plan premiums are deducted from your monthly Social Security check, 
then the late penalty is automatically taken out of it, too. If the plan sends 
you a monthly bill for premiums, the late penalty is added to the bill. If you 
prefer, you can choose to pay the penalty on a quarterly or annual basis.
Nice ’n’ Neat: Starting and 
Keeping Careful Records
People tend to be pretty slapdash about keeping records. Overwhelmed by 
junk mail, sometimes you toss the lot and lose something important. You put 
a vital document in a folder and then forget where you put the folder. Or you 
start off with the best intentions to sort and keep records in a file cabinet 
or computer file, and then — just like New Year resolutions that evaporate 
come February — you somehow fail to update them.
But if there’s one set of records you should keep safe, accessible, complete, and 
up-to-date, it’s all the accumulated bits of paper relating to your medical and 
prescription drug insurance. Doing so helps you keep track of your expenses and 
see how your drug coverage is panning out through the year (how close you’re 
coming to the doughnut hole, for example; see Chapter 15 for more on this 
topic). It also serves as a protection in case you get into any disputes with your 
plan and need hard facts to argue your case. In the following sections, I share 
how to tidy up your medical and drug insurance records, including how to store 
them online (if you’re so inclined).
Keeping hard-copy records you can rely on
If you hit a pothole while cruising down the Part D highway, you don’t want to 
have to scramble for your paperwork only to find it’s missing or unreadable 
because Fido used it as a new chew toy. In the next several sections, I present 
some suggestions for keeping records in such a way that you can actually find 
them when you need them.
Filing each type of insurance separately
 
Depending on how many different kinds of insurance you have — traditional 
Medicare, a stand-alone Part D plan, a Medigap supplemental insurance 
policy, a Medicare private health plan that includes drug coverage, or any 
other insurance (such as retiree or veterans health benefits) — keep records 
for each one in a separate file. Even if you have only one plan, creating one file 
for its medical benefits and another for its drug coverage is practical. Label 
each folder with the name of the plan and the type of insurance.

218
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
Keeping your Evidence of Coverage and other plan information
Your Evidence of Coverage booklet is a legal document that contains details 
of your legal rights and how to exercise them if you need to, as explained in 
the earlier section, “Information about your plan: Your new bedtime reading 
material.” If you have more than one plan, file each EOC and other documents 
in the appropriate folder for each plan so you can access them easily.
Tracking your expenses and level of coverage
Your plan must send a regular statement, called the Explanation of Benefits, 
about the treatment you’ve received and what you’ve paid. In the case of Part 
D, every EOB is worth keeping because together they show you
 
 How much you and your plan are paying for your drugs as the 
months go by. (The total amount paid by you and your plan affects 
your coverage level.)
 
 How close you are to the doughnut hole and, if your costs are high 
enough to land you in it, how much more you need to spend out of 
pocket before you qualify for the low costs of catastrophic coverage. (I 
explain the doughnut hole, catastrophic coverage, and other coverage 
levels in Chapter 15.)
 
 How much you’ve spent out of pocket on drugs during the year to 
date in this plan — in case you need to switch to another plan partway 
through the year (as explained in Chapter 17) and want to ensure that 
all of your payments under the old plan will count toward your out-of-
pocket limit in the new one.
Hanging on to documents that may help you resolve problems
Medicare has a system consumers can use to resolve disputes with their 
plans — whether they involve complaints against traditional Medicare, 
private Medicare health plans, or Part D plans — at several levels of appeal. 
(I explain the procedures for filing grievances and appeals in Chapter 19.) In 
Part D, you may need to ask the plan to cover a nonformulary drug or waive a 
restriction.
 
Keeping records of any interaction with your plan — including notes from 
phone conversations — helps your case if you need to file an appeal.
Opening and reading your mail
 
When an envelope marked with your plan’s name shows up in your mail box, 
open it! This advice may sound obvious, but plans too often send unwanted 
marketing materials to their members (sometimes unrelated to the health or 
prescription drug plan they’re on), and it’s easy to get into the habit of 
disregarding everything. But some plan mailings are important and may 
require timely action on your part. Here are some examples:

219
 Chapter 13: You’ve Just Signed Up — What Happens Now?
 
 The plan notifies you that it’s going to stop covering one of the drugs 
you’re taking and gives you 60 days’ warning. Or it informs you that one 
of your drugs has been taken off the market for safety reasons, and the 
plan will no longer cover it.
 
 The plan alerts you that it’s disenrolling you and terminating your 
coverage for some reason (as explained in Chapter 17) and gives you a 
certain amount of time to respond.
 
 The plan has decided you should pay a late penalty (as explained earlier 
in this chapter) and gives you 60 days to respond.
 
 The plan sends you its Annual Notice of Change (ANOC) — as all plans 
must do in October — which shows how its costs and benefits, and 
maybe its whole design, will change for the following year. (I explain 
more in Chapter 17 about the critical importance of reading the ANOC 
every year.)
 
 The plan informs you that it’s withdrawing service from your area, not 
renewing its contract with Medicare, or going out of business entirely. 
(See Chapter 17 for more on these possibilities.)
Tracking information online
 
Everything’s going electronic, and Medicare’s no exception. Following are two 
ways you may be able to keep track of your medical information online, up to 
a point, if that’s your preference:
 
 On Medicare’s Web site: Medicare offers a free way of accessing some 
of your personal medical information through its MyMedicare Web 
portal. Among other tasks, you can use this tool to
 
• Track your health claims in traditional Medicare
 
• See which preventive tests and screenings you’re entitled to
 
• Order a replacement for a lost Medicare card
 
• Keep a list of your medications
 
 To create a personal account, go to www.MyMedicare.gov, click “Need 
to Register?,” and enter your Medicare ID number. About two weeks 
later, Medicare will send you the password you need to access your 
account. Oddly, the password is sent via regular mail!
 
 In a personal health record: An increasing number of Medicare drug 
and private health plans are offering personal health records (PHRs) to 
their members for free. A PHR is an online tool that allows you to enter 
and keep any information you choose about
 
• Your medical history
 
• The visits you make to doctors and other medical services

220
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
• The dates of tests and screenings you need for your health 
condition
 
 Call your plan or visit its Web site to see whether it offers a PHR. You 
can also download a PHR that’s not connected to any health plan for 
free from the Internet.
These personal accounts may be a convenient way of storing files that are 
of interest to you — information downloaded from the Internet about your 
health condition, for example — or keeping a record of your treatments and 
setting up a calendar for your medical appointments. In some cases, you may 
be able to arrange for e-mails alerting you to tests, screenings, and checkups 
that are due. As more doctors transfer to electronic recordkeeping, you may 
be able to arrange to have their records of your visits, diagnoses, and tests 
transferred to your account. In this way, you choose what information you 
want to put into your account.
 
On the flip side, neither the MyMedicare site nor PHRs provide a way of 
tracking all your medical records and expenses as comprehensively as you 
can do the old-fashioned way — by filing paper. At least not yet. Also, many 
people remain uncomfortable with committing sensitive health information to 
a Web site. Both the operators of the MyMedicare portal and the suppliers of 
PHRs (including some of those private Medicare health plans) maintain that 
the accounts are secure and can be accessed only with your permission. But 
look carefully at the contract agreement (which you must sign) to see whether 
they retain the right to share your information with other parties.

Chapter 14
Filling Your Prescriptions
In This Chapter
 Deciding how to fill your prescriptions
 Picking the right pharmacies
 Being a card-carrying member of a drug plan — and what your card says about you
 Filling your prescriptions the first time out
I
 bet you’ve never compared your pharmacist to a pilot in the cockpit of a 
fighter jet! Yet both pros have something in common: They rely on warp-
speed electronic calculations to do their jobs. The pilot, facing enemy action, 
uses those calculations to fend off a missile attack. The pharmacist, facing 
Part D, uses them to tell you how much to pay for your Lipitor this month. 
Top Gun in a white coat!
This comparison may seem far-fetched, but it really isn’t. Just think how 
many calculations are necessary to arrive at that single payment. What you 
pay for each prescription depends on which Part D plan you’re in, where 
you’re at in the coverage cycle, whether you’re receiving Extra Help or 
additional coverage from outside of Part D, and even the pharmacy you go to. 
That’s complex math!
But all of these factors are chewed up somewhere in the ether and instantly 
spat out onto your pharmacist’s computer screen. If all goes smoothly, the 
result is the correct amount you should pay. If not, your pharmacist often 
can help you sort matters out. So the pharmacy is the front line in Part D, 
because your pharmacist is the go-between in your dealings with a drug plan. 
He’s the channel for your drug coverage and a useful person to answer 
questions.
This chapter has answers to issues that can arise when filling your prescriptions. 
I explain the various ways you can get your meds through Part D, the importance 
of going to pharmacies in your plan’s network whenever possible, and how your 
plan’s card is the key to coordinating all your benefits. I also cover what may 
happen the first time you have your prescriptions filled under a new Part D 
plan — because that’s when you’re most likely to hit any bumps in the road.

222
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
Choosing How to Fill Your Prescriptions
As ever in Part D, there are choices, rules, and pitfalls you need to know 
about when it comes to filling your prescriptions. The following sections 
explain the choices you have — between getting your drugs at a retail 
pharmacy or by mail order, if your plan offers that option — and the times 
when you may need to have a prescription filled at a specialty pharmacy that 
stocks and handles certain kinds of drugs. (Another option, long-term care 
pharmacies for people living in nursing homes, is covered in Chapter 18.)
 
Of course, you don’t have to choose just one pharmacy and stick with it. 
You can obtain your drugs from any pharmacy that accepts your plan’s card 
(and any others in an emergency; see the later section “Going to the Right 
Pharmacies and Avoiding the Wrong Ones”). And if you want to use mail order 
for some prescriptions and a retail pharmacy for others, that’s your call.
Retail pharmacies
By retail pharmacy I mean the bricks-and-mortar kind on Main Street that you 
walk into (as opposed to the mail-order pharmacies that you visit only on the 
end of a phone or online). Part D plans use a variety of retail pharmacies — 
large chains, supermarket pharmacies, and small independent locations.
You may choose to fill your prescriptions at a retail pharmacy (instead of 
going through mail order) for very personal reasons. You know the 
pharmacist, you like the staff, and it’s a good place to stop by for a chat with 
neighbors. Retail pharmacies have more general advantages, too, if you have 
one in your immediate area. When you need a medication for some acute 
condition that comes on fast, you can get it quickly. And your pharmacist is 
an expert source of help if you have questions about your health condition 
or the drugs you’re taking. If you’re housebound, a local pharmacy can often 
deliver meds to your home. However, if you live in a very rural area, with a 
retail pharmacy a long distance away, it may make more sense to choose mail 
order. (I go into the pros and cons of mail order later in this chapter.)
Every Part D plan has its own network of retail pharmacies — those pharmacies 
that accept the plan’s card. And every plan must ensure that at least one 
in-network pharmacy is within a reasonable distance of enrollees’ homes. 
What’s a reasonable distance? That depends on where you live:
 
 In an urban area, you’re likely to have dozens of in-network retail 
pharmacies to choose from — many within half a mile or so, and some 
even within walking distance.

223
 Chapter 14: Filling Your Prescriptions
 
 In a very rural area, getting to the nearest in-network retail pharmacy 
may mean driving ten miles or more. If only one such pharmacy is within 
that sort of distance, all the Part D plans in the area are likely to include 
it in their networks. (Head to Chapter 10 for suggestions on how to 
check up on convenient pharmacies when choosing a plan.)
 
Part D plans label some retail pharmacies in their networks as preferred. 
Generally, this means that the plan has a business relationship with these 
pharmacies, having negotiated lower dispensing fees or other special 
arrangements with them. Going to one of your plan’s preferred pharmacies
 
 Costs you somewhat less for your prescriptions than if you were to visit 
a nonpreferred pharmacy (as explained in Chapter 16).
 
 Possibly allows you to get your meds in 90-day supplies in one of the 
following ways:
 
• By paying the same amount or co-pay for 90-day supplies as you’d 
pay for three separate 30-day prescriptions.
 
• By paying the same discounted price or co-pay for a 90-day supply 
as you’d pay if you got the drugs from your plan’s mail-order 
service.
 
• By paying the discounted mail-order price or co-pay for a 90-day 
supply, plus an extra amount for dispensing fees.
 
• By paying the same co-pay for a 90-day supply as for a 30-day 
supply. (This option applies only if you’re receiving Extra Help.)
To find out which retail pharmacies are preferred, look at your plan’s 
pharmacy network list in your information packet (see Chapter 13), call the 
plan, or go to its Web site.
Mail-order pharmacies
Most plans offer a mail-order service for filling prescriptions, though not 
all do. Using this option can be convenient and save you money. But when 
deciding about mail order, consider the following:
 
 You can only purchase 90-day supplies, so mail order is best used for 
medicines you take regularly over a long period of time.
 
 Most plans (though not all) offer discounts for mail order — some-
times substantial ones. You may have lower co-pays and pay less in 
the deductible period and in the doughnut hole (formally known as the 
coverage gap; see Chapter 15) than at a retail pharmacy. (I explain more 
about possible savings and give examples in Chapter 16.)

224
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 Because you pay for a three-month supply in advance, you pay more 
upfront than if you buy a 30-day supply each month. And in certain 
circumstances, you may fall into the doughnut hole earlier as a result.
 
 Your drugs are mailed directly to your home, which may be convenient, 
especially if you’re homebound or live miles from the nearest retail 
pharmacy in your plan’s network. Shipping is free.
 
 You have to remember to phone in your next prescription or reorder 
online and allow time for delivery (usually seven to ten days) to ensure 
you don’t run out of your meds before the new ones arrive.
To find out how to use your plan’s mail-order service, check out the 
plan’s info packet, go to its Web site, or call its customer service number. 
Regardless, you’ll probably need to fill out a form to request this service.
Specialty pharmacies
Certain drugs must be handled extra carefully when they’re being dispensed — 
such as some drugs used for cancer, transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis, 
and other treatments. If you take one of these types of drugs, you need to 
purchase it at a specialty pharmacy that’s equipped to handle it. (The Food 
and Drug Administration allows some of these drugs to be distributed only to 
specialty pharmacies.)
The specialty label may be applied to a regular pharmacy that meets the 
conditions for dispensing these drugs, to a hospital pharmacy department, or 
to a doctor’s office. Your plan’s pharmacy list should indicate which 
specialty pharmacies are in-network.
 
If no in-network specialty pharmacy is in your area, you can go out of network, 
but call your plan first for guidance. Due to the circumstances, some Part D 
plans don’t offer mail-order service for these kinds of drugs.
Going to the Right Pharmacies and 
Avoiding the Wrong Ones
A pharmacy is a pharmacy is a pharmacy, isn’t it? How can there be right 
ones and wrong ones? This classification has nothing to do with quality. It’s 
just that going to a pharmacy outside your plan’s network, except in special 
circumstances, has consequences — consequences that cost you money. 
By staying in your plan’s network, you get your meds at the plan’s regular 
charges and ensure the costs count toward your out-of-pocket limit. I explain 
what you need to know in the following sections.

225
 Chapter 14: Filling Your Prescriptions
Using in-network pharmacies
Your Part D plan gives you access to a large number of retail pharmacies, 
either within its service area or all across the country. All of these pharmacies 
accept your plan’s card. That means you pay whatever the plan requires 
for your drugs and no more. Preferred pharmacies within the network may 
charge you less, as I touch on in the earlier section “Retail pharmacies.”
 
You can identify the retail pharmacies (including specialty ones) in your 
plan’s network by looking at the list in the plan’s information packet, going 
to its Web site, or using the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder at www.
medicare.gov (as explained in Chapter 10). If your plan allows you to fill 
prescriptions anywhere in the U.S. and you need to do so while traveling, you 
can call its customer service number (shown on your card) to check on 
network pharmacies where you are. Or you can show your card at any 
pharmacy and ask whether it’s in your plan’s network.
If you move away from where you live now and need to switch to a different 
Part D plan in your new area, the new plan sends you details about its in-
network pharmacies there as part of its enrollment package. If you remain in 
the same plan — for example, if you’re in a statewide stand-alone drug plan 
and you move to a new home within the same state — you can find a list of 
local in-network pharmacies by calling the plan, visiting its Web site, or going 
to the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder at www.medicare.gov.
Most plans, though not all, offer a mail-order service. If you prefer to obtain 
your meds this way, you must use the in-network mail-order service specified 
by your plan. (The plan won’t cover your drugs if you use any other mail-
order pharmacy, even if the plan doesn’t provide one of its own.) You can 
request mail-order service on a form your plan sends you if you check this 
option on your plan enrollment form or if you call the plan and ask for it.
Avoiding out-of-network pharmacies
 
Except in certain circumstances that I describe in the next section, these are 
the consequences of filling prescriptions at an out-of-network pharmacy:
 
 You pay a lot more for your drugs. In most cases, you pay the full price. 
Sending the receipts to your plan doesn’t do a scrap of good. The plan 
isn’t going to pay for them, period.
 
 These payments don’t count toward your out-of-pocket limit. If you 
fall into the doughnut hole, your plan disregards these payments when 
calculating your true out-of-pocket costs (TrOOP) — your expenses that 
count toward the limit that ends the coverage gap and triggers the 
beginning of catastrophic coverage, as explained in Chapter 15.

226
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
Knowing when going out of 
network may be okay
Obviously, situations may arise when you need to have a prescription filled 
outside of your plan’s pharmacy network. These times include
 
 When you’re traveling outside your plan’s service area within the U.S. 
(and maybe abroad, if your plan allows this exception for emergencies), 
and you run out of your meds, lose them, or become ill and need drugs 
for treatment.
 
 If you need to fill a prescription quickly outside business hours, but 
can’t find a 24/7 network pharmacy within a reasonable driving distance.
 
 If you need to start taking a specialty drug quickly and don’t have access 
to in-network pharmacies that stock this type of drug.
 
 When undergoing emergency or urgent treatment in a hospital, clinic, or 
outpatient facility and you receive Part D–covered drugs from the 
facility’s pharmacy, but it’s not in your plan’s network.
 
 If you have to leave your home area after a local calamity that’s been 
declared a state or federal disaster or a public health emergency.
 
Medicare expects all Part D plans to guarantee coverage at out-of-network 
pharmacies in any of the preceding circumstances — providing the plan 
covers the drugs in question and the request is reasonable. But if you 
regularly go to a 24/7 pharmacy that’s outside your plan’s network because 
you find it more convenient to shop late at night, expect the plan to quibble.
 
If you need to go out of network for any other reason than those I provide 
here, call your plan in advance and ask whether it’s okay to do so. A quick 
phone call may save you time, money and frustration in the long run.
When filling prescriptions out of network, you normally pay the full cost and 
later send the receipts to your plan, asking for the appropriate refund. If 
you can’t afford the full cost, call the plan and request assistance. (If you’re 
receiving Extra Help, which I describe in Chapter 5, ask the pharmacist for 
aid.) What if the plan rejects your claim for a refund? You can file a complaint 
and appeal against the decision, as explained in Chapter 19.
 
Your plan is allowed to charge you more for going out of network, even in 
these special circumstances. Whether it does depends on its policy. If you do 
have to pay more, though, the extra cost counts toward your out-of-pocket 
limit (as explained in Chapter 15). However, if you receive Extra Help, you 
can’t be charged any more than you would be at an in-network pharmacy. 
Also, you can’t be charged more if you’re enrolled in a Private Fee-for-Service 
plan that provides drug coverage (see Chapter 9), even if it has a pharmacy 
network.

227
 Chapter 14: Filling Your Prescriptions
Unlocking the Information in Your 
Membership Card
It’s all in the cards! No, your Part D plan membership card doesn’t magically 
foretell the future — except maybe to show how close you are to the dough-
nut hole. Yet it has a lot of detail locked inside that you can’t see on the sur-
face. This information is all about you. I tell you how to decipher these facts 
and make sure they’re right in the next couple of sections.
Understanding what your membership 
card says about you
So what deep secrets does your card reveal about you? Nothing sexy, that’s 
for sure — no exciting dark strangers in your past or future. But it does say 
a lot about your personal coverage for prescription drugs and what you 
should pay for them. Following is what your card reveals when the phar-
macist scans it through the computer system, depending on your plan and 
individual circumstances:
 
 Which Part D plan you belong to: Zillions of Part D plans are out there, 
so your pharmacist needs to know whom to bill and where to send the 
purchase details.
 
 Which phase of coverage you’re in: You may be in one of four phases, 
and in order for your pharmacist to bill you properly, he has to know 
which one applies to you at which time. I cover the various coverage 
levels in detail in Chapter 15, but here’s a quick breakdown:
 
• The deductible (when you pay the full price, if your plan has one)
 
• The initial coverage phase (when the plan pays a share of the cost 
of your drugs)
 
• The doughnut hole (when you pay the full price, if your costs are 
high enough to land you in it)
 
• The catastrophic coverage phase (when you pay very little, if your 
overall costs run that high in a year)
 
 Whether you receive Extra Help: This program for eligible people with 
limited incomes, which I explain in Chapter 5, reduces your payments 
a great deal and provides continuous coverage throughout the year 
(meaning no doughnut hole).
 
 Whether you receive other drug coverage from elsewhere: Your phar-
macist needs to know whether to bill your former employer or union plan, 
a State Pharmacy Assistance Program (SPAP), or another source, in addi-
tion to or in place of your Part D coverage. See Chapter 6 for more details.

228
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 What you should pay for each prescription: All of these factors play 
into what you actually pay at the pharmacy:
 
• The phase of coverage you’re in
 
• Whether you have extra benefits
 
• What your plan charges as co-pays or coinsurance
 
• Whether your plan has negotiated any discounts from this 
particular pharmacy
Making sure your benefits are 
correct and coordinated
The electronic wizardry that records all of your information saves a lot of 
hassle. Otherwise — just imagine! — you’d have to file a refund claim for 
every single prescription. But like any other automated system that relies on 
human input, it isn’t free from error.
 
Here’s what you can do to help ensure you receive all the benefits you’re 
entitled to and pay the correct amounts:
 
 Tell your plan what other coverage you have. If you have any other 
coverage at all, letting your plan know these details is crucial. The best 
way to guarantee that your plan coordinates all of your benefits is to 
fill out the form it sends you upon enrollment asking for these details. 
Medicare also sends you a similar form when you first come into the 
program. See Chapter 13 for more about disclosing other coverage.
 
 Know how other coverage fits in with Part D. If you receive insurance 
coverage from outside of Medicare — such as an employer or union 
plan, federal health benefits, or a State Pharmacy Assistance Program 
(SPAP) — your plan can give you specific details about how its coverage 
coordinates with Medicare prescription drug coverage. Or you can flip 
to Chapter 6 for the details of how Part D coordinates with each type of 
alternative coverage.
 
 Show your Part D plan card at the pharmacy. Presenting your card 
every time you fill a prescription — even during the deductible phase 
or the doughnut hole when you’re paying the full costs — ensures that 
your pharmacist charges you the correct amount according to your 
level of coverage. It also guarantees that the payments will count toward 
your out-of-pocket limit (as explained in Chapter 15).

229
 Chapter 14: Filling Your Prescriptions
 
 Check your statements. The Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statement that you 
receive regularly from your Part D plan, and any type of health insurance 
coverage, shows which of your payments the plan has covered. Reviewing 
the EOB is your best way of checking the accuracy of your payments and 
tracking your expenses and progress through different coverage levels.
 
 Tell your plan if your benefits situation changes. If you get a new job 
that affects your drug coverage — for example, your new employer pays 
your Part D premiums, whereas your previous one didn’t — or your 
current employer alters your benefits, write or fax your plan with this 
updated coverage information. (If new employment now gives you 
creditable coverage that you didn’t have before, you can disenroll from 
your Part D plan, as explained in Chapter 17.)
 
 Take action if you think something’s incorrect: Contact your Part 
D plan if you think you’re paying more than you should — the wrong 
amount for any of your drugs or for the coverage level you’re on, for 
example. (If this approach doesn’t resolve the issue, see Chapter 19 for 
how to file a complaint or an appeal.) If the issue involves another plan 
that provides additional drug coverage and coordinates with Part D, 
contact that plan for help.
Putting Your Plan to the Test: Filling 
Your Prescriptions on Day One
Day One is when you go to a retail pharmacy to fill a prescription for the 
first time under your new Part D plan. Whether you’re a newbie to Part D or 
you’ve switched to a new plan, I bet you’re wondering: How easily will I get 
my drugs under this new coverage? Will I hit any snags?
In the following sections, I suggest what you can do to make the process go 
as smoothly as possible. And, in case you do encounter problems, I explain 
what to do so you don’t leave the pharmacy without your medicine.
Dodging possible snags and delays 
by verifying your coverage
Normally, the procedure you follow to have your prescriptions filled under a 
Part D plan is simple; you just go to the pharmacy with your prescription (or 
have your doctor call it in), show your plan membership card, and pay 
whatever’s due. But when you go to a pharmacy for the first time under a 
new Part D plan, your pharmacist needs to verify your coverage, especially if 
you haven’t yet received your card or your enrollment information isn’t yet 
in the pharmacy’s computer system.

230
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
You can help speed up the process and avoid or minimize delays by following 
these tips:
 
 Pick the right pharmacy. Make sure the pharmacy you go to is in your 
plan’s network. (I explain why doing so is important earlier in this 
chapter.) You can find a list of in-network pharmacies in your plan’s 
information packet (see Chapter 13 for details on this packet). If you 
haven’t yet received one, call the plan and ask which of your nearest 
pharmacies are on the list. Or you can call ahead to a pharmacy to 
check if it’s in your plan’s network.
 
 Take proof of your Part D coverage with you. These items include
 
• Your plan membership card (see Chapter 13 for more about this 
and other cards)
 
• Your red-white-and-blue Medicare card
 
• A photo ID (if you have one)
 
 Have the pharmacist call the plan to confirm that you’re enrolled if 
you haven’t yet received your membership card. To smooth this 
process, provide your pharmacist with as many of the following as 
possible:
 
• The plan’s name
 
• The plan’s Medicare identification number (which you can find on 
the enrollment form you filled out, if you kept a copy)
 
• A letter from the plan acknowledging your enrollment request (if 
you’ve received it already)
 
• A letter from the plan confirming your enrollment (if you’ve 
gotten one)
 
• A copy of your enrollment request (if you haven’t yet received the 
plan’s acknowledgment or confirmation)
 
 Bring your Extra Help documentation, if you qualify due to limited 
income. Your plan’s membership card should be enough to confirm 
your eligibility, but if you haven’t yet received it, bring one of these 
items with you:
 
• Your Extra Help confirmation letter from Social Security or 
Medicare, or any recent letter you’ve received from either agency
 
• A copy of your Extra Help application, if you filled one out
 
• Your Medicaid card, if you’re receiving benefits from your state 
medical assistance program
 
• Any recent letters confirming that you receive Supplementary 
Security Income (SSI) or have your Medicare premiums paid by 
your state

231
 Chapter 14: Filling Your Prescriptions
Ensuring you don’t leave 
without your meds
What if your pharmacist can’t confirm your plan membership? Or says that 
your plan doesn’t cover one of your drugs, or that you need to get permission 
from the plan before it will cover a drug? What if she asks you to pay more for 
your drugs than you think you should? Any of these what-ifs can happen.
But let me give you a direct quote from Medicare. On December 28, 2007, in 
a statement that offered tips to consumers when filling prescriptions for the 
first time under a new Part D plan, the agency said: “Don’t leave the pharmacy 
counter without your medicines.” There — that’s straight from the horse’s 
mouth. But of course the circumstances may be different from person to 
person. I tackle what to do in certain situations in the next few sections.
If your pharmacist can’t confirm your enrollment in a plan
It takes time for plans to get details of new enrollees into the computer 
system, especially in early January when many people have just switched 
plans. If you have no proof of coverage (as explained in Chapter 12) or your 
pharmacist can’t verify your enrollment on the phone, here are your options:
 
 Pay for your drugs (at full price), keep the receipts, and send copies 
to the plan. Doing so is important, even if your plan has a deductible, 
because the payments count toward your out-of-pocket limit (as 
explained in Chapter 15) as long as the plan has a record of them. The 
plan then refunds you any money that’s due. However, if your enroll-
ment is denied (see Chapter 12 for how this situation can occur), the 
plan doesn’t cover these bills.
 
 Ask your pharmacist to call Medicare’s dedicated pharmacy hot line, 
which is used for this purpose if you can’t afford the prescriptions.
If your pharmacist says the plan won’t pay for one of your meds
Your pharmacist will probably tell you if your plan doesn’t cover a drug you’ve 
been prescribed, or if the med comes with restrictions requiring the plan’s 
consent before you can get it. (I explain these restrictions — prior authorization, 
quantity limits, and step therapy — and what to do about them in Chapter 4.) 
Whether she gives you this information or not, call your plan to find out why 
your coverage is being denied and what you should do about it.
 
If you’re newly enrolled in the plan and you’ve already been taking this drug, 
you have the legal right to a 30-day supply so your treatment isn’t interrupted. 
Ask your pharmacist to fill the prescription under your plan’s transition or 
first-fill policy. If she’s reluctant to do so, ask her to call your plan for approval. 
If you haven’t previously filled a prescription for the drug in question at this 
pharmacy, the pharmacist can call your doctor to verify that you’re currently 
taking it. Bringing in a current bottle containing this medication may also 

232
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
help. But note that this is only a temporary solution. You must take immediate 
steps to change to a drug your plan does cover or work with your doctor to 
get the restriction lifted, as covered in Chapter 4.
If your pharmacist asks you to pay more than you think you should
One common explanation for your pharmacist asking you to pay more than 
you think you should for drugs is this: You qualify for Extra Help, but your 
pharmacist can’t get immediate confirmation through the system. If you have 
Medicaid, show your card. If you’re receiving Supplementary Security Income 
(SSI) payments or your state pays your Medicare premium, tell the pharmacist. 
In all of these situations, you automatically qualify for Extra Help. If you 
applied for Extra Help, bring the letter from Social Security that says you 
qualify. Either way, you should be charged only small co-pays for your drugs 
(as explained in Chapter 5).
If you’ve applied for Extra Help but haven’t yet heard whether you qualify, 
you have two options:
 
 You can pay the plan’s normal co-pays for your drugs and keep your 
receipts. After you receive a letter from Social Security confirming that 
you’re eligible for Extra Help, the plan must refund you the difference 
between what you paid and what you would’ve paid under Extra Help — 
dating back to the time you applied for it.
 
 If you can’t afford to pay the usual co-pays upfront, tell the pharmacist, 
who has the discretion to help you under Medicare rules. (At the very 
least, if you have less than a three-day supply of your meds left, the 
pharmacist must allow you an emergency supply.) Don’t be too shy or 
proud to ask and, just like the Medicare honchos say, don’t leave the 
pharmacy without your meds.
 
The following situations may also result in you paying more at the pharmacy 
than expected, but they’re easy to check before you leave home:
 
 Your plan has a deductible. In this scenario, you pay the full cost of 
your drugs until you’ve met the amount of the deductible and your 
coverage begins. If you’re not sure whether your plan has a deductible, 
you can find out by looking in your plan’s Evidence of Coverage 
document or, if you haven’t received it yet, call the plan.
 
 The pharmacy isn’t in your plan’s network. In this case, you’re asked to 
pay the full price of your drugs. Fortunately, this situation is easy to 
avoid — just go to another pharmacy that is in the plan’s network. Again, 
you can find this information in your Evidence of Coverage or by calling 
the plan. However, if this is an emergency or another situation that allows 
you to go out of network (as explained earlier in this chapter), be sure to 
keep receipts for anything you pay.

Chapter 15
In and Out of the Coverage Gap
In This Chapter
 Grasping the fundamentals of the coverage gap
 Predicting whether you’ll tumble into the coverage gap
 Sidestepping or narrowing the gap with other benefits
Just imagine. For months you’ve been filling a prescription for $30 a 
month. Then one day, you go for a refill and the pharmacist says, “That’ll 
be $185, please.” You shriek, you’re outraged, you think it’s a mistake. But 
no — you just fell into the doughnut hole. Suddenly, you’re paying full price.
It’s no wonder that this doughnut hole — the universal nickname for what is 
officially called the coverage gap — is the most criticized and unpopular part 
of the Medicare drug benefit. Unlike almost any other kind of insurance, Part 
D gives some coverage for your first slice of drug costs and, if your out-of-
pocket expenses for drugs are high enough, another chunk of coverage later 
in the year. But in the middle, there’s this gap, and falling into it means 
having to pay every cent of drug costs out of your own pocket, unless you 
have other insurance that picks up any of it.
The doughnut hole doesn’t affect everybody. You won’t fall into it if
 
 Your total drug costs (what you and your plan pay) aren’t high enough 
to reach the limit of initial coverage over the whole year
 
 You receive Extra Help, which has no gap, as explained in Chapter 5
 
 You have additional benefits that cover your expenses through the gap
 
 You’re enrolled in a Medicare drug plan that covers all of your drugs in 
the gap
Even if none of these apply to you, you may still be able to avoid the gap 
or lessen its impact. But the gap exists, and it’s wise not to ignore it. This 
chapter explains how the doughnut hole works, how to tell whether you’ll 

234
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
fall into it, and how you may be able to cover some of your costs in the gap 
with additional benefits. Chapter 16 describes additional methods of bringing 
down your drug costs.
 
I use “doughnut hole” or “coverage gap” or just “the gap” interchangeably in 
this chapter — they all mean the same thing.
Understanding the Basics 
of the Coverage Gap
It may be hard to get your head around an insurance concept you’ve never 
met before. After all, car insurance doesn’t suddenly stop sometime through 
the year after you’ve clocked a certain number of miles. And home insurance 
doesn’t come with a clause saying you’ll be covered all year except, say, for 
July and August. But it’s amazing how quickly folks catch on to the idea of the 
Part D doughnut hole when their pocketbooks are at stake. You will too — I 
guarantee it!
In the following sections, I walk you through the mechanics of the doughnut 
hole in some detail so you can grasp exactly how it works. I also explain what 
drops you into the gap, what gets you out of it, and certain Medicare rules 
about the gap that you need to know.
The yawning gap in the 
middle of coverage
 
As I explain in Chapter 2, Medicare drug coverage has four phases over the 
course of a calendar year. The doughnut hole is the third phase. But whether 
you go through only one phase, two, three, or all four depends mainly on the 
overall cost of the drugs you take during the year.
 
 Phase 1, the deductible: In this phase, you may pay full price for your 
drugs until the cost reaches a limit set by law ($275 in 2008, $295 in 
2009) and drug coverage actually begins. If your plan has a deductible 
(many plans don’t), this period begins on January 1, or whenever you 
start using Medicare drug coverage.
 
 Phase 2, the initial coverage period: This phase begins when you’ve 
met the deductible, if there is one. Otherwise, it begins on January 1, or 
whenever you start using Medicare drug coverage. In this phase, you 
pay the co-pays required by your plan for each prescription; the plan 

235
 Chapter 15: In and Out of the Coverage Gap
takes care of the rest of each drug’s price. Phase 2 ends when the total 
cost of your drugs — what you’ve paid plus what your plan has paid — 
reaches a certain amount set each year by law ($2,510 in 2008, $2,700 
in 2009).
 
 Phase 3, the coverage gap: This phase begins if and when you reach the 
dollar limit of Phase 2. Unless you have other insurance that helps fill in 
the gap (see the later section “Avoiding or Narrowing the Coverage Gap 
with Other Benefits” for more information), you pay 100 percent of your 
drug costs until your total out-of-pocket expenses (except for premiums) 
reach another dollar amount set by law ($4,050 in 2008, $4,350 in 2009).
 
 Phase 4, catastrophic coverage: If your drug costs are high enough to 
take you through the gap, coverage begins again at a greatly reduced 
cost. In this period, you pay the standard catastrophic co-pay ($2.25 
per prescription for generics or $5.60 for brand-names in 2008; $2.40 
and $6.00 respectively in 2009) or 5 percent of the cost of your drugs, 
whichever is higher. Medicare picks up the remaining cost. Catastrophic 
coverage ends on December 31. The following day, January 1, you return 
to Phase 1 (or Phase 2 if your plan has no deductible), and the whole 
cycle starts over again.
 
Look again at the last sentence in the preceding paragraph — on January 1, the 
whole cycle begins all over again. In other words, the four phases repeat every 
calendar year. I want to be sure you understand this, because some folks think 
that after they’ve struggled through the doughnut hole and emerged into the 
rarified air of catastrophic coverage, this last phase goes on forever. Sorry — 
it doesn’t. But then, the doughnut hole doesn’t go on forever, either. Even if 
you ended the year paying full price in the gap, you’ll get back to Phase 2 cov-
erage again next year as soon as you’ve met the deductible, or as early as 
January 1 if your plan has no deductible.
To make more sense of this annual progression, take a look at Table 15-1. It 
shows how one Medicare beneficiary (Anna) with high drug costs — $800 a 
month for several prescriptions — went through all four phases and what she 
and her plan paid each month in 2008.
 
This example is based on the standard benefit for minimum drug coverage 
that Congress designed and that many plans stick to (as I explain in Chapters 
2 and 3). In other words, Anna is in a plan that charges her a full deductible 
and 25 percent of the cost of her drugs in the initial coverage period, and 
offers no coverage in the gap. If she were in a plan that varied the standard 
design, her costs would be different. Note: The calculations are based on the 
deductible and dollar limits for the initial coverage period and coverage gap 
that applied in 2008. These amounts are raised each year.

In Table 15-1, you can see that Anna paid the deductible (Phase 1) and then 
25 percent of her costs in the initial coverage period (Phase 2). She hit the 
doughnut hole (Phase 3) in the first few days of April, as soon as her total 
drug costs reached $2,510. She then paid full price until early August, when 
her out-of-pocket spending since the beginning of the year reached the $4,050 
limit. (The shaded rows in the table indicate her total time in the doughnut 
hole.) Then she came out of the gap and started receiving coverage again at 
the catastrophic level (Phase 4), paying only 5 percent of the cost of her 
drugs until the end of December.

237
 Chapter 15: In and Out of the Coverage Gap
Over the entire year, Anna paid less than half (44 percent) of what her drugs 
actually cost. But a full three-quarters (75 percent) of her expenses came 
right in the middle, in the doughnut hole. Note that this example focuses on 
Anna’s payments and savings in buying her drugs under Part D. But, in addi-
tion, Anna must pay her plan a monthly premium to receive Part D coverage. 
A premium of $26 a month, for example, would add $312 to her annual 
expenses.
What drops you into the doughnut hole
 
You reach the limit of the initial coverage period (Phase 2 in the previous 
section’s list) when the money both you and your plan pay for your drugs 
reaches the dollar amount set by law ($2,510 in 2008, $2,700 in 2009). It isn’t 
just what you have paid. This point is often overlooked, or misunderstood, 
with the result that folks fall into the gap a lot sooner than they expect to. 
I don’t want this to happen to you.
So say, for example, that your co-pay for one of your prescriptions is $25. 
During the initial coverage period (Phase 2), your plan pays the rest of the 
price it has negotiated for the drug — say $75. The full price of the drug is 
$25 + $75 = $100. The $100, not the $25, counts toward the limit. And what 
you’ve paid to the plan each month in premiums just to receive drug 
coverage doesn’t count at all.
What lifts you out of the doughnut hole
 
You get out of the gap as soon as your own out-of-pocket spending on drugs 
since the beginning of the year reaches the limit set by law ($4,050 in 2008, 
$4,350 in 2009). In this case, what your plan has paid doesn’t count. And other 
rules (no surprise here) outline what counts as “out-of-pocket” spending and 
what doesn’t.
These payments count toward the coverage gap limit:
 
 Your initial deductible (if your plan has one) during Phase 1.
 
 Your co-pays (or coinsurance) in the initial coverage period (Phase 2) or 
in the doughnut hole if your plan covers any of your drugs in the gap.
 
 Out-of-pocket payments that you’ve made in the doughnut hole for 
drugs bought through your plan at a pharmacy in your plan’s network 
(Phase 3).

238
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 Payments for your drugs bought through your plan and made by a 
family member, a friend, a charitable group, or a State Pharmacy 
Assistance Program (any phase). (I cover State Pharmacy Assistance 
Programs later in this chapter and charities in Chapter 16.)
 
 Any payment you make toward the cost of your drugs in the coverage 
gap when a third party (such as an employer or union plan or a pharma-
ceutical company’s assistance program) picks up the rest of the tab. 
(I describe these types of extra coverage in the later section “Avoiding 
or Narrowing the Coverage Gap with Other Benefits.”)
 
These payments do not count toward the limit:
 
 The monthly premiums you pay to the plan.
 
 Payments made by your plan for your drugs during the initial coverage 
period or in the doughnut hole. (Some plans, as you see later in this 
chapter, cover some drugs in the gap.)
 
 Payments you make for any drugs not covered by your plan (unless, for 
medical reasons, the plan has agreed to pay for a drug that it doesn’t 
normally cover; see Chapter 4 for more on this).
 
 Payments you make for drugs at pharmacies outside your plan’s 
network of pharmacies.
 
 Payments made for your drugs by a current or former employer or 
union, a government program (such as Veterans Affairs, TriCare, Indian 
Health Services, or Black Lung), or any other group insurer.
 
 Payments for drugs made under workers’ compensation or automobile 
or liability insurance.
 
 Payments made by AIDS drug assistance programs.
 
 Payments for drugs bought from Canada or other foreign countries.
 
 Payments for low-cost drugs (or the value of free ones) received from a 
drug manufacturer’s patient assistance program.
 
 The value of free samples your doctor has given you.
Rules for buying your drugs 
in the doughnut hole
As you may notice from the lists in the previous section, Medicare has some 
strict rules to persuade you to continue buying your drugs through your plan 
in the gap. Part D allows only payments for drugs covered by your plan and 

239
 Chapter 15: In and Out of the Coverage Gap
purchased from a pharmacy within your plan’s network to count toward 
the out-of-pocket limit that gets you out of the doughnut hole. The following 
sections detail what these mean and factors to keep in mind.
Using drugs covered by your plan
Drugs covered by your plan generally are the ones that are on your plan’s 
formulary (the list of drugs the plan helps pay for). The full cost of these 
drugs counts toward your out-of-pocket limit in getting out of the coverage 
gap. So does the cost of any nonformulary drugs that your plan agrees to 
cover if you’ve won an exception to its policy (as explained in Chapter 4). 
Any other drugs don’t count toward your out-of-pocket limit.
For example, say that you’re taking four meds — W, X, Y, and Z — but your 
plan covers only the first three. In the coverage gap, when you’re paying full 
price, these three drugs cost a total of $200 a month, every cent of which 
counts toward your out-of-pocket limit. So do your co-pays for them in the 
initial coverage period (Phase 2) that precedes the gap. In contrast, you pay 
the full price (say $100 a month) of the fourth drug, Z, throughout the year 
because your plan doesn’t cover it. For the same reason, none of your 
payments for Drug Z count toward your out-of-pocket limit.
 
If you start using a new medication when you’re in the gap, check to see 
whether the new drug — or a similar one that would work just as well for 
you — is on your plan’s formulary. If it is, the money you spend on it will 
count toward getting you out of the doughnut hole. (To find out, call your plan 
or look at the formulary on its Web site.) Also, remember that if the new drug 
isn’t on the formulary, you can still ask for an exception to get it covered, even 
while you’re in the doughnut hole.
Buying drugs from pharmacies in your plan’s network
Pharmacies in your plan’s network are those that accept your plan’s member-
ship card. If you buy your drugs from any of these pharmacies (or from your 
plan’s mail-order service) during the gap, your payments will count toward 
your out-of-pocket limit. Otherwise, they won’t. So if you find a lower price 
outside the network, you have to decide whether the savings are worth not 
having the payments counted.
Deciding whether you should stick to the rules
If your overall drug costs are high, you need all your payments in the gap to 
count in order to reach catastrophic coverage as quickly as possible. But if 
your costs are in the medium range, and you’re pretty sure you won’t get out 
of the gap before the end of the year — or you can’t afford the money it takes 
to get out of the gap — you may feel you have nothing to lose by getting 
lower-cost drugs elsewhere. (You can find ways to do this in Chapter 16.)

240
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
Keep in mind, though, that this choice can be a bit of a gamble. You can’t be 
entirely sure that you won’t develop a new medical condition that requires 
more drugs, and maybe expensive ones, later in the year — all of which, if 
bought through your plan, will move you faster through the doughnut hole.
Making sure your gap purchases count
 
If you continue to get your drugs at any of your plan’s in-network pharmacies 
during the gap, be sure to show your plan’s card to the pharmacist. Even 
though the plan doesn’t pay anything toward your drugs during this phase, 
your payment is logged into the computer system and counts toward your 
out-of-pocket limit. You may also want to keep the pharmacy receipts as a 
record of these payments, just in case you and your plan later disagree about 
the date when you emerge from the gap and become entitled to catastrophic 
coverage.
The consequences of stopping premium 
payments in the doughnut hole
You’re expected to pay monthly premiums through the gap. This rule bugs 
many people, which isn’t surprising. In the doughnut hole, you’re basically 
paying good money for no coverage. Medicare officials argue that your premi-
ums cover the cost of coverage over the whole year, including the generous 
catastrophic period. But what if your drug costs are enough to land you in 
the gap but nowhere near high enough to get you to the catastrophic level 
before the end of the year? Or what if you simply can’t afford the amount it 
takes to get out of the gap? Why continue paying premiums?
 
If you stop paying premiums, you’ll likely be thrown out of your plan and lose 
coverage. Here’s why that may not be a good idea:
 
 If you want to go back into Part D at a later date, you’ll pay a late 
penalty — an amount that adds to your premiums and increases over 
time, as explained in Chapter 8.
 
 You may be required to repay the premiums you owed before enrolling 
in a Part D plan again.
 
 The plan you dropped out of may go after you for the premiums you 
didn’t pay, arguing that you broke your contract.
 
 And — you never know — you may need coverage later in the year if 
you come down with some unforeseen health problem that requires 
treatment with expensive drugs.

241
 Chapter 15: In and Out of the Coverage Gap
Determining Whether You’ll 
Fall into the Coverage Gap
Nobody likes nasty surprises — and, as many folks have found out, falling 
into the doughnut hole unexpectedly can be a real shock. So it’s worth 
finding out in advance if and when you’ll face the coverage gap. Calculating 
this isn’t easy to do on your own, but the following sections explain ways to 
find out how close you are.
Reviewing statements from your plan
Your Medicare drug plan is required to send you regular statements showing
 
 How much you and the plan have spent to date for your drugs
 
 How close (or not) you are to the end of the initial coverage period and 
the beginning of the doughnut hole
If you go into the gap, the statements also show how much more you have to 
spend to get out of it before you can start receiving catastrophic coverage. 
Statements are normally sent monthly, unless you haven’t filled any prescrip-
tions in a particular month. You can also request a statement at any time by 
calling your plan. Some plans offer personalized access to their Web sites so 
enrollees can keep track of their status online.
What were they thinking . . . when 
they created the doughnut hole?
In designing the Medicare drug benefit in 2003, 
Congress decided to give comprehensive cov-
erage to people with low incomes (Extra Help) 
or high drug expenses (catastrophic coverage). 
But to sell the program politically — as well as 
to attract wealthier and healthier enrollees to 
spread the cost burden — Congress had to give 
coverage to everybody else too. It was impos-
sible to cover everyone comprehensively within 
the $400 billion originally budgeted for the pro-
gram, so something had to give. Inventing the 
doughnut hole solved the problem for the gov-
ernment’s purse strings, but created one for 
many enrollees’ pocketbooks.

Using charts on the Medicare Web site
The Web site for comparing Medicare drug plans at www.medicare.gov 
has a convenient tool you can use to see at a glance whether the doughnut 
hole will affect you and, if so, when it will hit. This is a very cool tool that 
creates personalized bar charts showing your likely out-of-pocket costs 
under different plans, according to the drugs you take, month by month 
through the year.
The charts on the Medicare Web site are so useful in estimating how your 
expenses may rise and fall during the year that going to some trouble to look 
at them is well worth it. (If you don’t have access to the Internet, you can ask 
someone else to do it for you.)
To have a personalized chart created for you, you must first enter the names 
of each of your drugs (plus their dosages and how often you take them) on 
Medicare’s online Prescription Drug Plan Finder. (For a step-by-step guide on 
how to do this quickly, go to Chapter 10.) Your costs under different plans 
are then automatically calculated. Ideally, you’d do this search when you’re 
comparing Medicare drug plans to decide which one to pick. You can then 
look at the charts included with each plan’s details. Or, if you’re already in a 
plan, you can go directly to that plan’s details to see your chart.
 
You’ll find your personalized chart at the bottom of the plan details page — 
so be sure to scroll down so you don’t miss it. The chart displayed there 
calculates your out-of-pocket costs (including premiums) on the basis of drugs 
bought from a retail pharmacy in the plan’s network. To see a chart showing 
your costs if you buy your drugs from the plan’s mail-order pharmacy (if the 
plan offers this option), click the “Show” button next to the heading Total 
Monthly Cost Estimator for Mail Order Pharmacy. To see details of how each 
month’s costs are calculated, click “Show Explanation of These Costs” 
alongside either chart.
Every chart varies according to the drugs you take and the plan’s overall 
design. Figures 15-1 and 15-2 are two examples of what the charts look like.
 
 Figure 15-1 shows the monthly out-of-pocket profile of a person in a 
plan with a deductible and no coverage in the gap, but this person’s 
costs aren’t high enough to take her through the doughnut hole to the 
catastrophic coverage level.
 
 Figure 15-2 shows the monthly out-of-pocket profile of a person in a plan 
with no deductible and no coverage in the gap, but this person’s costs 
are high enough to move him through the doughnut hole so he receives 
catastrophic coverage until the end of the year.

Each chart shows a profile of the user’s out-of-pocket costs under that 
particular plan — one with a deductible and one without — month by month 
throughout the year. The dollar amounts at the top of each bar are the total 
of what the user pays each month, including premiums.
The bar charts in Figures 15-1 and 15-2 come in many variations, according 
to each plan’s charges and benefit design. For example, if you’re in a plan 
with no deductible and your drug costs aren’t high enough to reach the 
doughnut hole, the payments for each month, January through December, 
will be the same. If you’re in a plan with no deductible that covers all of your 
drugs through the doughnut hole, that too will show the same flat payments 
each month.
 
The examples in Figures 15-1 and 15-2 show cost profiles over the whole 
year — typically the kind of bar chart you’d see during the annual open 
enrollment period (November 15 to December 31) when you’re comparing 
plans to pick one for next year. But what if you come into Part D partway 

244
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
through the year? Or change your medications during the year — 
dropping some or adding some? Here’s how the charts work in those 
circumstances:
 
 If you join Medicare Part D partway through the year: You’ll still see a 
profile of your projected costs over the whole year, but the dark shaded 
bars will show your actual monthly costs for the rest of the year. Say 
that you turn 65 and enroll in the program in November. Your cycle of 
coverage then begins in December, starting with the deductible (if any) 
and the initial coverage period. You’ll see a dark shaded bar in Month 1 
that shows your costs in December. The other months (2 through 12) 
are shown in light shading, but are irrelevant because, in this example, 
after December you’ll be into a new cycle of coverage. If you start 
coverage in June, say, the dark bars also begin in Month 1 (representing 
June), and continue through Month 7 (representing December). Again, 
the light-shaded bars in Months 8 through 12 are irrelevant because 
after December you’ll be in next year’s cycle of coverage.
 
 If your drugs change during the year: In this case, you can update your 
drug list on the plan finder to see how your cost profile will change. You 
must revise your list of drugs (omitting any you’ve stopped taking and 
adding any new ones) and then click the plan you’re currently enrolled in 
to see your new cost profile on the bar chart. Again, as explained in the 
preceding bullet, the dark bars on the chart indicate what you’ll pay for 
the rest of the year.
Avoiding or Narrowing the Coverage 
Gap with Other Benefits
In Medicare as a whole, you’ve always had the right to purchase extra insur-
ance that’s specifically designed to pay for out-of-pocket expenses, like Part A 
and Part B deductibles and co-pays. (This is known as Medigap supplemen-
tary insurance, which I explain in Chapter 1.) You’d expect this type of insur-
ance to also cover out-of-pocket expenses in Part D — especially those in the 
doughnut hole. But no, it doesn’t. The law specifically forbids it. (See the 
nearby sidebar “What were they thinking . . . when they didn’t allow Medigap 
to cover prescription drugs?” for more information.)
However, you may be able to get other benefits that help fill in the doughnut 
hole, either completely or partially. In the following sections, I consider help 
given through employer or union health plans, State Pharmacy Assistance 
Programs, and the few Medicare drug plans that offer some coverage in the 
gap. (I outline other ways of reducing your drug costs, which may also help 
you avoid the doughnut hole or lessen its impact, in Chapter 16.)

245
 Chapter 15: In and Out of the Coverage Gap
Leaning on employer benefits
Some employer or union health benefits provide drug coverage that wraps 
around Part D — in other words, it pays for some or all of enrollees’ out-of-
pocket costs in a Medicare drug plan. Sometimes this wrap-around drug 
coverage includes paying for drugs in the doughnut hole, either wholly or in 
part. (You can find more information in Chapter 6 on how employer and 
union drug benefits fit in with Part D.)
 
Any money your employer or union pays toward your drugs during the gap 
does not count toward your out-of-pocket limit, and therefore delays or elimi-
nates your chances of qualifying for catastrophic coverage later on. (Not that 
this matters, because you’re saving money anyway.) But anything you pay 
does count. Employers are expected to coordinate benefits with Medicare 
drug plans. Still, keeping the receipts for your share of these payments in the 
gap is a good idea, just in case you need to give proof to your drug plan.
Filling in with veterans benefits
If you’re enrolled in the healthcare program run by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and you’re in a Part D plan, you have the right to use 
either the VA or your drug plan to obtain medications, on a prescription-
by-prescription basis, as explained in Chapter 6. So you can use your VA 
benefits to cover prescriptions in the Part D coverage gap. These payments 
don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit to get out of the gap, but your 
co-pays count.
What were they thinking . . . when they didn’t 
allow Medigap to cover prescription drugs?
In designing Part D, Congress specifically pro-
hibited Medigap insurance from covering 
prescription drugs in all policies sold after Part 
D began. The law allowed people who already 
had such policies to continue using them — but 
barred those folks from having Medicare drug 
coverage at the same time. The law also 
decreed that those folks would be hit with a late 
penalty if they were to drop drug coverage from 
Medigap and join Part D in the future.
Consumer advocates vigorously opposed this 
clause in the law, arguing that buying additional 
benefits should be a personal decision, as it is 
in other forms of insurance. Lawmakers who 
supported the clause argued that Medicare 
beneficiaries needed to remain “aware” of the 
real cost of prescription drugs (as in, presum-
ably, “feeling the pain”). 
But there was also strong political pressure to 
get as many people as possible into Part D and 
to keep the program firmly within the control of 
Medicare’s private health and drug plans.

Seeking additional coverage from a State 
Pharmacy Assistance Program
In 2008, ten State Pharmacy Assistant Programs (SPAPs) provide some 
coverage in the doughnut hole for residents with incomes under a certain 
level who are enrolled in Medicare drug plans. They are Connecticut, 
Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, 
Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Help in the gap varies a great deal among 
these programs, from quite limited assistance to full coverage. (For more on 
how SPAPs fit together with Part D, see Chapter 6.)
 
Any payments an SPAP makes for your drugs in the gap do count toward your 
out-of-pocket limit — as long as the program is “qualified” under Medicare 
Part D rules (as those listed previously are; see Chapter 6 for an explanation 
of “qualified”). So these payments do not delay or erase your chances of 
qualifying for catastrophic coverage later on if your drug costs go that high.
Getting lucky with a Medicare drug plan 
that covers your drugs in the gap
Most Part D plans stick to the basic plan designed by Congress — that is, 
they don’t give any coverage in the doughnut hole. But some do, in one of 
two ways:
 
 Plans that cover only generic drugs in the gap: Generics have the same 
active ingredients as the brand-name drugs they are copying but cost 
far less, as explained in Chapter 16. In 2008, every beneficiary in every 
state has access to at least 14 plans that offer generic coverage in the 
gap. Most of these plans have higher-than-average premiums.
 
 Plans that cover generics and brand-name drugs in the gap: These 
plans have become much scarcer since Part D began in 2006. In that 
year, people in 46 states had access to at least one stand-alone prescrip-
tion drug plan (the kind that most people in Medicare have, to comple-
ment the traditional Medicare health program), which offered full 
coverage of generics and brand-name drugs in the gap. In 2007, such 
plans were available in 39 states. In 2008, only one stand-alone plan in 
one state gave any brand-name coverage in the gap, covering only about 
30 drugs.

247
 Chapter 15: In and Out of the Coverage Gap
 
 Among Medicare Advantage plans that provide both healthcare and 
drugs (see Chapter 9), gap coverage for brand-name drugs has also 
gotten scarcer. MA plans that covered all the drugs on their formularies 
in the gap were available only in a few counties across the nation in 
2008, mainly in large urban areas in California and Florida.
 
If you have one of these fill-in plans, the money your plan pays toward your 
drugs during the gap does not count toward your out-of-pocket limit, but your 
co-pays do count.
How do you know whether a fill-in plan is worth it?
 
If you’re considering a plan that offers any coverage in the gap, think about 
these points before signing up for one:
 
 Will the plan give you any benefit in the gap? If you use a lot of generic 
drugs, you may assume that a plan offering gap coverage for generics 
is your best bet. Well, it might be — but not necessarily. Most generics 
are so inexpensive that you’d need to use a very large number of them 
to rack up enough costs to even reach the gap. So why pay a higher 
premium for one of these fill-in plans if you’ll never hit the gap anyway? 
A plan that covers all your brand-name drugs as well as generics may 
well be a good deal if the drugs are costly enough to take you into 
the gap. But you generally can find such plans only in a few Medicare 
Advantage plans in local areas — which means considering their health 
benefits as well as their drug coverage before you sign up, as explained 
in Chapter 9.
 
 Will the plan cover all of your drugs in the gap? In the first two years 
of Part D, the fill-in plans usually offered full coverage in the gap for all 
drugs on their formularies. By 2008, only a very few Medicare Advantage 
plans did. The rest use much vaguer terms to describe their gap cover-
age: for example, “some generics and some brands” or “some generics” 
or “all preferred generics.” These terms often conceal a very limited 
range of drugs, often the least pricey ones on a plan’s formulary.
 
 What will you be charged for your drugs in the gap? Most fill-in plans 
charge the same co-pays for drugs in the gap as they charge during the 
initial coverage period. But some charge more. One plan in 2008 charged 
a $15 co-pay in the gap for the same generic drug that cost $2 in the 
initial coverage period — in other words, more than seven times as 
much. Some other plans charge three or five times as much. At the other 
end of the generosity spectrum, some plans don’t charge anything for 
generics, either in the initial coverage period or in the gap.
So how do you avoid these traps? In every case, you need to compare plans 
to find out whether a fill-in plan is actually worth it, according to the drugs 
you take. The only effective way to do this is to run the names of your drugs 
(plus their dosages and how often you take them) through Medicare’s online 
plan finder. Doing so automatically shows you the plans that cover your 

248
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
drugs at the least expense — including whether the plans offer any coverage 
in the gap. (I explain how to use the plan finder, or get someone else to use it 
for you, in detail in Chapter 10.)
Will there be more gap coverage in the future?
It’s always possible that more plans will offer full coverage in the gap in 
future years. You’d expect them to, because there’s obviously a demand. But 
don’t hold your breath. Private insurers are in this business to turn a profit, 
and they’re leery of offering full-coverage plans that attract people who need 
the most drugs and make the most claims — and therefore cost insurers 
the most money. In 2006 and 2007, full gap coverage was offered consecu-
tively by two insurers, and each eliminated it at the end of one year, citing 
financial problems. Many people saved a lot of money when enrolled in these 
plans — while they lasted. Their disappearance was bad news for people 
with high drug costs who most need coverage in the gap, especially those 
taking brand-name drugs that don’t have a comparable generic yet.
 
When open enrollment (November 15 to December 31) comes round each 
year, check to see whether any new plans are offering gap coverage for the 
following year. To find out, look in the plan listings at the end of your Medicare 
& You handbook, which Medicare mails to you in mid-October, or go to www.
medicare.gov and click “Learn more about plans in your area.” Still, as I 
suggested earlier in this section, the only way to find out whether any fill-in 
plan would benefit you is to use Medicare’s online plan finder, either yourself 
or by getting someone else to do it for you, as suggested in Chapter 10.

Chapter 16
Bringing Down Your Drug Costs
In This Chapter
 Lowering your costs to stretch your coverage
 Decreasing your expenses in the coverage gap
T
he difference between a co-pay and the full price of a prescription drug 
can bring on serious sticker shock. And the increase in your out-of-
pocket cost happens very suddenly if you cross the line into the doughnut 
hole, which I explain in detail in Chapter 15. So doing everything you can to 
stay clear of the gap makes sense. That means making the coverage you have 
at the beginning of the year last as long as possible. In this chapter, I suggest 
several ways to do that. Of course, these suggestions can help lower your 
expenses even if you’re unlikely to hit the doughnut hole.
And what if you fall into the gap despite your best efforts? Not everyone sees 
the gap in the same way:
 
 Some folks with very high drug costs want to race through the gap to get 
to those generous catastrophic benefits as quickly as they can.
 
 Others, also with very high costs, would like to do the same, but they 
simply don’t have the money it takes to get there. (Remember: You have 
to pay a large chunk on your own to get out of the gap.)
 
 The majority of people have costs in the medium to high range and 
expect to fall into the gap but not get out of it before the end of the year.
If you’re in the second or third group, you’ll want to lessen the impact of 
the doughnut hole while you’re in it. In this chapter, I suggest ways to do 
that, too.
Stretching Your Coverage
That first slice of coverage in Part D, the phase known as the “initial cover-
age period,” really isn’t very large. It sounds pretty good — coverage for up 
to $2,510 of drug costs in 2008 ($2,700 in 2009). But this amount isn’t just 

250
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
what you pay (read Chapters 2 and 15 for more about costs during the initial 
coverage period). It means the full cost of your prescriptions (what you pay 
and what your plan pays). And with drug prices as high as they are, it doesn’t 
necessarily take many meds for you to see your initial coverage swallowed 
up before half the year has passed.
I guess you’d prefer this not to happen to you. So somehow you need to 
s-t-r-e-t-c-h that coverage, which may turn out to be as healthy for your wallet 
as physical stretching is for your body — yoga for the pocketbook, perhaps. 
Even if you can save only a few dollars here and there, they all add up and 
stave off the sorry day when you may hit the doughnut hole. In the following 
sections, I highlight practical ways to do this, starting with one that may sur-
prise you.
Taking a hard look at your meds
Think about all of the medications you take. Do you really need them all? This 
may sound like an impertinent question, but I don’t mean it that way. Many 
people are being over-prescribed without realizing it. In a health system 
where you can see many different doctors, and there’s little or no coordina-
tion among them, taking more meds than you really need is quite easy. Your 
primary care physician may prescribe two or three drugs, and various spe-
cialists may prescribe more.
 
This isn’t just a matter of cost. Some drug combinations can work against 
each other in subtle and complex ways that harm your health. And the more 
meds you take, the greater the possibility that this can happen. Researchers 
have also found plenty of examples of people developing new symptoms — for 
example, depression, headaches, or constipation — which are actually side 
effects of one of the drugs they’re already taking. But without realizing this, 
they go back to their primary care doctors who often . . . yes, prescribe yet 
more pills.
Now don’t take this the wrong way. I’m not suggesting that you suddenly stop 
taking any of your drugs or lose faith in your doctor. Far from it. But make 
sure that all the medications you’re taking are necessary and safe when used 
together. If some aren’t, then cutting back will save you money and protect 
your health.
 
The American Society of Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP), whose members 
are pharmacists specializing in medication management for older people, 
recommend that seniors review their prescriptions if they currently

251
 Chapter 16: Bringing Down Your Drug Costs
 
 Take five or more medications
 
 Take more than 12 medication doses a day
 
 Take medications for three or more medical problems
 
 See more than one physician who prescribes drugs on a regular basis
The following sections explain how you can get your meds reviewed.
Consulting your primary care doctor
 
Some physicians encourage patients to bring all of their medications into 
the office, and they’re often amazed to see the variety of pills that are 
poured onto their desks. So your primary care doctor may — and certainly 
should — welcome a request to review yours. You can either take in the 
containers or make a list of all the drugs you’re currently taking — not just 
prescription drugs, but also over-the-counter medicines, herbal remedies, and 
vitamins. If you make a list, make sure to include
 
 The full name of each of your drugs
 
 Their dosages
 
 How often you take them
 
 How long you’ve been taking them
 
 The name of the physician(s) who prescribed them
 
It’s a good idea to keep this list in your wallet and show it to any physician 
who prescribes a new medicine for you. Then the doctor can decide on the 
spot whether the new drug is really necessary or how it may interact with 
others you’re already taking. If you’re newly enrolled in Medicare Part B and 
go for your “Welcome to Medicare” exam — the only routine checkup that 
Medicare covers — this would be another opportunity to produce the list and 
ask the doctor to review it.
During this review, ask your doctor these specific questions:
 
 Do I still need this drug? If so, why?
 
 Is this drug safe to take with all the others I’m taking?
 
 Is this drug appropriate for people of my age?
 
 Does this drug perform essentially the same function as another drug 
I’m taking? If so, do I need both?
 
 Is there a medicine I’m not taking that I should be taking?
 
 Are there any changes I can make in my daily life that will make taking 
this drug unnecessary?

Turning to a pharmacist
Pharmacists are experts on the active ingredients in medicines, how they 
work in your body, and how different drugs may interact. In fact, pharmacists 
are more expert on this topic than doctors, and they’re often willing to spend 
more time answering patients’ questions, such as those I suggest in the previ-
ous section. You can ask for an appointment to see a pharmacist face to face 
to review your drugs, or you can drop off your list of meds and arrange to 
call later for the pharmacist’s opinion. Note: You may be charged a fee for 
the review.
 
If you live in an area that has a School of Pharmacy, you can inquire whether 
any of its advanced students are interested in performing a review. Many 
schools offer this service as part of students’ clinical training, under faculty 
supervision, at the school or in local clinics at little or no charge. To see 
whether there’s a school near you, go to the American Association of Colleges 
of Pharmacy’s Web site at www.aacp.org and click “Pharmacy Schools.” Or 
call the AACP at 703-739-2330.
A relatively small but growing number of pharmacists have been trained in 
pharmacology as it relates to seniors. They know the drugs that older people 
shouldn’t be taking, how some drugs cause additional symptoms that don’t 
affect younger people, and which meds are risky when used in combination 
with others. These pharmacists have CGP after their names, which stands for 
Certified Geriatric Pharmacist, a professional credential.
 
Many CGPs make regular visits to nursing homes and senior centers. If a CGP 
works in your community, you can make a private appointment for her to 
come to your home, review your meds, and, if necessary, discuss the results 
with your physician. CGPs typically charge a fee for this service — about $100 
an hour — but if you take multiple meds, you may find it money well spent. 
To find a CGP, go to www.ccgp.org/consumer/locate.htm and click your 
state, or go to www.seniorcarepharmacist.com and click “Find a Senior 
Care Pharmacist in Your Area.”
Qualifying for Medication Therapy Management programs
Part D plans are ideally placed to monitor the drugs their enrollees are taking 
because each plan has all (or most) of those drugs already logged into its 
computer system. Under the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, Part D plans 
are required to offer what is known as Medication Therapy Management 
(MTM) for a certain group of enrollees. These are people who have several 
chronic diseases and take multiple drugs that cost at least $4,000 a year.
You can’t choose to join an MTM program, but if your plan says you qualify 
and invites you to take part in one, consider doing so. The benefit doesn’t 
cost you anything — by law, you can’t be charged a fee. But know that what 

253
 Chapter 16: Bringing Down Your Drug Costs
the program actually does depends on the plan. At best, your plan may pro-
vide a face-to-face meeting or a telephone conversation with a pharmacist 
who can review your meds and suggest ways you can manage your health 
conditions more effectively. These may include recommendations for differ-
ent or fewer medications, other drugs that may suit you better, or lifestyle 
changes that can improve your health and make you less dependent on pills. 
Some plans’ MTM programs fall short of this kind of service. You may only 
get an automated phone call reminding you to fill a prescription, or printed 
materials that give only general advice about your medical condition. If your 
plan invites you to join an MTM program, it sends details of the services it 
provides.
MTM programs in Part D are still relatively new. Over time, however, many 
of them may become more comprehensive, offering a valuable service to 
enrollees who take multiple drugs.
Switching to less expensive drugs
The most dramatic way you can lower expenses is to switch to less expensive 
drugs that work equally well for your medical condition. If you’re like many 
people, you may hesitate to mention cost as a problem when the doctor is 
writing out a prescription. And you probably think that if it’s what the doctor 
ordered, then that drug must be the best one for you. Well, maybe it is. Or 
maybe another one is far less pricey but just as good.
The fact is that the newest brand-name drugs — often the ones that doctors 
prefer to prescribe — are almost always the most expensive. Sometimes 
hugely expensive. (The nearby sidebar “What were they thinking . . . when 
they made prescription drugs so expensive?” explains some of those reasons 
behind the costs.) But often you have two other options: generic drugs and 
older brand-name medicines.
Checking out generic drugs
A generic is an inexpensive copy of a brand-name drug. It can be sold only 
after the original brand has been on the market for a number of years and its 
patent — which grants exclusive marketing rights — has expired. Generics 
may look different; they may taste different. But before they can be sold, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must certify that generics contain 
the same active ingredients (the chemicals that work in your body to coun-
teract disease or improve your health) as the brand-name drugs that they’re 
copying — and that they’re as safe. They should work exactly the same way.

254
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
Do they? Millions of people take generics and experience no differences 
between them and the original brands. Some people, though, are convinced 
that generics don’t work so well for them. It’s hard to say whether this is a 
psychological reaction or a real physical effect. But human bodies are both 
complex and highly individual. If an identical drug can affect two people 
differently, then so can a brand-name drug and its generic version — even 
if the only actual distinctions between them are the non-active ingredients 
that provide a different color, texture, or taste. (And if these ingredients may 
affect your condition, your doctor will tell you.) The only way to find out 
whether a generic works for you is to try one — and to do so, perhaps, with 
the expectation that it will work as well for you.
What were they thinking . . . when they 
made prescription drugs so expensive?
When a pharmaceutical manufacturer brings 
out a new drug, it has exclusive rights under the 
patent laws to sell that drug without competi-
tion for a lengthy period, about 10 to 17 years. 
These laws allow the manufacturer to recoup 
the millions of dollars it has taken to research 
and develop the drug. While the patent pro-
tection lasts, the manufacturer tries to make 
as much money as possible from that drug — 
selling it at a high price, advertising it to con-
sumers extensively on television, and sending 
legions of salesmen along to doctors to per-
suade them to prescribe it. The largest-selling 
(and most heavily promoted) medicines earn 
billions of dollars.
In recent years, drug companies have been 
heavily criticized for the tactics they use to 
keep profits high — sweetening sales pitches 
to physicians with gifts and free lunches, 
spending millions of dollars lobbying Congress 
and state legislatures to pass bills that are 
favorable to the industry and ditch bills that 
aren’t, and doing everything they can to extend 
patent protections and keep generic copies off 
the market as long as possible. When the first 
generic version does eventually go on sale, its 
manufacturer also gets six months of exclusive 
sales, so the drug costs only a little less than the 
brand’s price. But after that, more manufactur-
ers produce generic versions and prices drop 
dramatically, often to less than 20 percent of the 
original brand price.
This market-based approach is unique to the 
United States, which has by far the highest drug 
prices in the world. Other Western governments 
regulate or negotiate drug prices in various 
ways to keep them affordable for consumers 
and taxpayers while allowing manufacturers 
a reasonable profit. In 2003, the American drug 
industry was successful in getting a clause 
written into the Medicare drug benefit law that 
specifically prohibits Medicare from negotiating 
Part D prices directly with the drug companies. 
(Instead, prices are negotiated by individual Part 
D insurers, who have far less bargaining power 
than Medicare.) Consumer advocates strongly 
opposed this ban, arguing that the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, also a federal agency, has 
long negotiated drug prices directly on behalf of 
the veterans heath service. Although Congress 
has passed several bills allowing direct nego-
tiation for Part D, none (at least at the time I’m 
writing this) have yet become law.

255
 Chapter 16: Bringing Down Your Drug Costs
Of course, not all of today’s brand-name drugs have generic equivalents. 
But over the last few years, a great many best-selling brands have lost their 
patent protection, and generics have surged onto the market. Generic 
versions of Tamoxifen (to treat breast cancer), Prozac (depression), Zocor 
(high cholesterol), and Norvasc (high blood pressure) — to name only a 
famous few — are available for a fraction of the cost of the originals. Many 
more will be developed in coming years.
Understanding what an “older” brand-name drug is
The newest and most heavily promoted drugs aren’t always brilliant innova-
tions that are unique in treating a particular medical condition. Most of them 
aren’t very different from brands that have been around for a number of 
years. Often, their only claim to “newness” is offering more convenience — a 
pill you can take once a day rather than three times a day, for example — or 
even slighter variations. In 2002, the FDA approved 78 new drugs for market 
but classified only 7 of them as improvements over older drugs.
So why do consumers spend so much on these “new” drugs that are no 
better than old ones? The answer, largely, is television. Drug companies 
spend millions of dollars advertising their latest product to persuade 
folks that this is the drug of choice. “Ask your doctor . . .,” they say. And if 
enough of us do, the drug becomes a blockbuster. A well-known example is 
Prilosec — remember “the purple pill” for heartburn? — which earned up 
to $6 billion a year until its patent expired in 2001. Its manufacturer then 
poured many more millions into advertising Nexium, a pill almost identical 
to Prilosec, except that it had a new patent and no generic competition. And 
many people bought Nexium, even after the FDA decided that Prilosec was 
safe enough to be sold without a prescription. Checking retail prices at a 
leading chain-store pharmacy, I found that a 30-day supply of 20 mg Nexium 
costs $168; generic Prilosec (omeprazole) costs $63; and over-the-counter 
Prilosec is just $20.
There’s another reason, besides cost, why older drugs may be a better bet 
than the latest ones out of the lab. They’ve been on the market for more 
years, and millions more people have used them. That means they have a 
longer track record showing how safe they are.
Determining how much you can save by switching
 
Just by using lower-price drugs, you stretch your Part D initial coverage, 
because the overall total cost of your drugs adds up to bring you closer to 
the doughnut hole. But you also reduce your co-pays. Generic medicines are 
almost always placed in the lowest tier of charges, often with co-pays under 
$10 for each prescription. A few plans charge nothing for generics. Older 
brand-name drugs often have lower co-pays too.
To see how this works, take a look at Table 16-1. It shows how one man (Jim) 
lowered his costs by well over a third and stayed out of the doughnut hole.

Here’s how Jim achieved these savings. The least expensive Part D plan that 
covers all of his usual medicines — four brand-names and one generic — in 
2008 was going to cost him $2,740 (including premiums totaling $282) over 
the whole year. It would also put him in the doughnut hole for the last four 
months — so in early September his out-of-pocket costs would jump from 
$174 a month to $337. But then Jim found generic versions for three out of 
four of his brand-name drugs. Under the same Part D plan, two generics 
would cost him $4 per prescription, rather than the $54 he’d pay for each 
brand, and the third would reduce the brand-name price by about 66 per-
cent. Over the year, he’d pay $774 and cut his monthly costs to $64.50. So 
Jim talked to his doctor, changed to the generics, avoided the gap, and saved 
nearly $2,000.
If Jim had been in a plan that charged coinsurance rather than co-pays, he’d 
still have saved money. In one such plan, the total cost of his generics and 
single brand-name drug comes to less than $1,900, well short of the $2,510 
that would put him in the gap. After a deductible of $275, his 25 percent 
coinsurance plus premiums would come to $66.10 each month from March 
through December, making his out-of-pocket cost $936 for the whole year.
 
When you’re considering generics, you can play savvy in another way too. 
Consider, for example, Prilosec, which is used to treat heartburn. Generic 
Prilosec (omeprazole), while costing far less than its brand-name version, 
still costs $63 a month at full price, three times as much as over-the-counter 
Prilosec ($20). However, if you’re in a Part D plan that charges, say, a $5 or $10 
co-pay, or even no co-pay at all for generics, you’d be better off paying for the 
generic through your plan, at least in the initial coverage period, than buying 
the OTC version at full price. On the other hand, if you fall into the doughnut 
hole and have to pay the full price of generic Prilosec through your plan, the 
OTC version may then be a better bet.

257
 Chapter 16: Bringing Down Your Drug Costs
Finding out more about lower-cost drugs
 
Your doctor is the best person to ask about whether a generic or older drug is 
available because ultimately, if there is, she’s going to be the one who decides 
whether it would work well for you. You’ll also want to discuss whether an 
older drug may have other side effects or require a different dosage than the 
brand you’re taking now. (You’ll also want to make sure the generic or older 
drug is on your plan’s formulary. If it’s not, the plan will charge you full price.)
Your pharmacist, too, can be a good source of information on which lower-
cost drugs are available. Or you can identify them by using the online 
Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder at www.medicare.gov, as explained 
in Chapter 10.
You can also do a bit of homework yourself by exploring the value of differ-
ent kinds of medicines that are used to treat your health problem. By “value” 
I mean which drugs are considered to provide the best clinical benefits in 
their class, according to head-to-head comparisons based on the best avail-
able scientific evidence. This kind of comparison is known as evidence-based 
research and was pioneered by the Drug Effectiveness Review Project at the 
Health and Sciences University in Portland, Oregon. Each review investigates 
the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of all drugs used for a single spe-
cific medical condition — such as high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, 
allergies, depression, and many more. The resulting reports are increasingly 
used by doctors and big drug payers, such as state Medicaid agencies, to 
determine which drugs are most worth the money. After all, if five drugs are 
equally effective, why choose the priciest?
 
The scientific reports are difficult for most folks to read — they’re long 
and technical — but the Consumers Union has translated its results into 
free, easy-to-read summaries that consumers can use to help them discuss 
medications with their doctors. You can find these summaries at www.
crbestbuydrugs.org.
Buying drugs by mail order
Most Part D plans offer a mail-order service and charge less for drugs pur-
chased this way. This option means ordering 90-day supplies at a time, so 
it works best for maintenance drugs — those that need to be taken regularly 
throughout the year. Part D plans don’t charge extra for postage and packing 
in delivering orders to your door.
 
Be careful, though, to check that your plan’s mail-order service will actually 
save you money. Some plans charge exactly the same for mail-order drugs as 
they do for drugs bought at pharmacies. And a few plans don’t cover certain 
drugs on their formularies under the mail-order option — which means the 
ones omitted cost far more, maybe even full price. You can call your plan to 

258
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
check price differences for your drugs under the two options. Or, if you use 
Medicare’s online plan finder at www.medicare.gov to see which plan will 
charge you the least for your drugs (as explained in Chapter 10), you can see 
this info at a glance.
But checking is worth it, because you may get lucky. Remember Jim, who I 
mention earlier in this chapter, saving a bundle by choosing more generic 
drugs and keeping himself out of the doughnut hole? He took it a step further 
and saved even more money, as you can see in Table 16-2. The plan he’s 
enrolled in charges nothing for generics bought from its mail-order service, 
so he pays only for his single brand-name drug plus the monthly premium, 
reducing his annual expenses by another $242. Lucky Jim indeed.

Shopping around for the best 
prices at local pharmacies
 
Prices for the same prescription drugs at local pharmacies can vary quite 
a lot, even within a plan’s network of pharmacies. That’s because the 
plan negotiates dispensing fees and other costs with each of these pharmacies 
and makes better deals with some than with others. (See Chapter 14 for 
the scoop.) This negotiating won’t affect you if you’re in the initial coverage 
period and paying flat co-pays for your prescriptions. But if you pay 
coinsurance — a percentage of the cost of your drugs — or are paying full 
price in the deductible phase or the coverage gap, then you can probably 
shave a few dollars here and there off your prescriptions by shopping around.
Your plan includes a list of its pharmacies in your area in the information 
packet it sends you upon enrollment (or it can supply another on request), 
or you can view it on the plan’s Web site. You can also check out price 
differences among local pharmacies on Medicare’s online plan finder at www.
medicare.gov, as explained in Chapter 10.

What about those pharmacies that sell selected generic drugs at low cost, 
sometimes for as little as $4 for a 30-day supply? These pharmacies — 
Wal-Mart, Target, Safeway, and Kroger, among others — offer these prices 
year-round to all of their customers. (In other words, they’re not temporary 
discounts.) If any of these pharmacies is in your plan’s network, you have the 
right under Medicare rules to buy a covered drug at the pharmacy’s asking 
price through your plan when you fill the prescription. The payments count 
toward your out-of-pocket limit, and you don’t have to send the receipts to 
your plan.
For example, say that your generic medicine costs $4 at the supermarket. 
If your plan’s co-pay for this drug is $6, you’d save $2 by paying the super-
market price. Similarly, if your plan’s full price for the drug is $10, and your 
usual share is 25 percent of the cost ($2.50), you’d pay 25 percent of the 
supermarket price ($1) instead of $2.50. And if you’re paying full cost in 
the deductible phase or the coverage gap, you pay $4 rather than $10. (Of 
course, if your plan normally charges nothing for generics, the supermarket 
price isn’t a deal.)
Lowering Drug Costs 
in the Coverage Gap
I’m going to assume you’ve done everything you can to stay out of the cover-
age gap by following the advice earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 15 — 
but here you are still, pitched right into it. Of course, any of the suggestions 
earlier in this chapter can also help lower your expenses in the gap. Even at 
full price, a generic drug, for example, is likely to ease the sucker punch to 
your wallet more than a brand-name one will. But for many people, generics 
aren’t yet an option. According to one government report, 37 percent of Part 
D prescriptions dispensed in the first half of 2006 had no generic versions. So 
the following sections offer some alternative ideas.
Low-cost drugs from manufacturers
Many drug-making companies run patient assistance programs that offer 
their own brands for free or at very low cost to people with incomes under 
a certain level and no prescription coverage. When Medicare Part D began, 
these companies stopped assistance to people enrolled in the programs. 
Later, however, a few large companies changed course and now offer the 
same help to folks with Medicare drug coverage under certain conditions. 
Here are the pros and cons of patient assistance programs:

260
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 Pros: This is a good way of lowering costs dramatically in the gap if you 
don’t qualify for Extra Help under Part D or for your state’s pharmacy 
assistance program — provided that one or more of your drugs is made 
by a company that gives this help and you meet its eligibility conditions.
 
 Cons: The value of these drugs doesn’t count toward the out-of-pocket 
limit that gets you out of the gap. The application process can be a 
hassle, and if each of your drugs is made by a different company, you 
may have to apply several times over. In some cases, this assistance is 
only temporary — maybe three months or so — or must be renewed 
through another application every year.
Each company has its own rules on eligibility for its program and how to 
apply. You’ll probably need your doctor’s recommendation. Your doctor 
or pharmacist may be able to tell you which of your drugs are covered by 
a manufacturer’s assistance program and may even have application forms 
handy. State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) offer help with 
applying (see Appendix B for contact info). So do some national associations 
and patient support groups that specialize in a particular health condition. 
The Web site www.pparx.org lists company assistance programs, the drugs 
they cover, their eligibility rules, and how to apply.
Low-cost drugs from abroad
Prescription drugs are often much less expensive abroad because, unlike 
the U.S., most other governments regulate prices. Millions of Americans have 
saved money this way by filling prescriptions by mail order through the 
Internet, especially from Canada, or by hopping across the border. Here are 
the pros and cons of buying low-cost drugs from abroad:
 
 Pros: When you’re paying full price in the gap (and you don’t expect 
to get out of it), this option is worth considering. Brand-name drugs 
from abroad can cost half as much as the same ones here. Generics are 
usually not less expensive, but in some cases, you can buy new generics 
that are approved for sale in their own countries but not yet available on 
the American market.
 
 Cons: The cost of drugs from abroad doesn’t count toward the out-of-
pocket limit that gets you out of the gap. Unless you take sensible pre-
cautions, you may fall victim to scams and counterfeits. It’s still illegal 
under American law to fill prescriptions this way. Nobody, however, has 
been prosecuted for importing drugs for their own personal use. Also, 
the recent falling value of the American dollar has made buying drugs 
from abroad less of a good deal than it has been in the past.

261
 Chapter 16: Bringing Down Your Drug Costs
 
The first rule of obtaining drugs from abroad is to be careful. The Internet is 
Wild West territory, full of scams for the unwary, and this is especially true 
of the trade in prescription drugs. So you’ll need to pick a licensed pharmacy 
that has a reputation for good, ethical service. To find out how to buy drugs 
from abroad safely, go to Appendix C.
Other options
When you’re in the doughnut hole and trying to make your expenses more 
manageable, every avenue is worth exploring. Depending on your circum-
stances, you may be able to get help to lower your costs in some of the fol-
lowing ways:
 
 State Pharmacy Assistance Programs (SPAPs): I cover the big SPAPs 
that provide coverage to wrap around the Part D drug benefit, depend-
ing on your income, in Chapter 15. But many other state programs pro-
vide help with prescription drugs — for example, discount programs 
or low-cost drugs for specific medical conditions. To find out whether 
your state has a program, and its details, go to www.medicarerights.
org/rxframeset.html. Or call your State Health Insurance Assistance 
Program (SHIP; see Appendix B for contact info).
 
 Free or low-cost clinics: Each state has clinics or health centers that 
provide health services, including prescription drugs in many cases, for 
which patients pay what they can afford. These services are supported 
by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration. For contact 
information in your state, go to ask.hrsa.gov/pc. Or call your state 
Department of Health or Area Agency on Aging. Look in the state pages 
of your phone book for contact info.
 
 AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs): These programs help people 
with HIV-AIDS pay for HIV-related medications. They operate in all 50 
states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. To qualify, your 
income must be below a certain level, which varies from state to state. If 
you’re in one of these programs as well as a Medicare drug plan, you can 
use ADAP assistance to pay for HIV drugs in the coverage gap, though 
the payments don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit. You can find 
details of each program at www.atdn.org/access/states. Or call the 
AIDS Treatment Data Network at 800-734-7104 for help and information.
 
 Certified charities and patient organizations: If your income is low but 
a bit too high to qualify for Extra Help (which I cover in Chapter 5), you 
may be able to get help paying for drugs in the gap through a charity 
or a patient support association that specializes in a specific medical 
condition. These payments do count toward your out-of-pocket limit. To 
find such assistance, go to www.benefitscheckuprx.org or call your 
State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) — see Appendix B for 
contact info.

262
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 Pharmacy discounts: Many pharmacies offer discounts on drugs, either 
temporarily or through discount cards. If you happen to see that a 
discounted price is less than the price you’re paying under your Part 
D plan in the deductible phase or in the coverage gap (in other words, 
when you’re paying full price), you have the right to buy the drug at the 
pharmacy’s cash price instead of using your plan’s card. Provided that 
you send the receipt to your plan, this payment counts toward your 
out-of-pocket limit. (It’s only counted, though, if the drug is covered by 
your plan and the pharmacy is in the plan’s network of pharmacies, as 
explained in Chapter 15.)
 
 Free samples from your doctor: If you have trouble paying for drugs in 
the gap, don’t be shy about asking your doctor for free samples, which 
most doctors receive from drug manufacturers. It’s one way the com-
panies persuade doctors to prescribe their products — most often the 
newest and most expensive ones. For this reason, the drug you need 
may not be in your doctor’s sample cupboard, but it’s worth asking.

Chapter 17
Switching to Another Plan
In This Chapter
 Changing plans during standard enrollment periods
 Knowing when you can switch plans outside of standard enrollment periods
 Dropping your plan — and being dropped
 Deciding whether to change to another plan for next year or stay with the one you have
A
fter you’re in a Part D plan, and all the hard work of choosing one and 
signing up for it is behind you, probably the last thing on your mind is 
changing to another plan. But it makes sense to know when you can switch 
plans if you want to or need to, when you can drop out of a plan (yeah, there 
are rules about this too), and whether you should compare plans all over again 
at the end of the year to see if you’d get a better deal with a different one.
You can switch plans during three time frames, depending on the plan you’re 
now in and your reasons for switching:
 
 November 15 to December 31 each year: This is when anybody in a 
Part D plan (a stand-alone drug plan or a Medicare health plan that 
includes drug coverage) can change plans for the following year.
 
 January 1 to March 31 each year: This is when you can change from 
traditional Medicare to a Medicare health plan, or the other way around; 
or you can change from one Medicare health plan to another — whether 
it provides drug coverage or not. However, you can’t change from one 
stand-alone drug plan to another. Also, you can’t use this period to drop 
or add drug coverage (if you haven’t already got it).
 
 Special enrollment periods: These are allowed at any time of the year, 
but only in certain circumstances. They come with time limits.
This chapter focuses mainly on switching Part D plans at certain times, 
according to the preceding situations. (For details about enrolling in a plan 
for the first time, go to Chapter 12.) I also explain the circumstances in which 
you can drop out of a plan — or be dropped by a plan. Finally, I cover the big 
end-of-year question — stay with the plan you have or switch to another? — 
and suggest points to keep in mind when you make that decision.

Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
Switching Part D Plans at Standard 
Enrollment Times
You can understand why Medicare doesn’t allow everybody to switch Part D 
plans any time they feel like it — that would be chaos. And you can under-
stand why Medicare allows special enrollment periods for special circum-
stances at any time of the year (I describe these special periods in detail later 
in this chapter). But why, oh why, does it have two open enrollment periods 
at different times? Wouldn’t it be simpler to have just one free-for-all once a 
year? Of course. But you’re stuck with two.
Table 17-1 lays out the possibilities for switching plans during the two 
standard time frames — eight possible combinations, depending on the 
health and drug coverage you have. (The shaded rows show options for 
people without drug coverage.) But it isn’t as complicated as it looks. Find 
your situation — the kind of plan you have now — in the left column, and 
then look across to see which type of plan you can switch to and at what 
time. In each situation, you have no more than two choices of plan types to 
switch to.

If you haven’t already signed up for Medicare prescription drug coverage, you 
can use the January 1 to March 31 enrollment period only to switch to another 
health plan that doesn’t cover prescription drugs. I mention this as a warning 
because I’ve heard of some people (who’d missed their previous deadlines for 
getting drug coverage) joining a Medicare Advantage health plan during this 
period without realizing it wouldn’t cover their drugs. So if you want drug cov-
erage, be sure to sign up at the right times — and if you join a Medicare health 
plan, always check that it actually covers prescription drugs.
After you figure out when you can switch to a new plan and what kind of plan 
you can switch to, all that’s left to do is enroll. In the following sections, I 
explain what you need to do to switch plans and the actions you can take if 
you change your mind about your newly chosen plan.
Enrolling in a new plan
 
When switching to a new Part D plan in either of the standard enrollment 
periods, all you have to do is enroll in it, following the process I describe in 
Chapter 12. You don’t have to disenroll from your present plan or even notify 
it. Your new enrollment is logged into Medicare’s computer system, and 
you’re automatically disenrolled from your previous plan as soon as your new 
coverage starts. If you enroll
 
 November 15 through December 31: Your old drug coverage finishes at 
midnight on December 31. Your new coverage starts January 1.
 
 January 1 through March 31: Your new drug coverage starts the first 
day of the month after you enroll — February 1 if you enroll in January; 
March 1 if you enroll in February; or April 1 if you enroll in March.

266
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
Figuring out how many times 
you can change your mind
What if you switch to another plan during one of the standard periods and 
then change your mind, either because you’ve found yet another plan you 
prefer, or because you decide you want to return to the plan you just 
switched out of? If the enrollment period hasn’t yet expired, these are your 
options:
 
 November 15 through December 31: Within this period, you can techni-
cally change Part D plans as often as you want. The last plan you enroll 
in by December 31 is the one you’ll have the following year. But be 
cautious of changing more than once — it can cause problems getting 
your information into the system, as described in Chapter 12.
 
 January 1 through March 31: You’re allowed to switch plans only once 
during this period, so you can’t change your mind, unless you qualify for 
a special enrollment period, as explained later in this chapter.
 
One exception is worth keeping in mind. Suppose you were in traditional 
Medicare and switched to a Medicare Advantage health plan in the January to 
March period and then regretted the change. You’ve already used up your 
single chance to switch. But if this is your first time ever in a Medicare health 
plan and you dropped a Medigap supplementary insurance policy when you 
joined the plan, you have the right to return to traditional Medicare and get 
back your Medigap policy at any time within 12 months of joining the plan, as 
explained in more detail later in this chapter.
Switching Plans during a Special 
Enrollment Period
Some people need to switch plans outside of the standard enrollment 
periods. So Medicare allows special enrollment periods (SEPs) in certain 
circumstances. You can use these at any time in the year, but most have 
specific time limits. You have to switch plans within this allotted time — 
otherwise, you lose your chance and must wait until the next standard 
enrollment period to change plans. In some situations, this lag can leave you 
without coverage for several months.
In the following sections, I explain a number of circumstances in which you 
can obtain an SEP to change plans. I also tell you how to apply for an SEP (if 
you need to apply) and how to ensure your records are transferred safely. 
But I don’t include SEPs granted for situations that are covered in other 
chapters. Flip to the appropriate chapter if you’re

267
 Chapter 17: Switching to Another Plan
 
 Enrolling in a Part D plan when first joining Medicare (see Chapter 12)
 
 Receiving Extra Help (see Chapter 5)
 
 Entering, leaving, or living in a nursing home (see Chapter 18)
 
 Joining or leaving a Special Needs Plan or a Program for All-Inclusive 
Care of the Elderly (see Chapter 18)
 
 Enrolling in Part D after returning from living abroad or being in prison 
(see Chapter 12)
 
 Joining or leaving Part D because of employment-related issues 
(see Chapter 6)
Knowing when you can use 
SEPs to change plans
Special enrollment periods cover a wide range of circumstances. The ones 
listed in the following sections are those you can use to switch plans. In each 
case, I explain the conditions for getting it, how long the SEP lasts, and when 
coverage in the new plan begins.
If you move permanently out of your plan’s service area
The time frame of your SEP for switching to another plan depends on when 
(and if) you notify your current plan of your move.
 
 If you tell your plan in advance, your SEP begins the month before your 
move and ends two months after the month of your move.
 
 If you tell your plan after you move, your SEP begins on the date you 
notify the plan and lasts for two months.
 
 If you don’t notify your plan of the move, your plan will disenroll you 
after six months. You then get an SEP that lasts two months.
In all of these cases, after switching to another plan, you can choose when 
your new coverage will begin — either on the first day of the month after 
enrolling in the new plan or up to three months afterward.
 
Even if the company that sponsors your old plan (whether a Medicare health 
plan or a stand-alone drug plan) offers the same or other plans in your new 
home area, you have the right to switch to a different one if new plans are 
available to you there. (But if you’re in a stand-alone drug plan that serves an 
entire state, and you move to a new house within the state, your coverage will 
continue and you won’t be entitled to an SEP.)

268
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
If you’re in a Medicare private health plan and 
want to change to traditional Medicare
This SEP is available only if both of the following conditions are met:
 
 You joined this Medicare health plan during your initial enrollment 
period when you first became eligible for Medicare at age 65.
 
 This is your first year in the same plan.
If these two conditions apply to you, you have the right to switch to tradi-
tional Medicare (and a stand-alone drug plan) at any time within 12 months 
from the time your coverage in the plan started. You also have a guaranteed 
right to buy Medigap supplementary insurance, but you must apply for it no 
later than 63 days after your coverage in the health plan ends.
If you dropped a Medigap policy to enroll in a Medicare private health 
plan for the first time
This SEP gives you a one-time guaranteed right to buy another Medigap sup-
plementary insurance policy and switch back to traditional Medicare if
 
 You’ve been enrolled in this health plan for less than a year; and
 
 This is the first Medicare health plan that you’ve ever been in
 
 You can’t obtain this SEP if you were enrolled in a Medicare health plan 
before, no matter how many years ago; see the later section “If you’re 
considering a switch to a Medicare private health plan.”
If these two conditions apply to you, you have the right to be reinstated in 
the same Medigap policy you had before joining the Medicare health plan 
(or, if it’s no longer being sold, a policy from another insurer) at any time 
during your 12-month “trial period” with the health plan. You can use this 
SEP to disenroll from the plan and re-enroll in traditional Medicare, and you 
can also use it to enroll in a stand-alone drug plan. Your new coverage begins 
the first day of the month after you enroll. You can apply for the Medigap 
policy up to 60 days before, and no later than 63 days after, your plan 
coverage ends.
If your plan violates its contract with you
This SEP allows you to disenroll from your plan if it has broken its contract in 
some way — for example, it failed to provide promised benefits in a timely 
manner or in keeping with Medicare’s quality requirements, or it gave you 
erroneous information that led you to enroll in the plan.
You must apply to Medicare for this kind of SEP, as I explain later in this 
chapter. If Medicare determines that a violation has occurred, the SEP will 
begin when Medicare notifies you. You can then disenroll from the plan and 
enroll in another or switch to traditional Medicare. If you don’t immediately 

269
 Chapter 17: Switching to Another Plan
choose a new plan, your SEP lasts for 90 days after you disenrolled from your 
present plan. Your new coverage starts the first day of the month after you 
enrolled.
If you were tricked or misled into joining 
a Medicare private health plan
This SEP allows you to switch out of a plan that you joined based on mislead-
ing or incomplete information of the kind covered in Chapter 11. You must 
apply to Medicare for this SEP, as I explain later in this chapter, and your 
case will be investigated. If Medicare determines that your claim is valid, you 
can immediately disenroll from the plan. You can choose to join another 
Medicare health plan or to switch to traditional Medicare and join a stand-
alone drug plan. (In this case you also have a guaranteed right to buy a 
Medigap supplementary policy, regardless of when you joined the plan that 
misled you, as long as you apply for a policy no later than 63 days after your 
plan coverage ends.)
Your new coverage begins the first of the month after you enroll. But in 
certain circumstances — for example, if you incurred costs that your old plan 
wouldn’t pay for — you can ask for retroactive (backdated) enrollment so that 
Medicare can cover those bills (see Chapter 11).
If a federal employee made a mistake when processing 
your enrollment or disenrollment in a plan
This SEP allows you to join or switch out of a Part D plan after an error has 
been made. It begins the month Medicare approves the SEP and continues for 
two more months.
If your plan withdraws from your service area, doesn’t 
renew its contract with Medicare, or is closed down
An SEP is given in each case, but the allowed periods for switching to another 
plan vary according to the situation. Medicare, your plan, or both will send 
you a letter that explains the circumstances, tells you how long your cover-
age will continue, and details when you can switch to another plan.
If you’re enrolled in a qualified State Pharmacy Assistance Program
This SEP allows you to change from one Part D plan to another at any time of 
the year but only once a year. Your coverage begins the first day after the 
month you enroll in a new plan.
 
Before making a switch, contact your State Pharmacy Assistance Program 
(SPAP) for information because you’d need a plan that works with your SPAP 
coverage. If your SPAP automatically enrolled you in your current plan, 
you can’t get an SEP to change plans. (I cover SPAPs and which ones are 
“qualified” in Chapter 6.)

270
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
You also get an SEP if you lose your eligibility to be in an SPAP. This SEP 
begins the month you lose eligibility and lasts for two months afterward.
If you have any other exceptional circumstances
 
If none of the situations listed previously apply to you, you have the right to 
ask Medicare to allow an SEP based on your own “exceptional” situation. From 
time to time, Medicare introduces new SEPs, sometimes because a consumer 
draws its attention to an exception circumstance for which an SEP hadn’t 
existed before.
Applying for an SEP
You don’t need to apply for most SEPs. Just go ahead and enroll in a new plan 
of your choice. It’s the new plan’s responsibility to confirm that you’re enti-
tled to an SEP. You’ll receive an enrollment form asking for information, just 
the same as for any enrollment (see Chapter 12). If your enrollment is 
accepted, it means the SEP has been granted. If the enrollment is denied, 
you’ll get a notice explaining why, as explained in Chapter 13.
 
You need to apply for an SEP if the reason for wanting one is that your plan 
violated your contract or you believe you were misled into joining the plan, 
as explained earlier in this chapter. Call Medicare at 800-633-4227, explain the 
situation, and say you want to apply for a special enrollment period to change 
to a new plan. Medicare will investigate and decide whether to allow an SEP.
Making sure your records are transferred
 
When you use an SEP to change plans during the year, the record of your 
drug usage and payments to date (from the beginning of the year) should be 
automatically transferred from your old plan to the new one.
It’s very important that this is done, because your records show
 
 The total cost of the drugs you’ve used since the beginning of the year, 
which determines your coverage level
 
 Your total out-of-pocket expenses since the beginning of the year, which 
count toward the limit that ends the doughnut hole (if you fall into it)
 
 How much of the deductible you’ve paid (if there’s a deductible)
 
 How the deductible is transferred depends on whether the old and new 
plans have deductibles and the costs of the drugs you’ve used since the 
beginning of the year. These are possibilities:

271
 Chapter 17: Switching to Another Plan
 
• If your old plan had a deductible and you’ve already met it, you 
can’t be asked to pay a deductible under your new plan. For 
example, Plan X has a deductible of $295, and your total drug costs 
so far this year come to $350, so you’ve met your deductible and 
started receiving coverage. When you join Plan Y, which also has a 
$295 deductible, you don’t pay this amount but receive coverage at 
once.
 
• If your old plan had no deductible, but your new one does, you 
must meet this deductible before receiving coverage. For exam-
ple, Plan X has no deductible, and you’ve received coverage for 
$250 worth of drugs (what you and your plan have paid) so far this 
year. But Plan Y has a deductible of $295. So you must pay a bal-
ance of $45 ($295 – $250) in Plan Y before coverage begins.
 
• If your old plan had a deductible and you haven’t yet met it, it 
depends on whether the new plan has a deductible. For example, 
Plan X has a deductible of $295, but your total drug costs so 
far this year come to $100. Plan Y has a lower deductible of $200. 
Because you haven’t met your deductible in Plan X, you must 
pay the difference in Plan Y ($200 – $100 = $100). But if Plan Y 
has no deductible, you pay no more and your coverage starts 
immediately.
 
Medicare requires the old plan to transfer your payments record to the new 
plan within seven days of your coverage ending in the old plan. Still, checking 
is wise. When you receive the first Explanation of Benefits statement from 
your new plan, compare it with the last EOB from your old plan to ensure that 
your record has been transferred and that it correctly reflects the phase of 
coverage you’re in — the deductible, initial coverage period, coverage gap, or 
catastrophic coverage. If you’ve mislaid your last EOB, ask the old plan for a 
copy. If you think that the info hasn’t been transferred correctly, call Medicare 
at 800-633-4227 and file a complaint.
Dropping a Plan without Joining 
Another (Or Being Dropped)
Most people are allowed to drop out of a Part D plan voluntarily only during 
the standard enrollment periods or during some of the special enrollment 
periods specified earlier in this chapter. Clearly, if you switch plans, then 
technically you’re disenrolling from the old one and enrolling in the new 
one — even if disenrollment is automatic as soon as you join another 
plan — and that’s why the two actions are usually bundled together in 
Medicare’s eyes.

272
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
But there may be circumstances in which you need to drop out of a Part D 
plan without joining another. And in a few situations, your plan can drop 
you. This section considers both scenarios. I also cover a special situation in 
which you may or may not be dropped — being late with your premium 
payments — and explain what to do if you’ve been disenrolled from your 
plan unfairly.
Being a plan dropout
You can get a special enrollment period to drop out of a Part D plan without 
joining another in the following circumstances.
If you move to a new job that has health benefits
You may need to drop out of a Part D plan if you take a new job that comes 
with health benefits and drug coverage. Here’s what to do:
 
 Find out from your new employer’s benefits office whether your new 
drug coverage is creditable. (Creditable means at least of equal value to 
Medicare drug coverage, as explained in Chapter 6.) If it’s not, you need 
to ask whether keeping your present Part D plan could disqualify you 
from receiving health coverage from your employer. (I cover this possi-
bility in detail, too, in Chapter 6.)
 
 Call or write to your current Part D plan, explain the situation, and ask 
to be disenrolled. You’ll need to coordinate the date when your Part D 
coverage ends with the date when your new coverage begins.
 
 Your new employer’s benefits office may make these arrangements for 
you — if so, it’ll tell you.
If you become eligible for TriCare or VA drug coverage
You can get an SEP to drop out of your current plan if you start qualifying for 
military or veterans’ benefits under the TriCare or Veterans Affairs programs. 
I describe benefits under these programs in Chapter 6.
If you move out of the United States
 
From your plan’s point of view, going to live abroad just means that you’re 
moving out of its service area. So the SEP is the same as if you were just 
moving somewhere else within the U.S., as explained in the earlier section “If 
you move permanently out of your plan’s service area.” But in this case, you 
won’t be joining a new plan because Part D won’t cover you when abroad. 
When you return to live permanently in the U.S., you can apply for another 
SEP to enroll in a Part D plan again, as explained in Chapter 8.

273
 Chapter 17: Switching to Another Plan
If you decide you just want out of Part D
You do not get a special enrollment period for this purpose. You’re expected 
to wait until the November 15 to December 31 open enrollment period to do 
that. However, if you get an SEP to disenroll from a plan — for example, if 
you’re moving out of its service area — there’s no obligation to sign up for 
another plan. Similarly, there’s no obligation to sign up for another plan if 
you come to the end of the year and decide not to re-enroll. In this case, you 
need to deliberately request disenrollment from the plan — otherwise, your 
enrollment automatically continues the following year. And, of course, there’s 
no obligation to re-enroll if you stop paying premiums and get disenrolled by 
your plan.
 
If you drop out of a plan and don’t enroll in another, Medicare will probably 
send a letter warning that going without drug coverage would mean incurring 
a late penalty if you decide to enroll again in Part D in the future. But what you 
really need to think about — beyond the threat of a late penalty — is what it 
could mean to be without coverage for even a few months. Regardless of your 
reasons for dropping out of Part D, you may want to take a look at Chapter 7, 
which explains the implications of going without drug coverage.
Being dropped by your plan
 
A plan must disenroll you in any of these circumstances:
 
 You move permanently out of its service area. If you don’t let the plan 
know you’ve moved, it will eventually find out from Medicare or from 
returned mail. The plan must try to confirm that the move is permanent, 
but if it can’t contact you within six months, or receives no response, it 
must then disenroll you. (But if it confirms that your move is only tem-
porary, it must continue your coverage.)
 
 You are imprisoned. The plan must disenroll you (because you can’t be 
enrolled in Part D when incarcerated) after confirming the situation from 
public records.
 
 You lose your eligibility for Medicare. This can happen in these spe-
cific circumstances:
 
• Your eligibility for Medicare is based on disability (including blind-
ness or end-stage renal disease), but your disability ceases.
 
• You have Part A (hospital insurance) only because you’re buying it 
(as explained in Chapter 1). But you must also be enrolled in Part B 
(doctors’ and outpatient services) to qualify. So if you stop paying 
either Part A or Part B premiums (or notify Social Security that you 
no longer want this coverage) your eligibility for Medicare (and 
Part D) ends.

274
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 You misrepresented other coverage you have. If the plan receives 
evidence that you intentionally withheld or falsified information about 
coverage you have from elsewhere (such as an employer) — in other 
words, double-dipping — it must disenroll you, but only with Medicare’s 
approval. Your coverage stops on the first day of the month after you’re 
notified of the disenrollment.
 
 You die. At this point, you’re done worrying about Part D! But for the 
benefit of family members: They can inform the plan, but it won’t act 
until it’s received an official death notification from the Social Security 
Administration via Medicare. Disenrollment takes effect on the last day 
of the month of the death. The plan must refund any premiums paid 
beyond that date.
 
A plan can (at its discretion) drop you in these circumstances:
 
 You don’t pay your premiums in a timely manner. Because so many 
circumstances affect whether you’re dropped from a plan when you’re 
late with premium payments, I cover this possibility in more detail in the 
next section.
 
 You “engage in disruptive behavior.” Medicare doesn’t define exactly 
what this phrase means, except to describe it as behavior that “substan-
tially impairs” the plan’s ability to provide services to you or any other 
of its members. The plan can’t drop you for this reason without first 
trying to resolve the problem, submitting thorough documentation to 
Medicare, and receiving Medicare’s approval to disenroll you. The plan 
must also notify you of your right to appeal the decision (see Chapter 19 
for details on appeals). Depending on the situation, Medicare may also 
grant a special enrollment period for you to switch to another plan with-
out loss of coverage.
 
 You allow someone else to use your plan card to obtain services or 
prescription drugs, or the information on your enrollment form was 
fraudulent. The plan can terminate your coverage the first day of the 
month after it notifies you of disenrollment. The plan must inform 
Medicare, which will investigate the fraud.
A special case: Knowing what can happen 
when you don’t pay your premiums
If you stop paying your premiums, or get behind with them, what happens 
next depends on your plan’s policy. Under Medicare rules, your plan can 
choose to do any of the following:
 
 Nothing — in other words, allow your coverage to continue
 
 Disenroll you after giving you a grace period and notice

275
 Chapter 17: Switching to Another Plan
 
 Send you a letter inviting you to contact the plan if you receive Medicaid 
and/or Extra Help and are having difficulty paying the premium
Understanding when a plan can’t disenroll you
 
There are two situations in which you can’t be disenrolled from your plan for 
not paying premiums, regardless of its policy:
 
 If you’ve asked for premiums to be paid out of your Social Security 
check: The plan must work with Medicare to investigate why Social 
Security hasn’t deducted the premiums or, if it has, why the plan hasn’t 
received them. Whatever the reason, the plan can’t disenroll you while 
you’re considered to be in a state of premium withhold — that is, your 
premiums are being taken out of your Social Security check or you’ve 
asked for them to be deducted automatically in this way. Only if you 
change to being billed directly for your premiums can the plan ask you 
to pay the premiums and, if necessary, disenroll you if you don’t pay.
 
 If your full premium is paid by a State Pharmacy Assistance Program 
(SPAP) or another sponsor: The plan must work with the SPAP or the 
sponsor (such as an employer or union that pays Part D premiums) to 
receive the premiums.
Receiving a warning of disenrollment and a grace period
 
Part D plans can’t stop anybody’s coverage without warning. A plan must first 
send proper notice of its intent to disenroll you and inform you of its grace 
period — a length of time that gives you the opportunity to pay the overdue 
premium(s).
The grace period must be at least one calendar month — though plans may 
choose to give longer periods, such as two or three months. The grace 
period begins on the first day of the month for which a premium is unpaid. 
Plans also have two options on how to deal with disenrollment after a grace 
period ends:
 
 Single grace periods: If one or more overdue premiums haven’t been 
paid in full during the grace period, the plan can terminate coverage at 
the end of that period.
 
 For example, Harry is in a plan with a two-month grace period. He fails 
to pay a premium due June 1, ignores the warning notice from the plan, 
and fails to pay the next premium too. His grace period is June and July. 
Because he doesn’t pay the two premiums he owes by July 31, his cover-
age stops on August 1. (If he pays only one of the premiums by July 31, 
his coverage still stops on August 1. If he pays both premiums by that 
date, his coverage continues.)
 
 “Rollover” grace periods: These are more flexible arrangements that 
a plan can choose to provide. If more than one premium is owed, but 
you pay one premium during the grace period, this grace period stops, 

276
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
and the plan sends notice of a new grace period. This process continues 
until either you pay off all the owed premiums in full or you fail to 
make any payment during a grace period, at which time the plan can dis-
enroll you.
 
 For example, Maureen is in a plan with a two-month rollover grace 
period. She fails to pay a premium due June 1 and ignores the warning 
notice from her plan. Her grace period is June and July. In July she pays 
the June premium, but not the one for July. She gets another warning 
notice and another grace period for July and August. In August, she pays 
the July premium, but not the one for August. Her next grace period is 
August and September. Despite warning notices, she doesn’t make a 
payment during this time, so her coverage stops on October 1. (If she 
pays for one premium during this time, her coverage and the rollover 
grace periods continue. If she pays both overdue premiums during this 
time, she’s no longer in default and her coverage continues intact.)
Your plan’s policy on disenrollment for not paying premiums and on grace 
periods must be clearly set out in your Evidence of Coverage. The plan is also 
required to inform you of these policies in its warning letters. If your grace 
period expires, the plan must send you a letter saying it’s disenrolling you 
and giving the date when your coverage will end. The plan has the right to 
take action to recover the premiums you haven’t paid — and/or the right not 
to re-enroll you until you’ve paid all premiums that you owe.
 
If you’re disenrolled from a Part D plan because you haven’t paid your 
premiums, you can re-enroll (or enroll in another plan) only during the 
November 15 to December 31 enrollment period. So you may go without 
drug coverage for several months, which may incur a late penalty (as 
explained in Chapter 8) when you sign up again.
 
If you and your spouse are enrolled in the same plan and pay your premiums 
by check, it’s best to send separate checks for each monthly premium or, if 
you send a single check, clearly indicate on it that the payment covers both 
premiums. Otherwise, one of you may be mistakenly disenrolled.
Taking action if you’ve been 
disenrolled unfairly
Mistakes happen. Here are some examples:
 
 They thought you were dead, and you’re not! This happens a bit more 
often than you’d think. It’s most often due to an error in the Social 
Security files — in which case, your Social Security check has likely 
stopped arriving, too. Sometimes it’s an error in Medicare’s records.
 
 They thought you lost your entitlement to Medicare, and you haven’t. 
Again, this can be due to an error in the official files.

277
 Chapter 17: Switching to Another Plan
 
 They thought you’d moved away from your home area, and you 
haven’t. This may happen if you spend part of the year away from home, 
even if you’re enrolled in a Part D plan at your permanent address and 
have a plan that allows you to fill prescriptions at in-network pharma-
cies anywhere in the country. This is a mistake made by your plan.
 
 They disenrolled you by mistake. Computer systems can throw up 
wrong information in a number of situations, due to entry errors or time 
lags. For example, if you enroll in another plan during the November–
December open enrollment period, and then change your mind and re-
enroll in your old plan — and you do so, as allowed, before the end of 
that period — you shouldn’t be dropped from the old plan. If you are 
dropped, it’s a mistake.
 
If you think you’ve been dropped from your plan unfairly, call Medicare at 800-
633-4227 and say that you want to challenge the disenrollment. Medicare will 
investigate the situation. You should also call the plan and say that you want 
to remain enrolled. The plan must then tell you in writing that you should con-
tinue to use its services while your case is being investigated. If Medicare 
approves your challenge, your enrollment will be reinstated and backdated to 
the time you were dropped, so your coverage is unbroken. If you had to pay 
out of pocket for any services (such as filling prescriptions) in the meantime, 
the plan must reimburse you.
Conducting a Yearly Plan Review to 
Decide Whether to Stay or Switch
November. Time for raking leaves, travel plans, and turkey. It’s a busy month 
as America prepares the pumpkin pies and gets ready for other holidays 
looming beyond the bustle of Thanksgiving. As if you didn’t have enough to 
do, November is also the time when another pressing question arises: Should 
you stay with your current Part D plan next year, or should you switch?
 
Open enrollment from November 15 to December 31 allows everybody in Part 
D the opportunity to switch plans for the following year. But most people, in 
fact, don’t even consider it. Well, I’m going to push against that trend — not to 
persuade you to switch, but to recommend that you look carefully at the 
changes your plan will make in its costs and benefits for next year and then 
compare them with what other plans are offering. Why do I want you to go to 
this trouble? Because the plan that works best for you this year won’t necessarily 
be your best deal next year.
If you decide not to change plans, you don’t have to do anything — you’ll 
simply be re-enrolled automatically in your current plan for next year. But 
it’s in your interests to arrive at that decision after you’ve considered the 
alternatives and not just because doing nothing seems the easiest option.

278
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
In the following sections, I explain how your plan can change and how you’ll 
know about those changes, why it’s worth shopping around to see what 
other plans are offering next year, and factors to bear in mind if you consider 
making a switch.
Reading your Annual Notice of Change 
to understand plan alterations
 
Almost every plan makes some changes for the new year. So the costs and 
benefits in place on December 31 may well be different on January 1. Here are 
the changes that could, though not necessarily will, occur:
 
 The plan may not be there next year. Plans sometimes withdraw from 
certain service areas, don’t renew their contracts with Medicare, or, 
occasionally, go out of business or are terminated by Medicare.
 
 The insurance company that sponsors the plan may not offer this 
particular plan next year, but offers one or more different plans instead.
 
 The plan may alter its benefit design next year. For example, it may 
cease or start offering coverage in the doughnut hole (see Chapter 15), 
or it may change the structure of its tiers of charges for different drugs.
 
 The plan may change the amount it charges for premiums, deductibles, 
and co-pays — or switch drugs to different tiers so the co-pays change.
 
 The plan may alter its formulary (the list of drugs it covers) by dropping 
some drugs or adding others.
 
 The plan may change the restrictions it places on some drugs (prior 
authorization, quantity limits, and step therapy; see Chapter 4) by lifting 
them from some drugs and imposing them on others.
How will you know if any of these changes will affect you? In the case of the 
first possibility — that your plan won’t exist next year — the plan (or maybe 
Medicare) will notify you in good time. And in that case, you’ll have to enroll 
in another plan to continue coverage. For other changes, the plan must send 
you details in a document called the Annual Notice of Change (ANOC). It’s 
arguably the most important mailing you’ll receive from your Part D plan 
each year, and you should definitely read it. (See the nearby sidebar to find 
out what happened to someone who didn’t read it.)
 
The plan must ensure that you get your ANOC no later than October 31. If 
you’re new to Medicare and, for that reason, enroll in a Part D plan for the first 
time between October 31 and November 30 during your initial enrollment 
period, the plan must send the ANOC together with its Explanation of Benefits 
in its enrollment packet. If you don’t receive an ANOC by the right date, call 
your plan and ask for it.

279
 Chapter 17: Switching to Another Plan
Comparing plans — yes, all over again!
 
I can hear the groans. No, no, not again! Of course, it’s your choice to go to 
the trouble of comparing Part D plans this year and every year. But in my 
opinion — and, actually, all consumer advocates agree on this — shopping 
around is well worth it. Here’s why:
 
 It’s not just your plan that may change its costs and benefits — so will all 
the others. A plan you decided against last year may offer a better deal 
next year — for example, a reduced premium, lower co-pays, fewer 
restrictions, or even better coverage in the doughnut hole.
 
 If most plans in your area change their costs, this may alter the equation 
of which plan will charge you least overall. As I emphasize in Chapter 10, 
the specific drugs you use determine your out-of-pocket expenses in any 
plan. Only running the numbers again will show which plan offers you 
the best deal next year.
 
 Your personal set of drugs may have changed during the past year. That 
too alters the equation of which plan offers the best deal next year.
 
 If you don’t take any drugs and have opted for the plan with the lowest 
premium (as suggested in Chapter 7), check whether your current plan 
or another will have the lowest premium next year.
 
 If you compare plans and decide to stay with the one you have, you’ll 
have the reassurance of knowing that it’s still the best one for you.
Beware of ignoring your Annual Notice of Change
It’s really important to read the ANOC! Here are 
two examples of what happened to someone 
who didn’t and someone who did:
  Suzie didn’t read her ANOC and stayed with 
the same plan. The full impact didn’t sink in 
until the following summer, and then she 
e-mailed me, very steamed. “I deliberately 
chose this plan because it covered me in 
the doughnut hole,” she wrote. “Now I’m in 
it, and they won’t pay. I feel I’ve been 
tricked!” When I explained that her plan’s 
benefit design had changed at the begin-
ning of the year — no longer giving gap 
coverage — and that the ANOC she’d 
received the previous October warned her 
of the changes, Suzie fessed up that she 
hadn’t read it. “I won’t make that mistake 
again,” she said.
  Thomas began flipping through his ANOC 
without much interest, but then did a double-
take when he saw that his plan’s premium 
would be raised by $15 a month the follow-
ing year. That made him look more closely at 
the whole document. He found the co-pays 
for two of his brand-name drugs would also 
go up, from $52 to $60 a month. So Thomas 
used Medicare’s online plan finder to find 
out what he’d pay out of pocket for other 
Part D plans in the coming year, and 
switched to the one he felt would give him 
the best deal.

280
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
I’ll throw in another reason why comparing plans every year is worthwhile if 
you use the online Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder. The more often 
you do it, the easier it gets. After you have the routine down, it may take only 
a few minutes to decide that your current plan is still the one for you or that 
another is better.
Convinced? If so, turn to Chapter 10 for a step-by-step guide to comparing 
Part D plans online, or for other ways of getting the same information.
Making your decision
If you’re reading this section, I’m assuming that you’ve compared plan offer-
ings for next year and are considering one or two alternatives to your current 
drug plan. Chapter 10 offers several suggestions for making a final choice 
among a shortlist of options — for example, checking convenient pharma-
cies, evaluating customer service, and being able to get prescriptions filled 
when you’re away from home — which all apply here, too. But when you’re 
deciding whether to switch plans, rather than choosing one for the first time, 
you need to consider a couple other points.
If you’ve won exceptions from your current plan
Did your current plan grant you an exception by covering a drug that isn’t on 
its formulary? Or waive a restriction for any of your drugs because your 
doctor convinced the plan that it was necessary for your health, without the 
need for prior authorization quantity limits, or step therapy? If so, you need 
to find out whether your plan will allow these same exceptions to carry over 
into next year. Some plans do. Others may require you to apply for them 
again in the new year. The plan’s ANOC should clearly say what its policy is 
on this point. If it doesn’t, call the plan and ask for it in writing.
 
Of course, if your plan allows your exceptions to be carried over, that would 
save you hassle and be a big factor in deciding to stay with this plan next year. 
If it doesn’t, you have nothing to lose by changing to another plan. But in con-
sidering another plan, be sure to check its restrictions. They may be imposed 
on the same drugs — or on different ones you take.
If you’re considering a switch to a Medicare private health plan
If you’re thinking of switching from traditional Medicare and a stand-alone 
drug plan to a Medicare Advantage plan, you need to compare its medical 
costs and benefits as well as its drug coverage (see Chapter 9).
What about your Medigap supplementary insurance policy, if you have one? 
When you’ve dropped Medigap insurance to join a Medicare heath plan for 
the first time, your first 12 months in the plan is regarded as a trial period. 
During this time, you can get a special enrollment period to switch back to 

281
 Chapter 17: Switching to Another Plan
traditional Medicare and buy a Medigap policy with the same company, on 
the same terms you had before. Otherwise, you can still buy a new policy, 
but it will likely cost more than your previous one. Here are some examples:
 
 Erica turned 65 in 2005, enrolled in traditional Medicare, and bought a 
Medigap policy. But in 2007, she joined a Medicare private health plan 
and gave up her Medigap insurance. After several months, she decided 
this was a mistake. Because she’d been in the health plan only a year — 
and because this was the only one she’d ever been enrolled in — she got 
back her Medigap insurance with the same company, on the same terms 
she had before.
 
 When he turned 65 in 1996, Enrico signed up for traditional Medicare 
and bought a Medigap policy. In 1999, he joined a Medicare health plan 
and gave up his Medigap. But at the end of the year, the plan stopped 
doing business in his area and he had to return to traditional Medicare. 
Because he’d been in the plan only a year, he was able to get back his 
Medigap policy on the same terms. In 2006, Enrico decided to try a 
health plan again. But this time he wasn’t happy with it and returned to 
traditional Medicare for 2007. Because he’d been enrolled in a Medicare 
health plan back in 1999, he wasn’t able to get back his old Medigap 
policy on the same terms. He took out a new policy, but because he was 
older now with more health problems, it cost him more.

Staying in Long-Term Care 
(Or Helping Someone Who Is)
In This Chapter
 Making sure your Part D coverage works in a nursing home
 Changing Part D plans if you need to
 Finding sources of help
T
he phrase long-term care covers several different living situations. It 
includes everything from staying in a nursing home through being in vari-
ous kinds of assisted living facilities (where people can live independently 
but with access to support services) to living at home with support from 
personal caregivers and community services.
In most of these situations, the rules for Medicare Part D drug coverage are 
no different than those described in the rest of this book. But this chapter 
focuses on some special protections and rights — and things to consider — 
in regard to Part D for people in two types of long-term care. If one of the fol-
lowing situations applies to you, then you can’t afford to skip this chapter:
 
 You’re living temporarily or permanently in a nursing home or another 
institutional setting (such as a rehabilitation hospital or unit, long-term 
care hospital, or psychiatric hospital or unit) that offers round-the-clock 
nursing care and help with daily activities.
 
 You’re staying in a skilled nursing facility (which may be located in a 
nursing home or a hospital) for needed care after an illness or injury.
 
For all these situations, I use the term nursing home throughout this chapter. 
And I need to define another term here, too. That term is you. In this chapter I 
address “you” (the patient), while understanding that many people going into 
nursing homes are too frail or sick to be able to cope with Part D issues. So 
when I say “you,” I expect that, in many cases, you (the reader) will actually be 
a family member, friend, or other personal caregiver helping a patient who’s in 
a nursing home.

284
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
In this chapter, I explain special Part D rules and rights that apply to people 
in nursing homes when paying for prescriptions or changing plans. I describe 
a special kind of Medicare health plan that focuses on the needs of people in 
nursing homes, and another Medicare program that provides comprehensive 
care designed to keep people out of nursing homes for as long as possible. 
Finally, I suggest sources of help.
Reviewing Your Drug Coverage When 
You Enter a Nursing Home
When you first go into a nursing home, it’s likely that the last thing on your 
mind (or your caregiver’s) is whether you need to do anything about your 
Part D plan. You have too many other practical and perhaps emotional issues 
to think about. And if you’re already in a plan, why worry?
Well, you need to consider a few points about Part D, even at this difficult 
time. In the following sections, I explain why you need to find out how your 
meds are covered in the nursing home and why, in some circumstances, it 
may be wise or even necessary to change from your current Part D plan to 
another.
Understanding how your 
drugs will be covered
In most cases, while you’re in a nursing home, your meds are covered under 
the usual conditions of your Medicare Part D plan (or under any alternative 
drug coverage you have, such as an employer or union health insurance plan; 
see Chapter 6 for details about different types of drug coverage). The follow-
ing sections note three exceptions.
If you receive the Medicare skilled nursing facility benefit
If you’re receiving the Medicare skilled nursing facility benefit, your prescrip-
tion drugs are covered under Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) for a cer-
tain amount of time, and your Part D plan isn’t involved.
 
Many people don’t realize that Medicare does not usually cover what the 
agency calls custodial care in a nursing home. That means room and board, 
nursing care, and help with daily living activities. But the Medicare skilled 
nursing facility (SNF) benefit is an exception. To qualify, you need to be 
enrolled in Medicare Part A. You must also have spent at least three days as 
an inpatient in a hospital and need skilled care for nursing and rehabilitation 
services related to the illness or injury that put you into the hospital. A 

285
 Chapter 18: Staying in Long-Term Care (Or Helping Someone Who Is)
physician must refer you for SNF care under this benefit and certify that you 
need it as a matter of medical necessity. For example, a need for intravenous 
injections and physical therapy are reasons for this kind of continuing care.
If you qualify for this benefit, Medicare Part A covers all of your care in a 
Medicare-certified skilled nursing facility (either in a nursing home or 
hospital) for up to 100 days.
 
 For the first 20 days, Medicare Part A pays for all of your care needs — 
including the cost of your room and board, help with daily living 
activities, and prescription drugs — and you pay nothing.
 
 From 21 to 100 days in the facility, you’re responsible for a co-pay (up to 
$128 a day in 2008).
 
If you’re still in the SNF after the 100 days are up, you’ll be responsible for all 
costs, and Medicare pays nothing. (However, a different illness or injury that 
requires skilled care after another three-day stay in the hospital would qualify 
you for another 100-day benefit period.) So from day 101, if you have Part D 
drug coverage, you must then get your prescription drugs through your Part D 
plan. Make sure, well before the SNF benefit runs out, that the plan covers 
your prescriptions (as explained in the later section “Asking important cover-
age questions on Day One”) to prevent any interruption of treatment.
 
Just because the SNF benefit lasts for up to 100 days doesn’t mean you can 
choose to stay in the facility that long. Your continuing eligibility to stay there 
is reviewed regularly and depends on whether your physician and/or other 
medical professionals (such as physical therapists) consider that further 
days or weeks at the facility will result in an improvement of your condition. 
So if your condition reaches a plateau — a point when the illness or injury 
isn’t expected to get any better — you lose your eligibility for the SNF benefit 
and must leave the facility, even if you don’t feel better and actually need 
continuing care.
If you receive full Medicaid benefits
 
If your state pays for your medical benefits under the Medicaid program 
and you’re enrolled in Medicare Part D for your prescription drug coverage, 
you’re probably already receiving Part D’s Extra Help benefit (as explained 
in Chapter 5) and paying small co-pays for your meds. After a month in the 
nursing home, though, you should no longer pay anything for your meds for 
the rest of your stay. (In the event that you continue to be charged co-pays, 
call Medicare at 800-633-4227 or call your plan to get it to correct the mistake. 
Any undue payments you’ve made must be refunded to you.)
Medicaid also pays most of the costs of Medicaid-certified nursing homes for 
people with low incomes and few resources. Eligibility varies from state to 
state. Many patients who enter nursing homes pay the costs themselves or 
through long-term care insurance, but they become eligible for Medicaid 
when their savings are used up (or their insurance runs out and they have no 

286
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
savings to fall back on). In this situation, you receive a small allowance for 
personal needs. You’re not expected to pay for prescription drugs out of this 
allowance — again, your Part D plan must not charge you anything for the 
drugs it covers. If the plan doesn’t cover all the drugs you need, Medicaid 
may cover them instead (as explained in Chapter 5).
Ensuring all of your meds are covered when you enter a nursing home
Very often, people go into nursing homes after being in the hospital, where 
they’re prescribed more or different drugs than they were taking before 
being hospitalized. For this reason, and so that your treatment isn’t inter-
rupted, your Part D plan must cover all the meds that you’re taking when you 
first enter the nursing home for at least 90 days — even if the plan normally 
doesn’t cover some of these drugs or restricts access to them. Some plans 
extend this transitional period for up to 180 days after their enrollees go into 
nursing homes. Your plan can tell you how long the transitional period lasts.
Asking important coverage 
questions on Day One
 
Physicians who care for people in nursing homes say there are good reasons 
for patients (or their caregivers) to consider their Part D plan carefully and 
find out whether it’ll continue to work for them in these changed circum-
stances as soon as possible after admission, or even before. “Ideally,” one 
physician told me, “they should do this on Day One.” These are the questions 
to ask and why you should ask them:
 
 Are any of the pharmacies that the nursing home uses also in my Part 
D plan’s pharmacy network? Nursing homes use special long-term care 
(LTC) pharmacies that dispense prescriptions in special packages — 
the drugs come in single doses, individually sealed, instead of the usual 
containers. This is for hygiene and safety reasons in a setting where 
nurses administer a great many different drugs to many patients. LTC 
pharmacies may be large companies that supply only nursing homes 
and other LTC facilities or, in rural areas, local retail pharmacies that 
can supply properly sealed medicines. All Part D plans must include LTC 
pharmacies in their networks. But if the ones your nursing home uses 
are not in your plan’s network, the plan most likely won’t cover your 
drugs. The nursing home won’t pay for your meds if your plan doesn’t 
cover them, even if you can’t afford them.
 
 Does my Part D plan cover the medicines that I’m taking now? As 
explained earlier in this chapter, your Part D plan must cover all the 
drugs you’re taking when you first enter the nursing home for at least 90 
days. But it’s wise to check whether the plan will continue to cover your 
prescriptions (especially if they’re new ones) after this transitional 
supply has run out — and, if necessary, take steps to avoid having to 
pay full price for them at that time.

287
 Chapter 18: Staying in Long-Term Care (Or Helping Someone Who Is)
 
You can ask the nursing home administrator or social worker for the names of 
the long-term care pharmacies it uses; then call your plan and ask whether 
those pharmacies are in your plan’s network. If you’re not sure, the adminis-
trator or social worker can also tell you whether Medicare Part A is covering 
your stay (and your drugs) under the skilled nursing facility benefit. (I explain 
this benefit earlier in this chapter.) To find out whether your Part D plan 
covers your new prescriptions or imposes any conditions restricting your 
access to them (as explained in Chapter 4) — you should call the plan.
If you’re not covered by the Part A skilled nursing benefit (or if it’s run out), 
you may be facing at least one situation that requires action:
 
 The LTC pharmacy isn’t in your Part D plan’s network. You need to 
change your plan, as explained in the next section.
 
 Your plan doesn’t cover some or all of the drugs you now need or 
restricts immediate access to them. You can ask your attending doctor 
whether any alternative drugs your plan does cover would work as well 
for you (as explained in Chapters 4 and 16). Or you can ask your attend-
ing doctor to request an exception to the plan’s policy (see Chapter 4). 
In this case, it’s important for the doctor to explain to the plan represen-
tative that you’re in a nursing home and to fully describe why this par-
ticular drug is medically necessary for you and why an alternative 
covered by your plan wouldn’t work as well or could cause additional 
medical problems. Other ways of dealing with this situation may be
 
• Finding out whether Medicaid (if you’re enrolled in the program) 
will pay for drugs your plan doesn’t cover. Ask the nursing home 
social worker or a counselor at your State Health Insurance 
Assistance Program (SHIP) to help you. (For your local SHIP’s 
contact information, see Appendix B.)
 
• Switching to a Part D plan that covers your drugs or imposes no, 
or fewer, restrictions, as explained in the next section.
Switching to Another Plan
In general, the process of switching plans when you’re in a nursing home is 
the same as it is for anybody in Part D (see Chapter 17). But when you enter a 
nursing home, you immediately have rights that most other folks don’t have. 
In this section, I explain those rights and some additional tips. I also describe 
two special types of Medicare health plans that are available in some areas: 
Special Needs Plans and PACE plans.

288
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
Knowing your rights for changing plans
 
You have an absolute right to change your Part D plan, if you wish, when you 
enter or leave a nursing home, and at any time during your stay there. In other 
words, you don’t have to wait until the general enrollment period at the end of 
the year. Instead, you automatically receive a special enrollment period (SEP) 
to make the change. You don’t have to apply for this SEP or disenroll from 
your current plan — just enroll in a new plan, explaining the situation.
Recognize, too, that this right to switch plans applies if you’re in any 
Medicare- or Medicaid-certified institutional facility — an umbrella term that 
sounds grim but actually comprises nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, 
rehabilitation hospitals or units, long-term care hospitals, psychiatric 
hospitals or units, or intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded.
Table 18-1 shows how often you can change Part D plans when you enter, 
live in, or leave any of the preceding facilities and when your new coverage 
starts.

Choosing and enrolling 
in a new Part D plan
 
Having the right to switch to a different plan doesn’t overcome the fact that 
it’s a hassle if you need to do so — especially when you, the patient, are too 
frail or sick to go through the process. In such circumstances, you’d think that 
the simplest way would be to ask the nursing home staff or your attending 
physician to point you to the plan they think would suit you best. But 
Medicare prohibits these professionals from doing so. This rule is intended to 
protect patients and prevent the possibility of doctors and nursing facilities 
receiving financial kickbacks for steering patients to a particular Part D plan. 

289
 Chapter 18: Staying in Long-Term Care (Or Helping Someone Who Is)
But consumer and patient groups, long-term care physicians, and pharmacists 
point out that the rule lays a burden on many patients at a time when they are 
at their most vulnerable and unable to cope with it.
So if you’re a family member, friend, or personal caregiver of the patient, 
you’re likely to be the one helping to choose his new Part D plan. You may be 
able to choose a new plan by using Medicare’s online Prescription Drug Plan 
Finder, following the guidance I give in Chapter 10. If you don’t want to go 
online to compare drug plans, you can call Medicare or any of the other 
sources of help listed in Chapter 10.
 
Although nursing home staff, physicians, and pharmacists are banned from 
steering anybody to any one plan, they may be willing to do an objective 
search on the Medicare plan finder to identify the three or four plans that 
would suit the patient’s needs best (according to the drugs needed), and then 
you can make a final choice from that shortlist.
After you’ve found a suitable plan, the patient needs to be enrolled in it, and 
he must sign the enrollment application. Or, if the patient is incapable of 
signing, you (as caregiver) may be able to do so. If you already have durable 
power of attorney — the right to make medical and financial decisions on the 
patient’s behalf, according to the laws of your state — you can sign the 
enrollment form as explained in Chapter 12.
Checking out two alternative plan options
Two types of Medicare health plans are specially designed for people who 
are either in nursing homes or are eligible for nursing home care. These plans 
may be worth considering, according to your circumstances and preferences, 
if the plans are available in your area.
Special Needs Plans
Special Needs Plans (SNPs) are Medicare private health plans (usually HMOs 
or PPOs). Each one serves the specific needs of one group of people in three 
categories (see Chapter 9). One of these categories is for people who have 
been (or expect to be) in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes or 
other institutions, for 90 days or longer.
SNPs, which came into existence in 2004, are still somewhat experimental. 
In 2008, Congress authorized them to continue through 2010, but also barred 
any new ones from setting up in 2009 and 2010 until Congress has again 
reviewed the program and decided whether to continue it. Meanwhile, existing 
SNPs may accept more enrollees. Only about half of Medicare beneficiaries 
have access to SNPs that serve nursing home residents.
SNPs for people in nursing homes and other types of long-term care (which 
include assisted living facilities) are supposed to offer ways to coordinate 
care and services. For example, an SNP may provide a case worker or care 

290
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
manager who helps patients coordinate Medicare and Medicaid benefits, 
links patients with needed community services, advises on managing health 
conditions, and maybe helps solve problems with drug coverage. These 
services, and their quality, vary a great deal among different plans. By 2010 
all SNPs must provide a care management plan for each enrollee.
 
If you’re considering joining an SNP for nursing home patients, find out not 
only its costs and benefits, but whether it covers the providers that you 
prefer — all the factors relating to Medicare health plans that I cover in 
Chapter 9. The SNP should cover most of the meds commonly used by nursing 
home patients. But it’ll still have a formulary, so check that it covers the 
drugs you need.
You can enroll in this type of SNP (if one is available to you) when you enter 
a nursing home, regardless of the time of year. Your coverage starts on the 
first day of the month after you enroll. But if your special needs status 
changes so that you’re no longer eligible for this kind of plan, you can switch 
to another Medicare health plan with drug coverage or to traditional 
Medicare and a stand-alone drug plan. This SEP begins in the month your 
special needs status changes and ends up to three months after you’re 
disenrolled from the SNP.
 
You can find out whether there’s an SNP for nursing homes in your area by 
calling Medicare (800-633-4227) or by going to its online plan finder at www.
medicare.gov. You may also want to take advice from your State Health 
Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP), as explained in the later section 
“Getting Help for Yourself or Your Loved One.”
Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly
Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) is a Medicare program 
that helps people who’d otherwise need nursing home care to continue living 
in their own homes or with their families in the community for as long as 
possible. It provides comprehensive medical and social services — including 
home care, day care, physical therapy, dentistry, meals, social work counsel-
ing, transportation, and many other services. It also provides hospital and 
nursing home care should you need it. You can’t choose your own doctors in 
a PACE plan. Instead, you’re assigned a primary care physician who is one of 
a team of healthcare professionals working with you and your family to help 
maintain your overall health. The team also provides support to your care-
givers. PACE programs include Medicare Part D drug coverage, so you don’t 
have to join a separate drug plan.
 
You can join a PACE program if
 
 You’re 55 or older
 
 You’re certified by your state as being eligible for a nursing home level 
of care, after an assessment by the PACE plan’s care team
 
 A program serves the area where you live and is accepting new enrollees

291
 Chapter 18: Staying in Long-Term Care (Or Helping Someone Who Is)
 
 You’re enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid
 
 You’re able to live safely in the community with the help of PACE
PACE has no deductibles or co-payments for any service, care, or prescrip-
tion drug approved by your care team. Other costs depend on your situation:
 
 If you qualify for Medicaid, you pay a small monthly payment — and 
nothing for long-term care if you need it. The PACE plan determines the 
amount of the payment.
 
 If you don’t qualify for Medicaid, you pay a monthly premium to cover 
the long-term care part of the PACE benefit and also a monthly premium 
for Medicare Part D drugs, in each case paying what the plan requires.
If you’re eligible for an available PACE, you can join it at any time. If you’re 
enrolled in Medicare, you get a special enrollment period to leave traditional 
Medicare or a Medicare private health plan to join the program. (You can’t 
be in either of these programs at the same time as being enrolled in a PACE.) 
Also, you can leave a PACE any time you want to switch to traditional 
Medicare or a Medicare health plan.
 
To find out whether a PACE exists in your area, call Medicare (800-633-4227) 
or go to www.cms.hhs.gov/PACE/LPPO/list.asp. If you’re interested in 
joining it, contact the plan to arrange a home visit with you or your caregiver, 
or a visit to the PACE center. The plan will schedule a meeting between you 
and its care team for a medical and social assessment that determines your 
eligibility for the program. For more on how PACE works, go to the National 
PACE Association’s Web site at www.npaonline.org.
Getting Help for Yourself 
or Your Loved One
 
Don’t hesitate to get help for yourself or your loved one; some problems you 
just can’t cope with on your own. Here are some resources:
 
 Your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP): Whenever you 
need information or help with a problem with Medicare or Medicaid, 
including Part D and long-term care issues, your best bet by far is to 
phone your local SHIP immediately. This way, you get free, personal 
counseling from experts familiar with your area. For the phone number 
of your state SHIP, go to Appendix B.

 Medicare long-term care information: Medicare’s Web site (www.
medicare.gov) provides detailed information on different types of 
long-term care. On the home page, click “Long Term Care.” The site also 
has useful info on all nursing homes in the country that are certified by 
Medicare or Medicaid, including details of how well (or not) they per-
form. Click “Nursing Home Compare.” You can get the same info by call-
ing the Medicare help line at 800-633-4227 and asking the customer 
service rep to search for details of the nursing homes you’re interested 
in and send you printouts.
 
 Your state long-term care ombudsman: This is the person to contact 
if you have complaints or concerns about the care you receive in an 
LTC facility or are trying to find a facility. The ombudsman is trained to 
troubleshoot problems on behalf of people in nursing homes, board-
and-care homes, and assisted living, and acts as their advocate. Every 
state, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam, has an LTC 
ombudsman. To find the name and phone number of the ombudsman 
for your area, go to the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource 
Center’s Web site at www.ltcombudsman.org. Or call your state Office 
of Aging (in the state pages of the telephone directory) for the number.
 
 Your Area Agency on Aging: These public services are provided by 
the federal Administration on Aging to help older people maintain their 
independence and remain in their community. Each agency acts as a 
resource center for linking seniors and caregivers with local services 
and support groups. Visit the national Web site at www.aoa.gov/
eldfam/eldfam.aspx or call your local Agency on Aging at the 
number in the state pages of your phone book.

S
ooner or later, you may have some sort of issue with your Part D 
plan. Note that I’m saying may, not will. But you should know that you 
have every right to challenge your plan’s decisions — or even its ways of 
doing business — if you don’t agree with them. You can try to resolve a 
variety of problems through different procedures, such as filing a formal 
complaint about your plan, requesting a coverage determination to get the 
prescription meds you need, or appealing a decision you disagree with. In 
this chapter, I walk you through these procedures and suggest ways to seek 
free professional help in making appeals.
Having a Game Plan in Mind
 
Before you embark on filing a grievance, a coverage request, or an appeal, I 
want to suggest a general game plan to make the process easier:
 
 Have a rough idea of the kind of complaint you want to make. The 
plan may categorize your complaint as an inquiry, a grievance, or a cov-
erage determination, depending on whether you complain about
 
• One of the plan’s policies in general terms: In this case, the plan 
can treat your complaint as an inquiry and respond with a simple 
explanation of the policy.

294
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
• How a policy affects you personally: In this case, the plan must 
treat your complaint as a grievance or (if it concerns coverage or 
payment for a drug you need) as a coverage determination and 
take the appropriate action.
 
 Put your problem in writing. You can file a grievance or request a cov-
erage determination just by calling your plan. However, if possible, put 
your complaint or request in writing so you have a record. If the matter 
is urgent, fax your complaint to the plan instead of mailing it. Be sure to 
date all communications.
 
 Gather any documents that support your case. Such documents include 
statements from your doctor, pharmacy receipts for drugs you think the 
plan should pay for, and so on, depending on the situation.
 
 Keep all paperwork. Retain copies of all letters or forms you send to the 
plan, letters you receive from the plan or a higher appeal body, trans-
mission records of any faxes, and receipts and tracking numbers of any 
correspondence you send by registered mail. This way you have a paper 
trail if the plan tries to dodge your filing.
 
 Make notes of conversations: Keep track of all the people you talk to 
at your plan or at Medicare. Write down their names, the date and time 
you spoke to them, and their phone numbers. Having notes of your con-
versation gives you evidence that may prove valuable.
 
 Try to use the right terminology. Consumer advocates who help people 
with Part D appeals find that sometimes decisions are delayed or 
derailed simply because the consumer doesn’t talk (or write) the same 
jargon that a plan uses. In this chapter, I tell you the correct terms for 
different situations. You don’t have to commit them to memory — just 
know what they mean and have them handy when you need ’em.
 
 Stick to the deadlines. At every level of appeal, you have a certain 
length of time (usually 60 days) to file for a review of the previous deci-
sion. If it looks like you’ll miss a deadline for good reason — such as 
sickness or a family crisis — you have the right to ask for an extension.
 
 Don’t give up. If you think you’re right and the plan is wrong, don’t be 
put off by a “no” decision or feel intimidated by grand-sounding titles 
at higher appeal levels. The title “administrative law judge” may sound 
imposing, but ALJs more often decide in favor of consumers than plans. 
Therefore, if you have a reasonable case, you may just win it!
 
 Get help if you need it. You can designate anyone of your choice to 
help you, or to act on your behalf, in pursuing a complaint or an appeal. 
This person can be a relative, friend, consumer advocate, lawyer, physi-
cian, or anyone else willing to assist you. At higher levels of appeal or 
in tricky situations, it’s best to seek help from someone experienced in 
dealing with Part D appeals on behalf of consumers, such as the advo-
cates I suggest later in this chapter.

295
 Chapter 19: You Have Rights: How to Holler and (If Necessary) Holler Louder
Filing a Grievance
A grievance covers many types of complaints — but not those that have any-
thing to do with your plan covering your drugs or paying for them, which fall 
into the coverage determination category that I explain later in this chapter. 
Understanding the difference between the two is important, because a griev-
ance is not open to further appeals.
What is a grievance?
A grievance is a complaint about any aspect of a plan’s service or quality of 
care that requires some action from the plan to resolve. You can also file 
a grievance if the plan doesn’t respond within a proper time frame to your 
request for any kind of coverage determination. Here are examples of situa-
tions when you may want to file a grievance:
 
 Poor or unsatisfactory customer service: You find it hard to get through 
to the plan on the phone, hang on hold for ages, or get disconnected. 
Plan representatives don’t respond to questions satisfactorily, give 
wrong or inadequate answers, or are rude.
 
 Misleading information: You choose a plan on the basis of information — 
such as coverage or charges for your drugs — that turns out, after enroll-
ment, to be untrue.
 
 Absence of required notifications: The plan doesn’t send you required 
notices — such as its Annual Notice of Change (see Chapter 17), 
Explanation of Benefits statements (see Chapter 13), or warnings about 
formulary changes (see Chapter 4) — within the required time frames. 
Or you find the wording of notices or other written materials difficult to 
understand.
 
 Problems at the pharmacy: A pharmacy in your plan’s network gives 
you the wrong medication, the wrong number of pills, or makes other 
mistakes in dispensing your drugs. You have to wait a long time to have 
your prescriptions filled, or a pharmacy staff member treats you rudely.
 
 Poor quality of care for medical services: You can’t easily get appoint-
ments or have to wait too long for them. You have a problem with your 
care from doctors, nurses, hospitals, or other providers in the plan’s 
network — including rude behavior and facility cleanliness.
 
 Failure to transfer records: You switch Part D plans during the year, 
and your old plan fails to send your coverage record to the new plan in 
good time.
 
 Discrimination: You feel that the plan treats you differently from its 
other enrollees or seems to be encouraging you to disenroll.

296
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 Receipt of unwanted marketing materials: The company offering your 
plan sends you mailings that you didn’t ask for and that are unrelated to 
the plan.
 
 Tardy responses or decisions: The plan fails to respond to your request 
for a coverage determination or an appeal, or it doesn’t give you its deci-
sion within the required time frames. Or perhaps the plan denies your 
request for a fast coverage determination — in which case, the plan 
must make a decision within 24 hours.
How do you file a grievance?
To file a grievance, you can call the plan or write to it about your complaint. 
Look at the informational materials your plan sent you when you enrolled 
(I describe these materials in detail in Chapter 13). These documents give the 
appropriate phone numbers and address for filing a grievance, as well as 
an explanation of how to do so. You can also find this info on your plan’s 
Web site.
 
You must file a grievance within 60 days of the incident that prompts it. You 
can file yourself or have someone else act on your behalf (as explained in the 
last section of this chapter). You may receive extra time, up to 14 days, for 
filing if you ask the plan for an extension of the 60-day time frame, for example 
if you’re sick or have a family crisis during this period.
If you call about your complaint, the plan may be able to resolve it over the 
phone. Otherwise, the plan must tell you how to file a written grievance. In 
any event, the plan must give you a written response if you request it, if you 
complain in writing, or if the complaint involves a quality-of-care issue. The 
plan must respond no later than 30 days after receiving your complaint, or 
a lot sooner if the state of your health requires a fast decision. However, the 
plan may extend the 30-day period by up to 14 days if it needs more time to 
investigate your complaint — in which case, it must notify you.
 
A Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) is a panel of doctors and other health-
care experts contracted by the federal government to monitor and improve care 
given to people receiving Medicare services. If you’re complaining specifically 
about the quality of care you’ve received (whether under traditional Medicare, a 
Medicare private health plan, or a Part D plan), you have the right to file a griev-
ance directly with a QIO, your plan, or both. The advantage of involving the QIO 
in your complaint is that the plan must then work with the QIO to resolve the 
problem. (But note that QIO complaints almost always involve medical services 
rather than problems with drug coverage.) Your plan must include the phone 
number and address of your state QIO in the enrollment materials it sends you. 
You can also call Medicare at 800-633-4227 (or 877-486-2048 for TDD users) for 
the number.

297
 Chapter 19: You Have Rights: How to Holler and (If Necessary) Holler Louder
 
After the plan looks into your complaint, it should tell you what has been done 
to resolve it. If the plan decides that no action is needed — in other words, it 
doesn’t think your complaint is justified — you can’t appeal further. (However, 
if your complaint is a quality-of-care issue, the plan must inform you of your 
right to take it up with a QIO if you haven’t already done so.) Alternatively, 
if the plan decides your complaint should be handled as a coverage determi-
nation request rather than a grievance, it must tell you how to go about 
doing that.
Requesting a Coverage Determination
Unlike a grievance (which I describe in the previous section), a coverage 
determination always relates to drug coverage or payment issues. You can 
ask for a coverage determination for both nonpayment-related issues (like 
requesting a nonformulary drug be covered) and payment-related issues 
(like asking to be reimbursed for going to an out-of-network pharmacy), as 
the following sections explain. (Should your Part D plan deny your request, 
you can appeal against the decision, as explained later in this chapter.)
Filing for a coverage determination 
when it comes to your meds
You may be standing at the pharmacy checkout before you discover that 
your Part D plan doesn’t cover all of your drugs, or that it requires you to ask 
its permission before it’ll cover certain ones. Your pharmacist may or may 
not give you a computer printout from the plan that states the reasons for 
this denial. Either way, you should contact the plan (using the phone number 
on your membership card) to make sure you understand why it isn’t covering 
your drug(s). Alternatively, you may want your plan to charge a lower co-pay 
for a drug that’s medically necessary for you.
You have the right to ask your plan to do the following (but be sure to always 
do so with your doctor’s help, as I explain in Chapter 4):
 
 Cover a drug not on its formulary: You’re asking for an exception to the 
plan’s general policy and require a statement from your doctor explain-
ing the medical reasons why you need the plan to cover this drug.
 
 Waive a restriction: You want the plan to put aside a restriction it has 
placed on one or more of your drugs — such as prior authorization, 
quantity limits, or step therapy.

298
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
 Cover an excluded drug: In most cases, plans have the right to refuse 
to cover any drugs that Medicare excludes from Part D. But sometimes 
Medicare pays for these drugs if they’re prescribed for a specific medi-
cal reason that Medicare approves. If you’re in this situation, you can 
ask the plan to cover the drug as an exception, with your doctor’s 
support. (Chapter 4 lists excluded drugs and examples of times when 
Medicare is willing to pay for them.)
 
 Charge you for a drug at a lower tier level: If your doctor thinks that a 
nonpreferred, brand-name drug on your plan’s formulary is the only one 
that will work effectively for you, you can ask for it to be covered at the 
plan’s preferred-tier charge (see Chapter 3).
 
When you’re filing for an exception, you need to ask your doctor (or another 
provider who can prescribe drugs) to support your case by sending a writ-
ten statement to the plan. Your plan provides a form for this purpose. Under 
Medicare rules, the plan can’t insist that your doctor use this form. Instead, 
it must accept any statement written on his letterhead. But using the form 
ensures that your doctor provides all the information that the plan requires. 
The address or fax number to which the statement should be sent is in your 
plan enrollment documents. Or you can call the plan for this information.
 
If your doctor thinks you need a decision immediately because your health 
may otherwise be at risk, he can ask for a fast decision, otherwise known as an 
expedited decision. Your plan must respond within 24 hours of receiving your 
doctor’s request for an expedited decision — that’s 24 hours by the clock, not 
business hours. Otherwise, the plan must respond within 72 hours (by the 
clock) of receiving the request.
Filing for a coverage determination when 
it comes to your hard-earned cash
 
You can ask your plan for a coverage determination in matters related to your 
pocketbook, as well as to your health. You don’t need your doctor’s support if
 
 You think the plan is charging you at a higher tier level than it should: 
Sometimes a plan moves a drug into a higher tier of charges. If this situ-
ation happens when you’re already taking the drug, you have the right 
to continue paying the lower-cost tier rate for the rest of the year (see 
Chapter 3). If, instead, the plan charges you the new, higher rate, you 
can file for a coverage determination.
 
 You want to be reimbursed for going to an out-of-network pharmacy: 
Occasionally, you may have no choice but to go to a pharmacy outside 
your plan’s network, as explained in Chapter 14. If you’ve done so for 
good reason and the plan doesn’t reimburse the extra charges you’ve 
paid, you can file for a coverage determination. Be sure to send copies of 
the pharmacy receipts when making this request.

299
 Chapter 19: You Have Rights: How to Holler and (If Necessary) Holler Louder
 
 You want the plan to reimburse you for the cost of drugs you’ve 
already paid for: This scenario may crop up in a number of situations. 
Perhaps confirmation of your enrollment in the plan was delayed, 
and in the meantime you paid for drugs out of pocket (as explained in 
Chapter 12), but your plan hasn’t paid you back for its share of the cost. 
Or maybe you became eligible for Extra Help (or Medicaid, SSI, or a 
Medicare Savings Program) and should’ve been reimbursed for excess 
payments dating back to the time you applied, as explained in Chapter 5.
 
 You don’t think you’ve reached the doughnut hole, but your plan is 
charging you full price: Look carefully at the Explanation of Benefits 
notices your plan has sent you and at your pharmacy receipts. Both 
show the plan’s full price for the drugs, as well as your co-pay. The full 
price — that is, the combined amount that both you and your plan have 
paid from the beginning of the year — determines when you hit the 
doughnut hole, formally known as the coverage gap (see Chapter 15). If 
you think your plan’s calculations are wrong, you can file for a coverage 
determination.
 
 You believe you’re through the doughnut hole and should be getting 
catastrophic coverage, but your plan is still charging you full price: 
This situation is a dispute over your TrOOP — your true out-of-pocket 
expenses since the beginning of the year that determine when you get 
out of the doughnut hole. (Premiums and some other payments, includ-
ing those for drugs purchased outside of your plan’s pharmacy network, 
don’t count toward TrOOP; see Chapters 3 and 15.) If you think your 
plan has calculated your TrOOP incorrectly, you can file for a coverage 
determination. Make sure to include copies of pharmacy receipts for all 
prescriptions you filled while in the doughnut hole.
If you’re filing for a determination about any of these payment-related 
issues, then you don’t need your doctor’s help. You can file on the phone 
or (preferably) in writing either by submitting a letter or by using the 
plan’s form. You can also download and print a Medicare form from 
www.cms.hhs.gov/MedPrescriptDrugApplGriev/Downloads/
ModelCoverageDeterminationRequestForm.pdf.
 
The advantage of using a form is that it tells you what information is required. 
You can check off the box that applies to your situation. But if you call or 
write a letter instead, be sure to use the correct terminology. Say: “I want to 
request a coverage determination because . . .” Again, the plan should respond 
within 72 hours.
 
Anyone (a relative, friend, counselor, social worker, lawyer — basically whom-
ever you appoint as your representative) can help you file for a payment-
related coverage determination or make the request on your behalf. Be sure 
to call your plan to find out its requirements for appointing a representative. If 
you need free advice or help from a professional counselor, contact one of the 
organizations listed at the end of this chapter.

Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
Dealing with your plan’s response
After you’ve filed a coverage determination request, you should receive a 
decision quickly, within the time frames Medicare requires. But sometimes 
plans don’t comply like they’re supposed to. In the following sections, I 
explain what you can do if your plan doesn’t respond promptly, and what to 
expect if your plan grants or denies your request.
If your plan doesn’t respond within the required time frame
If your plan doesn’t decide a coverage determination request within the 
required 24 hours (expedited) or 72 hours (standard), Medicare rules say that
 
 You can file a grievance with the plan (see “Filing a Grievance” earlier in 
this chapter).
 
 You can file a grievance with Medicare by calling its help line at 
800-633-4227 (TTD: 877-486-2048).
 
 The plan should automatically refer your request to an Independent 
Review Entity (IRE) within 24 hours of failing to meet the required dead-
line. The IRE is normally the second level of appeal (as explained in 
the later section, “Level 2: Reconsideration by an Independent Review 
Entity”). But when a plan fails to decide a coverage determination in the 
first place, the usual next level of appeal (asking the plan to reconsider 
an unfavorable decision) is automatically skipped.
 
The Medicare Rights Center, which helps people file Part D appeals, suggests 
that in these circumstances, it’s worth writing directly to the IRE yourself. 
Simply say:
I assume that my Part D plan, [plan name], has forwarded to you my 
request for a coverage determination, because it has not responded to 
my request within the required time frame. I am asking for a coverage 
determination because [state reason]. I have enclosed documents to sup-
port my request.
Depending on the situation, these documents may include a copy of your 
doctor’s statement requesting an exception, receipts from a pharmacy show-
ing what you paid out of pocket, evidence that your plan has miscalculated 
your correct level of coverage, and the like. Advocates say that writing such a 
letter ensures that the IRE knows your plan hasn’t acted on your request and 
may bring a faster decision. They also recommend filing a grievance either 
with Medicare or with the plan itself so the plan’s delay is on record. (These 
complaints count when Medicare compiles its plan quality ratings, which are 
displayed in Medicare’s online Prescription Drug Plan Finder.)
If your plan makes a decision in your favor
When a plan responds within the required time frame and grants your 
request, it has to make good on its favorable decision within a certain time:

301
 Chapter 19: You Have Rights: How to Holler and (If Necessary) Holler Louder
 
 If the plan agrees to waive a restriction or cover a nonformulary or 
excluded drug, it must allow your prescription to be filled within 72 
hours (standard) or 24 hours (expedited) of receiving your doctor’s 
written statement.
 
 If the plan agrees to pay you back for a drug you’ve already paid for and 
received, it must send a payment to reimburse you no later than 30 days 
after receiving your request. (See the later section “Taking action if your 
plan has been told to pay up — but doesn’t” on what to do if your plan 
doesn’t send the payment within this time frame.)
If your plan refuses your request
Should your plan decide not to grant your request for a coverage determi-
nation, it must send you a letter explaining why. This letter also details the 
steps you can take to appeal the decision and gives you addresses for con-
tacting the appropriate appeal bodies at each level of appeal, as explained in 
the next section.
Filing an Appeal against a Decision 
You Disagree With
The appeals process begins when your plan either turns down your request 
for a coverage determination or doesn’t give you a decision within the 
required time frame (72 hours for a standard request, 24 hours for an expe-
dited request). At that point, you have the right to take your complaint to the 
next level of appeal. If that level also gives you an unfavorable decision, you 
can take your complaint to the next highest appeal level, and so on. In the 
next several sections, I guide you through the five levels of appeal, explain 
how to handle delays you may encounter, and give you tips on obtaining 
help.
 
The appeals process is the same whether you’re enrolled in a stand-alone Part 
D plan or in a Medicare health plan that covers prescription drugs.
Understanding the five levels of appeal
You have up to five opportunities to argue your case through the appeals 
process. Table 19-1 shows the five levels of appeal, together with the time 
frames for appealing at each level and the time it takes for a decision to 
be made. The table is useful for seeing the basic process at a glance, but 
there are many more details to be aware of. The following sections walk you 
through the procedures at each level of appeal.

Level 1: Redetermination by your plan
Redetermination, the first level of appeal, gives you the opportunity to chal-
lenge your plan’s denial of your initial coverage determination request if you 
don’t agree with this decision. You’re asking the plan to reconsider its deci-
sion and, in effect, signaling your intent not to take no for an answer.
Your plan must send you detailed instructions on how to ask for a redeter-
mination in the same mailing as its initial denial. You probably want to make 
this appeal as soon as possible after receiving the denial. However, you have 
up to 60 days after the date of the denial notice to make this appeal. If you 
need more time (due to sickness or some other good reason), you can ask 
for an extension. If you’re asking for a drug to be covered, you can request 
a standard decision within 7 days or a fast (expedited) decision within 72 
hours if your doctor thinks that further delay would put your health at risk.
 
Make sure to have supporting paperwork to back up your appeal. If you have 
documents supporting your request (such as your doctor’s statement), or if 
you have new supporting evidence that you didn’t send with your original cov-
erage determination request, be sure to send all of this info now.
You have the right to ask your plan to give you any information or evidence it 
has regarding your request. Just be aware that the plan may charge you a fee 
for copying and sending these documents.
After you’ve submitted your request and supporting paperwork, the plan 
should send a coverage decision within the 7 calendar days or 72 hours 
requested. If the plan doesn’t respond within these time frames, it should 
automatically forward your case file to the second level of appeal, the 
Independent Review Entity. (But, as I point out in the earlier section “If your 
plan doesn’t respond within the required time frame,” you can also file a 
grievance or write to the IRE yourself.)

304
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
If the plan decides
 
 In your favor: It must cover the drug you requested no later than 7 days 
after you filed for a redetermination, or sooner if your health requires 
the med. If your issue is related to payment, the plan should pay you the 
amount owed within 30 days of your filing.
 
 Against you: You have the right to appeal to the next level, the IRE. 
This is also the case if the plan only partially gives you what you’ve 
requested.
Level 2: Reconsideration by an Independent Review Entity
Reconsideration by an Independent Review Entity (IRE) is the second level 
of appeal, but the first level outside the plan to review your case. The IRE is 
an independent body, under contract with Medicare, and has no connection 
with your plan. (Medicare currently uses an organization called Maximus as 
its IRE. For more information on Maximus, go to www.medicareappeal.
com.) At this level, you’re asking the IRE to reconsider your case in the hope 
that it will reverse your plan’s decision.
You can make this appeal yourself or have someone else act for you (as 
explained in the later section “Getting Help in Making an Appeal”). Note: You 
can’t make this appeal through your doctor unless you’ve appointed your 
doctor as your chosen representative.
You must request a reconsideration in writing to the IRE, either in a letter 
or (preferably) on the standard form that your plan must send you when it 
denies your redetermination request. This form asks for contact info for you, 
your appointed representative (if you’re using one), and your prescribing 
doctor. It also requires a copy of your plan’s redetermination denial notice. If 
your doctor thinks you need a fast (expedited) decision from the IRE for the 
sake of your health, you can check the box asking for a decision within 
72 hours. Either way, be sure to return the form to the IRE at the address or 
toll-free fax number specified on the form.
 
You can request a reconsideration at any time within 60 calendar days of 
receiving your plan’s redetermination denial, but I recommend doing so 
as quickly as possible, if you can. Sending the form by fax rather than mail 
speeds up the process. If you have supporting documents (such as a state-
ment from your doctor saying you need an expedited decision), attach copies 
to the form.
Your Part D plan may refer your case to the IRE automatically if it’s failed to 
give you a redetermination in good time, as explained in the previous sec-
tion. If so, the plan must notify you that it’s done so and explain what you 
should do next. If you originated the appeal, the IRE asks the plan to send 

305
 Chapter 19: You Have Rights: How to Holler and (If Necessary) Holler Louder
copies of all the documents in your case file, quickly enough for the IRE to 
receive them within 24 hours (for an expedited review) or 48 hours (standard 
review).
 
The IRE will send you (or your representative) a letter saying that it has 
received your case file and will give you a reference number for the case. If 
English isn’t your first language, you have the right to ask the IRE to send you 
letters written in the language you best understand. You also have the right 
to ask the IRE for a copy of every document in your case file (which includes 
information sent by your plan).
 
During the review process, if you obtain additional information you want the 
IRE to consider, fax it in immediately. Be sure to write your name and case 
number on each sheet. The review process moves quite fast after it’s begun, 
so acting quickly is essential. If the IRE wants more details, it may contact you 
(and/or the prescribing doctor) by phone or mail.
After reviewing your case — according to Medicare rules and the information 
sent by you and your plan — the IRE must make a decision within 72 hours 
(expedited) or 7 days (standard). Here’s what happens next:
 
 If the IRE decides in your favor, the plan must cover the drug(s) in ques-
tion within 24 hours (expedited) or 72 hours (standard) of the decision. 
If you’re appealing a payment issue, the plan should pay you the dis-
puted amount within 30 days of the decision.
 
 If the IRE agrees with the plan and not you, you have the right to chal-
lenge its decision at the third level of appeal, an administrative law 
judge, under certain conditions.
Level 3: Hearing with Administrative Law Judge
An administrative law judge (ALJ) is a lawyer authorized to conduct hear-
ings on disputes between a government agency and anyone affected by the 
agency’s actions. ALJs are required to give impartial decisions according to 
the facts of the case and the law.
 
At the ALJ level of appeal, it may be best to get professional help from one of 
the sources listed later in this chapter. Someone who is experienced in Part D 
appeals can guide you through the process and act on your behalf in making 
the appeal if you want. If your appeal involves obtaining an exception for your 
plan to cover a drug, it may also help if your doctor — the one who prescribed 
the med(s) in question — agrees to take part in the hearing to speak on your 
behalf. However, your doc’s presence is by no means essential.
 
The ALJ level introduces a new requirement that doesn’t exist at lower levels 
of appeal. This requirement is the amount in dispute (sometimes called the 
amount in controversy) — a specified dollar minimum that represents the cost 
to you of having your drug or payment denied. In 2008, the amount is $120 (it 

306
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
goes up slightly each year). If your likely cost is less than this amount, you 
can’t appeal to an ALJ. But bear in mind that
 
 If you’re trying to get your plan to cover a drug, you can calculate the 
amount in dispute as what it will cost you out of pocket for the whole 
year if the plan doesn’t help pay for the drug.
 
 You can submit more than one claim to the same ALJ hearing, and the 
combined claims may raise the amount in dispute over the threshold 
level. This can happen if, for example, you’re asking the plan to cover 
more than one drug or your plan refused to reimburse you for the cost 
of a drug purchased for good reason at an out-of-network pharmacy on 
more than one occasion.
 
 If you’re appealing because your plan hasn’t reimbursed you for extra 
payments you made between the time you applied for Extra Help (or for 
Medicaid, SSI, or state-paid Part B premiums) and the date when you 
became eligible, all of those surplus payments count toward the amount 
in dispute. They include the difference between what you should have 
paid under Extra Help (premiums, deductibles, and co-pays) and what 
you actually paid under the regular Part D program.
You (or your representative) must request an ALJ hearing in writing within 
60 calendar days of receiving the IRE’s decision (see the preceding section 
for more on this level of appeal). Make this request on the form the IRE sends 
you and mail it to the address given in the IRE’s notice. If you have a good 
reason to miss the 60-day deadline (such as sickness or a family crisis), you 
can ask for a deadline extension. You can also ask for a translator or inter-
preter for your own language (including sign language) if you need to.
Send copies of any written evidence that supports your case, either with your 
request for a hearing or within 10 days of receiving a notice that specifies 
the date and time of your hearing. This evidence may include copies of claim 
denial documents, supporting statements or other records from your doctor, 
pharmacy receipts, the dated form on which you applied for Extra Help, and 
so on, according to the circumstances.
 
You have the right to ask the ALJ to conduct a hearing just on the written evi-
dence, without you taking part, but it’s usually best to participate. You can ask 
to take part in an ALJ hearing in one of three ways:
 
 In a telephone conference: You talk with the judge on the phone and, 
if you want, you can have your representative (or anyone else helping 
you) join the conversation, no matter how far away she may be.
 
 In a video conference: You (and your representative, if desired) talk 
with the judge through a video link so you can see each other on televi-
sion screens. A video conference can often be set up in a location near 
your home.

307
 Chapter 19: You Have Rights: How to Holler and (If Necessary) Holler Louder
 
 In person in a hearing room before the judge: In-person hearings 
are held in only four places in the country — Irvine, California; Miami, 
Florida; Cleveland, Ohio; and Arlington, Virginia. (To find out which of 
these offices serves your home area, call Medicare at 800-633-4227 or 
go to www.hhs.gov/omha/offices.html.) This type of hearing is 
granted only to claimants who can show “special and extraordinary cir-
cumstances” for arguing their case in person.
You can call the ALJ’s office to find out who else will be giving evidence at 
your hearing. Note: Somebody representing your Part D plan will likely par-
ticipate. You can ask the ALJ’s office to send you copies of any evidence that 
has been submitted by anyone besides you.
 
ALJ hearings are more informal than a civil court case, and judges are usually 
understanding and easy to talk to. Just be yourself and give your side of the 
story in your own words. Remember, though, that you, your representative, 
the person representing your Part D plan, and any other witnesses are under 
oath to tell the truth when giving evidence.
Often, the ALJ makes a decision within 90 days of your hearing, but this 
process may take longer if the judge decides that more evidence is needed. 
(However, Medicare proposed a new rule in mid-2008 that would allow fast 
ALJ decisions in some circumstances. By the time you read this book, that 
rule may be in effect.)
Here’s what to do next based on the outcome of your appeal to the ALJ:
 
 If the judge decides in your favor, your plan must cover the drug(s) in 
question within 72 hours of receiving the decision. For payment issues, 
the plan should pay you the disputed amount within 30 days of the deci-
sion. However, the plan also has the right to take the case to the next 
level of appeal, the Medicare Appeals Council.
 
 If the judge decides against you, you have the right to appeal against the 
decision to the Medicare Appeals Council.
Level 4: Review by Medicare Appeals Council
 
The Medicare Appeals Council (MAC) is a section of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services. If you want to take your case to this stage — the 
fourth level of appeal — I recommend you have an advocate or lawyer who 
has experience with the procedure represent you. The MAC review often 
focuses on a question of law (for example, whether the ALJ interpreted 
Medicare law correctly), a question of fairness (such as whether the ALJ con-
sidered all the evidence), or a question of Medicare policy (when there’s a dis-
pute about how Medicare interprets the law). Most people are way out of their 
depth here without an advocate preparing their case.

308
Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
At this level of appeal, the MAC decides a case simply by reviewing the writ-
ten evidence. No hearing is required, and the amount in dispute (see the pre-
ceding section for more info) doesn’t matter.
 
To request an MAC review, you or your representative must write directly 
to the MAC within 60 days of receiving the ALJ’s notice of denial. Follow the 
instructions included in the notice. If you have new or updated evidence that 
supports your case, you or your representative can submit it to the MAC at 
this time.
If the MAC decides
 
 In your favor: Your plan must give you what you were asking for within 
the same time frames as those given for the ALJ.
 
 Against you or denies your request for a review: You have the right 
to take your case to the fifth level of appeal in a federal court. The MAC 
notice tells you how to file for a federal court hearing.
Level 5: Hearing in federal court
If you go to this stage, you really want to be represented by a professional. 
(I explain how to find free legal help later in this chapter.) You can file for a 
judicial review in a U.S. district court if both of these circumstances apply:
 
 The MAC decides not to review your case or decides against you (in 
other words, it upholds the ALJ’s decision).
 
 The amount in dispute is more than a certain sum — $1,180 in 2008. This 
sum increases slightly every year.
 
The amount in dispute at this level of appeal is almost ten times higher than 
at the ALJ level, but the suggestions on ways to meet the amount that I pres-
ent in the earlier section on ALJ hearings apply here, too. Also, if an advocacy 
organization is helping you appeal, it may be able to combine other Medicare 
beneficiaries’ claims with yours. The rules allow appeals to be heard together 
if they satisfy certain conditions of similarity, and their claims can be added 
together to meet the required amount in dispute.
To request this review, you must file within 60 calendar days of receiving the 
MAC decision. The federal court judge first decides whether to review your 
case. If the case proceeds to court, it’s heard under normal court procedures. 
Should the judge decide
 
 In your favor: Your plan must comply with your request within the 
same time frames as those given for the ALJ earlier in this chapter.
 
 Against you: Typically this is the end of the road for the Medicare 
appeals process. But the judge may offer possibilities for further appeals 
in the federal court system, depending on the legal issues of your case.

 Chapter 19: You Have Rights: How to Holler and (If Necessary) Holler Louder
Coping with delays
Some of the appeals processes covered in this chapter can take months to 
decide. That’s one kind of delay. Another is when the case has been decided 
in your favor, but the plan delays paying the money it owes you.
Handling delays in getting your drugs covered
When you’ve asked the plan to cover a drug you need, your priority is to get 
it as quickly as possible. Filing for a coverage determination, a redetermina-
tion, or an IRE reconsideration can bring relatively fast decisions. At higher 
appeals levels, however, the process is much more drawn out. If you move 
into the fourth level of appeal, you may have to decide whether continuing is 
worth it. Just bear the following in mind:
 
 The ability to afford to buy the drug(s) out-of-pocket for a while doesn’t 
stop your right to continue the appeals process. If you win your case, 
the plan must cover the drug(s) retroactively, meaning it must reim-
burse you for all the excess payments you’ve made for your medicine 
during the appeals process. (So be sure to keep your receipts.) However, 
be aware that if you do pay for the drug, you can’t ask for an expedited 
decision when requesting a coverage determination, redetermination, or 
reconsideration.
 
 If you’re receiving Extra Help (see Chapter 5) or living in a nursing home 
(see Chapter 18), you have the right to switch Part D plans at any time of 
the year. So enrolling in a plan that does cover your drugs may be better 
than pursuing higher levels of appeal against your current plan.
 
 If your appeal to an IRE is turned down, you may consider asking it to 
reopen (take another look at) your case instead of appealing to the next 
level (ALJ). You can make this request if you think the IRE’s denial was 
based on a definite error or if you have new medical evidence to support 
your case. Requests for a reopening can be tricky, so taking advice from 
a legal advocate before proceeding with this course of action is wise.
 
 The situation may change. As this book goes to press, Medicare has pro-
posed new rules that should speed up the appeals process. These pro-
posals include requiring ALJs (the third level of appeal) to decide a case 
within 90 days and allowing expedited appeals at the ALJ level.
Taking action if your plan has been told to pay up — but doesn’t
Instances of plans not paying due reimbursements within the required 30 
days abound. In fact, sometimes they don’t pay for months after losing a 
payment case on appeal. If you’re in this situation, consumer advocates sug-
gest that you complain to Medicare. If necessary, continue complaining to 
Medicare until you receive your money.

Part IV: You’re In! Navigating Part D from the Inside 
 
Here are some suggestions for making your problem heard:
 
 Call the Medicare help line at 800-633-4227 (or 877-486-2048 if you’re 
a TDD user). If the customer representative tells you to call the plan, 
you should specifically say: “I want this complaint entered into the 
complaint tracking module.” Using this bit of jargon should ensure that 
Medicare logs the complaint and may speed up getting your money 
back.
 
 File a written grievance with Medicare (as I explain earlier in this 
chapter) and ask that it be forwarded to the plan manager at your 
regional Medicare office. The plan manager is the area Medicare official 
responsible for overseeing individual Part D plans. Enclose a copy of the 
appeal decision to show that more than 30 days have passed since the 
appeal was granted in your favor.
 
 Consider reporting the plan’s failure to repay you within the required 
time frame to your regional Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor 
(MEDIC). This organization is responsible for investigating fraud and 
abuse in Part D, including legal and administrative violations by plans. 
To report a complaint, call 877-772-3379 or download a complaint form 
from MEDIC’s Web site at www.healthintegrity.org.
 
 Consider writing to your member of Congress. Alert him or her that 
this part of the Part D appeals process isn’t working as it should.
 
Consumer complaints are fed into Medicare’s quality ratings system, which 
are displayed on Medicare’s online Prescription Drug Plan Finder. If enough 
people complain about this problem, Medicare may lean on plans more heav-
ily to guarantee they send payments within the required period.
Getting Help in Making an Appeal
 
Anyone can help you file for a coverage determination or an appeal — a 
relative, friend, doctor, consumer advocate, or lawyer. If you want any 
of these individuals to represent you — that is, prepare and present your 
arguments — that person must fill out a form provided by your plan or one of 
the appeal bodies (IRE, ALJ, MAC, or federal court). Free legal help from pro-
fessionals who are experienced in Part D appeals is available from
 
 The Medicare Rights Center: A national not-for-profit consumer ser-
vice, the Medicare Rights Center offers free counseling and representa-
tion with Part D appeals. Call the Center’s appeals hot line toll-free at 
888-466-9050. To download its guide to navigating the system, “Medicare 
Part D Appeals,” go to www.medicarerights.org.

 State Health Insurance Assistance Programs: All states have SHIPs 
that give free help and counseling to people with Medicare. If your state 
program doesn’t directly provide legal help with Part D appeals, it can 
put you in contact with a local service that can. To find your local SHIP’s 
phone number, see Appendix B.

arlier chapters of this book deal with the daily busi-
ness of Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage — 
all the practical things you need to know to get the most 
out of the program. The two chapters in this part veer off in 
a different direction. The first assumes you’re a boomer not 
yet on Medicare but helping an older person — most likely 
a parent — deal with Part D. It suggests ten ways to manage 
that process effectively while helping yourself at the same 
time.
The second chapter alerts you to ten proposals to change 
Part D that have been put forward by members of Congress 
and others. These suggestions range from specific improve-
ments to overhauls of the entire program. None may hap-
pen any time soon, or even at all. But Part D is a creation of 
politics, so it’s good to know what’s in the air.

Ten Ways Boomers Can Help 
Loved Ones with Part D
In This Chapter
 Offering to help your relative with Part D
 Thinking about the future — for your relative and yourself
A
 lot is said about baby boomers — born between 1946 and 1964 — but 
one characteristic is unique: Boomers, much more than any previous 
generation, are (or will be) caring for elderly parents. Now that people com-
monly live into their 80s, 90s, and even 100s, often with chronic conditions that 
impair daily activities, their adult children are mostly the ones who care for 
them. Today, caregiving usually includes coping with Part D. So in this chapter, 
I suggest ten ways that you, as a boomer (or perhaps someone even younger), 
can help an older relative with Part D in the short term, and also prepare for 
the future when you too will become eligible for Medicare and face Part D.
Helping with Tact
Every family is different, of course. Your relationship with an aging relative 
may be close, strained, at loggerheads, or even a bit of all three at different 
times. Perhaps you’re living in the same house or 3,000 miles away — spend-
ing a lot of time together or much less than you’d like. So generalizing is 
impossible. And I’m not about to lecture you on family relationships.
 
What I can tell you is that helping a relative, especially a parent, with Part D 
requires sensitivity and tact. Implying that Dad’s incapable of figuring the 
program out for himself may not go down too well. (“What do you think I am — 
senile?”) Remember that it’s not his age that makes him find Part D confusing. 
It’s because Part D is confusing! So figuring it out together — or at least giving 
the impression of doing so, even if you’re doing most of the heavy lifting — 
may bring about a sense of closeness (think “us versus the bureaucracy”) that 
goes far beyond picking a Part D plan.

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Identifying the Insurance 
Your Loved One Has Now
When helping a relative with Part D, you may first need to step back and ask 
some basic questions about what kinds of health and drug insurance she 
already has. And don’t be surprised if she doesn’t know! Her mind isn’t going 
mushy. Seniors often have a perplexing patchwork of different kinds of insur-
ance (not their fault) and aren’t always sure which plan covers what.
For example, your relative may simply say, “I have Medicare.” But does 
that mean traditional Medicare? Or a Medicare private health plan? Or both 
Medicare and Medicaid? Or Medicare plus a retiree health plan? And does 
she get her prescription drugs from a Medicare health plan, a stand-alone 
drug plan, or a retiree plan — or possibly some combination of these? Then 
again, she may say, “I have Blue Cross.” But does that mean a Medigap policy, 
a Medicare private health plan, a stand-alone drug plan, or a retiree plan? 
Large insurers like Blue Cross sell all of these plans.
 
Here’s how to find what type of medical insurance your relative currently has:
 
 Find the paperwork for each plan. If you’re lucky, it may be neatly filed 
and accessible. If not, prepare for some hunting around: “Would it be in 
a kitchen drawer, Mom, or your dresser? Please, not the attic!”
 
 Look for the Evidence of Coverage booklet(s). Every private plan (but 
not traditional Medicare) sends this document annually to enrollees. 
The EOC may describe a retiree plan, a Medicare health plan, a stand-
alone Part D plan, or Medigap insurance. Make sure the EOC you find is 
for the current year and not one that’s expired.
 
 Look to see what each plan is. Your relative’s EOB booklet and plan 
membership card should clearly identify what kind of plan she has. If 
you’re still not sure what kind of plan it is, call the plan’s customer ser-
vice number to find out.
 
 Check if your relative has health and drug insurance outside of 
Medicare. She may have coverage from a previous employer or union, 
veterans or military benefits, or COBRA insurance. Or she may be 
enrolled in a State Pharmacy Assistance Program (SPAP). (Chapter 6 
covers how these benefits fit in with Part D.)
 
 Ask if your relative has a Medicaid card if you know or suspect 
that her income is limited. Medicaid beneficiaries are automatically 
entitled to Part D’s low-cost Extra Help program, covered in Chapter 5. 
(Remember: Medicaid, a state program that provides healthcare for low-
income people who qualify, is different from Medicare, as explained in 
Chapter 1.)

Doing Your Homework
You’ll be much more confident (and competent) about helping your rela-
tive if you have a broad understanding of how Part D works. Good thing you 
picked up this book, huh? Reading the pertinent bits that fit in with your rela-
tive’s situation can help you evaluate the insurance he already has and aid 
you both in deciding which Part D plan most suits his needs or if switching to 
a different plan may be worthwhile.
 
Without rehashing the information in the rest of this book, here are a few 
important points to keep in mind:
 
 If your relative has any kind of retiree benefits, don’t let him sign up for 
a Part D plan (or persuade him to do so) without carefully investigating 
the consequences. Some retiree plans automatically disenroll anyone 
who signs up for Part D. (Chapter 6 has details.)
 
 Switching to a Medicare private health plan has consequences, espe-
cially in regard to choosing doctors and hospitals (see Chapter 9), that 
your relative should know about if he currently has traditional Medicare.
 
 If your relative has a limited income and few savings, check out if he 
qualifies for Extra Help (see Chapter 5). Many eligible people don’t apply 
for this Extra Help and miss out on big savings on their medicines.
 
 Scams are out there, and sometimes sales agents persuade Medicare 
beneficiaries to buy plans that aren’t right for them. If you think your 
relative is vulnerable, try to make sure he doesn’t sign anything until 
after you’ve checked it out. (See Chapter 11 for red flags to look for.)
Offering Your Skills
You (yes, you!) have skills that can be of enormous help to a relative trying 
to figure out Part D. Of course, many older people are quite able to brave the 
Part D waters themselves, thank you very much, and don’t need any help. On 
the other hand, some people can use help but don’t want to admit it. You’ll 
have to be the judge of that. But you may discover that offering your skills — 
on the computer, phone, or both — to find a suitable Part D plan for her or to 
troubleshoot problems will be very warmly received.
 
One great advantage of the Internet and toll-free phone numbers is that you 
can use your skills remotely, even if you don’t live anywhere near the person 
you’re helping. In some families, sorting out Medicare and Part D issues has 
become part of shared caregiving for a frail or sick parent — a way for the sib-
ling who lives far away to lift at least one responsibility off the shoulders of a 
brother or sister who lives in the area and is on standby all the time.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Helping to Pick a Plan
If your relative doesn’t have Internet access, or just doesn’t feel up to doing a 
Web search personally, you can offer to compare Part D plans for him. Using 
the online Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder at www.medicare.gov is 
the most effective way of comparing plans and choosing the one that’s most 
suitable. In Chapter 10, you can find a step-by-step guide to walk you through 
the process. Or you can call the Medicare help line at 800-633-4227 for similar 
information, also explained in Chapter 10. After you have a shortlist of the 
two or three plans that seem the most suitable, you and he can discuss the 
options to make a final choice.
 
For a relative enrolling in a Part D plan for the first time, you may need to talk 
with him about how the program works. For example, you may need to explain 
that drug coverage is offered through many private insurers, not by Medicare 
directly, and that he needs to pick one plan. If you’re helping a couple, you may 
need to explain that the same plan probably won’t be right for both of them.
Following Up
After your relative is in a Part D plan, your help isn’t necessarily at an end. 
Asking her from time to time how the plan’s working out is a wise precau-
tion. Check that she’s getting the prescriptions she needs. If the plan imposes 
restrictions on any of her drugs, find out if she needs help asking the plan for 
an exception (covered in Chapter 4) or filing an appeal (explained in Chapter 
19). If so, suggest that she contact one of the help organizations listed in the 
last section of Chapter 19 or, if necessary, call one yourself.
Another time when your help may be needed is if your relative moves away 
from her present home. She may need to change her plan if she moves out-
side of her current plan’s service area (covered in Chapter 17) or into a nurs-
ing home or other institutional facility (described in Chapter 18).
Making Part D an Annual Event
Everyone groans at the idea of comparing Part D plans all over again each 
year, but I strongly urge doing so if you want to make sure your relative 
continues to be in the plan that best meets his needs. Why? Because every 
plan can change its costs and benefits every calendar year, and usually they 
all do. At the very least, make sure your relative reads the Annual Notice of 
Change that his current plan mails out in October (as explained in Chapter 17), 
or read it yourself if necessary.

319
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways Boomers Can Help Loved Ones with Part D
 
Some families make Part D plan comparisons an annual event — most often 
when they get together for Thanksgiving, which conveniently falls smack in 
the middle of open enrollment. It may not seem a task that fits perfectly with 
a mood of celebration, let alone the general lethargy that follows a big dinner, 
yet it can be a genuine moment of family connection. What’s more, if you do a 
plan comparison for your parent(s) every year, the process becomes familiar 
and easy, taking maybe no more than half an hour on a computer after the 
remains of the turkey have been cleared away.
Looking to Your Loved One’s Future
No one likes to think about the possibility of loved ones developing dementia 
or undergoing other medical events, like severe strokes, that rob them of the 
power to make decisions or even communicate. Yet this scenario happens 
with tragic frequency. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, more than 
19 million Americans are estimated to have a family member with Alzheimer’s 
disease alone, and nearly one in two Americans who live beyond 85 are likely 
to have at least some of its symptoms.
 
Experts on aging suggest that long before anything like this happens, adult 
children need to talk with their parents and find out their wishes on what 
should be done in the case of incapacity. Certainly this isn’t the easiest discus-
sion topic in the world, but early planning makes for easier decision making 
should a crisis occur.
One of the most important questions to ask is who makes medical and legal 
decisions on behalf of your parent if and when she can no longer make her 
own. (These include decisions about her Part D coverage, especially if she 
needs to go into a nursing home, which I cover in Chapter 18.) This is a ques-
tion that requires expert guidance. The process for becoming a legal guard-
ian or obtaining durable power of attorney — the right to make legal decisions 
on behalf of someone else — depends on your state’s laws.
 
For information on advance healthcare directives — in which your parent can 
specify who should make which decisions if she becomes incapacitated — and 
other legal instruments, go to the Web site of the American Bar Association’s 
Commission on Law and Aging at www.abanet.org/aging/publications/
home.shtml. (Click “Online Publications for Consumers” to access a list of 
helpful resources.) AARP also has a wealth of information about advance 
planning, including “Prepare to Care: A Planning Guide for Families,” at www.
aarp.org/family/caregiving.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Remembering That Your Time Will Come
Boomers, stereotypically, have never wanted to grow old. (Well, who does?) 
Many of you have already succeeded in redefining old age: “Fifty is the new 
thirty! Sixty is the new forty!” Nonetheless, just as you’ll look in the mirror one 
morning and suddenly see your parent or grandparent staring back, so too will 
you one day confront at least some of the problems your elders face now.
One benefit of helping older relatives navigate Part D is perceiving what’s in 
store not too many years down the road and, in a way, getting into training. 
The first boomers turn 65 — and become eligible for Medicare — in 2011. 
Will you be panicking about how to sign up? Will you be totally baffled by the 
complexities of Part D? Not if you’ve already been there, done that on behalf 
of Mom or Dad.
“Working with aging parents is a voyage of discovery,” wrote psychologist 
Mary Pipher (author of Another Country: Navigating the Emotional Terrain of 
Our Elders) in her introduction to the AARP guide Caring For Your Parents 
(Sterling, 2005). “As we travel, we learn about us, about them, and about our 
relationship. We learn about caregiving and care receiving. And we learn how 
we want to handle our own old-old age.”
Being a Bona Fide Boomer 
by Making Part D Better
So you’ve confronted Part D, navigated it, and emerged — with what 
thoughts? That it’s a good program? Better than nothing? In need of major 
improvements? Boomers traditionally never accept the status quo and 
believe that anything can be made better, especially if it affects them person-
ally. So you may take a very different view from today’s generation of seniors 
who are the first to experience Part D and have in recent memory the bad old 
days when Medicare didn’t cover outpatient prescription drugs at all.
 
Part D is a creature of politics. So if you don’t like parts of it, don’t blame 
Medicare. Congress writes the law, and only Congress can change it. Senators 
and representatives listen when enough of their constituents make a fuss 
(especially in election years). You can find their contact information at www.
senate.gov or www.house.gov.
So if your generation lives up to its reputation, how will Part D evolve? Will 
future Medicare beneficiaries one day wave a not-so-fond farewell to the 
doughnut hole? Over to you, guys.

Chapter 21
Ten Proposed Changes to Part D 
You Should Know About
In This Chapter
 Improving Part D coverage as you know it
 Overhauling Part D completely
P
art D has always been a political hot potato. Over time, it’s tended to 
scorch the fingers of folks who support it and those who oppose it. 
Why? Because it’s an imperfect, overcomplicated benefit that’s hard to sup-
port wholeheartedly. Yet it’s allowed millions of Medicare beneficiaries to 
buy prescription drugs more affordably than they ever could before, which 
makes it very hard to oppose wholeheartedly, too.
But of course, anything can be improved. In this chapter, I present ten propos-
als with the potential to change Medicare prescription drug coverage either in 
small or more sweeping ways. At the time I’m writing this book, these propos-
als are only suggestions put forward by consumer groups, policy experts, and/
or members of Congress. But they’re worth keeping an eye on.
Simplifying Plan Choices
Having a multitude of choices supposedly allows people to choose the 
Medicare private health or drug plan that fits them best. But in practice, 
it doesn’t necessarily work out that way. Faced with a dizzying number of 
plans, all with different costs and benefits, people are often too overwhelmed 
to make careful comparisons. As a result, many Medicare beneficiaries don’t 
make informed choices at all.
What can improve this situation, while still keeping the principle of choice? One 
idea that’s gained traction among some lawmakers and consumer advocates 
is to standardize and simplify plan choices. Medicare beneficiaries would be 
offered a certain number of standard plans — maybe ten or fewer — that each 
provide a different benefit package. Each plan would be sold by competing insur-
ance companies for different premiums, according to the level of benefits. Sound 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
familiar? It’s modeled on Medigap supplementary insurance, which supporters 
of the proposal point to as a precedent. The Medigap market was a free-for-all 
until 1992, when Congress reformed it by introducing ten standardized policies. 
Choice and competition were preserved, but consumers were able to compare 
benefits more easily.
 
Standardization may well simplify choices among Medicare health plans’ med-
ical services, but it’s difficult to see how it’d work on the prescription drug 
side. One snag is that the best drug plan for consumers depends less on its 
design and premium and much more on the specific prescription drugs that 
each person takes. Part D has far more variables in it than Medigap.
Abolishing the Asset Test for Extra Help
More than 2.5 million Americans with limited incomes would qualify for Part 
D’s Extra Help benefit if it weren’t for the asset test, which takes savings as 
well as income into account when determining eligibility. Consumer groups 
protest that the test penalizes individuals who’ve managed to save a little 
for their old age when they’ll be living on low, fixed incomes. The chances 
of abolishing the asset test entirely aren’t high, because doing so would add 
billions of taxpayer dollars to the cost of Part D. But bills have been intro-
duced in the House and the Senate to raise the asset limits to a degree that 
would allow many more people whose incomes qualify them for Extra Help to 
actually get it. Some of these bills would also exclude individual retirement 
accounts and 401(k)s from being counted as assets.
Allowing Medicare to Negotiate Prices
It was obvious from the get-go that a prescription drug benefit in Medicare 
would eat up a lot of taxpayer money, so you’d think Congress would’ve 
done everything possible to keep drug prices in check. Yet the 2003 Medicare 
Modernization Act specifically prohibited the government from negotiat-
ing Part D drug prices directly with the manufacturers. Instead of using 
Medicare’s huge bargaining clout to keep costs down, negotiation was left to 
individual Part D insurers. Proposals to reverse the ban have many powerful 
supporters (like AARP and the American Medical Association) and opponents 
(like the pharmaceutical industry and, latterly, the Bush administration).
In January 2007, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill 
to allow direct negotiation for drugs in Medicare, but a similar bill failed in 
the Senate. Look for more attempts — and big controversy — in the future.

323
 Chapter 21: Ten Proposed Changes to Part D You Should Know About
Eliminating the Doughnut Hole
For consumers, the doughnut hole (also known as the coverage gap) is the 
most unpopular aspect of Part D. But although many lawmakers have railed 
against it, no one has seriously tried to move legislation to fill in the gap and 
give year-round coverage to everyone enrolled in Part D. That’s because 
doing so would cost an estimated $450 billion over ten years. Abolishing the 
doughnut hole is a popular enough cause for many lawmakers to continue 
proposing it. But given the hard choices of raising taxes, cutting benefits in 
other programs, or keeping Part D’s doughnut hole, eliminating it in reality 
seems remote unless the whole program is overhauled.
Improving Access to Needed Drugs
Allowing plans to impose restrictions on some drugs (through cost-cutting 
measures such as prior authorization, quantity limits, and step therapy), and 
requiring consumers to go through the hoops of the exceptions and appeal 
process to get those drugs, burdens people unduly and discourages many 
from requesting the drugs they need, according to many consumer groups. 
No concrete proposals to simplify this system have been advanced. But one 
suggestion, for Medicare to require plans to inform enrollees at the point 
of sale why a drug isn’t covered and how they can request coverage, would 
lessen many customers’ bewilderment at the pharmacy and may encourage 
them to file for an exception more quickly.
Cutting Medicare Advantage Subsidies
The 2003 law that created Part D gave Medicare health plans large subsidies 
to persuade private insurers into the Medicare fold. The extra payments, 
in turn, allow the plans to offer richer benefits to their enrollees than tradi-
tional Medicare offers — an average value of $1,100 more in 2008 for each 
enrollee. The plans defend this lopsidedness as a boon to people who can’t 
afford Medigap, whereas critics condemn it as a stealth agenda for essentially 
privatizing Medicare. Certainly, the extra payments add to Medicare’s overall 
costs and therefore increase the Part B premium for everyone in Medicare, 
not just beneficiaries in the plans. In 2008, many members of Congress called 
for a halt to the subsidies and succeeded in reducing them slightly. But abol-
ishing them would probably cause many Medicare Advantage plans to raise 
costs, reduce benefits, or withdraw from the market — a tricky political issue 
for lawmakers with constituents in the plans. Many in Congress still eye the 
subsidies — estimated to cost $54 billion over five years — as a pot of gold to 
pay for other priorities. So stay tuned: This issue isn’t going away.

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Legalizing Drug Imports from Abroad
Bills making it legal for American consumers to buy prescription drugs from 
Canada for their own use have been signed into law twice in the past decade. 
But in each case, the legal language required that the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services guarantee the safety of drugs imported from other countries, 
which no secretary has so far been willing to do, so the laws never went into 
effect. With many supporters on both sides of Congress, the issue will con-
tinue to be pressed. But drug pricing is complex, and experts say competition 
from abroad may not significantly push down prices in the U.S.
Creating a Government-Run Plan
One proposal floated by some Democrats is to create a government-run Part 
D plan to compete with private plans on a not-for-profit basis. It would allow 
Medicare to negotiate drug prices for its enrollees and provide “a consistent, 
uniform drug benefit” available to anyone, according to the House Ways 
and Means Committee chairman, Rep. Pete Stark. Just as people can choose 
between traditional Medicare and a private plan, Stark said, they “could 
remain in the Medicare drug plan or choose to switch to a private option.”
Throwing Out Part D and Starting Over
For the severest Part D critics, getting rid of the program and starting 
over has been a dream since it first became law. But unless a general elec-
tion throws up a Democratic president and huge Democratic majorities in 
Congress, it ain’t gonna happen. Even so, overhauling the system would be a 
huge challenge in the face of Part D’s established infrastructure and opposi-
tion from the health insurance industry. More likely, changes to Part D will be 
made bit by bit over many years.
Bringing in Universal Health Insurance
With 44 million Americans uninsured, and costs rising even for those who 
have insurance, the need to make health coverage affordable for everyone 
is a huge political issue. Of course, there’s no consensus on how universal 
health coverage can be achieved. A wholly government-run health system? 
A mix of public and private systems? A kind of Medicare for all? Tax breaks 
for folks who buy health insurance? Who knows? We’ll have to wait to see 
if whatever system is decided upon (if any) has an impact on Medicare and 
Part D.

take now, plus their dosages and how often you take 
them. You can use the second and third worksheets to 
help compare drug plans and Medicare health plans point 
by point.
Appendix B is the place to go for contact information for 
many sources of help. Here you find phone numbers and 
Web site addresses for the key government agencies 
(Medicare and Social Security), every State Health 
Insurance Assistance Program, and many consumer orga-
nizations. This appendix also suggests ways of getting 
updates on Medicare and Part D so you can stay informed 
on changes that come down the track.
Appendix C is a guide on how to get prescription drugs 
safely if you purchase them by mail order from Canada, 
where they generally cost less. It explains how to avoid 
scams and counterfeit meds, how to assess pharmacies 
for safe and ethical service, and how to find prescreened 
licensed pharmacies you can trust.

 Seeing how Medicare Advantage health plans measure up to one another
F
inding the best drug plan among scores of possibilities — when each 
one has its own costs and benefits and is different from the next — can 
be a nightmarish prospect. But it doesn’t have to be a nightmare in practice. 
In Part III, I explain how you can whittle those choices down to a manageable 
few — by first deciding whether you want to receive your healthcare from 
traditional Medicare or from a Medicare Advantage plan and then by compar-
ing Part D plans head-to-head according to what they charge for the drugs 
you take (and other factors that may be important to you).
Using checklists and notes of point-by-point comparisons to track the info 
you’re compiling can help you more clearly see the differences between the 
plans you’re considering so you can make that final cut — down to one. This 
appendix has three worksheets designed to help you do just that.
 
 Worksheet 1 is essentially your master list. It provides an organized way 
of jotting down complete information on all the prescription drugs you 
take. This is the list you need to make before you can compare Part D 
plans properly, as explained in Chapter 10.
 
 Worksheet 2 is the tool to use after you’ve searched the online Medicare 
Prescription Drug Plan Finder (or had someone do this for you), as 
explained in Chapter 10, and reduced your number of drug-plan options 
to a shortlist of three or four that seem best. You can use this worksheet 
to finalize your choice among either stand-alone prescription drug plans 
(PDPs) or Medicare Advantage health plans that cover drugs (MAPDs).
 
 Worksheet 3 is a checklist to use when considering Medicare Advantage 
plans for their health costs and benefits, as explained in Chapter 9, after 
you’ve reduced these plans to a shortlist of the three or four that seem 
best for you.

Part VI: Appendixes 
Worksheet 1 is the essential list you must make before comparing Part D 
plans, as explained in Chapter 10. For each of the drugs you take, write down 
its exact name together with any other words or letters that follow the name 
(for example, verapamil HCR ER), its dosage (120 mg, 2.50 ml, and so on), and 
how often you take it (one pill a day, one bottle a month, and so on).

You can use Worksheet 3 to compare Medicare Advantage health plans after 
you’ve decided to receive medical benefits from an MA plan rather than tradi-
tional Medicare (as explained in Chapter 9). This worksheet focuses only on 
medical care. You can get most of the answers by comparing Medicare health 
plans online at www.medicare.gov. You may have to ask plans or providers 
for answers the online tool can’t provide. (To compare these plans’ drug ben-
efits, use Worksheet 2.)

Part VI: Appendixes 

Appendix B
Sources of Help
V
ery often, the help you need to deal with Part D plan issues is only a toll-
free phone number or a Web site away. In these pages, I give contact 
information for government help lines and online resources; independent 
organizations that offer direct help; where to go for updated info on Medicare 
and Part D and for ways to save money; and advocacy organizations that 
work on behalf of people in Medicare. Throughout, I note special help pro-
vided for people whose first language isn’t English.
Government Help Lines and Web Sites
The go-to sources for help provided by federal and state governments are 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Social Security 
Administration (SSA), the State Health Insurance Assistance Programs 
(SHIPs), and the Eldercare Locator.
The Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services
CMS is the federal agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid (under the 
umbrella of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) and is 
responsible for overseeing the Part D drug coverage program. It provides 
updated information and direct help to consumers in English and Spanish.
 
 The Medicare & You handbook is sent to everyone on Medicare every 
October. This basic overview of Medicare services also includes brief 
details of the Medicare private health plans and Part D stand-alone drug 
plans that will be available in your area for the following year.
 
 Medicare’s toll-free help line at 800-633-4227 is available 24 hours a day, 
7 days a week. (TDD users should call 877-486-2048.) The folks on the 
other end of the line can answer your questions, send you free fact sheets, 
and give you help on many Medicare and Part D issues. If neither English 
nor Spanish is your first language, you can ask for an interpreter — more 
than 70 languages are available.

334
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
 Medicare’s Web site, www.medicare.gov, offers a huge amount of 
information. Go to this site to compare Part D plans, Medicare private 
health plans, nursing homes, and hospitals.
The Social Security Administration
SSA is the federal agency that administers Social Security benefits. Call SSA 
toll-free at 800-772-1213 (TDD: 800-325-0778) or go to its Web site at www.
ssa.gov for information on Social Security, enrolling in Medicare Part A 
and/or B, and applying for Part D’s Extra Help program.
 
The SSA Web site can be read in Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Farsi, French, Greek, 
Haitian-Creole, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Tagalog, 
and Vietnamese, as well as English. To choose a language, click the “Other 
Languages” button at the top of the home page. You can also ask for an inter-
preter in any language when you call the help line (press 2 for Spanish or 1 for 
any other language) or when you arrange to visit a local Social Security office.
State Health Insurance 
Assistance Programs
SHIPs are valuable resources for anyone who needs help with Medicare 
issues, especially Part D. They offer free, expert, personal counseling when 
you want to find a Part D plan that fits your needs, apply for Extra Help, get 
help making an appeal, or resolve a variety of other problems. If English isn’t 
your first language, the program can provide interpreters or refer you to 
local organizations that offer counseling in your own language.
SHIPs, which are funded by the federal and state governments, are avail-
able in every state, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. The programs have different names in some states (for exam-
ple, HICAP in California; SHINE in Florida). The following list includes every 
program, its name, the state agency that runs it, a toll-free telephone number 
(except for D.C. and the territories, which have local numbers), and the Web 
address. If the number you call isn’t working, call the Eldercare Locator at 
800-677-1116 or go to www.shiptalk.org or www.hapnetwork.org/
ship-locator for an updated number. (Find out more about the Eldercare 
Locator in the next section.)

The Eldercare Locator
The Eldercare Locator is a free public service run by the U.S. Administration 
on Aging. It acts as a national clearinghouse for Americans age 60 and over to 
find help and resources in their own communities. It can connect you to local 
agencies and organizations that provide many different kinds of services and 
assistance programs, typically those that help people continue to function at 
home or in their communities as they age.
 
 Phone: 800-677-1116 (toll-free), Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Eastern Time. The Language Line can handle 150 languages.
 
 Web: www.eldercare.gov. (For a list of links to home- and community-
based services, go to www.n4a.org/locator/el_hcbs.cfm.)
Independent Sources of Direct Help
The following agencies are nonprofit organizations that are very similar to the 
SHIPs I list earlier. They offer free direct help to consumers on Part D issues, but 
are national and sometimes provide more specialized services. They also act as 
advocates on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries in Congress and state legislatures.
The Medicare Rights Center
The Medicare Rights Center (MRC) is an independent, New York-based organiza-
tion that offers information and free legal help and representation on Medicare 
issues to consumers throughout the country. It also acts as a consumer watch-
dog and advocate for improving Medicare benefits (including Part D).

340
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
 Consumer hot line: Call 800-333-4114 (toll-free), Monday through Friday 
between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Time, to talk to a counselor about 
health insurance options, Medicare rights and protections, billing prob-
lems and payment denials, and complaints and appeals.
 
 Medicare appeals hot line: Call 888-466-9050 (toll-free) Monday through 
Thursday, noon to 2 p.m. Eastern Time to leave a message. This service 
provides free help with appeals if your Medicare health plan or Part D 
plan has denied you care or coverage that you need.
 
 LINCS hot line: Call this program only if you’re a low-income New Yorker. 
LINCS (Linking Individuals in Need to Care and Services) can help you 
apply for Extra Help in Part D and/or connect you to other programs in 
New York that may reduce your prescription drug costs. Call 888-795-4627 
(toll-free).
 
 Online information: For consumer guides on Medicare and the option 
of receiving free newsletters by e-mail or joining online seminars on 
Medicare topics, go to www.medicarerights.org.
The National Alliance for Hispanic Health
The National Alliance for Hispanic Health (NAHH) promotes the health and 
well-being of Hispanics through community programs that reach more than 
14 million Hispanics throughout the country. It provides written information 
and free counseling services in English and Spanish on health programs for 
consumers of all ages, including direct help on Part D drug coverage. Based 
in Washington, D.C., NAHH is also a leader in advocacy and research for 
Hispanic health.
 
 Phone: You can call the National Hispanic Family Health Helpline 
(Su Familia) at 866-783-2645 toll-free Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m. Eastern Time, for free one-on-one counseling on any health issue. 
A popular part of this service is personal help with Part D, including 
finding a drug plan and applying for Extra Help.
 
 Web: The NAHH Web site at www.hispanichealth.org has a wealth 
of health information and publications in English and Spanish. For 
Medicare information, click “Community” and then “Medicare.”
The National Asian Pacific Center 
on Aging
The National Asian Pacific Center on Aging (NAPCA) promotes the health and 
well-being of senior Asians and Pacific Islanders throughout the U.S. through 
advocacy, education, and direct help. It provides details on a range of aging 
issues and free counseling to help navigate Part D drug coverage.

341
 Appendix B: Sources of Help
 
 Phone: The NAPCA National Toll-free Multilingual Helpline Center specif-
ically deals with Part D issues, offering personal bilingual counseling on 
any aspect of the program — choosing a plan, helping with enrollment, 
applying for Extra Help, and troubleshooting problems. Call 800-582-4218 
(Chinese); 800-582-4259 (Korean); 800-582-4336 (Vietnamese); or 800-
336-2722 (English).
 
 Web: The NAPCA Web site at www.napca.org has information for 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on healthcare and long-term care, 
employment, education, welfare reform, and many other issues.
Resources for Saving Money
The following resources can help you save money on prescription drugs 
through various public and private programs for people with limited 
incomes:
 
 BenefitsCheckUp (www.benefitscheckup.org): This Web site, a 
service of the National Council on Aging, allows you to find national, 
regional, state, or local programs that provide benefits you may qualify 
for without realizing it — or perhaps never knew existed. It has helped 
more than 2 million users find more than $6 billion in benefits. Online, 
you’re asked about your zip code, age, health status, family circum-
stances, and income. You do not give your name, address, or any other

Appendix C
Buying Prescription Drugs Safely 
from Abroad
I
n Chapter 16, I mention the possibility of buying prescription drugs from 
abroad by mail order as a way to lower expenses in Part D’s doughnut 
hole (formally called the coverage gap). You need to weigh the pros and 
cons, but if you decide to go this route, your chief concern is to make sure 
you order from a legitimate, licensed pharmacy that sends you the drugs 
your doctor prescribed.
Importing prescription drugs from abroad is still illegal in the United States. 
(Congress has passed legislation to legalize the practice, but it has never 
been put into effect, for reasons explained in Chapter 21.) However, no 
American has ever been prosecuted for importing drugs for his own personal 
use, and it’s extremely unlikely that anybody would be. For the millions 
of otherwise law-abiding citizens who’ve ordered prescription drugs from 
abroad — mostly senior citizens before Medicare drug coverage began in 
2006 — it’s a no-brainer. The same meds that cost a fortune without insur-
ance in the U.S. can often be bought from Canada and other countries, where 
drug prices are nationally regulated, for much less.
Certainly, getting drugs from abroad can be risky — unless you’re careful. 
Unscrupulous sellers who lurk behind anonymous Web sites peddle coun-
terfeit and other harmful drugs. Scammers will take your money without 
sending you any meds. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regularly cites 
these reasons in warning Americans against buying drugs from abroad.
But many reputable online pharmacies sell bona fide prescription drugs to 
Americans safely and ethically. This appendix shows you how to find those 
that offer quality services and how to avoid the ones that are dubious. It also 
suggests ways of locating pharmacies that have been prescreened for safety 
and service by state governments or organizations that give seals of approval 
to online pharmacies that meet certain standards.

346
Part VI: Appendixes 
In these pages, I focus on ordering drugs from licensed Canadian pharma-
cies. The Canadian federal and provincial governments regulate pharmacy 
practices and drug safety as rigorously as American health authorities do, 
and after nearly a decade of experience in the cross-border trade, these phar-
macies have an established track record. They operate mail-order services 
because that’s the only way most Americans can buy drugs from Canada, 
although many people living in the northern-most states physically cross the 
border to fill prescriptions in regular drugstores. The mail-order pharmacies 
maintain Web sites that state their drug prices and policies and allow you to 
order online.
 
What if you don’t have Internet access? You can order meds by phone from 
a mail-order pharmacy, but first you’ll usually need someone to go online to 
look for a reputable one (by using the suggestions in this chapter) and find its 
phone number. Or you can call one of the state-operated services that provide 
links to prescreened Canadian pharmacies, as described later in this chapter.
Distinguishing the Good Guys 
from the Bad
Just because an online pharmacy says it’s based in Canada doesn’t mean it 
is. And just because it has a Canadian address doesn’t mean it necessarily 
provides good service. Here are ways to evaluate legitimate pharmacies and 
avoid dubious sellers so you can be more confident that the medications 
you’ll receive are the ones your doctor prescribed.
Assessing safe and ethical service
 
American and Canadian pharmacy experts recommend that you choose an 
online pharmacy that uses the following best practices of
 
 Displaying on its Web site its license number and the name of the 
Canadian regulatory agency that granted it. This means you can 
check that it’s an authentic pharmacy. As an American, you have the 
same right to complain about a pharmacy to its licensing agency as a 
Canadian does.
 
 Displaying on its Web site the approval seals of organizations that set 
standards for safety and service and accredit pharmacies that meet 
the standards. See the next section for details of these organizations and 
how to ensure that the seals posted on pharmacy Web sites are genuine.

347
 Appendix C: Buying Prescription Drugs Safely from Abroad
 
 Requiring a prescription from your doctor. This isn’t a hassle — it’s 
your best safety protection. Some reputable pharmacies may allow you 
to fax in the prescription, but will then phone your doctor to confirm the 
prescription or wait until they receive the original one in the mail before 
filling your order.
 
 Requiring you to have taken the drug for at least one month before you 
order by mail so you and your doctor know it’s working well for you.
 
 Requiring you to submit details of your medical history, usually 
through an online questionnaire.
 
 Stating its policy for ensuring your medical and personal privacy in 
clear language on its Web site.
 
 Sending drugs in the manufacturer’s original container with seals 
intact. This is normal practice among reputable Canadian pharmacies. 
In some cases, though, they may send drugs in regular pharmacy bottles 
if the manufacturer’s own containers hold different quantities than you 
order.
 
 Sending drugs with labeling written in English that includes strength, 
dosing directions, expiration date, appropriate warnings, and a Drug 
Identification Number (DIN) that shows the drug has been approved 
by the Canadian government health authorities.
 
 Explaining differences between American and Canadian drug names 
and labeling. The same drugs sometimes have different names in other 
countries.
 
 Explaining why it can’t provide certain drugs. Reputable pharma-
cies don’t sell drugs that are regarded as controlled substances under 
American law (like narcotics), or drugs that can’t be sent safely through 
the mail (such as some that require careful handling or refrigeration).
 
 Providing a full mailing address and a toll-free phone number on its 
Web site so you can call the pharmacist with questions, check on the 
status of an order, or order by phone instead of online if you prefer.
 
 Displaying on its Web site full information about shipping fees, pay-
ment policies, and refunds. Reputable pharmacies offer encrypted (that 
is, secure) online payment for credit cards, alternative payment options 
(such as electronic fund transfers and regular checks), and don’t charge 
any separate fees except for shipping.
 
 Charging the cost of drugs to your credit card only when they’ve been 
shipped to you — and not when the order is first placed.
 
 Refunding your money or shipping replacement drugs immediately 
if your order doesn’t arrive. Reputable pharmacies will do this even if 
your shipment is intercepted and confiscated by U.S. Customs, a prac-
tice that has happened in the past but has become much rarer in recent 
years since Congress condemned it.

Part VI: Appendixes 
Avoiding scams and dubious sellers
 
The snake oil salesmen are still out there and thriving — though these days 
they’re usually peddling fake Viagra and other drugs that folks feel too shy to 
ask their doctors about. These are basic guidelines for avoiding unscrupulous 
sellers and counterfeit drugs:
 
 Never use an online pharmacy that offers to sell you a prescription 
drug without a doctor’s prescription. This is the number-one no-no — a 
clear sign of unethical and potentially dangerous practices.
 
 Never use an online pharmacy that sends you an uninvited e-mail. 
Those unwanted e-mails that pop up so frequently in your in-box should 
always be seen as outright attempts to scam you. Delete them!
 
 Don’t trust an online pharmacy that doesn’t display a customer ser-
vice number on its Web site. If there’s no phone number, you can’t con-
tact the pharmacy — so how can you know it actually exists?
Finding a Pharmacy You Can Trust
The best way to find reputable licensed pharmacies that give quality ser-
vice is to use some kind of filter — that is, a system that has already identi-
fied pharmacies that operate according to the best practices listed in the 
“Assessing safe and ethical service” section. In the following sections, I sug-
gest two types of filters:
 
 Programs set up by state governments to link consumers to prescreened 
Canadian pharmacies
 
 Organizations that give seals of approval to online pharmacies that meet 
their standards
Using state links to Canadian pharmacies
 
In 2003–04, two state governors lost patience waiting for the federal govern-
ment to legally allow people access to low-cost prescription drugs from 
Canada. Both governors created Web sites offering links to Canadian phar-
macies that state health officials have prescreened and regularly inspect to 
ensure safety and quality service.

349
 Appendix C: Buying Prescription Drugs Safely from Abroad
 
 Minnesota RxConnect: This program, set up by Minnesota Governor 
Tim Pawlenty in 2003, offers links to four prescreened Canadian phar-
macies. Some other states (and the District of Columbia) direct their 
residents to this program, but residents of any state can use it. Go to 
rxconnect.dhs.state.mn.us and click “Order Your Medicine from 
Canada.” Or call 800-333-2433.
 
 Illinois I-SaveRx: This program, created by Illinois Governor Rod 
Blagojevich in 2004, offers a link to one prescreened Canadian pharmacy. 
The program is open to residents of Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Vermont, 
and Wisconsin. Call 866-472-8333 or go online to www.i-saverx.net.
Looking online for seals of approval
 
Hundreds of advertisements for low-cost prescription drugs litter the Internet, 
aimed at Americans who are trying to save money on their prescriptions. 
Every time you go online to search for any medical topic, these ads pop up on-
screen in profusion. Some are legitimate, and some are total rip-offs. How can 
you tell which are which? You can’t. However, you can play it safe. Ignore the 
ads. Instead, look for licensed pharmacies that display, on their Web sites, the 
seals of approval awarded by organizations that have screened them to meet 
certain safety and service standards.
Here’s where those seals of approval come from:
 
 Internet and Mail-Order Pharmacy Accreditation Commission (IMPAC): 
IMPAC was founded in 2003 in Vermont by an independent group of 
doctors and pharmacists to promote consumer safety and quality service 
among licensed mail-order pharmacies in the U.S. and other countries. 
A pharmacy must meet rigorous standards during a two-day on-site 
inspection every two years to receive and retain IMPAC accreditation. 
To see a list of the currently accredited pharmacies, go to www.impac
survey.org or call 800-677-7019.
 
 Canadian International Pharmacy Association (CIPA): CIPA was formed 
in 2002 to represent licensed Canadian pharmacies that sell prescription 
drugs to Americans by mail order and that meet its safety, service, and 
ethical standards. The group has testified before Congress and state 
legislatures to address safety issues and to promote U.S. legalization of 
the cross-border trade for consumers buying prescription drugs from 
Canada for their personal use. To verify that a pharmacy is currently 
accredited by CIPA, go to www.ciparx.ca.

350
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
 Better Business Bureau (BBB): The BBB awards its BBBOnline seal of 
approval to Web sites that meet its standards for ethical service, trust-
worthy business practices, and truth in advertising. You can check out 
BBB records for an online pharmacy, including whether the BBB has 
received consumer complaints about it, at www.bbbonline.org. If you 
go to a pharmacy Web site that displays the BBB seal, clicking the seal 
will take you straight to the BBB report on that pharmacy.
 
 PharmacyChecker.com: This Web site, run by an independent American 
consumer research group, provides ratings and drug price comparisons 
for about 30 online pharmacies in the US. and abroad (mainly Canada). It 
gives its “verification” seal to those that meet five service standards — it’s 
licensed, requires a doctor’s prescription, displays its address and phone 
number, offers secure online financial transactions, and promises privacy 
for medical information. The site also posts names of “rogue” pharmacies 
that it considers unethical or unsafe. It compares prices for more than 
1,000 drugs at verified pharmacies and posts customers’ comments on 
quality of service. Check it out at www.pharmacychecker.com.
 
Approval seals awarded by these organizations provide a useful guide for 
consumers looking for a legitimate online pharmacy. However — wouldn’t you 
know? — some scam artists use these seals too to cheat customers by post-
ing copies of them on their own rogue Web sites. The copies are good — you 
wouldn’t know the difference just by looking at them. However, you can verify 
whether the displayed seals are genuine or fraudulent. Clicking the image of 
a seal on a pharmacy Web site should take you straight to the Web site of the 
organization that awarded it, whether IMPAC, CIPA, BBB, or PharmacyChecker. 
If nothing happens, you can be sure that the seal isn’t genuine. Or you can go 
directly to the organization’s Web site and enter the name of the pharmacy. 
This will tell you whether the pharmacy is entitled to display the seal.
