Preface
“It is characteristic of mankind to make as little adjustment as possible 
in customary ways in the face of new conditions.”
— Robert and Helen Lynd
The United States Declaration of Independence was a revolutionary 
document to assert people’s rights to pursue happiness. The world had 
to wait over two centuries for the scientific study of joy and fulfillment. 
Emotional Intelligence has uncovered a profound link between happiness, 
health, and well-being. This fusion of emotion and intellect signifies a 
significant shift in our understanding of the human psyche, as positive 
psychology highlights the importance of emotions in the family, 
workplace, and even law enforcement. 
In an age where technological revolution promises astonishing 
transformations in work and social life, it becomes imperative to 
understand the nuances of human cognition and emotion. Artificial 
Intelligence transforms the workplace, liberating us from many tasks with 
the potential to make work exciting, challenging, and humane. We are at 
a crucial moment when focusing on intellect requires capitalizing on the 
diverse cultural, racial, and sexual human potential.
This book, Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience, 
ventures into the intricate realms of emotions and consciousness, 
juxtaposing scientific explorations with philosophical discourses. 
The human mind is a complex and mysterious entity shaped by 
millions of years of evolution. While we celebrate its logic, creativity, and 
emotional capabilities, it also harbors quirky, baffling, and weird qualities. 
In a radical departure from traditional neuroscience, this book builds on 
this strange duality to search for answers for emotions and consciousness 
in the realms of physics. 
This journey creates a new foundation for human motivation, which 
might serve as the foundation of future society. The underlying thesis is 

Preface  v
that emotionally secure and content individuals are intrinsically motivated 
to work toward the greater good. Productive citizens will actively chart 
the direction of the increasingly faster-paced technological progress.
Environmental factors, such as residence, parents’ occupation, and 
income, influence a child’s IQ.1 The essential role of the home in personal 
development leads to intergenerational stability of beliefs. According to 
some Biblical interpretations, the Israelites could not enter the Promised 
Land with a slave’s mind. The psychological renewal took forty years of 
desert wandering because the older generation had to die off. Can social 
transformation happen at a faster pace? This book offers a fast track for 
societal evolution.
Personal skills (so-called “soft skills”) can dramatically improve the 
social environments. Although changing the mind and mastering emotions 
is possible at any age, teaching social skills can start in Kindergarten. 
Although feeling permanent, our mindset changes constantly as we try 
to keep up with our environments. Career changes, adult education, 
and social changes continuously update our understanding. These skills 
can transform societal interactions by fostering fairness, honesty, and 
collaboration. The book underscores the idea that physical exertion can 
increase physical fitness, and overcoming mental challenges can pave the 
way for wisdom and contentment. 
For example, at the turn of the twentieth century, cars began to clog the 
streets and cities. Cities responded by setting up roles to regulate traffic. 
Yet, initially, drivers resisted the need to obey these laws. Nevertheless, 
we cannot imagine our congested roadways and fast-paced traffic without 
following traffic rules. This book introduces an operational understanding 
of emotions. It supplies internal motivation for change, with the potential 
to fundamentally transform our social fabric. 
In the intricate tapestry of human experience, emotions and 
consciousness weave the threads that define our existence. From the gentle 
caress of joy to the depths of sorrow’s abyss, from the spark of curiosity to 
the fire of passion, our emotions color our lives, shaping our perceptions 
and driving our actions. At the heart of it all lies consciousness, that 
enigmatic beacon of awareness that illuminates the landscape of our minds.
The tome stands as a testament to the prescience of the Declaration 
of Independence. It emphasizes the democratization of well-being as a 
bulwark against societal discord. “Emotional Reasoning” is not just a 
book; it’s a journey. A journey that acquaints readers with the intricate 
workings of their minds and provides practical tools for self-betterment.

Introduction
The very essence of science lies in expanding and challenging the 
established norms and boundaries of our understanding. Still, proposing a 
novel hypothesis is a bold undertaking, fraught with uncertainty and risks. 
Questioning long-held beliefs often triggers resentment and skepticism, if 
not outright mockery. However, new ideas should be evaluated on their 
ability to solve pressing conflicts and simplify fundamental problems. 
A retrospective journey through the annals of scientific history reveals 
a path dotted with uncertainties and groundbreaking revelations. Though 
seminal in their contributions, figures like Newton weren’t exempt from 
misadventures in their quest for knowledge. Though postulated by 
respected physicists, current theories, such as the multiverse concept, 
sometimes challenge foundational principles of physics. Like Newton’s 
occult explorations, the multiverse concept disregards fundamental 
physical principles, such as energy conservation. 
Hence, scientific brilliance does not render someone immune to error. 
Science’s annals are filled with luminaries like Wegener, Mendel, and 
Darwin, whose pioneering theories, though initially met with skepticism 
or ridicule, shaped the foundations of their respective fields. Such tales are 
a reminder of the dangers of rigid thinking and the importance of keeping 
an open mind in science.
There is an automatic jerk reaction of hostility or outright derision 
to ideas outside the established norms. Darwin, for example, harbored 
such apprehension of ridicule that he delayed publishing his findings for 
decades. Is it possible to do better? I believe so. The merit of a scientific 
theory should be based on its ability to yield fresh perspectives (Doerig 
et al., 2022).   
This book offers a radical hypothesis to uncover the nature of 
consciousness that bridges the worlds of neuroscience, psychology, and 
physics. It suggests that interacting with the environment through the 
sensory system makes our brains part of its energy-information cycle. This 
continuous exchange, subject to the laws of physics, might hold the key 

Introduction  xiii
to unraveling the nature of consciousness. The brain’s ability to consume 
information and build intellect inspires a spiritual wonder and awe at 
the coherence of reality and our deep connection to the physical universe 
(Preston et al., 2023). 
While animal life-cycles are bound to the changing seasons, yet remain 
unchanged over millions of years. Most of human existence followed a 
similar patern, with most people, including virtually all peasants were 
illiterate, plagued by disease, frequent bouts of starvation, and worries of 
survival. 
Recent technological advancements and societal shifts have drastically 
influenced our life trajectories. Today, the concept of self-realization 
and finding purpose is no longer confined to a select few philosophers, 
scientists, or spiritual leaders. The democratization of knowledge and the 
onset of the technological era have made it possible for every individual 
to seek a life of meaning and purpose. The unending flow of information 
about technical and social changes dictates a fast pace of change in our 
minds. The inability to keep pace with this rapid change can trigger 
mental conflict, anxiety, and even depression.
This very idea of purpose and meaning lies at the core of this volume. 
It posits that updating understanding and purpose inherently goes 
hand-in-hand with morality and ethics. We are at a threshold of a paradigm 
change, where we have the tools needed to discover our purpose and role in 
the world. In the past, only philosophers, religious leaders, and artists had 
the luxury to reach their full potential. With the spread of automatization 
and artificial intelligence (AI), living with meaning is becoming possible 
for everyone. 
The availability of tools to achieve personal meaning and satisfaction 
inspires trust in the system, provides optimism for the future, and dictates 
a strong sense of community, making actions that harm society or disrupt 
the social fabric inherently repulsive. 
The natural laws governing our interaction with the environment and 
the role of emotions in our relationships and lives are the deeply seated 
qualities of our personal universe. The book you keep in your hands 
offers a guide to this paradigm. When you finish this book, you will 
understand how the mind operates and have hands-on tools to initiate 
positive life changes for you and your loved ones. Understanding these 
vital relationships and subject matter will put you at the forefront of a 
rising social tide. 
This practical guidebook will expand your mind. You may have to 
reconsider some preconceptions about emotions and behavior. Your

action plan (even minor modifications in thinking and behavior) will 
enhance your contentment and better your life. 
I hope this tome serves as a catalyst, sparking curiosity and fostering a 
sense of emotional equilibrium and purpose. With newfound knowledge 
and tools, readers will be well-equipped to navigate life’s challenges, 
making meaningful and positive contributions to society. As you delve 
deeper into the intricacies of the human mind and its interplay with the 
environment, you’ll realize that the pursuit of truth and understanding 
is not just a scientific endeavor but a deeply personal and transformative 
journey.

Chapter 1
The Brain
“The human brain has 100 billion neurons, each neuron connected 
to 10 thousand other neurons. Sitting on your shoulders is the most 
complicated object in the known universe.”
— Michio Kaku
The subject of consciousness has intrigued humanity throughout the 
ages. The fast progress in neuroscience recently gave rise to the optimistic 
expectation that the understanding of consciousness was just around the 
corner. However, the 25 years old bet between a cocky neuroscientist 
(Christof Koch) and philosopher (David Chalmers) was decided in the 
philosopher’s favor. Neuroscience still has no idea how the brain achieves 
consciousness, forms emotions, or the exact definition of these concepts. 
It is a fascinating enigma of how a mere lump of brain matter can 
harbor, transmit, and receive vast amounts of information, conjure 
subjective conscious experiences, and even introspect upon itself. The 
mind-body problem and the personal nature of experiences present 
persistent challenges. In the pursuit of identifying the neural correlates of 
consciousness (NCC), techniques such as functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) serve as windows 
offering glimpses into the dynamic brain activity during conscious states. 
The “global workspace” concept proposes that consciousness emerges 
when information integrates across various brain regions, enabling 
cohesive awareness.
Altered states of consciousness caused by anesthesia, meditation, 
or psychedelics can uncover the mechanisms underlying shifts between 
conscious and unconscious states. The interdisciplinary synergy of 
advanced brain imaging techniques and AI has become indispensable 
in grappling with these complex questions. However, our quest to 
understand consciousness must start with a comprehensive overview of 
the brain’s architecture. 

2 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
How did the brain, the body’s most complicated part, emerge? In the 
tapestry of evolution, the Planaria might be the first brainy animal and the 
possible ancestor of the vertebrate brain. This remarkable organism boasts 
unparalleled regenerative abilities, capable of regrowing an entire body 
from a mere 1/100th of its original form. Its capacity to regenerate a new 
head or tail renders it a favored subject in organ and limb regeneration 
research studies.
The sensory neuron serves as the sentinel, detecting specific stimuli 
like touch or chemical cues and relaying the information to the interneuron. 
The interneuron, in turn, processes the sensory input and generates a 
response signal, which is transmitted to the motor neuron. Finally, the 
motor neuron sends commands to the muscles for coordinated movement 
or behavior.
In the narrative of evolution, the subsequent pivotal phase involves 
the development of the limbic brain, a conglomerate of structures located 
above the brainstem. In creatures ranging from fishes to reptiles, the 
superior sensory processing capacity of the limbic brain facilitates the 
development of finely coordinated behaviors. For instance, agile sharks’ 
ability to sense their prey’s minuscule electromagnetic fields transforms 
them into adept predators.
The culmination of the brain’s evolutionary journey resides in the 
cortex, the epicenter of consciousness and emotions. Complex emotions, 
the bedrock of intelligent social conduct, memories, learning, and strategic 
planning, are rooted in this complex web of neural connections. It is to the 
cortical brain that our focus now turns as we strive to unveil the intricacies 
and dimensions of consciousness.
The Anatomy of the Brain 
“The brain is just the weight of God.” — Emily Dickinson
In ancient thought, the philosopher Aristotle postulated that the seat of 
perception and the soul’s self-nourishment must reside within the heart. 
To him, the brain merely served as a radiator, a mechanism to prevent the 
heart from overheating. However, the strides of neuroscience have since 
relegated the heart to the periphery, elevating the brain as the pivotal hub 
for perception and the orchestration of the soul. 
Biological functions such as heart rate and aerobic capacity boast 
distinct and defined energy requisites. Yet, these demands pale compared 
to the brain’s insatiable appetite, consuming a staggering 20% of the 
body’s oxygen and 25% of its glucose, underscoring the indisputable 
primacy of cognition. Orchestrated by the intricate interplay of countless 
neurons, our actions arise from the simple act of walking to the complex 

 The Brain 3 
realms of artistic creation or primal instincts like ‘fight’ or ‘flight’. Indeed, 
the brain stands as the supreme command center (as depicted in Figure 1).
Even amidst the cacophony of sensory inputs, the brain makes sense 
of the outside world with remarkable fluency. This feat is achieved 
through three intertwined, progressively complex modules operating in 
a meticulous hierarchy. Each stage of sensory processing builds upon the 
last, fostering escalating intricacy and nuance.
The initial evaluation of sensory inputs within the brainstem serves 
as a swift precursor to the subsequent assessments carried out within the 
limbic system, culminating in cortical perception. The transient activations 
of the prefrontal cortex act as the alchemical catalysts, conjuring forth the 
intimate realm of private consciousness.
The Brainstem 
Nestled at the brain’s foundational core, the brainstem serves as a nexus 
between the cerebral expanse and the spinal cord (depicted in Figure 1). 
Analogous to an old switchboard, this ancient region presides over vital 
functions—posture, respiration, and slumber—comprising the inaugural 
step in sensory processing. Its extensive interconnections with the cortex, 
primarily the frontal domain, bestow the ability to swiftly craft overarching 
sensory impressions and responses inherently influenced by one’s mood.
Moreover, the brainstem assumes the role of a pivotal crossroads, 
where incoming sensory signals traverse from one side of the body to 
the opposite hemisphere of the brain, only to return as outgoing motor 
innervations bound for the muscles. These incoming environmental 
signals undergo a transformative translation, manifesting as synchronized 
Figure 1. Information flow in the human brain during a stimulus. FC (Frontal cortex), 
VC (visual cortex). The stimulus arrives in the brainstem and moves to the limbic brain. 
The cortical processing begins in the sensory cortex and continues in the frontal, associative 
areas. Response to stimulus coincides with the reversal of the information flow.

rhythmic patterns known as the brain’s oscillations or brain waves, 
effectively encoding spatial relationships into neural symphonies.
The Cerebellum
Nestled beneath the cerebrum, the cerebellum may constitute merely 
10% of the brain’s overall weight. However, it houses a staggering 80% of 
the brain’s neurons, dedicated to orchestrating the symphony of muscle 
movements and maintaining posture. Its specialized sensors are attuned 
to discern even the subtlest shifts in balance, promptly dispatching signals 
to establish harmonious connections. Beyond this role as the guardian of 
physical equilibrium, the cerebellum assumes a more intricate mantle, 
deftly refining movements through repeated practice. Moreover, it takes 
on the crucial responsibilities of governing eye movements, facilitating 
language processing, and weaving the intricate fabric of memory.
The Limbic Brain 
Positioned atop the brainstem, the limbic brain forms a cohesive assembly 
of modular structures (depicted in Figure 1). It serves as a dynamic 
interface bridging the cerebral cortex’s intellectual capacities with the 
subconscious, autonomic functions anchored within the brainstem. 
Intriguingly, these limbic modules seamlessly integrate into the cortical 
regulatory circuits, assuming a pivotal role in orchestrating cognition, 
emotions, and memory.
Within this intricate network of modules, the amygdala emerges 
as a critical contributor to the genesis of emotions, particularly evident 
in processes like fear conditioning. Meanwhile, at the heart of this 
arrangement lies the hippocampus, acting as the epicenter for the 
repository of memories and facilitating spatial orientation. Given 
cognition’s profound reliance on an acute environmental awareness, any 
disruption leading to spatial confusion directly imperils the fabric of one’s 
sense of self. This phenomenon frequently stands as the harbinger, the 
initial symptom heralding the onset of various mental disorders.
The thalamus is a central information relay and processing station 
before the cerebral cortex. Input from all sensory systems except the 
olfactory system is processed and filtered in its two large lobes. Likewise, 
signals from the basal ganglia and cerebellum are relayed to the motor 
cortex. The thalamus also generates sleep spindles,2 contributing to 
emotion, pain, and memory formation. In addition, it has an essential role 
in regulating sleep and wakefulness.
2	 Sleep spindles are bursts of brain activity during sleep.

 The Brain 5 
The Cortex 
The brain’s outermost layer, the cortex, is a convoluted gray neural tissue 
enveloping the limbic structure. Yet, despite its prominence, the unique 
arrangement of folds, characterized by gyri and sulci, has remained 
an enigma in the realm of neuroscience. The question persists: What 
underlying rationale might account for the cerebral wrinkling that defines 
the cortex?
Central to the cortex’s role is its function as an information processing 
hub, diligently sifting through inputs from the sensory system. This role 
requires proportionality between cortical volume and the organism’s size, 
leading to a curious relationship. As the brain grows in tandem with an 
animal’s dimensions, the cortical volume, stretched into a thin veneer, 
undergoes an exponential expansion that far outpaces the brain’s increase 
in volume. In response, the burgeoning cortical tissue folds and crinkles, 
a strategy to ensure it remains intricately connected to the underlying 
neural substrates, as highlighted by research led by Im et al. (2018).
In larger animals, the remarkably intricate accordion-like folds within 
the cortex facilitate the emergence of traveling cortical waves (Pang et al., 
2023). The inherent robustness of the cortical architecture molds these 
waves, invoked by tasks, into expansive brain-wide patterns akin to the 
undulating crests of ocean waves. These globally synchronized waves 
ripple through both cortical and subcortical structures in harmony with 
states of arousal. This orchestration underpins the brain’s extraordinary 
intellectual prowess.
Muscle Twitches: During REM sleep, our bodies are partly paralyzed, but 
muscle twitches activate the sensorimotor cortex, which is responsible for 
movement coordination. These meticulous and precise twitches aid in 
developing a sense of self-awareness and body comprehension. During 
the gestational period, spontaneous muscle activations set in motion a 
cascade that unfurls the fetal brain’s long-range neuronal connections. 
Concurrently, the intricate process of selective pruning clears away 
superfluous neuronal links. Adolescence marks a pivotal phase, refining 
the synaptic map to mirror individual experiences and the evolving 
contours of the body.
Unveiling an intricate dance of interactions, the brain’s connection 
map becomes as idiosyncratic as fingerprints, a testament to the relentless 
optimization of neural circuits through regular engagements. This 
intricate network orchestrates a seamless translation of neural innervation 
into impeccably precise muscular movements effortlessly summoned at a 
moment’s notice. However, as the stage of life advances into the realm of 
aging, a secondary phase of irreversible decline befalls the once-stabilized 
adult connection map, embodying the transient nature of human existence.

6 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
The Brain as a Pinhole Camera (Camera Obscura)
“Who would believe that so small a space could contain the images of the 
whole universe?” — Leonardo Da Vinci
How does the brain reconstruct the symphony of sounds, the tapestry of 
scents, the mosaic of images, the choreography of movement, the textures 
of touch, and even the echoes of pain? The elucidation of these mysteries 
might draw inspiration from the annals of physics. However, exploring 
this insight must start in an artist’s studio. 
Venturing back to the nineteenth century, we encounter the practices 
of European artists who harnessed the pinhole camera to replicate 
visual imagery (as depicted in Figure 2). This ingenious contraption, a 
light-proof box punctuated by a minuscule aperture, could project a 
diminutive yet inverted depiction of a lit scene onto the box’s inner rear 
surface. Strikingly, this process bears a remarkable semblance to the 
sensory cortex’s inverted portrayal of the surrounding world.
A remarkable dance of sensory data unfolds as sensory data from 
the left of the body is processed in the right side of the cortex and vice 
versa. This arrangement extends even to vision, where signals from the 
right eye journey to the left side of the brain. A symphony of reciprocity 
unfurls as motor innervation traverses sides en route to the muscles. The 
complexities do not halt at mere inversion; they extend to processing 
inputs upside-down. Thus, the toes communicate sensations to the 
cerebral hemisphere’s upper reaches. 
At the same time, the head and hands find representation along the 
cortex’s flanks, culminating in the face being relegated to the furthest 
reaches. This intricately orchestrated symphony persists in outgoing 
impulses to the motor cortex, adhering to the identical organizational 
blueprint. In the above organization, the strongest cortical field at the 
center ensures the cohesion of extremities. Inversely, the innervation of 
the hands and face at an extreme distance from the center allows fine 
manipulation. 
Within the brainstem, the juncture where neural pathways traverse 
between the cortex and the body resembles the mechanism of a pinhole 
camera. As the infant’s brain takes tentative steps in deciphering this 
inverted sensory map, an uncanny mastery over this perceptual inversion 
is acquired. Remarkably, sensory perception is an involuntary pursuit 
entirely distinct from conscious intent. We find ourselves powerless in 
the face of stimuli, unable to halt their reception or our comprehension. 
It is a journey where evolutionary and intellectual advancement unfolds 
irrevocably, forever marching forward. Once we unlock the reading 
skill, decoding the significance of a STOP sign becomes an inexorable 
consequence.

 The Brain 7 
Intriguingly, it’s vital to acknowledge that the brain doesn’t exert 
dominion over its surroundings. Instead, it is a passive conduit, receiving 
and embracing the ceaseless torrent of information cascading from the 
environment.
The Brain’s Operation Predicts the Future
“We tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner to the extent 
that behavior patterns of objects seem to persist into the future, and 
throughout the unobserved present.” — David Hume
The foundation of survival rests upon the delicate balance of accessing 
sustenance and evading threats, indicating the paramount importance of 
information. Within this intricate tapestry, the sensory system emerges 
as an adept collector of this invaluable currency—information. The 
journey commences from stimuli, which promptly metamorphoses into 
electric signals traversing the neuronal network. Within this exchange, a 
minuscule interlude, known as the synapse,3 introduces a slight delay in 
the baton-passing from sender to receiver. This choreography is not static; 
Figure 2. The Pinhole camera. Light only enters the box through a small hole. The umbrella’s

instead, it thrives on an efficiency bolstered by activity and regresses under 
the weight of idleness. This dance of synaptic transfer molds memory and 
etches the learning pathways, enabling better gathering and processing of 
information.
Predictability and Randomness 
Amidst the ebb and flow of our cerebral currents lays predictability and 
randomness, influencing the ongoing brain activity that envelopes our 
mood and attitude. This mental disposition exerts its dominion over our 
sensitivity to external stimuli. Here, our elusive outlook assumes the form 
of a sixth sense, a harbinger that holds the power to sway or even shape 
our perception.
The shifting polarities of electric currents between the neocortex and 
the limbic system craft a symphony of cognitive inference (Deli et al., 
2018). This symphony masterminds the orchestration of minimal energy 
configurations during transitions, ensuring the least energy conformation 
(Pepperell, 2018). It’s this very dance that ushers the evolution of 
consciousness into an abstract mirror, one that faithfully reflects the 
environment. 
Mental Topology: Within this intricate web of connectivity, synaptic 
topology acts as the rudder, steering incoming signals akin to the uneven 
terrains that guide the path of a rolling ball (as depicted in Figure 3). 
Frequented pathways carve valleys while the less trodden trails manifest 
as formidable hills (as illustrated in Figure 4.A). 
Yet, this is no static landscape; alternative synaptic routes unfurl as 
resilient channels, offering a lifeline against minor disruptions like the

demise of a neuron. These secondary passages harbor the capacity for 
unveiling unexpected behaviors and embracing flexibility, a testament to 
their significance within the intricate labyrinth of complex environments. 
The ever-evolving contours of mental evolution are supported by 
psychology and social sciences.

Fractal Structures: In a realm of complexity, signal fragments can unveil 
a statistical essence of the whole. From the undulating rhythms of ocean 
waves to the intricate contours of landscapes, the labyrinthine formations 
of lung tissues, the branching intricacies of trees, and the oscillations 
within an electroencephalogram (EEG), a recurrent motif emerges—a 
symphony of self-similar patterns echoing across myriad levels, known as 
fractals (Zappasodi et al., 2015). These constructs are essential constituents 
of the physical universe and the intricate landscape of the brain 
(Figure 5).
From the Brain to the Mind
“Minds are simply what brains do.” ― Marvin Minsky
The profound inquiry into consciousness resides at the very heart of both 
our spiritual exploration and scientific quest to understand ourselves. 
Consciousness research promises to illuminate our comprehension of 
disorders, the nuances of decision-making, and the intricate tapestry of 
self-awareness. Moreover, this journey stands poised to unfurl the ethical 
and philosophical dimensions underpinning our societal values and 
frameworks.
Consciousness, the quality of the cortical brain, is a puzzling inner 
cosmos. Existing within precise anatomical boundaries, the brain gives 
rise to a mind with limitless imagination and potential. The enigmatic 
interplay between the mind and the brain has remained an intriguing 
puzzle that continues to captivate. 
Figure 5. The mind as a gyroscope. Expectations direct motivations unconsciously. 
Emotions signify a deviation from expectations, and their intensity is proportional to the 
energy required to restore a neutral state.

 The Brain 11 
The quest of neuropsychology is to decode the psychological and 
mental phenomena as intricate products of the symphony of brain circuits. 
Within this paradigm, the very nature of consciousness must take on a 
physical guise. The mind unfurls as an ever-changing abstract reflection 
of the physical environment. This blueprint empowers it to harmonize 
and modulate behavioral responses with shifting stimuli. Within this 
dynamic, diverse physics frameworks can illuminate the puzzles of 
cognitive sciences (Déli, 2020a, b). 
The cross-pollination of fields in the sciences has led to significant 
advances. Physics has influenced chemistry, biology, and economics 
by exploring matter and energy. Similarly, psychology, for more than 
a century, has harnessed the tools of quantum mechanics to unveil the 
fundamental underpinnings through which concepts intertwine, meld, 
and dance within human cognition (Wendt, 2015). Quantum cognition 
uses the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to shed light on 
memory and decision-making (Basieva et al., 2019). For example, the 
context-dependence of decisions, perception, and attitude potentially 
contribute to the reproducibility crisis within psychology and social 
sciences (Dennett, 2018).
In neuroscience, the brain can be dissected in various meaningful 
ways; however, the mind defies such segmentation. The mind is the 
most fundamental unit of intellect, indivisible by partition constraints. 
The realm of conscious experience is a unique privilege—a first-person 
sojourn into subjective perception, thoughts, and imaginings, shrouded 
in an enigma inaccessible to others. This exquisite process colors even 
our dreams, where odd sounds, scents, or lights weave themselves into 
our slumbering narratives. When prompted, people can smile or frown in 
certain phases of sleep (Türker et al., 2023). 
Merely a few decades ago, the domain of the mind remained 
the exclusive realm of philosophical and religious contemplations. 
However, the advent of cutting-edge technologies affording intimate 
glimpses into the living brain has transfigured cognitive science into a 
thriving interdisciplinary pursuit, embracing the realms of linguistics, 
anthropology, and neuropsychology. With these tools in hand, the once 
elusive nature of consciousness stands poised to emerge from the shadows 
into the light of comprehensive understanding.
The Enigmatic Intricacies of the Human Mind
Human beings have always been intrigued by the mind’s complexities. 
It houses consciousness, memory, emotion, and countless processes 
responsible for our subjective experience. The mind has bewildering 
attributes that, despite scientific advancements, remain perplexing. The 

12 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
intertwining of neuroscience with thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, 
and psychology presents a promising path to unraveling some of the 
mind’s most puzzling attributes. Understanding these complexities, 
particularly from an energetic perspective, a sense of resting state, and the 
relationship between the brain and the mind, provides profound insights 
into our understanding of ourselves.
Energy and the Mind: The human brain is an energy-intensive organ. 
Considering it takes up about 20% of the body’s energy despite being 
just 2% of its mass underscores its significance. Essential cognitive 
functions such as maintaining ionic gradients, synaptic transmission, 
and signal transduction consume this energy. Disturbances in energy 
metabolism can significantly affect mental and immune functions, 
thus making understanding the thermodynamics of the brain critical. 
Intriguingly, the energy demands of processes like consciousness can lead 
to mental fatigue, making being aware and processing information an 
energy-intensive endeavor.
Resting Homeostasis: While the brain is energetically active, it also has a 
resting state. This default mode seems to be the baseline of our cognitive 
existence. Without external stimuli, the mind engages in introspection, 
mind-wandering, and other intricate processes. This homeostatic 
regulation and the balance between evoked and spontaneous activations 
showcase the brain’s adaptability. It’s intriguing how the brain balances 
the dynamic interplay of sensory inputs with a stable, coherent resting 
state, ensuring a continuous experience of self-consciousness. Such a 
balance might be instrumental in understanding memory, learning, and 
the brain’s energy dynamics.
Brain-Mind Relationship: The debate on the relationship between the 
brain (physical matter) and the mind (conscious experience) has raged 
for centuries. Neuroscience challenges traditional dualism but hasn’t 
yet provided a comprehensive explanation. Recent interdisciplinary 
approaches, borrowing from quantum physics, have tried to capture 
the nuances of human cognition, showing promise in understanding the 
elusive nature of consciousness. This bridging of physics with psychology 
is not new; the influences of Jungian psychology on early particle physics 
are a testament to the historical intertwining of these fields.
Emotional Regulation: Another puzzling domain of the human psyche is 
emotion. Sigmund Freud’s work hinted at how deep-rooted emotional 
traumas could manifest into physical and psychological issues. Emotions 
are central to our decision-making processes by influencing our perception 
of time. The interplay between thermodynamics and emotions, which 
could provide insights into how time perception affects our psyche, 
remains an area ripe for exploration.

Chapter 2
How the Brain 
Produces Emotions
“Your intellect may be confused, but your emotions will never lie 
to you.”
― Roger Ebert
Until the end of the eighteenth century, the bedrock of economies lay in 
manual labor. In this realm, the sinewy strength of muscles propelled 
tasks spanning manufacturing, agriculture, and trade. However, this era 
also harbored a subtle yet potent undercurrent—a space where workers 
harnessing their minds’ power could conceive of dangerous notions 
capable of unsettling non-democratic governments. This intellectual 
potency posed a dual threat; a calculated response from oppressive 
regimes propagated a latent fear to subdue dissent while subjugation 
simultaneously created formidable barriers against the pursuit of 
self-realization.
The past hundred years bore witness to a profound and breathtaking 
transformation. This technological upheaval supplanted the sweat-soaked 
toil of physical labor with the prowess of machines. Simultaneously, the 
realm of research illuminated intriguing revelations about the pivotal role 
of attitude and mood in performance. Similar to a burdensome tax, the toll 
of conflicts not only saps morale but also corrodes work efficacy. These 
revelations resonated within a swiftly evolving professional landscape 
that demanded intellectual acrobatics and the cultivation of creativity 
from workers. Companies attuned to this dynamic safeguard their core 
values by weighing the human element4 and cultural resonance in their 
hiring decisions.
4	 The human element is the developer and custodian of the organization’s culture, values, 
and mission.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Nonetheless, for all their strides, societies remained planted within 
the embrace of rigidity. As information technology (IT) professionals 
envision sweeping societal transformations, the bulk of society clings to 
the familiarity of their time-honored ways, a complex juxtaposition that 
engendered profound social inertia in the face of change. The problem is 
severe and requires a complete transformation of social dynamics. 
This intricately woven narrative leads us to an imperative query—
how can families and schools recalibrate their motivational tools, 
transitioning from the dated “carrot and stick” paradigm to the nurturing 
embrace of respect and love? In this journey, our worldview—an intricate 
mosaic etched over millennia through the indelible marks of wars, 
oppression, and the caprices of natural disasters—defies the prospect 
of swift metamorphosis from a realm of fear to one of trust. A striking 
example surfaces within school curricula—meticulously tailored to mirror 
technological progress, yet often bereft of the essential tools to impart the 
delicate nuances of social intelligence.
As a result, the mantle of social learning—a torchbearer transmitting a 
society’s cultural legacy to the next generation—must transpire within the 
home. Within this familial crucible, orchestrated dialogues of verbal and 
non-verbal communication, interwoven with behavioral modeling, serve 
as the conduit for the passage of cultural wisdom from parent to progeny. 
Yet, within this intricate choreography lies an inherent dichotomy. In this 
space, children, like little sponges, absorb not just the nurturing aspects 
but also unwittingly assimilate fears, prejudices, and corrosive narratives. 
Parents can inadvertently undermine their children’s self-assuredness and 
human potential in this dance of influence. Understanding how we can 
transform the dynamics of the home commences with the contemplation 
of the nature of emotions and their intricate genesis.
The Nature of Emotions: Nature’s canvas unfurls, driven by the entropic5 
currents orchestrating grand-scale organization. Within the realm of 
neural dynamics, disturbances trigger a symphony of resting recovery to 
unfold through compensatory emotional responses. These responses form 
a delicate dance—hunger cues the instinct for nourishment, a fall propels 
the quest for rebalancing, and a threat sparks the search for sanctuary. Just 
as the gravitational forces maintain celestial equilibrium, the yearning for 
psychological security is intricately entwined with the fabric of emotional 
balance. Within this symphony, emotions rise as the intimate custodians 
of personal, subjective homeostatic regulation.
Like the equilibrium position for the pendulum, the brain’s resting 
state represents a mental balance (Zanin et al., 2020). Embedded within 
5	 Entropic directionality is the physical environment’s statistical tendency is to move 
toward equilibrium.

How the Brain Produces Emotions  15
the involuntary nature of emotions is a profound revelation—an 
essence that transcends mere feeling and takes on the aura of energy 
(Kao et al., 2015). Furthermore, emotions represent a kaleidoscope of 
multi-dimensional representations and varied cultural and brain activity 
profiles (Nazmi et al., 2020). Nevertheless, emotions’ essence can be 
distilled into positive or negative energy states (Kao et al., 2015). This 
polarity of emotional valence dances between positivity and negativity 
(Hesp et al., 2021), representing an instant feeling for or against
(Surov, 2022). 
The Fundamental Nature of Emotions
“If we resist our passion, it is more due to their weakness than our 
strength.” ― François de La Rochefoucauld 
In 1928, Phillip Bard surgically removed cats’ cortical hemispheres. What 
followed was a revelation that morphed the creatures into vessels of 
unrestrained fury, responding with disproportionate anger to even the 
faintest stimulus. This phenomenon, famously dubbed “sham rage”, 
unfurled as a potent testimony to the indispensability of context—woven 
intricately by the associative realms of the frontal cortex—in shaping the 
contours of an appropriate emotional response.
So, how do emotions form? While the realm of positive feelings often 
feels like magic, the reality is that we’re not immune to the shades of blue, 
the sparks of aggravation, or the tears that well up in response to tragedy. 
While the tapestry of emotional expression takes its cues from the interplay 
of cultural, religious, personal, and social factors, our bodies serve as 
unwitting informants. The canvas of our physiological reactions—the 
shift in skin color, the cascade of tears, or the cadence of laughter—betray 
our internal state. The sinking sensation that grips us might whisper of 
humiliation or the stark isolation we grapple with, while taut muscles and 
a racing heart might sound the siren of imminent peril.
Nevertheless, emotions are a universal undercurrent connecting 
emotional animals (Figure 6). The capacity to produce feelings is 
intertwined with the privilege of recognizing these very feelings. Aesop’s 
ageless parables mirror this essence—projecting the quintessence of 
pride, compassion, and shrewdness onto the animal realm. Concern for 
others rests upon the potent foundations of “feeling the pain of others”, 
an empathy that resonates across species, uniting us in the universality of 
emotional experience.
Emotions persist as a steadfast yet not always conscious state of mind, 
a cornerstone upon which our psychological equilibrium, wellness, and 
health hinge. Insight into this realm can reverberate across domains, 
enriching the tapestry of our relationships, rendering the learning

environment more fertile, amplifying professional prospects, and infusing 
happiness into our homes. This essence serves as a catalyst for creativity, 
an indispensable wellspring in the bedrock of our innovative society.
Mental Energy 
A perpetual influx of sugar and oxygen sustains the intricate neural 
network, serving as the lifeblood that fuels its operations. However, the 
scale of human achievements remains a diverse panorama, a testament 
to the profound impact of motivation—an elusive trait that demands 
unwavering persistence. Within courage and determination, mental energy 
takes center stage, illuminating individual disparities in enthusiasm, 
self-assurance, learning, and creativity (Di Domenico and Ryan, 2017). 
Mental energy has an enduring quality intertwined with intrinsic 
motivation, a potent harbinger that forecasts performance trajectories.
Mental energy is related to emotional intelligence—an attribute 
intricately woven through the tapestry of individuality. This dynamic 
essence transcends the confines of a singular moment, extending 
its influence across the spectrum of personality development and 
well-being landscape (Ryan and Deci, 2017). Notably, the ebbs and flows 
of mental energy, akin to the tides that shape oceanic landscapes, entail 
a thermodynamic expenditure—a testament to the intricate interplay 
between energy dynamics and the nuanced realm of cognition.
Like a boat navigating the vast expanse of an ocean, maneuvering the 
myriad currents of society necessitates confidence. Much like a sturdy 
vessel battling the capricious waves, the journey of intelligence finds its 
cornerstone in a steadfast mental equilibrium. As tumultuous seas can 
spell the doom of a diminutive craft, intelligence relies upon a secure and 
unwavering balance of the mind.

How the Brain Produces Emotions  17
Mental energy is a long-term ability related to intrinsic motivation, 
which predicts performance and plays a vital role in personality 
development and wellness across the lifespan (Ryan and Deci, 2017). 
Significantly, mental energy is the brain’s structural quality; therefore, 
mental energy changes are associated with a thermodynamic cost.
The Role of Emotions in Behavior 
“What drains your spirit drains your body. What fuels your spirit fuels 
your body.” ― Caroline Myss
A scattering experiment propels particles or radiation, such as light or 
sound, toward a medium, redirecting the particles, absorbing them, or 
permitting them to journey unscathed. Measuring the particles’ outgoing 
pattern unveils a trove of insights about the inner structure and properties 
of the medium. In a parallel realm, animals engage with the sensory 
stimuli akin to the incoming radiation in the scattering experiment. 
Primitive animals react predictably, offering a window into their simple 
organizational constructs. 
Contrasting this simplicity, the stage of emotional reaction unfurls a 
tableau that reaches deep into the annals of history—the history of one’s 
journey, the reservoir of mental energy amassed, and the fleeting terrain 
of the psyche’s present state. Like the delicate interplay of particles in the 
scattering experiment, emotional responses mirror the inner landscape, 
echoing the tides of time, the energy ebbs and flows, and the poignant 
essence of the immediate moment.
Just as physical imbalance triggers a flurry of responses, emotional 
and mental instability sets off a cascade that manifests as anxiety. This 
emotion ignites various regulatory frameworks within us. Intricately 
intertwined with our belief systems, these frameworks stand sentinel, 
striving to preserve our psychological equilibrium. Within this realm, 
emotions emerge as forces of motivation, surging through every facet 
of our lives, infusing each stride, choice, and endeavor with energy. 
Nevertheless, this unstoppable power unfurls its influence in the most 
nuanced ways.
The Role of Feelings in Thoughts, Performance, 
and Intellect
In classic models of thinking and decision-making, feelings often stand 
relegated to the domain of irrationality. However, the tides of the past 
decades have ushered in a paradigm shift within neuroscience, uncovering 
the powerful and pervasive role of emotions in cognition, such as 

18 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
decision-making. Emotions are an inherent part of the self, mirroring 
every shift and every alteration of our environment, an essence as innate 
to our psyche as the very breath we draw.
	 •	 Our intuitive gut feelings frequently emerge as the architects of wiser 
decisions than the calculated constructs of rational reasoning. These 
emotions are a continuous presence that wields its sway across the 
myriad facets of life—guiding our culinary choices, determining our 
sitting positions, and steering our needs, desires, and laments. Within 
the symphony of conscious existence, no minute, no second, is devoid 
of the undulating currents of emotion.
	 •	 The study of emotions uncovered the role of relationships at the 
foundation of our psyche. The energy we invest in forging bonds, 
whether with people or tangible elements, makes losses painful. As 
physical pain sets our body’s limitations, spiritual distress casts its 
shadow upon our intellectual freedom. A pursuit to evade the specter 
of pain can sometimes spiral into paranoid self-avoidance.
	 •	 Emotions are intimately intertwined with our core environment. 
Supportive, loving experiences weave a cloak of trusting embrace and 
safety. Within the folds of love, faith, and pride, emotions become 
the fuel that kindles the flame of intellect, breathing life into our 
aspirations and endeavors.
	 •	 Across the tableau of history, luminaries of various domains—
teachers, politicians, artists, and even the shrewd maneuverings of con 
artists—have harnessed the latent power of emotions to manipulate 
people, even entire nations. Within this intricate dance, a poignant 
truth surfaces—people and animals, as the echoes of emotional energy 
reflect back the essence they receive.
	 •	 Nestled as the singular driving force of mammals and birds, emotions 
provoke a profound sense of permanence. Within their tender embrace 
lies the potency to shape destinies, the ability to kindle greatness, and, 
at the darkest fringes, their crushing weight can project the desire for 
suicide. As such, emotions lay the bedrock of intellect—a realm that, 
by its untamable essence, necessitates not control but mastery.
	 •	 With the lens of evolution, emotions emerge as an essential tool—an 
intricate facet of the brain’s sophisticated energy network, the linchpin 
of survival. Emotions are survival tools, crafting the foundation upon 
which intellect flourishes. This bridge integrates the symphony of the 
mind with the ever-shifting landscapes of the environment.

Automatic Behavior
“Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be 
broken.” ― Warren Buffett
The neural system is at the helm of the intricate symphony of intuitive and 
conscious behavior. Within this elaborate dance, we discern a spectrum 
ranging from swift reflexes to contemplative decisions, each echoing the 
increasing depth of conscious and emotional engagement.
1. Autonomic Perceptions
Even amidst the shroud of night, the mind remains attuned to the ceaseless 
inflow of environmental input. A symphony of physiological reactions 
and subtle hormonal shifts plays out beneath the veil of awareness—
expressions etched upon our faces and the tautness of our muscles tell 
tales of our true feelings, often contrary to our conscious intentions. In 
the silent corridors of the mind, experiences are etched anew through 
the strengthening of connections among specific neurons, forging 
transmission pathways. This learning unfolds as a spontaneous process, 
weaving itself without conscious intervention. A familiar sight—a red 
hexagon by the roadside—instigates the automatic identification of the 
stop sign, an emblem of such learning.
2. Automatic Actions
Learning to ride a bike or drive a car formulates the neurons’ precise 
activation sequence. At the level of competence, the reins of emotionally 
driven conscious control loosen, ceding ground to spontaneous action, 
unfurling beyond the reach of deliberate intent. Whether in a debate or 
on the tennis court, performance hinges upon near-instant, millisecond 
reactions to the demands of the environment. Astonishingly, these 
reflexive actions, albeit wielding considerable power over our lives, can 
diverge from the paths laid by logic, reason, and even conscious intention.
In our dynamic existence, moments often rush past without affording 
the luxury of deliberate analysis or contemplative thought. These flashes of 
intuitive decisions, akin to minimal-energy formations, serve as cognitive 
shortcuts, preserving energy and time and bequeathing mental vigor. 
Language generation, for instance, is a symphony of automatic phrasings, 
freeing consciousness to thread meaning, social context, and emotional 
nuances—resulting in variances when addressing a boss, a parent, or a 
friend.
Automatic actions do not involve feelings and do not generate a new 
memory. Like water flowing through an open pipe, autonomous actions 

20 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
are the synaptic freeways of the brain. Once mastered, even complex 
actions, such as flawless star performances, can arise with spontaneous 
ease. Creative shortcuts give rise to the master’s assured brushstroke 
or the pianist’s precise finger movements. Thus, artists do a poor job of 
explaining their work.
3. Habits 
Habits are sculpted through the crucible of reinforcement and repetition. 
Within these finely-honed muscle movements resides a reservoir of 
intuitive precision, bestowing us with confidence within the familiar 
realms of behavior. They weave the fabric of our morning rituals, define 
our customary environments, and shape our social etiquette. Yet, an 
interruption in the fluidity of this automatic signal flow can lead to 
unraveling the very action sequence—spawning errors and sowing seeds 
of confusion. A crying child or an unexpected phone call can taint the 
sacred dance of the morning coffee routine.
Routines also include rigid, formal, and repetitive rituals endowed 
with symbolism and meaning. These can improve individual performance 
and group cohesion.  
The struggle to break free from the clutches of smoking or other 
addictions speaks volumes of habits’ formidable dominion over conscious 
intention. Bad habits, resilient and tenacious, are arduous to relinquish; 
conversely, cultivating virtuous habits requires persistent conscious 
effort. Herein, the tapestry of one’s routines knits the very texture of life, a 
testament to their power in shaping the contours of existence.
The Modern, Cohesive View of Consciousness 
“I... 
a 
universe 
of 
atoms, 
an 
atom 
in 
the 
universe.” 

― Richard P. Feynman
Self-perception, that intricate tapestry of our being, finds its roots in 
the interplay between the senses and the inner workings of our organs. 
The softness of sand beneath our feet, the cold kiss of raindrops—these 
sensations meld into a cohesive reality. As Thomas Nagel so aptly phrases 
it, the elusive “what it is like to be” forms the heart of qualia, an enigmatic 
realm of highly subjective mental landscapes that constitute the self.
Mental Unity 
Amidst the cacophony of incoming information, a singular conscious 
experience emerges—a phenomenon that has dominated philosophical 
discourse since the days of Descartes and Kant. This unity arises from 

How the Brain Produces Emotions  21
the twin threads of attention, capable of embracing only one facet at a 
time and the tendency of even tumultuous mental content to coalesce 
into an intrinsic oneness. The most disparate, bewildering, or disorderly 
information weaves into a unified perception tapestry (Tring et al., 
2023). While mind-altering substances, neural injuries, or the march of 
neurodegeneration can fray the threads of coherence, the self-identity of 
the psyche remains.
In the case of split-brain patients, the severing of connections between 
cortical hemispheres births a dual existence, each half housing independent 
perceptions and a distinct sense of self. These halves harbor separate 
experiences, intentions, and preferences. However, the splintering of 
the brain further dismantles consciousness. In instances of stroke, the 
demise of neurons can obliterate significant portions of the brain. Yet, as 
untouched areas assume the mantle of the defunct, the shrunken neural 
volume orchestrates near-complete or full functionality.
Over time the Self manifests  remarkable unity. The trajectory of the 
self undergoes dramatic metamorphoses from infancy to the embrace of 
old age, yet the core of self-identification remains constant. This sense of 
unity evokes spiritual awe for the cosmic oneness of being.
Beliefs:  Beliefs stand as unwavering pillars, the bedrock upon which our 
mental universe is built. An assault on these personal bastions triggers 
profound emotional reactions. The human need for cognitive consonance, 
as Krause (1972) describes it, is an irresistible force; no amount of evidence 
can dislodge these convictions. Facts wield no balm against hopelessness, 
nor do predicaments shatter the glass of optimism. Without belief, we 
surrender, and setbacks transmute into irreversible defeats. Moreover, 
when our convictions diverge, they can kindle intense personal and 
societal strife.
Festinger’s Cognitive Dissonance Theory: Festinger’s cognitive dissonance 
theory (1957) postulates that incongruence between two beliefs begets 
cognitive conflict, termed dissonance. This dissonance, the disjuncture 
between conviction and behavior, can birth madness or abandonment of 
our core values, hinting at the trajectory toward criminal pathology.
The Holographic Mind
Through an intricate interference process, Holography manages to 
preserve the depth of a three-dimensional scene. In a parallel manner, 
our sensory perception captures the profound complexity and depth of 
the physical world, all neatly encoded upon the canvas of the cortical 
surface. When it comes to decision-making, we merely skim the surface 
of our unfathomably intricate subconscious. Much like a hologram’s 

22 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
ever-shifting perspective, the meaning we attribute to things is intrinsically 
tied to the web of experiences we’ve woven. A seemingly simple word 
like ‘ball’ can conjure a cascade of associations—baseball, ballpoint pens, 
paintball, or the novel combinations that human creativity constantly 
concocts.
Consciousness, acting as a distinct observer, maintains its separate 
status over the self-regulating mechanisms of the brain.
Now, let’s delve into the intricacies of the brain’s mechanisms that 
underpin our versatile psychology. Why does the governance of our 
thoughts often feel like grasping at elusive shadows? Why do our beliefs 
seem to elude the reins of conscious control? The answers to these profound 
inquiries about consciousness find their roots in the self-regulatory 
essence of the human mind. The mind operates as a homeostatic organ at 
its core, ensuring equilibrium and stability amidst the dynamic currents 
of experience. From this bedrock, a solid foundation for consciousness 
science, built upon rigorous physical principles, must naturally emerge.
The Resting State 
“We want the facts to fit the preconceptions. When they don’t it 
is easier to ignore the facts than to change the preconceptions.” 
— Jessamyn West
Hans Selye (1970)6 pioneered stress research by closely examining the 
universal reactions of patients to illness. His groundbreaking studies 
revealed physiological shifts in response to prolonged stress. It’s becoming 
increasingly evident, through findings in psychology and social sciences, 
that psychological evolution mirrors the ever-shifting environment we 
inhabit.
In many ways, we navigate life like finely tuned antennas, attuned to 
the frequencies of our expectations. Amidst the dance of our surroundings, 
the mind wields a remarkable self-regulatory power, ensuring a steady, 
self-sustaining equilibrium. The brain’s spontaneous fluctuations in the 
absence of stimuli form a restful baseline, akin to a car idling. 
Mental Homeostasis: Human beings possess a unique knack for preserving 
psychological equilibrium. This ability, operating automatically and 
independent of conscious awareness, enables the mind to counterbalance 
disturbances imposed by the external world. It forms the bedrock of the 
mind’s homeostatic regulation (Smitha et al., 2017). As past states fade and 
the future remains uncertain, consciousness—representing the transient 
present—changes over time.
6	 Hans Selye introduced and popularized the idea of stress. 

How the Brain Produces Emotions  23
This self-aware readiness stems from our identification with the 
body through sensory perception. Even as sensory input disrupts 
subsequent layers of regulation within the brain, the mechanisms of 
self-regulation work in harmony to maintain the constancy of the resting 
state’s personalized perspective (Wolff et al., 2019). This is achieved 
through precise regulatory integration (Zanin et al., 2020). Unruly 
thought processes converge to craft a coherent self-narrative (Smitha 
et al., 2017), constructing a subjective, transcendental, and uniquely personal 
first-person experience (Kolvoort et al., 2020).
The brain adeptly translates spatial signals from the sensory system 
into the temporal cadence, where the slow oscillations stand as steadfast 
pillars, with precise timings dictating the rhythm of activation. The 
resting-state network effectively integrates information into abstract 
representational hierarchies, spanning a vast geodesic distance from 
primary sensory and motor regions. When stimuli are absent, this fertile 
ground becomes a realm of mind-wandering, autobiographical memory, 
future projections, and introspection. This abstract world model is the 
foundation of the mind’s self-consciousness and boundless imagination 
(Tring et al., 2023; Wolff et al., 2021).
Fundamentally, survival—hinging on nourishment and security—is 
intricately tied to sensory input. Contributions to evolutionary fitness are 
often the primary argument for emotions. However, a novel perspective 
emerges when viewing the brain as a self-regulating system governed by 
physical laws: emotions represent energy imbalances that steer behavior 
toward restoring equilibrium. At the same time, they drive changes 
within the brain’s neuronal landscape. The energy expenditure needed 
for updating synaptic organization transforms sensory processing into a 
thermodynamic endeavor. 
The Resting State as a Physical Field 
In physics, the field7 is a surface with defined energy at every point of space 
and time. The field’s integrity hinges on a seamlessly interconnected map, 
and any abrupt discontinuity prompts immediate correction. In the social 
sphere, fields manifest as intricate patterns of cultural norms, national 
identities, age-based expectations, and class privileges. 
Place cells, which encode physical location also assign social 
relationships (Forli and Yartsev, 2023). These societal overlays are 
imprinted upon our minds’ resting state, contributing to our subjective 
beliefs’ formation. Interactions are set into motion when these internal

direct experience and can be assessed only indirectly. For example, we cannot see gravity 
but feel its effect.

beliefs deviate from external expectations. These interactions serve as 
catalysts for updating our personal belief map, thereby instigating a 
continuous shift in the landscape of our mental states. Simultaneously, 
the social field itself undergoes revision through the collective experiences 
of its members.
The resting state, acting as a personalized projection of the 
encompassing social field, encapsulates our perceived behavioral 
expectations. In essence, it is a guiding force that shapes our social 
behaviors. Just as particles’ interconnected energy dance governs the 
curvature of the gravity field, the resting state wields a similar power in 
governing social conduct.
Mind-wandering, the Path of Insight
“Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded 
thoughts.” ― Buddha
Over the past few decades, rapid advancements in neuroscience 
have unveiled a profound correlation between neural activities and 
psychological processes.
It has become evident that focused and negative mental states carry 
a substantial amount of information, rendering them energetically more 
demanding compared to positive and neutral conditions (Trevisiol, 2017). 
The accumulation of stress (Xu et al., 2023) raises what can be referred 
to as emotional temperature8—a social analog of temperature. This 
phenomenon parallels how negative emotions are born from the same 
pain receptors, whether triggered by a minor physical discomfort like 
bumping an elbow, a material loss like a wallet, or the loss of a loved one. 
This shared origin in pain receptors gives rise to tightening and pressure 
(Figure 5), a precursor to deterministic9 behavioral responses (Sakai, 2020) 
that can ultimately lead to cognitive fatigue.
The progression of mental weariness eventually transitions into 
what is commonly called “mind-wandering.10” This mental wandering 
also occurs during moments of boredom, such as difficulty falling 
asleep at night, monotonous conferences, or mundane work tasks. 
Such mental disengagement experienced while driving or at work can

have dire consequences, including accidents and errors with significant 
repercussions. This prompts a critical question: Why does the brain 
engage in seemingly wasteful and perilous activities?
A Path to Insight
Mind-wandering encompasses more than simply shifting away from 
focused attention. Rather than being a mere time-wasting activity, it 
can be likened to gathering rain clouds, which eventually turn into 
rain. Just as the qualities of the terrain and the wind influence rainfall, 
mind-wandering filters new information through our existing beliefs, 
dreams, visions of the future, or reflections on the past. These mental 
wanderings continually update our resting state, maintaining our mental 
stability and forming insight into our social position (Smitha et al., 2017). 
This process of piecing together coherent narratives from fragmented, 
disjointed elements forms the basis of our gut feelings—the initial 
emotional filter through which we perceive stimuli. 
The pessimistic mind is stuck in the past. Pessimism is a broken 
record that ensnares the mind in repetitive and self-defeating thoughts. 
In contrast, a flexible and agile brain engages in activities that enhance 
performance by generating new associations, ideas, and discoveries. 
Consider the purposeful and enriching mind wanderings of creative 
geniuses like Mozart and Einstein. 
Using Stimulants: Experimentation with brain stimulants has been a part 
of the human experience for millennia. In various cultures, substances 
like coffee, tea, and alcohol have become sanctioned components of 
social gatherings. Psychedelics and hallucinogens, on the other hand, can 
profoundly alter perception, mood, and cognitive processes, leading to 
distortions in thinking, sense of time, and emotional experiences. They 
are being studied for their potential to address various medical issues, 
including pain management, addiction treatment, depression therapy, 
and the induction of brain plasticity. However, their addictive nature and 
long-term effects on executive functions such as memory, learning, and 
motor and verbal abilities urge caution (Carr and Schatman, 2019).
The Evoked Cycle 
“Experience is food for the brain.” — Bill Waterson
The evoked cycle is the foundation for the brain’s interaction11 with its 
environment. The energy expenditure associated with perception firmly 
11	 Interaction modifies neuronal connections in the brain, which correlates with a change in 
cognition or memory.

26 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
situates the brain within the energy dynamics of its surroundings. 
Consider the act of seeing a road sign (activation), which prompts you to 
turn the wheel (response). Similarly, the sensation of hunger (activation) 
encourages the preparation of a meal (response). These evoked activities 
ripple across the cortical surface like waves on a pond, leading to 
modifications in the synaptic connection map and a continual update of 
the resting state.
Neural activation can be likened to pulling a spring, drawing a 
bowstring, or setting a pendulum in motion. Just as potential energy drives 
the restoring force in a pendulum, bow, or spring in the brain, minute 
potentials facilitate the movement of energy (or information) between the 
cortex and the limbic brain. This energy-transfer functions to restore the 
resting equilibrium, thereby preserving the fundamental constancy of the 
mind (Smitha et al., 2017).
Similarly to a ball’s ability to move in any direction on a flat surface, 
resting thoughts possess a remarkable degrees of freedom.12 In physics, 
“degrees of freedom” pertain to the number of independent variables 
governing positions or motions in space. However, much like a ball 
tracing a predictable trajectory on a hillside (Figure 4), sensory inputs 
from the eyes, ears, tongue, and skin follow well-defined paths toward 
the associative regions of the brain. This leaves little time to consider 
alternative options, and conversations or behavioral actions often occur 
instinctively. Our attitudes, rather than conscious intentions, guide our 
spontaneous actions in these situations.
Entropy
“A brain is only capable of what it could conceive, and it couldn’t 
conceive what it hasn’t experienced.”  ― Graham Greene
An agent’s capacity to generate work is intricately tied to its internal 
organization. In systems isolated from external influences, the constituents 
naturally evolve toward a stationary state where no observable changes or 
work occur. This equilibrium state is referred to as high entropy.13 
The concept of entropy was introduced by Rudolf Clausius as a 
form of energy incapable of producing work. This notion was redefined 
in statistical mechanics as the system’s microstates (Martyushev, 2013), 
signifying the various possible configurations linked to thermal disorder 
(Kostic, 2014). In the 1940s, Shannon extended the concept of entropy 
to information science, defining it as a measure of surprise potential 
(Shannon, 1948). More recently, investigations have explored the 
12	 In cognition, mental freedom refers to a person’s possible behavior choices.
13	 Entropy is the tendency to disperse energy or particles in a system.

significance of information and entropy in biological systems, including 
the living brain (Koonin, 2016).
In our daily lives, entropy is responsible for cooling our morning coffee, 
the aging of vehicles, and the corrosion of equipment. Throughout human 
history, the struggle against entropy has been a persistent challenge.
Entropy in the Brain 
The consideration of entropy within the context of the neuronal system 
has provided fresh insights into understanding brain functionality. The 
coherent low-frequency resting oscillations of the default mode network 
(DMN) provide a wealth of degrees of freedom (Smallwood et al., 2021). 
These degrees of freedom pertain to the number of accessible neural 
states and have predictive value for complex behavioral performance, 
intellectual capacity (Yang et al., 2019), and creativity (Shi et al., 2019).
Unlike its definition in the physical world, entropy in the brain aligns 
with mental energy, serving as the source of intellect. While entropy may 
signify disorder in your room, it fosters cognitive flexibility within your 
brain.
Living systems rely on metabolic networks to counteract erosion 
and decay. The evolution of the cortex introduced even subtler energy 
regulation, maintaining the high entropy14 resting state.
The activation paths’ high degree of freedom makes resting thoughts 
transient and hard to retrace. Simultaneously, their spontaneous nature 
gives rise to innovative associations and sophisticated behaviors. It takes 
energy to rein into focus these fleeting associations. Hence, the interplay 
between entropy and energy profoundly influences actions and decisions, 
a topic explored further in the subsequent section on emotional regulation.
Emotional Regulation
A hundred years ago, Sigmund Freud’s systematic investigations 
paved the way for scientific psyche analysis. Psychoanalysis delves 
into the concealed structures of personality, illustrating how emotional 
traumas can lead to motivational, psychological, and physical issues. 
Although we take pride in our consciousness, the short-lived and 
fleeting cognitive focus relies heavily on emotions to color virtually every 
thought, judgment, and decision. Even when feelings remain beneath the 
threshold of consciousness, they impact what we perceive, hear, and see 
(Xu and Schwarz, 2017), catalyzing creative brilliance, driving criminal 
acts, or triggering self-destructive tendencies like suicide (Beall and 
Tracy, 2017).
14	 Mental entropy correlates with the lack of predictability and a high degree of freedom.

28 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Warm-blooded animals, including humans, rely on emotions, vital in 
parental care behaviors (Farmer, 2020). Interconnected regulatory pathways 
establish a strong correlation between emotion and thermoregulation, 
evident in responses like shivering under stress or perspiring due to fear 
(Grigg et al., 2021), highlighting the central regulatory role of emotions.
The Energy Characterization of Emotions  
“Most every image in the main procession we call mind, from the 
moment the item enters a mental spotlight of attention until it leaves, 
has a feeling by its side.” ― Antonio Damasio
Sham rage has underscored that emotions are a perpetual presence 
within the mind, even if not always consciously acknowledged. While 
emotions align with every shift in the environment, their intelligent 
response necessitates the cortical interpretation of the stimulus (Figure 7). 
Emotional valence represents the energy of the stimulus, and the context 
provides its meaning. Thus, emotions can be categorized based on their 
energy demands. Negative and focused states require higher energy than 
positive and neutral emotions (Kao et al., 2015).
Comparable to canaries in coal mines, emotions act as indicators 
of unstable energy conditions, urging adaptive changes to restore 
equilibrium. Therefore, emotions exert a commanding influence over 
our behavior, often operating below conscious awareness to influence 
our perceptions, auditory experiences, and thoughts. Hence, emotions 
effectively signify shifts in the brain’s energy or synaptic dynamics.
Positive feelings broaden our comprehension, radiating enthusiasm 
and generosity. Signal sparsity expands into negative curvature, increasing 
cognitive freedom (Figure 5) and potential (Fry, 2017). However, like 
delicate soap bubbles, their expansive essence makes them ephemeral. A 
smile, an awe, or a surprise fades swiftly after its initial appearance.
Negative emotions are information-rich (Kao et al., 2015), and their 
synaptic connections serve as attractive loops, perpetuating deterministic, 
repetitive thought patterns. These patterns manipulate our psychological 
landscape with their partial viewpoints. Additionally, emotions like 
shame, remorse, regret, and hate can linger within the synaptic network 
for years. Unexpectedly, their energy can gather momentum, transforming 
into anger, madness, and destruction.

How the Brain Produces Emotions  29
While conscious reasoning may cloak genuine motivations, 
compromised energy regulation can detrimentally impact personal, 
professional, relationships, and psychological and physical well-being. 
Mental degradation can contribute to hormonal imbalances, immune 
issues, and mental disorders.
The ensuing sections will delve into emotions’ classification and 
operational intricacies, encompassing their motivational generation and 
the reasons behind our recurrent struggles to execute our intentions.
Figure 7. Energy values of some emotions. The two-dimensional representation of 
emotional magnetism and temporal gravity. The horizontal line represents temporal gravity, 
which varies between pressure on the left and expansion on the right, while the vertical 
coordinate represents emotional electromagnetism, which changes between desire at the top 
and aversion at the bottom. Just like in a computer game, where a plane disappears on the left 
and reappears on the right, the two sine curves that cross at zero can flip at their extremities 
- from security to curiosity and to fear. In an instant, a fight can transform into a powerless 
flight. However, love has the power to overcome fear and inspire a sense of security.

Chapter 3
The Mind as a Particle
“The universe gives birth to consciousness, and consciousness gives 
meaning to the universe.”
― John Archibald Wheeler
The wonder we feel staring at the night sky is a testament to our desire to 
understand our place in the universe. Although neuroscience can probe the 
human brain in detail, unraveling the intricate web of neurons, hormones, 
and cognitive processes that underpin our conscious experience, it is at a 
loss to explain consciousness. 
Our ability to process and adapt to new information underscores the 
flexibility and dynamic of the mind. Through this adaptability, we can 
intuit the laws of physics and translate them into intelligent behavior, 
technological innovations, and philosophical insights. In essence, our 
journey from gazing at the stars to pushing the boundaries of knowledge 
exemplifies the power and potential of the human mind. 
Perception as a Path to Understanding: The natural world has fascinating 
examples of adaptability and intelligence that may not align with our 
traditional definitions. Different species evolve unique strategies to 
interact with their environment. With its limited vision, the spider 
relies on detecting vibrations in their webs to identify captured prey. 
The comparison of a spider’s web-centric universe to our own human 
cognition and consciousness is a compelling one. 
The lack of scientific consensus on consciousness highlights the need 
for a radical approach. It’s impressive how a lowly spider can process 
and interpret external stimuli with such efficacy and intricacy. Processing 
sensory information can construct a comprehensive model of one’s social 
and physical surroundings. The experience of the physical world leads 
to the seamless integration with the environment. Finally, adopting 
the physical laws as the operational principles of perception engenders 

The Mind as a Particle  31
striking similarities between consciousness, material systems, and the 
universe.
The Mind Regulates Its Environment
The Good Regulator Theorem, initially proposed by Conant and Ashby in 
1970, asserts that for any system to regulate itself efficiently, it must possess 
a model that mimics its operations. In the case of the brain, experiences 
build mental complexity as an environmental model. Intelligent modeling 
requires environmental insights beyond superficial projections. The 
continuous engineering of superior regulation requires the brain’s 
innate intuition of the physical laws. Recent neuroscience studies have 
highlighted striking similarities between the organization of the physical 
world and the activities of the brain, as noted by Deli (2020a, b).
Libet’s early experiments on free will showed a close correlation 
between volition and the brain’s background electrical fluctuations (1985), 
revealing the relationship between motivation and energy regulation in 
the brain. As such, thermodynamic considerations can explain the nature 
and origin of emotions and intellect.
The brain, a veracious energy-consuming organ, integrates into the 
environment’s thermodynamic cycle via the sensory and muscle systems. 
Therefore, it can be analyzed based on information and energy exchange, 
much like any other physical system, such as an engine. The question that 
arises is how far do the similarities between the brain and the physical 
world extend? The book, The Science of Consciousness (2015), argues that 
material interaction increases cosmic complexity through physical, 
chemical, and biological evolution, ultimately leading to the emergence of 
an intelligent mind. Therefore, consciousness is the child of the universe, 
inheriting its structural and operational organization. 
The Surprising and Unexpected Organizational Similarity 
of the Mind and the Universe 
“The universe is built on a plan the profound symmetry of which is 
somehow present in the inner structure of our intellect.” ― Paul Valery 
The emergence of life, particularly intelligence, in the material universe 
is a question that has been a source of meaning and wonder for human 
existence. The concept of the soul, as provided by religion, was an 
initial answer to this question. As philosophers delved into this issue, 
they formed divergent, unresolved viewpoints. One such example is 
dualism―the intuitive belief that conscious experiences are separate from 
the material world.

32 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
More recently, the discourse has been dominated by scientific 
perspectives, acknowledging the physical nature of the mind. While the 
body occupies physical space, searching for the mind within the brain or 
any tangible location proves futile. Even though self-perception is linked 
to the body and can be influenced by social and virtual cues, the mind 
lacks attributes of physical dimensions such as length, weight, or height.
Characterizing the mind functionally proves elusive. Our mental 
discourse remains beyond our complete control, giving rise to spontaneous 
and involuntary thoughts, internal dialogue, emotions, and actions. Errors, 
irrational choices, and even foolish decisions result in feelings of regret, 
shame, and remorse. From the most abstract theoretical ponderings to 
the persistent recollections of pain or humiliation, consciousness merely 
represents the visible surface of an extensive mental reservoir. The mind 
is a self-regulating independent organization resistant to traditional 
scientific investigation. Still, poetry over millennia provided mesmerizing 
glimpses of the depths beneath this impenetrable mental exterior. 
A hundred years ago, the intricate beauty of Ramón y Cajal’s drawings 
brought brain organization into focus. The Spanish neuroscientist thought 
that the cosmos’ awe-inspiring complexity is a mere reflection of the brain. 
The truth is even more remarkable. Life’s reliance on the physical world 
is a fundamental fact of biology. Gravitational pressure lends stability 
and balance, ensuring cell growth and organizational symmetry. The 
explanation of the mind’s mysterious, yet unequivocally physical nature, 
might lie in particle physics.
The Mental Particle 
Imagine the universe as a grand, intricate puzzle with pieces so small that 
they’re beyond our everyday perception. The tiny building blocks of this 
puzzle are matter particles called fermions. 
Fermions are half spin15 constituent particles of matter. Half spin is 
the wave function’s momentum (Ohanian, 1986), pointing in the direction 
or opposed to a magnetic field (–1/2). The conservation of momentum 
requires that only opposite spin fermions (up and down spin) can occupy 
the same quantum state, as expressed by the Pauli exclusion principle. 
Although the Pauli exclusion principle defines a unique energy level to 
each electron, all electrons have precisely the same unchanging properties 
of mass, charge, and spin. 
This principle necessitates the atom’s different energy levels, making 
it possible to form bonds in molecules. Adopting these spin attributes as 
psychological spin (Deli, 2023), leads to our inclination for interpersonal 
comparisons, competition, and establishing hierarchical social structures. 
Hence, the mind’s social qualities can emerge from its fermionic essence.
15	 A half spin particle resembles a tiny bar magnet.

The Mind as a Particle  33
Fermions serve as the foundational building blocks of matter, while 
the mind represents the smallest unit of intellect. The temporal nature of 
cognition denotes a perpendicular transformation of sensory reality. The 
temporal orientation endows the mind with its most peculiar qualities. 
Particles have a location in space, while thoughts and ideas exist in time. 
The ‘Self’ is a self-contained, holistic mental reality, forming a particle-like 
isolation. Nevertheless, its energy levels are far lower than the immense 
energies elementary fermions represent. 
Considering the fermionic structure as an energy unit indicates that 
the particle structure might be valid for the universe as the originator of 
all organization and energy. Therefore, matter fermions (like electrons), 
the mind, and the cosmos could be considered three passible elementary 
particle categories. These entities’ identical energy structures and analogous 
operational principles create a fractal arrangement encompassing various 
energy levels and sizes. The tiniest constituents are material fermions, 
characterized by immensely high frequencies and substantial energy 
levels. They constitute the radiant cores of stars and the delicate forms of 
living organisms. The largest cosmologic structure, the universe, possesses 
the lowest energy level, yet it houses infinite complexity within its 
finite confines.
The notion that the mind is integral to a harmonious, interconnected 
universe aligns with ancient perspectives. Aristotle, for instance, believed 
that the essence of an object existed within the thing itself. In Hinduism, 
the concept of Atman portrays the individual Self as one with Brahman, 
the Ultimate Reality and divine spirit of the universe. In monotheistic 
religions, God is synonymous with the cosmos, and humanity is fashioned 
in His image. We will explore the implications of the temporal fermion in 
individual and social behavior. 
Classification of Emotions 
Performance is enhanced through feedback from the environment. The 
initial language that the mind becomes acquainted with is not the native 
tongue but the physics vocabulary; even within the womb, muscular 
movements offer a sense of weight and proportion. The answer to the 
question, “What is it like?” is the privilege of emotions. Emotions can 
convey imbalance, thereby assisting in maintaining a state of restful 
equilibrium.
How can individuals make complex assessments in real-time? 
Our reality is structured by the four elementary interactions:16 gravity,

electromagnetism, and the nuclear weak and strong interactions. 
These interactions are facilitated by bosons, which transfer energy and 
information among matter particles, while emotions transmit inspiration. 
Emotions, the foundational driving forces of motivation, are the temporal 
analogs of physical interactions. Subsequent sections delve into the societal 
parallels of the most familiar interactions, gravity, and electromagnetism. 
We shall commence by examining the concept of gravity.
Gravity
“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to 
curve.” ― John Archibald Wheeler
Despite being the weakest force in physics, gravity exerts pressure on 
every single molecule within our bodies. As articulated by Wheeler’s 
renowned words, particles choreograph the dance of the gravitational 
field,17 steering the motions of galaxies, stars, and planets. Objects of 
considerable mass induce more pronounced curvature in the fabric of 
space; even on Earth, gravity is stronger near mountains than in the less 
dense oceans. Consequently, substantial gravitational disparities exist on 
the scale of galaxies and galaxy clusters.
While we often take it for granted, gravity enables us to gauge 
distances, coordinate our movements, and perform abstract thinking. The 
intuition of gravity holds fundamental importance across the spectrum 
of biology. What can our exposure to gravity teach us about our own 
psychology?
Impact on our Emotional State: Although intense gravity can be perilous, the 
subtle fluctuations in its force evoke profound pleasure. Roller coasters 
around the globe captivate thrill-seekers by manipulating the influence 
of gravity. The ascending motion of the ride compresses the body, 
concentrating the pressure sensation around the stomach. Upon reaching 
the pinnacle of the ride’s path, the dominance of gravity gives way to the 
exhilaration of weightlessness, engendering a feeling of expansiveness. 
Gravity influences our emotional states; from infancy to old age, we delight 
in swings, cradles, rocking chairs, parachuting, and bungee jumping. As 
gravity permeates our psyche, it endows us with a bipolar regulation 
of emotions.
17	 Fields are expansive, undulating waves of energy, generating a specific force at every 
point of space.

The Mind as a Particle  35
Emotional (Temporal) Gravity 
“Holding on is believing that there’s only a past; letting go is knowing 
that there’s a future.” — Daphne Rose Kingman
The lessons learned extend beyond mere logic when a child takes a 
tumble. Expressions like “above all”, “parallel”, and “distant” serve as 
linguistic indications that spatial orientation holds a place within the 
theoretical realms; physical attributes such as weight, size, and stability 
are projected onto mental constructs. The equilibrium found in physical 
balance is abstracted into a mental state of equilibrium. The heaviness of 
challenges and suffering, the pressure of stress, and the light moments of 
happiness originate in the experience of gravity. 
Wheeler’s quote acknowledges the concurrent development of 
particles and their corresponding fields. These fields also exist within the 
social sphere, intimately governing our emotional state and shaping our 
understanding (as depicted in Figure 8). Individuals within a network 
influence the social structure of their surroundings, thereby impacting the 
entire interconnected web (Li et al., 2018). The social environment, in turn, 
influences individual thought patterns, behaviors, lifestyle choices, and 
personal routines.
Like matter is held together by gravity, people are bound by 
relationships. Attachments to a spouse, child parent, or a cause define 
Figure 8. Interaction with the temporal field. ‘P’ indicates the mind ‘Field’ is the temporal 
field. Top: the mind is in harmony with its surroundings. Bottom: Sensory stimuli trigger 
activation, and response acts back on the environment. The evolution of the individual and 
its surroundings are intimately connected.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
our loyalties, our secure bonds. The strength of these connections defines 
emotional gravity.18 Temporal gravity oscillates between the yearning 
for security and nourishment and the allure of novelty (as illustrated 
in Figure 7). An emphasis on safety can lead to fear and conservatism. 
At the same time, an infatuation with the new can result in a sense of 
emptiness. Emotional gravity provides a stable foundation for our social 
lives, yet it also magnifies the pain of losses. It shapes our personal and 
social boundaries, molding our habits that impact every facet of our daily 
existence. Just as excessive or inadequate gravity is detrimental to the body, 
extreme psychological stress strangles the mind, while overindulgence 
weakens determination.
Because the thrill of levitation on roller coasters and swings is preceded 
by the pressure of gravity, the struggle possesses profound transformative 
potential. Challenges give rise to growth, turning individuals from victims 
into deserving heroes or heroines. Whether in folk tales, adventure 
narratives, horror stories, cliffhangers, or suspenseful accounts, hardship 
consistently paves the way for success. Just as periodic physical exercise is 
vital for the body, intermittent periods of stress benefit the mind.
Temporal Orientation 
Fundamental to bodily function and perception are spatial orientation 
and balance. Within each ear, three semicircular canals are oriented 
perpendicularly to each other and function as a gyroscope,19 sustaining 
posture even without visual cues (as illustrated in Figure 5). Stemming 
from our experience of physical space, mental orientation supports 
psychological stability and facilitates social and conceptual adaptation 
(Figure 3).
The temporal organization of the brain is rooted in the limited 
sustenance from essential factors like air, water, rest, and nourishment 
(Tsao et al., 2018), as well as the sequential associations crucial for learning, 
speech, thinking, and muscle coordination (Ahmed et al., 2020)—refer 
to Table I. Biological reliance on air, water, and food renders time the 
ultimate boundary of life. Our biology harmonizes through millisecond 
coordination, accomplished through a fluid, rhythmic interplay of glances, 
gestures, and smiles between caregivers and children, educators and 
pupils, supervisors and subordinates, and even strangers. Additionally, 
countless environmental cues swiftly prompt our spontaneous actions 
throughout the day. Similar to how material systems adhere to the

principle of least action20 (stationary action) when moving through space, 
cognition follows a trajectory of minimal temporal distance between the 
past and the future.
Through repeated use, specific neural networks become more 
dominant, essentially becoming ‘hardwired’ and significantly easier to 
activate. When confronted with decisions, the well-worn pathways within 
our brain offer the path of least resistance, forming a stationary route. 
Consequently, our current actions contribute to shaping our future social 
milieu.

imbuing our life with direction by spontaneously navigating between 
birth and death. Subsequently, we delve into the exploration of how the 
brain gives rise to the psyche.

The Role of Temporal Orientation in Perception
The arrow of time demonstrates a profound link to the rate of entropy 
generation (Lucia and Grisolia, 2020) and the loss of potential for work. 
Within non-equilibrium systems, the second law of thermodynamics 
elucidates the irreparable exchanges between states (Seif et al., 2021). The 
above irreversibility is analogous to the neural flow of activity within the 
neural system initiated by sensory input.
The challenge of neuroscience is how subjective mental states 
emerge from neural dynamics with a complex interconnection between 
the dimensions of space and time. Place cells within the hippocampus 
convert spatial relationships into a temporal projection (Shimazaki, 2020), 
thereby rendering temporal orientation a foundational aspect of the mind 
(as depicted in Figure 9). The notion of Self is inherently intertwined with 
temporal integration across various time spans, likely encompassing an 
individual’s retrospective lifetime.
Spatial data compression engenders an orthogonal21 sensory 
hologram (Saaty and Vargas, 2017) on the two-dimensional cortical surface 
(Déli, 2020a). Holography generates three-dimensional images, viewable 
from diverse perspectives. This is similar to the constant influxes of new 
experiences, which continuously reshape the significance of memories 
and one’s sense of Self.
21	 Orthogonality is the quality of being perpendicular.

temporal signal. The mind, a predictive organ, generates meaning and memory.

Subsequently, we explore how the perception of time shapes 
motivational dynamics.
Dilation of Time Perception
Our biological requirements and even social interactions oscillate between 
scarcity and surplus. We find joy in the arrival of relatives, yet we might be 
even more content when they depart. This shift between contentment and 
restlessness imparts a malleable quality to our subjective sense of time.
How does the psychology of emotions produce performance? The 
capacity of emotions to stimulate motivation and behavior underscores 
their energetic essence. Engaging in conversations with a romantic 
partner, a tax advisor, or an armed intruder demonstrates vastly distinct 
psychological states and varying rates of information flow. The pace of 
information transmission constructs a subjective perception of time, 
ranging between a scarcity of time and an abundance of it. Positive 
emotions and awe convey the sense of information voids, emerging from 
expansive feelings forming time excess. In contrast, stress parallels an 
overflow of information, leading to the sense that time is running out. 
Our motivation is closely intertwined with our perception of 
available time.22 A sense of awe stretches our perception of time, 
inspiring patience (Rudd et al., 2012). A feeling of permanence nurtures 
confidence (Makarevskaya, 2018), contentment (Carmona-Halty et al., 
2019), generosity, and trust (Connelly et al., 2017). Conversely, stress 
acts as psychological pressure that constricts the flow of time (Remmers 
and Zander, 2018). The sensation of permanence makes every minute 
unbearable, resulting in impatience, impulsivity (Hosseini Houripasand 
et al., 2023), and the activation of the fight-or-flight response (as depicted 
in Figure 10; see Table II). It’s important to note that it’s not the negative 
emotions themselves but the transitions from neutral to negative states 
that induce the stagnation of perceived time (Wang and Lapate, 2023). 
Consequently, perception of time signal energy shifts during neural 
processing. 
Warped spatial patterns across the brain (Knapen, 2021) can influence 
temporal curvatures, dimensionalities (Tozzi et al., 2017; consult 
Table II), and neural efficiency (Velasco et al., 2019). The boundless energy 
of positive emotions and the immobilizing constriction of negative feelings 
represent the polar opposites of our psychology. Thus, the dilation of time 
perception during positive and negative states reflects opposing energetic 
conditions and attitudes. As awe induces relaxation and extreme stress 
causes paralysis, neither catalyzes effective action.
22	 Time perception is the subjective experience of the length of events. Both negative and 
positive emotions lengthen time perception (Lupien et al., 2007).

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
How does time perception relate to gravity? The memory of the 
field resides within its curvature. Within general relativity’s framework, 
gravity and acceleration lead to time dilation. As gravity warps space, 
time passes more slowly at the base of a mountain. Similarly, the 
curving temporal field decelerates time perception (as illustrated in 
Figure 8). Emotional gravity modulates data flow between time pressure 
(i.e., stress) and expansion (i.e., elation), deviating from the Euclidean 
field formed by the brain’s resting state. Although both conditions expand 
time perception (Figure 5), their divergent energy processes result in 
Figure 10. The polarity effects of temporal gravity. Negative emotions can deplete energy 
and trigger the fight or flight response; however, at their extremes, emotions can result in 
no action.

distinct physiological and psychological encounters and motivations. The 
deceleration of time perception in contrasting conditions underscores the 
brain’s adherence to the principles of physics.
Emotions and Temperature Regulation: The brain’s emotion and temperature 
regulatory pathways are closely linked through the striatum, limbic 
structure, and cortical insula (Inagaki et al., 2019). Therefore, the body’s 
temperature control mechanisms can be utilized for psychological 
regulation through sweating or shivering (Kuno, 1956). For example, 
anxiety disorders often intertwine with disturbances in thermoregulation 
(Raison et al., 2015). Therefore, in addition to time perception, secondary 
emotional symptoms, such as shivering, sweating, changes in facial skin 
coloration, and others, enhance motivation.
The Social Mind 
“For a solitary animal, egoism is a virtue that tends to preserve and 
improve the species: in any kind of community it becomes a destructive 
vice.” ― Erwin Schrodinger 
From the perspective of Abraham Maslow, the American psychologist, 
the quality of our social environment plays a paramount role in our 
psychological well-being. The framework for our actions is established 
by physical laws, legal regulations, traffic rules, and social norms. 
Undoubtedly, our operational reality emerges from a foundation rooted 
in the social realm, forming a stable system of beliefs—akin to a floor. 
Conversely, limitations act as constraints, restricting possibilities like a 
ceiling. Consequently, our scope for movement is confined within the 
conceptual space defined by this floor and ceiling.
The curvature of the gravity field compresses physical space, while the 
curvature of temporal gravity gives rise to stress. Similar to how photons 
disperse energy throughout the cosmos, emotions disseminate motivation 
across society. The feedback to the mind’s spontaneous exploration 
concerning our physical existence, behaviors, and social interactions 
unveils our standing within the social landscape. For instance, playful 
teasing among young boys establishes dominance dynamics. Group 
members thoroughly understand their social positions and vigorously 
safeguard them. Our perceived rank within the social hierarchy shapes 
our aspirations, behaviors, decision-making processes, and countless 
subconscious reactions in our daily lives. These influences give rise to 
social hierarchies, classifying socioeconomic strata according to factors 
like wealth, income, race, education, and authority, as discussed in the 
“Conservation of Time”. As our social environment molds our ambitions, 
we simultaneously shape and originate our world.

The Structure of Society: Socioeconomic Status
“Our inequality materializes our upper class, vulgarizes our middle 
class, brutalizes our lower class.” — Matthew Arnold 
Fermions’ distinctive half-integer spin engenders atomic arrangements and 
an intriguing resilience to compression. Consequently, matter, including 
massive stars, resists compression, forming the sturdy foundation of 
our reality. The fermionic framework’s resistance to stress leads to the 
territorial behaviors of animals. Similarly, human beings safeguard their 
domains of influence, leading to the establishment of hierarchical social 
structures (as outlined in Table 1). Social representation can be likened 
to a topographical landscape within the conceptual social field, where 
influential individuals and organizations occupy the peaks while ordinary 
people crowd the plains.
It enlarges social conflicts, increasing the need for policing; it 
devastates human potential, negatively affecting technological progress. 
Human civilization has advanced toward notions of social mobility 
and democracy, yet hierarchical relationships endure and perpetuate 
inequality. Higher social status often aligns with a dynamic environment 
and opportunities, fostering optimism and individuality. A positive 
mindset nurtures confidence, adaptability, and intellectual growth. Trust 
and faith serve as sources of spiritual strength and prerequisites for 
intellect. However, social status is an artificial category that discourages 
genuine relationships. Therefore, inequality within and among nations 
proves detrimental to progress and long-term stability. It exacerbates 
social conflicts, necessitating heightened policing, and curtails human 
potential, hampering technological advancements.
Open social frameworks should ideally present avenues for 
achievement. However, despite the potential for equal opportunities, why 
is inequality rising in many parts of the world? What distinct challenges 
confront the impoverished? In a manner reminiscent of gravity forming 
dense structures with maximum pressure at the center, social gravity 
generates stress directed at the people with the least social financial 
resources. Hierarchic social structures redistribute time among people, 
with the excess to time being inversely proportional to social status, 
imposing the most significant stress on the marginalized (Figure 11). 
The restricted access to healthcare, justice, and education diminishes life 
expectancy; brutality, injustice, and indecency contaminate the human 
spirit, leading to mental degradation, abuse, and conflict. The burden of 
intergenerational anxiety drives individuals into a sense of hopelessness, 
which can ignite acts of terrorism and crime.

The Mind as a Particle  43
Temporal Mass 
 “You only lose what you cling to.” — Buddha
In physics, mass quantifies inertia, denoting the resistance to an applied 
force. Similarly, temporal mass (or emotional mass23) gauges the intensity 
of attachments. Strong attachments impede social mobility as heavy 
objects settle and resist change.
Low Temporal or Emotional Mass: Low temporal or emotional mass signifies 
a limited capacity for decisive action. Factors such as wealth, poverty, or 
affiliation with religious institutions can isolate individuals from active 
social engagement, resulting in ignorance, represented by low emotional 
mass. On the other hand, moderate temporal mass establishes a stable 
intellectual foundation, enabling the development of a sense of purpose.
Large Temporal Mass: A high temporal mass is associated with intense 
attachments. Though not a financial classification, poverty can intensify 
23	 Temporal mass is the strength of attachments to things and people. Emotional mass 
provides security but enhances attachments, which slow change and block progress.
Figure 11. Social status as a function of temporal curvature. Competition results in an 
uneven distribution of time, reducing it for those on the left and increasing it for those on 
the right. The accumulation of information is stressful due to a positive temporal curvature 
(as indicated by the black arrow), whereas greater access to time leads to satisfaction and 
confidence (white arrow). Lack of time on the far left provokes a struggle for survival.

44 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
temporal mass. This substantial temporal mass fosters insecurity, which 
in turn fuels fear. Insecure individuals often employ complaints, excuses, 
and conspiracy theories to mask their insecurities and fears. This tendency 
to complain amplifies problems instead of solving them. Those who take 
action do not have the energy to indulge in complaints. Fear also triggers 
a compulsion for excessive control, hindering progress. A rigid adherence 
to traditions leads to beliefs in severe punishments. The condition can 
deteriorate into a glorification of suffering and self-flagellation, indicating 
a pathological personality. Such rigidity obstructs change and obstructs 
upward social mobility.
In the words of George Orwell, “Poverty…annihilates the future.” 
Poverty imposes an unrelenting cognitive burden, diminishing intellectual 
capacity (Makharia et al., 2016; Mani et al., 2013). The pressing concerns with 
immediate needs muddle cognitive abilities. It erodes security and personal 
boundaries, creating an emotional barrenness that erases traces of love and 
engenders callous disregard for societal norms. Distrust perpetuates itself 
by extinguishing generosity, kindness, and civility. Expecting honesty from 
the destitute is futile; their moral compass is broken. 
Psychological Lensing: Light follows the contours of space. Gravitational 
lensing, which results from the bending of light by massive objects, can 
distort the apparent location of an object or create mirages. Remarkably, 
this bending of light parallels the emotional distortion of memories 
and experiences. Psychological lensing is the emotional equivalent of 
gravitational lensing. Much like gravitational lensing challenges our 
perception of the cosmos, context-dependent bias obscures the truth. 
Identification with a cause or a person (family member or even 
celebrities) can become central to people’s personal or group identity. Not 
getting the outcome people want on something central to their identity 
causes them to let go of objectivity and discredit the process (Mullen and 
Skitka, 2006). This situation-dependent bending of the facts produces 
psychological lensing’s alternative ‘realities’. Sometimes, this bias is 
confined to a specific domain, but like cancer, it can infiltrate various 
aspects of life. 
The Laws of Emotion Regulation
“The laws of nature are written in the workings of our brains.” 
― Thomas L. Saaty
The profound parallels between the mind and matter carry extensive 
implications for society. The bedrock principles of classical physics hinge 
on the stability of the gravitational field. At the same time, the societal 

The Mind as a Particle  45
sphere depends on social equilibrium. Newton’s and thermodynamics 
principles underpin our physical reality and leave an indelible imprint on 
our psychological makeup. Universal gravitation governs the trajectories 
of celestial bodies, just as our aspirations take root in our societal strata. 
Consequently, classical physics’ tenets find relevance within society’s fabric.
Newton’s Laws
Newton’s trilogy of motion laws is the cornerstone of classical mechanics, 
delineating how forces influence motion. Their temporal projections 
reveal the deterministic potency of emotions.
The First Law 
The law of inertia dictates that objects persist in a state of rest or uniform 
motion. This law finds temporal counterparts in emotions and habits. 
Emotional inertia sustains prejudices, grievances, and animosities across 
generations. Adjusting to life changes or contending with losses is 
impossible without emotional investments. Consequently, embracing an 
unsatisfactory situation often proves more attractive than unsettling the 
comfort zone. 
The challenge of creating positive habits and breaking negative ones 
has motivated various institutions, including schools and the legal system. 
Prisons aimed at reforming inmates inadvertently foster impulsiveness—
the root of criminal behavior (Umbach et al., 2018). Newton’s first law 
suggests that addressing underlying causes instead of symptoms is 
pivotal, underscoring the importance of preserving individual dignity.
Like a fledgling chick emerging stronger after endeavoring 
to hatch from its shell, efforts invested in forming positive habits, 
studying, accepting, and meditation instill confidence for ongoing 
mental advancement. The “Free Will” section delves into habit-related 
discourse further.	
Newton’s Second Law 
A constant force yields acceleration. The second law emphasizes that social 
influences are additive in the societal realm. Genuine compliments can 
propel significant personal growth, whereas maltreatment compromises 
psychological well-being. For instance, skilled educators, coaches, and 
counselors can positively influence generations of young people under 
their tutelage. Conversely, the aforementioned prison scenario illustrates 
how the degrading and humiliating atmosphere reinforces the very 
qualities it should rectify.

46 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Newton’s Third Law 
Newton’s third law establishes the symmetry of forces: two bodies exert 
forces on each other with equal magnitude but opposite directions. A 
body maintains its state unless compelled by external force. 
The Man of la Mancha echoes this symmetry of forces:24 “Whether the 
stone hits the pitcher or the pitcher hits the stone, it’s going to be bad for 
the pitcher.” Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, posited 
that a compensatory unconscious mirrors our lives. Each conscious action 
engenders a corresponding and opposing unconscious reaction, striving 
to balance the human experience. 
The social dimension of this law delineates the source of social discord. 
A reactionary force equals the force exerted—people push back as hard 
as we push them. For example, innovative concepts spark unyielding 
opposition. The reactionary forces can take various forms—everything 
from active resistance to passive-aggressive behavior to sabotage behind 
the scenes. It’s also important to realize that this opposing force is not 
always negative—it can provide opportunities to engage in quid pro quo 
to achieve mutual goals. 
Third Law situations move toward a state of equilibrium, in which 
equal forces are exerted against each other. Opposing social forces 
sustain a delicate balance: conservatives and progressives, left and right, 
protectionism and globalization epitomize political reflections of one 
another. Their apparent adversarial conflict is but a façade. In truth, the 
existence of one hinges upon the presence of the other. Polarization always 
has two sides.
The Laws of Thermodynamics
“Regarding the Laws of Thermodynamics: “(1) You can’t win, 
(2) you can’t break even, and (3) you can’t get out of the game.” 
— Dennis Overbye
Thermodynamics delves into the conversion and transfer of energy. 
Einstein succinctly encapsulated its significance: “The laws of 
thermodynamics are the only physical theory of universal content which 
I am convinced ... will never be overthrown.” Applying the four laws of 
thermodynamics to societal contexts yields profound insights into the 
nature of social existence and the foundations of society.
24	 Man of la Mancha, musical, 1965.

The Mind as a Particle  47
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
The Zeroth Law asserts that if two thermodynamic systems attain thermal 
equilibrium with a third, they are in thermodynamic equilibrium. This 
concept defines temperature, which aligns with thermal energy in physics. 
Just as particles’ kinetic energy defines temperature, the tendency for 
competition outlines social temperature (Déli, 2020a).
	(1)	 Low social temperature epitomizes predictability, trust, and civility. 
In the late 1800s, Peter Kropotkin observed that abundance fosters 
cooperation and generosity among wild horse herds, wolf packs, 
and human communities (Connelly et al., 2017; Kropotkin, 1902). 
Thus, social collaboration and generosity hinge upon societal safety 
and equity. 
	(2)	 As resources diminish to a critical point, generosity yields to 
competition. Stressed, strained ecosystems give rise to chaos and 
disorder, producing high social temperatures. Social biases and 
oppression arise as a natural outcome of perceived scarcity. Resource 
scarcity imposes a cognitive burden, hampering IQ. 
Leo Tolstoy astutely cautioned, “There are no conditions to which 
a man may not become accustomed, particularly if he sees that they are 
accepted by those around him.” The Zeroth law finds application in social 
climates through the bandwagon effect, where newcomers swiftly adopt 
local social norms. Akin to this, healthy rats, pigs, and humans can acquire 
depression from afflicted peers in prolonged cohabitation (Zeldetz, 2018).
In the nineteenth century, Thomas Malthus noticed that food 
production did not keep pace with population growth, causing perpetual 
poverty, war, famine, and disease. Paul Ehrlich’s book, The Population 
Bomb (1968) brought the question into the public consciousness. None of 
these threats came true. With advances in agricultural technology, seeds, 
soil management, irrigation, and mechanization, the food supply stayed 
ahead of the population curve. Nevertheless, humanity’s future hinges on 
finding sustainable growth strategies that respect Earth’s resources and 
the natural environment. The Social Zeroth law reminds us that only a 
shared future is viable for humanity. 
The First Law of Thermodynamics
The law of energy conservation stipulates that energy cannot be created nor 
destroyed—only transformed from one form to another. Put differently, 
the total energy within an isolated system remains constant. Exothermic 
processes dissipate entropy and energy into the environment, making 
endothermic systems that absorb entropy and energy possible. 

48 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Conservation of Time: We have seen that the orthogonal transformation 
of spatial input is crucial in the temporal organization of cognition 
and intellect. Our psychology hinges on the preservation of time. Time 
conservation originates in the time needed for securing sustenance and 
evading predators. Tomorrow cannot compensate for today’s lack of 
food, air, and water. Life’s finite nature underpins this principle. In the 
realm of society, technological progress shapes our temporal allocation. 
In medieval times, nearly 90% of individuals toiled in agriculture for 
collective sustenance. Presently, this figure stands at 10% and is set to 
decline further, freeing a significant portion of society to engage in diverse 
pursuits.
As earlier elucidated, the least action in physics resurfaces in cognition 
as a stationary temporal trajectory. Time takes the place of space in social 
interaction, and energy conservation becomes time conservation. While 
technology has drastically diminished the time required for survival needs, 
uneven access to time engenders psychological divisions. Power affords 
relaxation, while inferiority generates stress. Inequality is fundamentally 
the inequality of access to time. The affluent can purchase time, as the 
less privileged are willing to trade their time for money. The dearth of 
time for the disadvantaged finances the excess time of the affluent, 
lending credence to the adage, “Time is money” (depicted in Figure 11). 
Consequently, the comfort at the apex relies on the hardship of the many, 
rendering social mobility an illusion. Time constraints make escaping dire 
poverty through diligent effort more unlikely than winning a lottery.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The Second Law elucidates the inclination of isolated systems to degrade 
into disorder, with systems naturally progressing toward thermodynamic 
equilibrium characterized by maximum entropy. 
In physics, entropy is often characterized by the microstates of the 
system and the different possible arrangements of particles. Although 
not directly transferable to societal contexts, individual actions can 
yield comparable state formations. Continuous sensory-driven pairwise 
comparisons create an “inner eye” (Peng and Xie, 2016; Saaty and Vargas, 
2017). Comparison with others generates peer pressure that levels 
opportunities within a given class and disseminates habitual behaviors, 
such as quitting smoking, opinion forming, experiencing happiness, and 
adopting optimism or pessimism (Kong, 2022).
The concept of sentiment contagion25 gauges the likelihood of emotional 
transmission among users in online social media. Our intellectual and 
25	 Sentiment contagion is the ability of sentiments and behaviors to spread like infectious 
disease in social groups.

The Mind as a Particle  49
social attitudes are universal, unconscious, and convergent, homogenizing 
intentions and opinions into a shared intuition (Goldenberg et al., 2021). 
Thus, sentiment contagion increases social entropy, analogous to fluid 
dynamics, as discussed in “Emotional Temperature and Pressure”.
However, while competition fosters similarities among individuals 
with comparable economic backgrounds, it concurrently fosters social 
discord and inequality. Across 71% of the global populace, inequality 
has burgeoned, concentrating income and wealth at the apex. There is an 
expanding chasm in prosperity and opportunities, which warrants further 
exploration. In the context of physical systems, low entropy magnifies the 
system’s capacity to generate work. Likewise, increasing social friction 
signifies societal instability, catalyzing uprisings and revolutions.
The Third Law of Thermodynamics
The Third Law posits that as a system reaches absolute zero temperature, 
its entropy approaches zero. Lower temperatures significantly decelerate 
the pace of interactions. Emotional temperature can apply the law to 
society. Civility is proportional to socioeconomic status but exhibits 
an inverse relationship with emotional temperature. As previously 
demonstrated, higher social status affords abundance and security 
(i.e., lower social temperature). Akin to physical systems, social 
entropy tends toward zero under low social temperatures. Serenity and 
mental balance render competition obsolete in secure environments 
(Kropotkin, 1902).
Just as physical systems possess vibrational energy even at absolute 
zero, some friction remains an intrinsic facet of any society. Lingering 
social energy renders complete non-reaction and equanimity implausible, 
even for the saintly individuals. Learning and progress are contingent on 
interactions and mistakes.
Emotions constitute an inherent component of the human experience 
and are inherently intertwined with society.
Emotional Electromagnetism
“The starting point of all achievement is desire.” ― Napoleon Hill
Just as gravity serves as the bedrock of space, emotional gravity 
underpins society. Much like the necessity for charge separation in 
atomic structures, the organization of society involves the coexistence of 
opposites, such as male and female, democrat and republican, conservative 
and progressive. While emotional gravity functions as a steady force, 
emotional electromagnetism can rapidly oscillate between attraction 

50 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
and repulsion (Drigotas, 1993). For example, a dog’s wagging tail signals 
desire, while raised hackles convey aversion.
Polarization obstructs the pursuit of objective and impartial 
viewpoints. The act of excommunicating a member reinforces the unity of 
organizations or nations. Individuals with adversaries seek camaraderie, 
expecting their friends to share their anger or antipathy toward the 
so-called enemy (Krems et al., 2023). Hate demands substantial energy, 
possibly overshadowing life’s rational equilibrium and depleting common 
sense, time, and financial resources. Recognizing this universal human 
susceptibility permits a better life balance. 
Due to its greater strength compared to gravity, emotional 
electromagnetism can spur extraordinary accomplishments, extravagant 
purchases, and imprudent decisions. It also makes unsuspecting 
individuals susceptible to manipulation by demagogues and fraudsters. 
This phenomenon also surfaces in the disappointment in response to 
unexpected cancellations. Just as flipping the poles of a magnet alters 
its attraction, a shift in the social climate can instantly turn interest into 
antagonism and repulsion.
Emotional 
electromagnetism 
encompasses 
competitiveness, 
aggression, and audacity. These attributes, associated with masculinity, 
tend to predominate in youth. Throughout our lifetimes, the predominance 
of emotional gravity relative to electromagnetism tends to increase. 
In older individuals, emotional gravity safeguards against envy and 
resentment, although stronger attachments render them vulnerable to the 
experience of loss. Women also exhibit a stronger gravitational tendency, 
often displaying a natural inclination toward cooperation.
Positive Psychology and Expectations: Positive psychology acknowledges 
the significant impact of hope on personal growth. Expectations act like 
a magnetic field, substantially influencing those who embrace them. 
Children, for instance, frequently live up to the expectations set for them. 
However, it’s important to note that Lenz’s law operates on a deeper level 
than mere surface or wishful thinking; it involves genuine intentions 
grounded in beliefs.
Festinger’s Cognitive Dissonance Theory
Constructing a false facade (analogous to a magnetic field) induces 
a corresponding emotional charge. Festinger’s Cognitive Dissonance 
Theory illustrates how immoral behavior has a reciprocal effect on our core 
principles, inevitably leading to their alteration. Experiences conflicting 
with our beliefs cause a mental strain called cognitive dissonance. The 
discomfort may cause us to twist our perception of reality to reduce this 
discomfort or even change our beliefs. 

The Mind as a Particle  51
Rigid moral rules (magnetic fields) can trigger a counterflow of evasive 
actions, deceit, and secrecy. This phenomenon is especially concerning 
in children. For instance, boasting and belittling can foster feelings of 
inadequacy, temptation can weaken resolve, delight can give rise to envy, 
displeasure can fuel paranoia, and pride can engender desire. However, 
projecting a fake social milieu can precipitate destruction.26 Ultimately, 
bullies and tyrants become victims of their poison.27 
Harmonic Motion 
Emotions influence us around the clock, every day of the week. Feelings 
follow a pattern akin to harmonic motion; peaks generate attraction, while 
troughs elicit disdain, even within our closest relationships, such as those 
with our children or spouse (Figure 12). Similar to a spring’s oscillation, 
the equilibrium point holds the most significant momentum, propelling 
attitudes to switch to their opposite. Because the equilibrium position 
hides feelings from awareness, we are ignorant of their alternating nature 
and power. 
Emotions are under the control of the waveform’s automatic 
evolution. Interaction can change the wave’s amplitude, frequency, and 
intensity. Impulsivity increases the frequency of interaction, and aging 
reduces its amplitude. As discussed in later sections, the waveform can 
produce emotional interference or passive aggression. On a larger scale, 
intergenerational, organizational, and national sentiments also follow 
Figure 12. Emotional electromagnetism. Emotions can be represented by a harmonic 
function, with the most intense feelings located at the peaks and troughs of the curve. 
Emotions are hidden at equilibrium points. The highest point of the curve represents the 
strongest attraction, while the lowest point corresponds to intense dislike.

harmonic motion. These forces turn repressions and revolutions into 
inevitable consequences of each other. The 1956 Hungarian uprising, the 
1968 Prague Spring, the 2004 Orange and 2014 Maidan Revolutions in 
Ukraine, and the 2012s Arab Spring all grew out of brutal oppression and 
hopelessness. 
Lenz’s Law 
Lenz’s law applies the conservation of energy to electromagnetic 
interactions. When a change in magnetic flux through a loop occurs (such 
as the movement of a magnet or a difference in the current of a nearby 
circuit), an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the loop. This EMF 
will generate a current in a closed loop. The law states that the direction 
of the induced EMF (and thus the direction of the induced current, if any) 
opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it. 
Decreasing Magnetic Flux: If the magnetic flux through the loop decreases, 
the induced current will circulate in a direction that tries to maintain or 
increase the existing flux. For example, if a magnet’s north pole is pulled 
away from a coil, the coil will act as though it’s producing its own north 
pole to try and keep the magnet from leaving.
Increasing Magnetic Flux: If the magnetic flux through the loop increases, 
the induced current will circulate in a direction that tries to reduce or 
counteract this increase in flux. If you push a north pole of a magnet into 
a coil, the coil will act as if it’s creating its own south pole to oppose the 
magnet’s entry.
Lenz’s law says that the direction of the induced current will oppose 
the change in flux that created it. It’s not a matter of increasing and 
decreasing; it’s a matter of direction. A decreasing flux creates an EMF 
that creates a current, and that current will be in whatever direction it has 
to be to try to keep the flux from decreasing. An increase in flux will lead 
to a current that will try to keep the flux from increasing. In both cases, it’s 
consistent with conservation of energy.
In our daily lives, Lenz’s law keeps our mindset congruent with our 
social situation. When our thought processes and beliefs are disjoined, 
our mind tries to restore congruence. For example, losing social support 
urgently requires finding it elsewhere. Unfair treatment or disappointments 
often trigger a knee-jerk, revengeful, or destructive reaction. The so-called 
impostor syndrome is the self-sabotage of significant social advancement. 
The most secure way to achieve success is by gradually improving our 
social position. 

The Mind as a Particle  53
Thought Suppression: Thought suppression involves a conscious effort 
to halt anxious or depressing thoughts. Lenz’s law demonstrates that 
focused suppression is ineffective, allowing negative thoughts to resurface 
with heightened intensity, particularly during relaxation or fatigue 
(Roemer and Borkovec, 1994). Lenz’s law also contributes to the challenge 
of altering habits or overcoming addictions.
In societies and organizations, the rhythm of the usual way of life 
provides stability. External changes trigger strong opposition, ranging 
from foot-dragging and inertia to outright rebellion, attempting to keep 
the emotional charge flowing.
Emotional Electromagnetism in Social Behavior
“The world is little, people are little, human life is little. There is only one 
big thing—desire.” ― Willa Cather
Electromagnetism is a foundational force in the physical realm, with 
magnetic fields spanning vast cosmic scales, even encompassing the 
universe’s most significant clusters of galaxies. It follows that social bias 
(comparable to magnetism) is an important factor in shaping societal 
structures. Charge separation in the human context leads to biased and 
selective thinking, often manifesting as an “us versus them” mentality. 
Oxytocin, a hormone, can accentuate this division, promoting affectionate 
behavior toward familiar individuals while triggering hostility toward 
outsiders (Anpilov et al., 2020).
Attachments to family, social groups, nations, or races can blind 
individuals to the flaws of their idols and affiliations, whether in politics, 
sports, or religion. Emotional electromagnetism adeptly fosters group 
unity by vilifying scapegoats, whether individuals or groups. Leaders 
might enhance their popularity by stoking sentiments of racism or 
anti-immigration. Historical examples, such as communist and Nazi 
regimes, utilized ostracism to consolidate political control. Conversely, 
polarized populations often rally behind strong leaders.
However, unity built upon bias carries risks. Just as similar charges 
repel each other, in-group cohesion can be short-lived and result in 
internal conflicts. Divisions along political, religious, ethnic, or geographic 
lines often lead to hostility and fragmentation. Continuous feuds plague 
prejudiced and segmented communities, like the Montagues and Capulets, 
Christians and Muslims, or Sunni and Shia factions. Polarization and 
partisanship erode trust and hinder progress. Resilient and dynamic 
economies avoid significant polarization (Klimek et al., 2019).

With this, the classical exploration of the fermionic mind concludes. 
We showed that the brain uses any means necessary to reproduce 
analogous regulation to the material world. Consciousness is an abstract 
reflection of particle organization. 
The upcoming section will delve into the quantum attributes of 
mental particles.

Chapter 4
Quantum Cognition
Quantum mechanics is a foundational theory in physics that describes 
the behavior of matter and energy on the smallest scales, typically at 
the level of atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike classical mechanics, 
which predicts deterministic outcomes, quantum mechanics is inherently 
probabilistic. For example, particles can exist in a combination of multiple 
states simultaneously. Only when we measure them can they ‘collapse’ 
into one of the possible outcomes. The wave function collapse means 
particles can behave like waves (with interference patterns) and like 
particles (with discrete energy levels). When squared, the wave function 
provides the probability of finding a system in a particular state. 
Another quality is entanglement occurring between two particles. The 
state of one instantly affects the state of the other, no matter the distance 
between them. Einstein famously described this phenomenon as “spooky 
action at a distance”. Furthermore, particles can ‘tunnel’ through barriers 
that classical mechanics predicts should be impenetrable. Quantum 
mechanics has been experimentally verified to an incredible degree of 
precision. Yet, debates about its interpretation continue to confound our 
conception of reality.
Thermodynamic Considerations of Brain Activities
Fresh and unforeseen information possesses the ability to startle 
individuals and societies alike. Emotional gravity provides our convictions 
for our secure mental world firmly rooted in resting stability. Unexpected 
disruptions give way to cognitive disarray, which compels individuals to 
explore ways to stabilize their beliefs. However, this process inherently 
reshapes the very framework of those beliefs. The more astonishing the 
news, the greater the mental exertion and time required to interlace those 
objective realities into the existing certainties. The intellectual labor and 
painful assessment needed to assimilate jarring information into the 

56 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
domain of convictions is a testament to the energy needs of cognitive 
transformations.
The Thermodynamic Cycle in Physics: In physics, a thermodynamic cycle 
describes various heat and work transfers due to temperature, pressure, 
and volume changes, where the system eventually recovers its initial state. 
A prime example is the Carnot engine,28 operating between two reservoirs 
that define the maximum possible efficiency of a heat engine when 
converting heat into work. The Carnot cycle is a closed system29 drawing 
heat from a hot reservoir and releasing it into a cold one, executing work 
without generating entropy. 
An essential facet of the Carnot cycle is its reversibility, enabling the 
execution of both exothermic and endothermic processes. Exothermic 
operations in physics yield heat, whereas the endothermic counterpart 
necessitates an infusion of energy. Notably, the cycle’s heat absorption 
or work production can be significant as the function of the temperature 
change.
The Brain as a Closed Thermodynamic Cycle: Biological organisms are open 
systems that consume energy-storing molecules and release metabolites. 
However, because the brain only interacts with the environment through 
the sensory and motor systems, it represents a closed system reliant 
on the resting state with constant parameters (Crossley et al., 2023). 
Therefore, the resting state functions as a thermal reservoir. At the same 
time, sensory perception constructs a self-contained thermodynamic cycle 
(as reviewed by Watts et al., 2020). In this manner, perception circles 
between the environment and the high entropy resting state. 
The Brain’s Energy Turnover: According to von Helmholtz (1882), the 
maximum work a thermodynamic process can perform on a constant 
volume equals the negative change in the free energy. Neurons within 
the brain expend energy to uphold their resting potential, activate action 
potentials, and transmit signals across synapses. The mitochondria 
manufacture adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from blood glucose, serving 
neurons’ high-energy demand. This energy turnover is so efficient that 
heightened local activation avoids exhausting ATP reserves and augments 
them. As a result, increased blood flow and oxygen supply around the 
active cells can be used as a marker of local brain activity. 
Complexity Generation: The brain exhibits an exceptionally high energy 
consumption rate, accounting for about 20% of the body’s total energy 
usage. This energetic expenditure primarily sustains the brain’s internal 
28	 A theoretical thermodynamic cycle proposed by the French engineer Sadi Carnot.
29	 A thermodynamically closed system conserves mass but energy can enter or exit freely.

Quantum Cognition  57
workings, with a smaller percentage allocated to activities evoked by 
external tasks (Huang, 2019). Consequently, the brain’s intrinsic activity, 
occurring even without specific tasks, surpasses those prompted by 
stimuli. 
In ordinary circumstances, the brain’s heat exchange with the 
external environment remains minimal; energy and information transfer 
exclusively transpire through the sensory organs and the muscular system. 
Analogous to how a mechanical engine requires lubrication to operate 
smoothly, the brain’s energy supply ensures the seamless transmission of 
information through its intricate neural network. However, in contrast to 
the work produced by a mechanical engine, perception by the brain gives 
rise to complexity. 
Information Transmission: One of the brain’s primary functions is 
information propagation. All memory storage devices, from the brain to 
the computer, store information by altering physical properties through 
energy-consuming processes. Significant energy consumption ensures 
the operational readiness of individual neurons (Fry, 2017). Notably, 
the speed of information transmission is contingent on the frequency of 
brain oscillations—higher frequencies transmit more information per 
unit of time than lower frequencies. Moreover, neurons cannot generate 
greater activation; instead, the firing rate of neurons reflects the intensity 
of stimulus and the speed and strength of muscle contractions. Therefore, 
stimulus imposes energy cost for the sensory input through the oscillation 
frequency.
The Reversibility of the Perception Cycle: The brain’s treatment of sensory 
information bears semblance to how fuel operates in an engine. Much 
like a spark ignites compressed gases in an engine, triggering combustion 
and the subsequent piston-driven motion that propels the vehicle, the 
subjective significance of sensory information acts as the spark igniting 
the cognitive cycle. As a result, the meaning attributed to information 
determines the cycle’s energy and direction, whether it’s an endothermic 
or exothermic process. The intricate geometry of the cerebral cortex gives 
rise to a dynamic intrinsic activation pattern on its surface, akin to fluid 
waves (Pang et al., 2023). This pattern holds more influence over arousal 
than the nature of the stimulus itself (Dempsey et al., 2022), effectively 
rendering arousal a probabilistic and reversible thermodynamic cycle 
(Figure 2). 
The Energy Consequences of Perception: Perception and memory formation 
drive oscillations beyond the constraints of the connection map 
(Inzlicht et al., 2018), thus fueling energetically demanding changes in 
synapses (Crossley et al., 2023). Cognitively taxing exothermic cycles that 

58 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
dissipate energy impairs cognitive functioning (Padamsey et al., 2022). 
Conversely, the endothermic process of the reversed cycle augments 
mental energy levels.30 
The Quantum Characteristics of Cognition: The reversibility of the brain’s 
cognitive cycle turns perception probabilistic. When the process reverses 
its direction, it creates an opposite thermodynamic outcome, lending a 
spin-like quality to perception. Furthermore, the cycle’s dependence on 
stimulus introduces contextuality, and the switch between the irreversible 
resting state and the reversible cognitive cycle is analogous to the 
wave-particle duality. Therefore, the highly complex neural system adopts 
quantum operation. 
Therefore, intelligent processing is analogous to information erasing, 
which decreases the temperature while increasing the overall neural 
organization (O’Neill and Schoth, 2022). 
The Path to Quantum Cognition
“Life is strong and fragile. It’s a paradox... It’s both things, like quantum 
physics: It’s a particle and a wave at the same time. It all exists all 
together.” ― Joan Jett
The dawn of the twentieth century marked a flurry of intellectual 
endeavors that would lay the foundation of quantum mechanics. However, 
the groundbreaking experiments, exemplified by the counterintuitive 
nature of wave-particle duality, perplexed and disconcerted physicists. 
Interestingly, an unexpected source of inspiration emerged, Carl Jung’s 
analytic psychology, which shaped Niels Bohr’s explorations into 
particle-wave duality. Furthermore, dialogues and exchanges with Carl 
Jung granted Pauli an almost mystic insight into particle physics. 
Where did such unlikely parallels come from? Jungian psychology 
views the images and symbols that emerge within dreams and perceptions 
as offering insights into the structural underpinnings of the mind, similar 
to scattering experiments unveiling the atom’s inner workings.31 Beyond 
scattering experiments, various frameworks of physics can elucidate 
enigmatic cognitive phenomena. For example, quantum mechanics, 
30	 The ability to transform information into energy, i.e., intellect, seems to be the brain’s 
essential quality. The energy gain of the neuronal system is intellectual evolution, which is 
closely intertwined with the environment. Although the environment controls the brain’s 
sensory input, the mind can control the environment.
31	 In physics, scattering experiments measure the deviation in the trajectory of particles 
following a collision with another particle. Scattering need not necessarily involve direct 
physical contact; instead, it can transpire through the interaction of particles repelling 
each other, such as in the case of two positively (or negatively) charged ions.

Quantum Cognition  59
which captures particles’ wave-like behavior, also provides insight into 
the context-dependence of decision-making. Like indivisible quantum 
entities, beliefs cannot be decomposed into smaller units. The main topics 
of human thoughts, such as God or politics, come down to affirming or 
opposing the idea. Beliefs are also updated through a discrete mental 
energy change, indicating the quantized nature of consciousness. 
Quantum mechanics32 has given us a wealth of technological 
advancements spanning atomic clocks, holography, Lasik Eye Surgery, 
smartphones, and quantum computers. Yet, beneath the impressive 
accomplishments over the past century, hide our complete ignorance of 
an intuitive understanding. Analogous to a present-day stomachache 
originating from tomorrow’s meal, the peculiarity of quantum phenomena 
renders outcomes contingent upon far-off observers. As quantum 
mechanics challenges our firm grip on reality, might the field of cognitive 
science offer remedies for this conundrum?
Conscious perception, encompassing a state of wholeness, becomes 
subject to non-deterministic, quantum-like fluctuations between dual 
possibilities. Where does the quantum character originate? Is it our neurons 
or cognition itself that produces these intricate quantum psychologies?
Much like electrons or photons, the mind defies classical assessment. 
The mental state remains elusive until the moment of decision-making, 
at which juncture potentialities crystallize into concrete attributes. 
Introducing sensory information, even as simple as opening the eyes, 
disrupts and changes the brain. However, measurement (stimulation, 
particularly pronounced incentives) cannot establish motivation, for 
it irrevocably alters emotional states, rendering the original condition 
uncertain.
Just as an electron cloud within an atom delineates a specific energy 
level but not an exact position, the brain’s response to identical stimuli 
varies slightly due to the influence of synaptic memories. Cognitive 
outcomes are intrinsically linked to the context of memories and 
situations. Quantum probability theory offers an explanatory framework 
for noncommutativity and order effects in decision-making (Pothos and 
Busemeyer, 2021). Additionally, Bose-Einstein statistics33 can account for 
the bandwagon effect34 in psychology (Khrenikov, 2020). In the digital 
age, social media platforms epitomize internet-based echo chambers, 
where coherent, high-amplitude informational waves can swiftly amass 
immense motivational energy.
33	 In bosonic system we cannot differentiate between the particles.
34	 The bandwagon effect is the tendency for people to adopt certain behaviors, styles, or attitudes 
simply because others are doing so.

60 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Everyday experiences feature objects with discernible speeds at 
specific points in space; however, particle measurement harbors inherent 
limitations. Simultaneous observation of complementary physical 
properties, like position and momentum, remains unattainable. Yet, 
as probabilistic quantum attributes coalesce into predictable physics, 
individualistic actions form stereotypical social patterns. The mathematical 
principles underpinning quantum physics leverage probabilistic datasets 
in psychology to forecast preferences in music, purchasing decisions, and 
political choices.
Unity in Quantum Mechanics
In quantum systems, the potentialities encapsulated within a 
wave function manifest as amplitudes that eventually resolve into 
well-defined observational outcomes (Selesnick and Piccinini, 2018). 
Similarly, conscious perception exhibits an unbroken continuity: 
when confronted with ambiguity, a non-deterministic, quantum-like 
fluctuation transpires between two options, images, ideas, or concepts, as 
exemplified by the perceptual alternation in the Necker cube’s dual depth 
representation (Einhäuser et al., 2008) see Figure 13. This phenomenon 
extends to binocular rivalry, where perceptions oscillate between the two 
sensory fields of the eyes (Tong et al., 2006) or the nostrils (Zhou and 
Chen, 2009).
Surgically separating the two hemispheres causes the famous 
split-brain experience. This division gives rise to disconnected mental 
Figure 13. Necker cube. The Necker cube is a wireframe cube with no depth cues. We 
perceive the image as three-dimensional with either the lower-left or the upper-right square 
as its front side.

Quantum Cognition  61
content, intentions, and distinct personalities within each hemisphere 
(Pinto et al., 2017). Intriguingly, a further partitioning of the brain leads 
to the annihilation of consciousness. Since particles represent matter’s 
fundamental constituents, it’s plausible to regard the mind as the elemental 
unit of intellect (Déli, 2020a). This prompts us to explore how this mental 
unity can generate the astonishing complexity characterizing the social 
world, commencing our inquiry with the concept of spin.
The Cognitive Cycle Formulates Psychological Spin
Otto Stern and Walter Gerlach designed a test to pass silver atoms through 
an inhomogeneous magnetic field, now known as the Stern–Gerlach 
experiment. The anticipated outcome for particle distribution, mirroring 
classical spinning objects, was one of randomness and continuity. 
However, contrary to this expectation, the particles exhibited an even 
distribution between two distinct states: approximately half positioned in 
an upper state “spin up”, and the remaining half in a lower state “spin 
down”. This phenomenon pointed to spin as an inherent manifestation 
of angular momentum, constituting an essential elementary particle 
character.
According to information theory, the Carnot cycle reconstructs the 
past (liberates past information) through dissipative processes, and the 
reversed Carnot cycle belongs to the intelligent ones that control the 
future (Cox, 1979). The above rule might be prescient in cognitive science. 
Mistakes represent a failure to move forward (exothermic). In contrast, 
achievement, healthy behavior, and even retirement planning (Li et al., 
2018) enhance mental energy (Déli et al., 2018) and inspire future focus 
(Deli, 2020b). 
The concept of reversible perception cycles naturally aligns with a 
spin interpretation. A psychological grasp of spin prompts consideration 
of attitudes, which serve as instantaneous, context-dependent motivators 
for action. In high-pressure, high-arousal environments, situations laden 
with significant stakes, or moral dilemmas, attitudes wield particular 
influence over thought processes (Bechler et al., 2019); refer to Figure 2/
right.
Drawing a parallel between the half-integer spin characterizing 
fermions like electrons, which dictates atomic structure (only one electron 
per set of possible quantum numbers), and psychological spin, we find a 
potential link to the hierarchical structure of society (Wato et al., 2020). As 
such, attitudes are pivotal in shaping the quality of social relationships, 
career trajectories, and achievements.

62 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
To illustrate endothermic and exothermic psychological states, 
envision a soldier charging toward a formidable enemy (Roberts, 2019). 
In the time reversal, the warrior runs cowardly away from the enemy. 
However, a note of caution arises against interpreting time reversal 
in a purely literal sense. The orthogonal position signifies uncertain 
back-and-forth vacillations of the coward that hinder mental progress. 
Subsequently, we explore how the reversible perception cycle gives 
rise to psychological spinor. 
The Mind as a Spinor 
“Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive 
one.” —Hans Selye
Within the realm of spinors, undergoing a 360° phase shift results in a 
directional alteration of –1, a trait rooted in their inherent half-spin 
characteristics. This transformation effectively converts them into their 
opposite spin state (as illustrated in Figure 7). Spinors encapsulate the 
fermionic capacity to manifest up and down spin orientations. Fermions 
themselves are representative of spinors; their wave function necessitates 
a 720-degree rotation to return to the original state. In our conventional 
experiential context, spinors can be analogously depicted through objects 
like a Mobius band35 (Figure 14). 
As earlier chapters have exemplified, the mind readily succumbs to 
distractions and veers away from logic. The spinor character introduces 
an additional layer of unpredictability to this dynamic. A psychological 
spinor embodies the disposition-dependent direction of the perception 
cycle. Motivation becomes malleable under the influence of stress 
and folly, capable of morphing honesty into cynicism and humor into 
vexation. Pain disappears when serving a noble cause, but the absence 
of trust can potentially transmute a gentle caress into mistreatment 
and affectionate words into skepticism (Zhang et al., 2019). The spinor 
attributes of consciousness significantly contribute to psychology’s 
replication (reproducibility) crisis. In this context, the spinor nature of 
the mind accentuates the pivotal role that attitude plays in shaping the 
trajectory of our life histories.

The Down-spin Psychology: While occasional stress can heighten reward 
motivation (Ironside et al., 2018), persistently negative emotional states 
deplete motivation (Kool and Botvinick, 2018). The latter occurs because 
stress accumulates (refer to Figure 15). For example, gamma rhythms in 
the prefrontal lobe (Gao et al., 2022) or increased connectivity in resting-
state networks (Gehrt et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023) elevate emotional 
Figure 15. The cognitive burden of negative emotions. Negative emotions accumulate in 
the prefrontal cortex inducing high frequency gamma rhythms (drawn after Gao et al., 2022).

intensity (Sakai, 2020), leading to deterministic behaviors like impulsivity 
and problems in error correction (Aberg et al., 2023). Cognitive burdens 
negatively affect IQ (Gao et al., 2022), as illustrated in Figure 3.
Like all exothermic systems, the low-entropy brain discharges energy 
(Deli and Kisvarday, 2020; Deli et al., 2021) (refer to Table II). Energy 
dissipation can occur through vigilance (Manohar et al., 2018), criticism, 
destructive behavior, or violence. Long-term potentiation decreases 
resting complexity and entropy (Déli et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2022), propelling 
monotonous and repetitive thinking (Wang, 2020). Intellectual limitations 
are outward signs of the constrained degrees of freedom (Kaiser et al., 
2016). A pessimistic fixation on past mistakes amplifies anger and sadness 
(Chen et al., 2023). Aggravation, violence, and regret represent exothermic 
energy release, compromising cognitive performance (Nuno-Perez et al., 
2021). The above argument explains the early burnout of aggressive, 
restless, and conflict-driven personalities. 
The wisdom of the German proverb, “Fear makes the wolf bigger 
than he is”, highlights anxiety’s power to impair one’s resolve (Meeusen 
et al., 2020). Going through the motions without having a heart for the 
venture is no different from outright quitting. Corrupted decision-making 
(Lin et al., 2022) renders people susceptible to addiction, emotional 
challenges (Meijers et al., 2018), and cognitive impairments (Grieder 
et al., 2018).
Sigmund Freud has already pointed out the role of emotions in 
developing chronic conditions, such as cancer (Justman, 2020) and other 
adverse health outcomes (Ruan et al., 2020). The cognitive burden can 
suppress immune function (Cunnane et al., 2020), activate stress hormones 
(Alhussien and Dang, 2020), and cause mental problems (Grieder et al., 
2018). The close link between psychological and physical health (reviewed 
by Koban et al., 2021) underlines the long-term health cost of aberrant 
thoughts and behavior. 
The Up-spin Psychology: Given the significance of self-reliance in coping 
and adjustment, positive psychology underscores the role of a positive 
environment and mindset in fostering ambition and accomplishment 
(Schubert et al., 2019). There is energy in positive emotions and the 
willingness to act enthusiastically and decisively. The reversed Carnot 
cycle centers on a high resting entropy (Gao et al., 2022), which parallels 
temporal variability, signifying fluid intelligence (Wang, 2021). The greater 
degrees of freedom inspire optimism, openness (Zmigrod et al., 2019), and 
creativity (Shi et al., 2019).

Quantum Cognition  65
The elevated entropy of the resting state signifies an accumulation of 
energy within the cycle, forming trust, belief, and confidence (Ryan and 
Deci, 2017). Mental energy is a structural facet of the brain that amplifies 
an individual’s capacity to accomplish tasks through consistent cognitive 
exertion.
Like changing a vehicle’s course involves a deliberate deceleration, 
rectifying errors necessitates a mental slowdown (Ryan and Deci, 2017). 
This mental deceleration, including practices like meditation, acceptance, 
and gratitude (Huang et al., 2020b), corresponds to a lower social 
temperature (O’Neill and Schoth, 2022; Déli et al., 2021). Positive states 
demand an initial cognitive investment; for instance, reward processing 
hinges on the production and release of thalamic neurotensin (Li et al., 
2018). The question arises: how does this initial investment of energy 
translate into the accumulation of mental energy?
Landauer’s principle has shown that erasing information from a 
memory storage device dissipates heat into the environment, increasing its 
entropy. According to Landauer, forgetting, which optimizes the growth 
and pruning of networks, is an intrinsic part of learning. In this context, 
learning potentially involves reciprocal changes in synapse connections 
(Dempsey et al., 2022), whereby the formation and retrieval of memories 
necessitate a concurrent loss of synapses. Despite the inclination to 
minimize uncertainty or entropy to streamline decision-making, pursuing 
certainty curtails the spectrum of possibilities, ultimately leading to an 
exothermic focus on the past.
In summary, positive emotions pinpoint exact moments while hiding 
their precise energy. In contrast, negative emotions make their potency 
evident while keeping their true origins elusive. The “law of orthogonality, 
acceptance” introduces further avenues for discussion.
The Quantum Zeno Effect: The quantum Zeno effect capitalizes on the 
particle-wave duality by employing frequent measurements centered 
around a specific configuration to halt the particle’s temporal progression. 
An illustrative instance involves continuously observing an inherently 
unstable particle, effectively preventing its decay. Intriguingly, the 
quantum Zeno effect also finds its relevance within psychology. For 
example, conscious intentions can be viewed as a ‘measurement’ or 
‘observation’. Similar to the evolution of a quantum system, which can be 
slowed due to repeated measurements, frequently ‘observing’ or focusing 
on a specific intention, the associated brain dynamics might be prevented 
from changing, allowing the intention to have a sustained impact. Within 
quantum cognition models, extended evaluation or introspection stabilizes 
the initial viewpoint (Rossi, 2021).

66 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Contextuality in Quantum Mechanics
“What we observe is not nature in itself but  nature exposed to our 
method of questioning.” ― Werner Heisenberg
The world of quantum mechanics often challenges our everyday intuitions. 
One of the more perplexing elements is the idea of contextuality. In 
essence, the properties or behaviors of quantum systems are determined 
by the system and how we measure or observe them. When we talk about 
context in everyday life, we might think about the different circumstances 
or settings in which something happens. Similarly, in quantum mechanics, 
‘context’ refers to the specific experimental setup or measurement choice. 
The outcome of a quantum event, like the spin of an electron, might 
depend on how and in what sequence we choose to measure it.
Classical systems, like a rolling ball or a swinging pendulum, behave 
the same way regardless of how we observe them. Their properties are 
intrinsic. But in the quantum world, the properties are not just inherent 
to the particle; they arise from the interplay between the particle and our 
chosen observation method. 
Quantum Logic vs. Classical Logic: The peculiarity of quantum systems 
leads to the need for a new type of logic, known as quantum logic or 
nondistributive logic. Unlike classical logic, which obeys distributive 
laws (like distributive quality in algebra), quantum logic does not. In a 
departure from classical logic, in quantum mechanics, measurements can 
disturb the state of the system, and the sequence in which measurements 
are made can lead to different outcomes.
However, this ‘logic’ is not about ordering or ranking events. Instead, 
it’s about understanding the hierarchy or relationship between different 
contexts (or experimental setups), particularly how they relate to or affect 
one another. The subsequent sections discuss complementarity,36 the 
uncertainty principle, and wave-particle duality. 
Context in Psychology
“To shift your life in a desired direction, you must powerfully shift your 
subconscious.” ― Kevin Michel
Perception is highly dependent on subjective variables as the interplay 
between system and context forms the very fabric of the quantum realm 
(Heelan, 1970). For instance, food may be highly desirable for a hungry 
36	 Complementarity expresses the quality of requiring knowledge of both particle and wave 
aspects of a quantum system.

Quantum Cognition  67
animal but repulsive for a sick one. Substantial incentives, whether bribes 
or threats, yield distorted, polarized, and thus unpredictable reactions 
(Kleiner, 2018). 
In psychology, context refers to the role of circumstances in the outcome 
of a study. The mental state is malleable and sensitive to incentives and 
bribes. Context,37 such as wording effects, can modify mood and response. 
Word recall can instantly conjure up related terms like ‘ball’, triggering 
softball, tennis ball, football, soccer ball, globe, ballplayer, and others. 
Social questionnaires and search engine optimization methods must 
consider these challenges. 
The human ability to control Earth’s resources is far superior to 
animals’ simple existence, grazing or hunting for food. In Edwin Abbott’s 
1884 novella, Flatland, the citizens have a limited two-dimensional 
experience. However, the hero’s experience of a three-dimensional world 
inspires him to imagine even higher spatial dimensions. Like the primitive 
Flatlander vision, we are bound by social and cultural beliefs. 
Context dependence turns intelligence flexible, as opportunities can 
liberate a rainbow of talents, such as linguistic, logical, visual, spatial, 
musical, interpersonal, or intrapersonal skills. Overcoming personal 
and professional challenges can propel people to the top of their careers. 
Franklin Roosevelt’s paralysis from polio did not keep him from becoming 
president, Sylvester Stallone’s facial paralysis did not prevent him from 
acting, and Imre Kertész could write about survival in a concentration 
camp. These people became extraordinary by switching the ‘context’ of 
their lives. 
Duality 
One of the giants of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, introduced the 
notion of complementarity. It suggests that a single quantum entity (like 
an electron) can display dual behaviors (like particle and wave properties) 
but not simultaneously. Which behavior is observed depends on the 
experimental context. 
The particle’s ability to exhibit both point-like (discrete) and wave-like 
(probabilistic) behaviors is analogous to the metaphor of the blind men 
observing an elephant. The men must synthesize individual observations 
to comprehend the entirety of an elephant. Likewise, describing 
particles necessitates both particle-like and wave-like characterizations. 
The quantum quality of cognition (refer to Table I) is exemplified by 
phenomena such as the Necker cube (depicted in Figure 13). In the case of 
the Necker cube, the visual system manipulates ambiguous lines in a way 
37	 Context is the circumstance forming of an event, statement, or idea, which is necessary for 
a complete understanding.

that only one of the possible three-dimensional interpretations is valid at 
any given time.
Surprisingly, the concept of wave-particle duality also applies 
to the way stimuli trigger our thoughts. When activated, the resting 
brain’s wandering thoughts suddenly take on a distinct shape, like a 
wave transforming into a particle. Similarly, the relationship between 
experience and memory exhibits a similar switch between ambiguity and 
certainty, i.e., wave and particle. For instance, emotional affairs can alter 
our perception of time, and memories tend to accumulate based on their 
emotional significance. As a result, time is stretched and compressed to fit 
into our emotional story.
In the words of E.C.G. Sudarshan, “Conclusions, premises, feelings, 
and insights coexist in a manner that defies temporal order.” The 
remarkable fluidity and vagueness of subconscious thoughts, emotions, 
and mental concepts contrast the discrete nature of convictions and faiths 
(Herzog et al., 2020). Despite gradual synaptic changes, beliefs are updated 
in discrete steps to build upon one another. This kind of cognitive duality 
leads us to uncertainty.
Uncertainty 
 “The mistake is thinking that there can be an antidote to the uncertainty.” 
― David Levithan
A speedometer provides us with the car’s speed at any given moment. 
However, quantum mechanics makes pinning down a particle’s location 
contingent on disrupting its momentum. The Heisenberg uncertainty 
principle forbids the simultaneous measurement of a quantum system’s 
position and velocity. Uncertainty is a consequence of complementarity. 
The origin of this uncertainty within quantum mechanics is intriguing. 
Separating the wave function from the gravitational field conceals the 
quantum wave’s evolution into a timeless dimension. When measured, 
an interaction occurs, altering quantum frequencies and the classical 
updating of the field curvature. The crux of uncertainty and wave-particle 
duality resides in the clear differentiation between the wave function and 
the field. 
Uncertainty in Psychology: The brain’s activations reflect the ebb and flow 
of probabilistic, reversible energy dynamics. Analogous to the above 
timelessness of the wave function, thoughts epitomize a state free from 
time constraints. The deeper the mental engagement, the more detached 
from time-keeping imagination becomes.
Decision-making ceases the brain’s probabilistic computations, 
introducing certainty. Paradoxically, we often opt for unfavorable news 

Quantum Cognition  69
over tormenting uncertainty. Although the search for a closing is deeply 
embedded in the mind, the value of information lies in its novelty for 
this predictive machinery.38 Our engagement with adventure, horror, 
cliffhangers, and round-the-clock news channels stretches our sense of 
suspense like taffy candy. The heightened tension maintains our focus, 
offering a resolution just before reaching the point of no return.
The uncertainty principle also extends into intentional space and time 
within the human experience (Anderson et al., 2019). Heisenberg’s principle 
implies between the time of the event and its momentum represented by 
motivation. In the case of positive experiences, interaction reveals their 
precise timing as they bubble forth with immediate enthusiasm. However, 
their holistic presence cannot offer quantification of their energy. There 
exists only complete happiness. Negative emotions, on the other hand, 
lead to a precise energy scaling of behaviors ranging from criticism and 
shouting to physical violence.
Nonetheless, their gradual accumulation in the brain’s connection 
network is similar to sand piles. The slightest, most minor irritation can 
unleash their accumulated power onto unsuspecting recipients with the 
ferocity of a storm. Therefore, hurts create a lasting trace in the deep 
crevices of our minds, even if they do not generate a reply. 
The Pauli Principle in Mental Interaction
“All things are made of atoms—little particles that move around 
in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little 
distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.” 
― Richard Feynman
Every alteration stems from the interaction of particles. Similar to 
minuscule gyroscopes, particles exhibit an inherent flow of energy known 
as spin,39 which has the potential to impact the geometry of the spatial 
field. Matching geometries (spins) produce energy maxima (depicted in 
Figure 16A), which is unstable. Consequently, particles push each other 
to form contrasting spin configurations to fulfill the energy minima 
condition, an essential principle in physics (as illustrated in Figure 
16B). This fundamental stipulation is referred to as the Pauli exclusion 
principle,40 a central idea within the realm of quantum mechanics.
38	 New is the information’s ability to update comprehension.
39	 Spin is always an active, up or down state, which reflects the wave function’s connection 
with the gravity field.
40	 Pauli exclusion principle explains why two or more identical matter particles (same spin) 
cannot occupy the same quantum state.

70 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Social Aspects of the Pauli Principle 
Although our personal space is highly subjective and situation-dependent, 
relationships are characterized by precise emotional distance. The 
emotional distance also applies to attachments toward abstract entities 
or ideas. We automatically react to the slightest deviation in our drive to 
maintain emotional separation.41 Detachment triggers a need for closeness, 
but neediness prompts the need for independence. The amygdala is 
responsible for the Pauli principle by controlling interpersonal distance 
in psychology.
Opposite Spin States: According to quantum mechanics, identical fermions 
cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state to neutralize 
spin momentums. The same rule is valid in psychology; close proximity 
to strangers or seeing emotionally disturbing images, even if unaware, 
causes us to feel aversion. Animals generally defend their personal space. 
However, a threat may trigger a fight or flight response42 (Figure 10). In 
some cases, animals will freeze or play dead as a last resort to escape 
danger. 
When interacting socially, opposition to others is spontaneous 
(as shown in Figure 16B). In small children, the discovery of their 
41	 Emotional distance is the degree of trust toward others.
42	 An automatic physiological reaction to a stressful or frightening event activates the 
sympathetic nervous system and triggers an acute stress response that prepares the body 
to fight or flee.
Figure 16. The geometric basis of the Pauli exclusion principle. “P” represents particles, 
while lines indicate field geometries. “D” and “U” represent down and up spin respectively. 
Identical spin particles form energy maxima, while opposite spin particles form a minimal 
energy formation. 

Quantum Cognition  71
independent selves is indicated by the profuse use of the word ‘no’. Physics 
explains this contrarian disposition as the minimal energy configuration 
where aggravation represents down spin. However, it’s important to 
note that the Pauli principle only applies to emotional proximity. Richard 
Feynman’s quote also applies to society: people detest being squeezed 
into one another. Our strongest emotions are usually reserved for those 
we are strongly connected to, including the desire to take a break from 
their company. Unfortunately, this strong identification can also lead to 
historical conflicts between groups with shared backgrounds, such as 
the Sunni and Shia, Christians and Jews, Christians and Arabs, Jews and 
Muslims, and Democrats and Republicans.
Shared-down Spin: Mutual downward spin is the maximum energy 
formation of exothermic states, typified by shared antagonism and 
jealousy. At the neural level, reciprocal comparisons with others lead to 
rivalry (Peng and Xie, 2016; Saaty and Vargas, 2017) for the same things. 
However, rivalry injects similarities within the social classes while 
promoting social stratification. Ultimately, this hostile inclination results 
in a reluctance to offer compliments or ask for assistance. Therefore, shared 
downspins impose high cognitive costs and act against social cohesion. 
Despite this phenomenon’s substantial energy requirements and role 
in social discord, intense social stress, such as economic difficulties or 
worsening living conditions, sparks collective animosity and polarization. 
In numerous countries, the political landscape is characterized by the 
dominance of two major parties that champion opposing viewpoints on 
various issues. Competing companies often work against collaboration as 
they prioritize safeguarding and promoting their distinct systems. 
On a global scale, countries organize into blocs with similar economic 
and political ideologies. This leads to polarization and prevents any 
force from dominating but, unfortunately, leads to significant wastage. 
The atmosphere of competition triggers activities like military buildup, 
espionage, and political maneuvering, ultimately exacerbating human 
suffering. 
Shared-up Spin 
Like shared-down spin, mutual up-spin is an energetically expensive 
formation. These configurations are exclusive to trusting environments or 
situations with significant personal distance, as discussed below.
A. Trusting Environments: Shared up spin requires social energy input
in the form of patience and respect. Its existence is limited to trusting

72 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
and altruistic social formations, such as family, friendship, school, or 
healthcare settings (as depicted in Figure 16A).
A, Mitigating the Pauli Principle via Distance: The philosopher Sextus 
once said, “Absence makes the heart grow fonder,” which provides a 
social perspective to Richard Feynman’s earlier quote. Distance, whether 
physical from our loved ones or social, from celebrities, politicians, and 
saints can lead to identification and attraction. The latter gives celebrities 
significant influence on shaping public opinion.
The Hierarchic Mind 
In the words of Erwin Schrodinger, “Entanglement is not one but rather 
the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics.” Entanglement facilitates 
the evolution of hidden energy disparities within a shared wave function. 
This correlation preserves the energy of the combined system, resulting 
in reciprocal energy changes for the constituent particles. Decoherence 
ends entanglement by separating the wave function into two distinct 
particles, revealing their individual attributes and positions. This process 
of entanglement, followed by interaction, gives rise to the vast intricacies 
of the cosmos.
Like the rich structure of space, social entanglement gives birth to 
hierarchical social evolution. Social entanglement engenders disparities 
in access to time (which can manifest as stress or contentment). Variations 
in mental comfort, particularly in terms of time perception, lead to the 
subordination of one participant to another. In societies marked by 
significant class divisions, this hierarchical structure helps suppress 
conflicts. However, with the advent of democratization, such class 
separation gives rise to thorny moral dilemmas. While entanglement 
plays a role in individual energy disparities, the stabilization of social 
stratification requires a gravity field (for a deeper exploration, refer to 
“The Structure of Society - Socioeconomic Status”). This dynamic gives 
rise to a duality between the properties of the wave function and the field.
Interference 
“Nothing happens until something moves. When something vibrates, 
the electrons of the entire universe resonate with it. Everything is 
connected.” — Albert Einstein.
The Double-slit Experiment stands as the most renowned phenomenon 
within quantum mechanics. The name “double-slit” arises from a 

Quantum Cognition  73
partition featuring two narrow apertures through which particles can 
pass. The wave function’s peaks and troughs are superimposed within 
the experiment’s context. This interplay of interference serves to amplify, 
diminish, or nullify the amplitudes, thereby generating a waveform 
marked by heightened or reduced amplitude (as depicted in Figure 17).
The Double-slit Experiment: The Double-slit Experiment involves the 
projection of photons (or other particles) onto a light-sensitive screen, 
which produces distinct dots. However, when these particles traverse a 
double-slit configuration, they create an interference pattern reminiscent 
of waves. The two setups highlight the concept of wave-particle duality: 
a quantum entity can exhibit characteristics of both a particle and a wave.
Amazingly, a measurement apparatus placed behind one of the slits 
abolishes interference. Even more astonishingly, the particle can land in a 
discrete position behind either of the slits on the screen. The conclusion is 
that the particle senses the device’s presence even if traveling through the 
opposite slit. The perplexing question emerges: How does a measurement 
taken behind a single opening influence the outcomes of both possible 
paths? The answer finds its roots in wave-particle duality. Analogous to 
a computer’s restart button function, a measurement reconfigures the 
whole particle’s wave function. The exchange of energy with the field 
changes the field curvature and the particle energy function, subsequently 
canceling out interference.
Figure 17. Interference between two same-frequency waves. Correlated waves (their peaks 
and troughs line up) generate interference. Destructive interference subtracts the waves’ 
amplitudes, reducing their size (top). Constructive interference sums the amplitudes to 
create higher peaks (bottom). 

74 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Constructive and Destructive Interference 
During interference, two correlated (coherent) waves43 superimpose to 
form a resultant wave of greater or lesser amplitude. Its effects can be 
observed in all types of waves (for example, light, acoustic, and water 
waves). Constructive interference occurs when the crest of one wave 
meets the crest of another wave of the same frequency at the same point. 
Constructive interference sums the waves’ amplitudes. In destructive 
interference, the crest of one wave meets the trough of another wave. In 
this case, the magnitude of the displacements is equal to the difference 
in the individual sizes. When the phases meet at intermediate points 
between these two extremes, the resulting shape of the summed waves 
lies between the minimum and maximum values.
Interference in Psychology 
“It would be most satisfactory of all if physics and psyche could be seen 
as complementary aspects of the same reality.” ― Wolfgang Pauli 
Within psychology, repetition can align the similarities between 
separate events. In this context, interference encompasses aggregating 
or subtracting the structural peaks and troughs among experiences, 
thus influencing their impact. The manipulation of cognition through 
interference (as explored by Chandler, 1989) sheds light on the malleability 
of memories and knowledge. Often oblivious to the broader repercussions, 
individuals unfailingly form a temporal interference pattern in shopping 
habits, election results, or aversion (Xu and Schwarz, 2018).
Interference Theory: Interference theory, which posits that memory affects 
the pace of learning, has been a staple of psychology since 1892, predating 
the advent of quantum theory. Destructive interference hampers learning 
and memory performance, whereas constructive interference accelerates 
these aspects (as illustrated in Figure 17). The mental disturbance either 
complicates or simplifies retaining new information (Anderson, 2000). In 
the proactive scenario, existing knowledge overshadows new material. 
For instance, practicing sorting items with a different arrangement slows 
performance. In the retroactive case, recently acquired data, such as new 
phone numbers, can displace older ones from recall.
Destructive interference makes updating old information and 
modifying habits more challenging than acquiring fresh knowledge. 
However, interference can play a positive role when repeated exposure 
43	 Correlated waves originate from the same source, or they have the same frequency.

Quantum Cognition  75
unveils deeper meanings or shifts perspectives. Often, students attain a 
more mature comprehension of subjects as they progress to higher-level 
classes, and adult insight replaces a child’s innocent outlook on events. 
Social Interference 
Operating instantaneously and independently of conscious participation, 
mental interference amplifies or dampens personal intentions. It can 
override economic rationality in various aspects of our social lives. For 
instance, aesthetically pleasing public spaces evoke a sense of security 
and encourage positive behavior (as depicted in Figure 9). The aroma of 
household cleaners fosters cleanliness and activities that promote prosocial 
behavior inspire charity. Disorderly surroundings, such as random piles 
of trash, can stimulate feelings of stress, asocial thoughts, and phobias, 
leading to stereotyping, carelessness, and delinquent conduct. Similarly, 
although playing violent games can alleviate stress, its long-term antisocial 
effects can lead to aggressive behavior. Interference gives rise to social 
phenomena through temporal waves and bursts.
Impact on Decision-making: Temporal interference wields significant 
influence over decision-making processes. For instance, in a game reported 
by Savage (1954), where participants have an equal chance of winning 
$200 or losing $100, approximately 69 percent of winners and 59% of 
losers choose to play another round. Logically, not knowing the outcome 
should result in an average between the winners’ and losers’ percentages 
(64%). Surprisingly, uncertainty prompts interference, leading to a drop 
in the players’ combined ratio to 36 percent (Tversky and Shafir, 1992). 
Without feedback, the mind exists in a state of quantum uncertainty. 
Gaining knowledge of the outcome acts as a measurement device, which 
collapses the wave function and forms interaction. Interaction opens the 
path to a logical decision.
Prisoner’s Dilemma: The prisoner’s dilemma is a renowned psychological 
analogy to the double-slit paradox (Stewart and Plotkin, 2013). In this 
scenario, two separately incarcerated criminals face prison sentences. They 
can either collaborate with their partner (by remaining silent) or betray 
each other (by confessing). Cooperation results in a reduced punishment, 
while defection offers freedom but imposes a significantly longer sentence 
on the cooperative companion. Remarkably, individuals overwhelmingly 
opt to support and cooperate with each other, an inclination best explained 
by the interference theory. Without interaction, the mind is in quantum 
limbo and subject to interference. 

76 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Interference can complicate problem-solving. Uncertainty surrounding 
event outcomes can hinder progress in one’s life. Again, the absence of 
closure inhibits decision-making. The mental ambiguity can maintain 
persistent efforts to search for a lost treasure, a past love, or a scientific 
breakthrough. The process may appear as loyalty, determination, curiosity, 
or laziness for outside observers. Adopting an external perspective on the 
problem is a form of interaction that resolves uncertainty.
Investment Bubbles: Advertisements often portray idealized dreams that 
exaggerate appeal through interference with natural desires. Significant 
and widely publicized financial gains pique interest, leading to the 
formation of investment bubbles. When the rapid price growth halts, 
enthusiasm turns sour, resulting in destructive interference. This shift 
prompts avoidance behavior, triggering a frenzied sell-off that causes 
the price to plummet. These losses offset the previously unsubstantiated 
gains. A parallel instance is the bandwagon effect, explored further in the 
section “Social Lasing”.
Social Lasing
“Realize that everything connects to everything else.” ― Leonardo Da 
Vinci
The process of laser amplification involves the stimulation of an atom 
with the help of multiplier mirrors to emit identical photons, resulting 
in the production of coherent light. This type of light can be focused on a 
small area or transmitted over long distances without diverging, making 
it useful for various applications such as communication, pointing, and 
cutting/marking materials. 
Social Lasing: Social interference gives rise to investment bubbles, but 
social lasing is an even more effective collective motivator. Social laser 
intensifies social energy44 into coherent actions. On social media, reposting 
boosts the amplitude and coherence of information waves (social energy), 
serving as a multiplier mirror (Khrennikov, 2023). 
Amplified discontent can trigger revolutions and protest movements 
like Brexit or the Arab Spring. Therefore, social lasers transform information 
radiation into specified behavior and physical action sequences, confirming 
that the brain operates as a thermodynamic machine. 
44	 Social energy is a special form of motivation boosting decision-making. 

Quantum Cognition  77
The Fermionic Mind Hypothesis (FMH)
“We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question that divides 
us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct.” 
— Niels Bohr
Imre Lakatos, the Hungarian-born science philosopher, pointed out that 
some scientific theories may not be directly falsified. A hypothesis should 
be assessed by its capacity to generate novel insights and predictions of 
previously unknown phenomena (Doerig et al., 2022). 
Consciousness embodies a self-regulating system akin to a particle, 
specifically a fermion (as outlined in Table I). The mind can uphold its 
internal stability and enduring nature while seamlessly adapting to the 
ever-evolving surroundings. Put simply, despite constant fluctuations, 
the mind remains fundamentally unchanging—an attribute that mirrors 
the electron,45 the most familiar fermion.
The Holographic Mind: The Fermionic Mind Hypothesis (FMH) stands 
out as a distinct theory by elucidating consciousness attributes through 
reference to the particle structure in physics. The continuous flow of 
information from the environment projects an inverted representation 
onto the cortical surface in an involuntary process—a phenomenon 
aligned with the second law of thermodynamics. The mind, guided by an 
inherent comprehension of the environment and its governing laws, is an 
innate generator of remarkably unified and holographic consciousness.
Particle-wave Duality: Despite the necessity for diligent practice, acquiring 
skills like walking or riding a bike is an abrupt accomplishment, with the 
skill emerging in a sudden flash of clarity. The same vague uncertainty 
characterizes the thinking process or the initial phase of the perception 
cycle. Nevertheless, decision-making or recognition crystalizes the chaos 
in a discrete energy switch that triggers cognitive clarity. The probabilistic 
nature of the subconscious and the field-like stability of self-consciousness 
(Wolff et al., 2019) are reminiscent of the wave-particle duality. Surprisingly, 
the reversal of the process also represents a wave-particle transformation. 
Activation by stimulus reduces the diffuse exploratory resting thoughts 
into sensory action. Therefore, our experience can only offer us the fluidity 
of the wave function intercepted by flashes of recognition. 

78 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
This duality leads to one of the psyche’s most perplexing, 
counterintuitive, and challenging aspects. The introspectively accessible, 
phenomenal facets of the mind lie at the core of the mind-body problem. 
Instead of attempting to deconstruct this complex puzzle step by step, a 
resolution can be found by recognizing the mind as the most fundamental 
unit of intelligence.
The Observer Mind: Evolution didn’t introduce entirely new laws for 
life and consciousness; instead, the brain adapts to its environment 
by incorporating the regulatory principles of the laws of physics. 
Consequently, intellect can be defined as an endothermic process that 
increases complexity. Consciousness signifies an awareness of the 
mind’s distinct observer status over the self-regulating brain. Our beliefs, 
internal dialogues, and stable sense of self originate from this resting 
state. Its particle-like isolation bestows the mind with its self-referential 
characteristic—an individual’s internal, subjective perspective.
Temporal Continuity: As perception revolves around the resting state, it 
shows reversibility and probabilistic nature. Moreover, the comprehension 
of stimulus triggers thoughts and emotions, which reach back to the 
regulatory foundations of physics for conceptual orientation in time. 
Therefore, perception is a thermodynamic cycle that confers attitudes 
with temporal direction and motivational energy. Temporal directionality 
represents cognitive spin. Up spin comes from an endothermic process, 
while down spin is exothermic. As particle spin entails intrinsic angular 
momentum, psychological spin corresponds to intrinsic motivation. 
Consequently, the mathematical tools developed for addressing quantum 
mechanics problems are highly applicable to addressing specific queries 
(and paradoxes) in psychology and the social sciences.
We have observed that the generation of energy within the cognitive 
cycle depends on the significance of stimuli, and the scope of free will is 
confined to determining the direction of that cycle. Notably, abrupt shifts 
in the neural dynamics form between the hippocampus and prefrontal 
regions, stemming from bifurcations (Sridhar et al., 2021). These 
contrasting gradients, representing past or future behavioral trajectories, 
support the above conclusions. 
Dilation of Time Perception: In analogy to the phenomenon of time dilation 
caused by photons, the motivational potency of emotions must lie in 
their ability to expand the perception of time. Emotions like hunger 
and fear motivate engagement with the external world by altering time 
perception to fulfill the thermodynamic imperative of restoring the 
resting state. Hence, emotions are the fundamental drivers of motivation 
(Déli, 2020a, b); their remarkable capacity to generate action gives rise to 

Quantum Cognition  79
the belief in free will. Moreover, the thermodynamic analysis of perception 
makes it clear that quantum phenomena can ensure energy conservation. 
The energy conservation of entangled particle evolution is only possible if 
they are part of one combined system. 
The Temporal Fermion: The origin of mental regulation can be traced back 
to general relativity and quantum mechanics, reinforcing the fundamental 
coherence between the mind and the physical realm. Just as fermions 
adhere to the stationary action principle in physics, the mind’s predictive 
processes epitomize the most economical, mental path toward the future. 
Supersymmetry theory posits the existence of a super-partner for each 
fermion. By extension, it’s conceivable that the mind is the temporal 
super-partner to fermions. 
FMH demonstrates that evolution can harness physical laws to 
motivate self-preservation and survival. As a result, the universality of 
physical laws extends to the realm of intellect. Physics emerges as the 
exclusive guiding principle behind the intricately harmonious cosmos. 
Rather than devising novel forces and laws, biological evolution integrated 
the existing physical laws into the brain’s framework to forge the most 
efficient regulatory mechanism―the intelligent mind.
Consequences of the Fermionic Mind Hypothesis: Drawing inspiration from 
Imre Lakatos’ ideas, the Fermionic Mind Hypothesis (FMH) unveils fresh 
explanations and insights into the brain’s inner workings, addressing 
pivotal queries within the field of consciousness science: (1) The basis of 
the brain’s self-regulation is the resting balance. (2) The evoked cycle’s 
search for thermodynamic balance occurs through emotions. Indeed, 
residual emotional charge corrupts the resting coherence and openness 
(Gehrt et al., 2022). (3) The neural bifurcations between the hippocampus 
and prefrontal regions (Sridhar et al., 2021) embody contrasting gradients, 
signifying the divergence between past and future focal paths—a 
foundational element of quantum probability. (4) Emotions’ exceptional 
motivational power to incite action occurs by slowing time perception. 
The temporal orientation of the mind vis-à-vis material systems 
represents orthogonality, turning the dilations of time into the dilation 
of time perception. Therefore, time perception represents field curvature. 
(5) Decision-making transforms probabilistic thoughts and concepts into
the stable convictions that characterize the resting state.
The brain’s cognitive cycle can run in reverse, making perception 
uncertain. This reversal provides a spin-like quality due to the opposite 
energy direction. The switch between the irreversible resting state and 
the reversible cognitive cycle is similar to the wave-particle duality. As a 
result, the cerebral system adapts to quantum characteristics. 

80 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
In physics, quantum mechanics relates to the behavior of matter and 
energy on the scales of atoms and subatomic particles. How can the brain, 
a classical system, give rise to quantum cognition? The answer comes 
from the brain’s operational dimension. Perception is an orthogonal 
transformation of the spatial sensory signals into a temporal rhythm, the 
fundamental operating principle of the mind. While elementary particles 
are regulated by gravitational curvature (contraction or expansion of 
space), cognition is sensitive to the perception of time, a quality transmitted 
by emotions. Perception turns time into a flexible field, enabling quantum 
computation. The perpendicular transformation from space to time 
endows cognition with quantum computing abilities. However, quantum 
cognition is a temporal quantum computer. 
Comprehending physical laws fundamentally shapes our intellect―
the understanding of gravity, for instance, empowers us to achieve balance, 
engage in running, and propel a ball through the air. As these physical 
laws are assimilated, the mind takes on a particle-like organization.
As we reflect on the universe we are part of, our minds assume the 
form of a distinctive, particle-like cosmos. The particle-like stability 
ensures the continuum of conscious selfhood from infancy to old age, 
transcending the profound changes occurring to the body and brain. 
Consequently, the essential nature of an individual’s mind reflects the 
entirety of the universe, corroborating the Eastern concept of the unity of 
existence—Atman and Brahman are one.
To comprehend particles is to comprehend the mind and, by extension, 
to understand the universe itself.
Hard-to-Explain Experiences 
Our brains are constantly trying to predict the future, which can 
sometimes lead to errors in perception, such as sensory hallucination 
of expected objects that are not there. Pareidolia is the mind’s tendency 
to find meaningful patterns, especially faces, in random data. Making 
up things is even easier in dreams. Dreams can be a wild and bizarre 
carnival of strange and unconventional narratives created by our brains 
by combining different memories and experiences. However, unlike 
our wakeful cognitive processes, we rarely question the absurdities we 
encounter in our dreams. 
Our brains can be selective about the information we process, leading 
to inattentional blindness. This means we can miss apparent things in our 
visual field because our attention is elsewhere. This emphasizes the limits 
of our perception and how our brains prioritize information. The strange 
feeling that a new situation has occurred before is known as déjà vu, and it 
continues to puzzle scientists. 

Quantum Cognition  81
The above occurrences have no current scientific explanation. Still, the 
brain’s autonomic self-regulation can provide a plausible interpretation. 
Sensory perception is driven unceasingly by memories and experiences 
into a projected anticipation. Pareidolia and dreams have similar origins; 
they can be kaleidoscopes of our fears, experiences, expectations, or 
discoveries. A great story is of the nineteenth-century German chemist 
August Kekulé, who claimed to have pictured the ring structure of 
benzene46 after dreaming of a snake eating its own tail.
Finally, neuroscience and psychology have tried to explain many 
human characteristics due to millions of years of evolutionary selection 
pressures. However, the temporal particle offers a radically different 
paradigm that defies simple evolutionary explanation. Although the 
mental particle is subjected to evolutionary pressure, its fundamental 
character traits emerge from thermodynamic pressures rather than 
predator-prey dynamics. 
Future Directions
We are losing control over our future due to climate change and economic 
inequality, which increasingly force migration and human suffering. 
Additionally, we face ongoing conflict and war. To address these issues, 
we must prioritize integrity over individuality, empathy over rivalry, 
solidarity over patriotism, wisdom over white-collar superiority, and 
consensus over discipline. According to traditional psychology, these are 
intractable issues. However, the physical approach to consciousness can 
provide a solid path toward a transformation, which is organic, originating 
at the individual level, and can act in synergy with leadership to radically 
transform our social fabric. 
The 
preceding 
discussions 
have 
centered 
on 
gravity 
and 
electromagnetism—two fundamental forces shaping our everyday 
experiences. In contrast, nuclear forces operate within the atomic range. 
Among these forces, the weak interaction is responsible for the breakdown 
of unstable elements, and the strong interaction, also known as the 
strong nuclear force, is responsible for confining quarks within particles 
called hadrons. This force boasts two distinct ranges, operating through 
corresponding force carriers. The weaker of the two binds protons and 
neutrons (nucleons) within the atomic nucleus. The stronger one is 
the gluon, which ensures the cohesion of quarks within hadrons. The 
impossibility of quark separation illustrates the gluons’ immense strength. 
When quarks are separated by a distance surpassing the diameter of an 
46	 An aromatic functional group characterized by a ring of six carbon atoms, bonded by 
alternating single and double bonds.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
atomic nucleus, the result is the emergence of additional quark-antiquark 
pairs, which occupy the intervening space.
These forces’ social analogies are speculative. The social equivalent of 
strong nuclear force is trust, an emotion regulating emotional closeness. 
Trust takes root in shared dignity and fosters a sense of unity, bridging 
differences among people and even animals. Trust invokes respect while 
liberating from fear. Similar to the behavior of the strong nuclear force, its 
hold diminishes when in close quarters but gains potency as the distance 
between individuals grows. Trust endures through loss by reformulating 
itself in the community. Dignity fosters an environment of trust, exerting 
its influence on the broader society.
The following parallel processes will fundamentally transform our 
social structure. The inevitable introduction of universal basic income 
will spare people from losing their moral compass due to necessity, as 
explained by Festinger’s cognitive dissonance theory. The slowing and 
reversal of population growth combined with increasing productivity 
and creative potential of the individual due to technological development 
will dramatically increase the value and dignity of the individual. This 
will sweep away the current, highly competitive, often cutthroat business 
environment, where resorting to misleading and cheating customers is 
the norm. The employees are often subjected to abusive treatment in the 
interest of profit. 
As the social environment changes, so does the social structure. 
People can be compassionate about events affecting the furthest corner of 
the Earth. Therefore, the interest of others is just as important as that of 
the self. 
As demonstrated, the same phenomena can adopt distinct 
interpretations when viewed through classical and quantum physics 
lenses. Although science strives for a unique explanation for various 
phenomena, in reality, multiple insights often can complement each 
other. The evolution of scientific thought throughout history supports 
the latter argument. During the history of science, explanations of various 
phenomena have grown in complexity as science has delved deeper into 
details and achieved a more profound comprehension. In fact, diverse 
perspectives can yield more intuitive insights.

“Optimism is the one quality more associated with success and happiness 
than any other.”
― Brian Tracy
In the preceding sections, we observed that animal survival hinges on 
the astute interpretation of the external environment, which serves the 
maintenance of biological functioning and physiological and psychological 
balance. Emotions prompt the actions to achieve those aims. Just as energy 
transitions between various forms, emotions transform and motivate 
behaviors. Emotional motivation transforms into work representing muscle 
movement. Drawing a parallel to photons, which influence electron behavior, 
sentiments generate intentions and behavior. Just as photons represent 
elemental forces, emotions constitute fundamental drivers of motivation. 
This chapter discusses the role of emotions in normal human physiology. 
Intelligence
“The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.” — Albert Einstein
At its core, intelligence is an adaptive mechanism that allows individuals 
to interact optimally with their environment. As remembered, the spider’s 
intelligence rests in its ability to catch prey by sensing the net vibrations. 
While animals primarily rely on genetic adaptations over long periods, 
humans have the unique capability to create tools, technology, and 
social constructs that shape their environment. Human ingenuity and 
insight led to social evolution, which increasingly transforms culture 
and social organization. In turn, technological development increases the 
productivity and creative potential of the individual.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Forms of Intelligence: Human intelligence is multifaceted. Gardner’s 
theory expands the traditional view of intelligence to include musical, 
bodily-kinesthetic, and interpersonal intelligence. These various forms 
confirm the perspective of parents and educators that students think and 
learn in many different ways. These diverse forms of intelligence emphasize 
that human potential is not strictly tied to logical or mathematical abilities.
Intelligence is highly heritable and predicts important educational, 
occupational, and health outcomes better than any other trait (Plomin and 
von Stumm, 2018). Nevertheless, it is also malleable; for example, major 
systematic interventions, such as education (Brinch and Galloway, 2012), 
diet (Protzko, 2016), or adoption (Duyme, 1999) can make significant 
differences in measures of intelligence in children. 
Mental Energy: Nevertheless, significant achievements require a serious, 
long-term commitment. Synaptic adaptability ensures mental flexibility, 
while traits such as self-confidence, a proactive mindset (Yang et al., 
2020), and goal-driven orientation permit a substantial concentration and 
focus (Shimazaki, 2020) to overcome external and internal barriers. The 
general factor of intelligence, the g factor, was discovered by Spearman 
in 1904. He noticed that intelligence is a complex trait penetrating many 
behavioral and psychological outcomes, including educational attainment, 
occupational status, health, and longevity. Therefore, increasingly, several 
aspects of intelligence are considered. 
Intelligence Quotient (IQ) measures cognitive comprehension and 
problem-solving skills. Emotional Quotient (EQ) represents emotional 
management and self-awareness. Social skills and interaction capabilities 
are quantified by Social Quotient (SQ). Finally, the Adversity Quotient 
(AQ) concerns resilience and overcoming adversity. While IQ measures 
academic abilities, EQ is often a better predictor of life and work success.
Emotional Intelligence and Energy: Analogous to potential energy in physics, 
emotional intelligence requires consistent cultivation (Kong et al., 2019) 
(Figures 6 and 7). While rest can relieve fatigue (MacCann et al., 2019), a 
lack of mental energy impedes accomplishments (Meeusen et al., 2020). 
Motivation, perseverance, and well-being are crucial in determining 
outcomes in various fields, from professional achievements to athletic 
performance (Nicolas et al., 2019).
Thermodynamics and Success: The brain’s thermodynamic investigation 
unveils a reality bereft of shortcuts to success. While we often attribute 
achievement to talent, substantial accomplishments are born from persistent 
and purpose-driven endeavors, mental rigor (Inzlicht et al., 2018), unyielding 
perseverance, and an unwavering commitment to hard work (Figure 6). 
Various practices, such as meditation, meaning, purpose, and acceptance, 

Behavior Regulation  85
can help improve well-being and cope with personal and professional 
challenges (Chang et al., 2019).
Supportive Environments: The intricate energy balance of the human 
psyche underscores the importance of a positive social and educational 
environment (Crawford et al., 2020). Such environments foster growth 
and offer the emotional stability necessary for individuals to remain 
committed to their pursuits over extended periods. Even when progress 
appears incremental, an endothermic process provides emotional balance, 
resilience, and the tenacity needed for sustained, long-term commitment 
(as illustrated in Figure 6).
Within a dynamic environment, biological systems exist as 
endothermic entities, relying on continuous energy input to facilitate 
growth and adaptation. Since mental evolution thrives on adaptability 
and change, novelty becomes a fundamental prerequisite for intellectual 
development. 
Emotions in Well-being
“There is no path to happiness: happiness is the path.” ― Buddha
Traditionally, intellect was considered the domain of mathematical logic, 
the faculty of reasoning and understanding objectively and abstractly. 
Increasingly, the role of emotions in intelligence is beginning to be 
recognized. Contemporary research also substantiates ancient insights 
that optimism, trust, and confidence are integral to psychological 
well-being. Sages, philosophers, and artists over millennia preceded 
scientists in recognizing the health advantages associated with positive 
emotions.
The Role of Irreversibility: In physical systems, irreversibility drives the 
movement toward a state of high entropy equilibrium, a concept known as 
the arrow of time. The brain’s resting activations’ remarkable irreversibility 
(Kolvoort et al., 2020) optimizes the action repertoire between past and 
future (Déli et al., 2022) (Figure 4). However, its relevance contrasts sharply 
with the arrow of time, which degrades the system’s degrees of freedom. 
Although the irreversibility of the resting state represents a state of mental 
equilibrium, it is an active state with future directionality. It enhances the 
scope of actions toward increased freedom (Zanin et al., 2020), creativity, 
and novelty (Jeffery and Rovelli, 2020).
The accumulation of negative influences taints the mind with 
inflexibility and generates past focus. Long-term stress lowers resting 
entropy and gives rise to reversible activations (Kolvoort et al., 2020). 
These reversible resting activations, which show time symmetry and 

86 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
monotony, are also characterized by pathological conditions as evidenced 
in major depression (Stringer et al., 2019; Wang, 2020). There are no quick 
remedies for diminished mental energy, which often introduces rigidity 
and pessimistic past focus. The mind tied to the past is destined for a 
reduced quality of life (Sizemore et al., 2018).
Applying the principles of thermodynamics to the domain of 
perception elucidates these contrasts, enabling the analysis of emotions 
through the lens of physics.
Positive Psychology 
The contemporary interpretation of karma has paved the way for 
positive psychology, a field dedicated to investigating the advantages 
of optimistic thinking and improving the quality of life. It is defined by 
Martin Seligman  and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi as “the scientific study 
of positive human functioning and flourishing on multiple levels that 
include the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and 
global dimensions of life”. It offers evidence-based interventions to boost 
well-being and enhance life satisfaction by exploring concepts like flow, 
gratitude, resilience, and hope. It provides tools for individuals to lead 
more fulfilling lives and for societies to foster more thriving citizens.
The Minnesota Nun Study delves into the life trajectories of nuns, 
revealing that complexity, fluency, and imagination in youth protect 
against later cognitive impairments like Alzheimer’s (Iacono et al., 2009). 
Positive thought processes, a sense of dignity, and forward-looking 
anticipation foster well-being and healing and can contribute to longevity. 
Traits like faith, love, and courage catalyze enduring enthusiasm, 
generosity, and cooperation. Even in broken relationships or loss, one can 
find transcendence and closure through emotional healing. 
In today’s rapidly evolving society, psychological well-being is 
intricately linked to personal growth and expanding possibilities (Kolvoort 
et al., 2020). While happiness serves as a motivator for striving toward 
a brighter future, the mere act of feigning happiness proves ineffective. 
Deceiving our employers, friends, or partners might be possible, but 
deceiving our own minds remains an impossible challenge. The principles 
of positive psychology extend to communities as well. Physical proximity, 
touch, and embracing signify group unity, cohesion, and mutual trust.
The Hazards of Superficial Joy: Superficial emotions like egocentricity and 
boastfulness can be likened to empty calories that sow seeds of insecurity 
and hollowness. The grand promises of overconfident young talents 
might transform into disillusionment and bitterness, leading to lives bereft 
of meaning. Comparable to a mirage, the allure of luxury and comfort 
distorts our perspectives, continuously altering our expectations. 

Behavior Regulation  87
Emotional dynamics, akin to electromagnetism, highlight the relative 
nature of comparisons; hedonic adaptation erodes the joy stemming from 
superficial accomplishments. Substantial windfalls, such as promotions 
or lottery wins, may offer only fleeting contentment. Sustained well-being 
necessitates facing and overcoming challenges.
Love: Love, an affection that emanates warmth and intimacy, invokes a 
mental slowing down, relaxing and elevating the soul. Beauty acts as the 
spark for both romantic and parental love. In the eyes of a lover, beauty 
becomes the sole focus, creating an intensifying spiral of affection that 
perpetuates itself through attraction and appreciation. The recognition 
of beauty is not limited to humans; animal courtship validates physical 
perfection and cognitive prowess through graceful and harmonious 
movements, often resembling a dance. The process also includes securing 
and creating places for mating and nurturing offspring.
Social well-being is built on personal dignity, engendering trust, 
and social mobility, the subject of the next section. Significant negative 
correlations exist between stress and the components of emotional 
intelligence, such as emotional awareness and expression, emotional 
thinking, and emotional regulation (Jung et al., 2019). High levels of 
anger, a component of stress, were significantly related to poor emotional 
regulation. Perhaps the most notable ancient understanding of the 
long-term health and career consequences of emotional states is the 
Eastern concept of karma. 
Karma
“As she has planted, so does she harvest; such is the field of karma.” 
― Sri Guru Granth Sahib
The philosophy of karma holds a significant connection with the concept 
of rebirth in Indian religions. However, a broader interpretation of karma, 
derived from the Sanskrit term “Karman”, encompasses action, effect, 
or fate. It entails the belief that our present actions somehow shape our 
future outcomes. Acts driven by good intentions and virtuous deeds 
are believed to contribute to future happiness. In contrast, malevolent 
intentions and immoral actions are thought to lead to suffering. The latter 
perspective is shared across various religions and philosophical systems, 
exploring the interplay between reciprocal action outcomes in the 
‘Just-world’ hypothesis.
The Difference from Lenz’s Law: Lenz’s law acts instantaneously to oppose 
changes in the external environment. Instead, karma represents the 
additive nature of our efforts by compounding mental power and its 

88 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
external consequences. Moreover, karma reflects long-term field effects, 
immune to human evaluations of time, as described by Benjamin Bayani. 
Therefore, karma is the consequence of general relativity operating in the 
social sphere. Our daily actions act on the curvature of the social field to 
bring long-term changes in personal fortunes. 
Supportive surroundings bolster self-assurance, while stress hampers 
focus and curtails performance (Nuno-Perez et al., 2021). This intertwined 
relationship leads to karmic consequences. According to karma, the power 
of one’s attitude (the energy emitted) holds greater significance than 
circumstantial factors. Confidence draws in support, whereas harassment 
invites mistreatment.
Bad Karma 
Pessimistic attitudes narrow focus (Izaki and Ogawa, 2023), limiting 
mental freedom (Figure 18). A lack of self-esteem denies the capacity 
to cultivate genuine relationships, fostering selfishness and emotional 
instability. These emotional swings create a self-perpetuating cycle that 
drives one toward unhappiness and accelerates cognitive aging.
The Perils of Deceit: Cheating corrodes the soul, breeding distrust and 
vigilance. Once doubt infiltrates the mind, it permeates every facet of 
judgment, curtails possibilities, and complicates life. Lenz’s law shows 
that a deceitful person projects onto others his own skepticism. A careless 
carpenter anticipates the collapse of houses, and a neglectful tailor or 
shoemaker is critical of the goods others make.
Figure 18. The effects of emotions on mental freedom. Positive emotions and meaning expand 
freedom (top). On the other hand, the higher energy needs of aggravation, anger, and anxiety 
waste time and energy, which decrease the future freedom of action. (Figure is courtesy of 
Deli, 2020a.)

Behavior Regulation  89
Good Karma
A positive attitude and proactive actions cultivate confidence and an 
optimistic perspective, forming the essential components for achieving 
success (as depicted in Figure 19). This positive approach yields a dual 
effect: firstly, it garners the respect of peers, clients, and our social circle; 
secondly, it nurtures self-assurance and contentment. Dependable and 
conscientious individuals foster their personal achievements and inspire 
success in others. The significance of ethical conduct endures even if no 
one notices it. Therefore, they can afford not to respond to provocation 
while courageously confronting injustice when necessary. Even personal 
tragedies, such as the family tragedy, spur positive responses. For example, 
they might advocate for regulatory and social reforms.
Optimism: Optimism, a hopeful outlook on the favorable outcome of 
endeavors, empowers confident individuals. In the face of uncertainties, 
setbacks do not dampen their spirits for long. Armed with resolve, they 
transform ambiguous situations into triumphant narratives (Treadway 
et al., 2012). Consequently, a discerning mind neither endures nor carries 
the burden of maltreatment or injury over the long term. Being unburdened 
by chronic stress contributes to a healthier and longer life span.
Figure 19. The origins of positive karma. Response to a stimulus modifies both the brain 
(mind) and the surroundings. Likewise, learning produces expert knowledge and confidence, 
a compelling combination for success.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
The mantra, “I think I can, I think I can,” echoes in the Little Engine’s 
and countless others’ sentiments (Piper, 1930). Self-efficacy, characterized 
by the belief in one’s ability to execute tasks, is critical to finding solutions. 
Emotional stability facilitates the commitment to self-improvement, 
inspiring the same in others. They are healthier, happier, and wealthier 
and contribute to a well-functioning society (Moffitt et al., 2011). Through 
continuous interaction with the social milieu, confident people maintain a 
youthful, active, and lively existence even in old age.
Understanding karma liberates us from the grasp of vengeance and 
remorse. It frees us from expecting instant results from our efforts.
Social Mobility
“A human must turn information into intelligence or knowledge.” 
— Grace Hopper
Emotional well-being is fundamental for individual flourishing and 
reaching one’s potential. This is also connected to the ability to contribute 
to society. The wide array of human skills, encompassing domains like 
music, language, organizational aptitude, and spatial thinking (stereopsis), 
combined with universal education and democratic institutions, are 
supposed to provide everyone with equal opportunities for achievement.
The adaptability of synaptic connections in response to changing 
circumstances suggests that mental agility could be crucial in intellectual 
prowess and navigating challenges through effective problem-solving. 
The individual notion of intelligence is cognitive flexibility (Birney and 
Beckmann, 2022). Cognitive flexibility enables us to switch between 
concepts or adapt behavior to achieve goals in a novel or changing 
environment. Why does social mobility seem out of reach for those at the 
lowest rungs of the economic ladder?
Interestingly, an individual’s personal approach to education often 
wields more influence than their inherent abilities. Recent studies highlight 
that intellectual deprivation, characterized by a scarcity mentality and a 
sense of neediness, emerges as a primary factor behind untapped potential 
(Kearney and Levine, 2016). A mindset of disadvantage has been linked to 
a 13-point decrease in IQ, akin to the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation. 
The absence of financial security or overreliance on financial concerns or 
social status can stifle creativity (Mani et al., 2013), a topic explored in the 
subsequent section.

Behavior Regulation  91
In conclusion, without a basic sense of security, democracy remains 
illusory. 
Creativity
“Creativity takes courage.” — Henri Matisse
Every passing generation must grapple with technological, cultural, and 
religious shifts. Still, our technologically driven society inspires a fixation 
on advancement. Creativity is steadily becoming an essential asset in 
our multifaceted lives through its role in inventing novel technologies, 
conquering ailments, and unraveling societal dilemmas. Nevertheless, 
research demonstrates that progressive technological environments nurture 
intelligence without necessarily impacting creativity (Makharia et al., 2016).
The epiphanic moments of inventors, artists, and scientists are 
celebrated across the annals of human history. Nevertheless, creativity 
is not the privilege of the few. Children’s boundless imagination is a 
testament to the inherent human capacity for creativity. How can we 
ensure that this abundant gift endures into adulthood? How do we 
cultivate and nurture creativity?
While necessity might be the catalyst for invention, a positive mindset 
is the conduit for giving birth to something new. Innovation, which 
addresses practical problems, may not be a pressing concern for the 
affluent. Conversely, individuals trapped in poverty are often unable to 
rise above their hopelessness. The elixir of success demands a blend of 
stress and an ample measure of ambition mixed with purposeful work. 
A purpose diminishes anxiety, mitigates conflicts, and even modulates 
pain sensitivity (Hooker et al., 2017). Working for a goal expedites 
problem-solving for humans, animals, or even robots. For example, 
programming a task into robotic simulations yields marked improvements 
in problem-solving prowess (Wissner-Gross and Freer, 2013).
Creativity as a Process 
Engaging in empty entertainment is draining. Picasso’s assertion, “When 
I work, I relax,” underscores the delight and contentment inherent in 
creativity, a state often referred to as “flow”.47 Flow embodies a complete 
immersion of the mind, fostering intense concentration and unwavering 
engagement. The actor becomes one with their role, the musician 
harmonizes with their music, and the painter channels their imagination 
into tangible form. Achieving this harmonious resonance of the soul 
47	 Csikszentmihalyi introduced flow, a state of focused abandon, in the seventies 
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1980).

92 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
necessitates assiduous technical groundwork to channel intuition. Thus, 
creativity emerges as an authentic and ego-transcending alignment of the 
soul.
The Chaos of Creativity: Astrophysicist de Grasse Tyson succinctly notes, 
“Rational thoughts never drive people’s creativity as the way emotions 
do.” Analytical thinking demands focused attention, whereas creativity 
requires a dynamic mental landscape to navigate the perplexing, 
challenging, and sometimes overwhelming phase of problem-solving. In 
this chaotic process, the brain’s innate regulation compresses, processes, 
and sieves through conflicting information. While stress amplifies the 
perception of time and can lead to impatience, a receptive and relaxed 
mind can navigate mental turmoil. Creativity defies planning; it arises 
unexpectedly when the focus broadens to encompass a more expansive 
perspective (Izaki and Ogawa, 2023).
Although it takes diligent mental commitment, it does not require 
rigid concentration! Einstein often received creative inspiration while 
chatting with friends or engaging in mundane activities. Mozart did not 
shy away from light-hearted partying with friends. Distraction appears 
to lead to better choices than either conscious thought or an immediate 
decision (Dijksterhuis et al., 2006). 
The Eruption of Creative Insight: Creativity hinges on abstract thinking to 
distill the crux of a problem, discarding extraneous details. As with all 
happy moments, creative ideas materialize succinctly in time and present 
wholesome understanding. 
The eruption of insight signifies a mental expansion that heralds 
the unraveling of a joke’s humor, the resolution of a problem, or the 
formulation of a hypothesis. The mental tension recedes, replaced by a 
surge of confidence and elation. While refining the finer points might 
necessitate days or even years, the burst of creativity offers the blueprint 
for the work’s essence, structure, and resolution. Subsequently, we delve 
into the arts, one of the most renowned conduits of creative expression.
Creativity isn’t merely a pursuit; it becomes a fulfilling way of life, 
enhancing its overall quality.

Behavior Regulation  93
The Role of the Arts
“Art, freedom and creativity will change society faster than politics.” 
— Victor Pinchuk
Oscar Wilde considers the ability to appreciate beauty a hallmark of our 
humanity.48 Evidence of prehistoric creativity can be seen in sculptures 
and cave art that date back tens of thousands of years. The earliest Rock 
Art examples from India, the Middle East, and Germany date back to 
700,000 BCE. Although not tangible, music and storytelling undoubtedly 
were necessary forms of artistic expression. Early shamanic rituals, art, 
and religion shaped ancient beliefs about the workings of nature, the 
human condition, and the afterlife. In turn, these core beliefs provided a 
moral code for human conduct. 
The arts provide a kaleidoscope of human experience, as recognized 
by Aristotle, who understood the power of stories in offering perspective 
and imagination to improve mental functioning. Perfection49 is static, cold, 
and sterile and misses the human element. This is the quality we feel in 
AI’s instantaneous technical ability. Great art conveys positive messages 
about human potential; its internal rhythm is born from nature, the source 
of all beauty. 
While the audience’s interpretation of the artwork may differ from that 
of the artist (we may never know the prehistoric cave painters’ intentions), 
we connect with the art and the artists through the language of emotions. 
The unexpected brings forth the self-transcendent and the spiritual, the 
foreknowledge inspires catharsis, retrospection engenders empathy, and 
anticipation causes curiosity, tension, and enthusiasm. 
The Beauty and the New: Art creates beauty, the symphony of surprising 
yet familiar. Too much novelty turns the work into bizarre, threatening, 
or ugly, but lacking surprise is the recipe for boredom. Nevertheless, 
repeated exposure exhausts art’s originality. As Oscar Wilde said, “The 
moment you think you understand a great work of art, it’s dead for 
you.” Therefore, art, the servant of only emotions, not rules, is a mirror of 
its time.
Surprising elements in art appeal to our sense of novelty, while 
familiarity provides a sense of security and comfort. The balance between 
new and safety arises from the emotional balance of temporal gravity 
(Figure 7). We seek to balance surprise and familiarity in every aspect of 
life, such as food preferences, housing, and clothing choices. If our creative

side is compromised, we become novelty seekers, trying endlessly to 
catch up to others by shopping for the latest fad or consuming the most 
sensational news item. 
Art’s therapeutic and uplifting effects have led to its use in medical 
clinics, hospitals, and public places.
What is Free Will? 
“...free will does not mean one will, but many wills conflicting in one 
man. Freedom cannot be conceived simply.” ― Flannery O’Connor
The information value of a stimulus is determined by its potential 
to surprise. However, our perception and understanding operate 
involuntarily and automatically; we cannot choose to ignore a stop sign, 
for instance. What is often termed “free will” is essentially spontaneous 
behavior. But is free will indeed the central governing force of the brain? 
Scientific findings suggest otherwise. Extensive research indicates a 
surge in electrical activity preceding a decision (Libet, 1985). This surge 
is the readiness potential, signifying the brain’s preparation for voluntary 
actions. Among various choices, the one we make reflects the path with 
the dominant activation. Free will might manifest as the option requiring 
the least action, dictated by the brain’s energy processes, representing a 
stationary action.
In the realm of physics, degrees of freedom pertain to the independent 
parameters of a given state. In the emotional context, this correlates to 
decision-making freedom. We have free will if we are more powerful than 
our problems. Going against the prevailing trend50 restricts focus and 
autonomy (Izaki and Ogawa, 2023). Within a negative mindset, excessive 
details cloud clarity, resulting in bias and judgment. Like an electron 
obeying the forces of its environment, a negative attitude can powerfully 
control thinking and behavior. 
For example, committing a crime or moral transgression is often 
followed by predictable and highly deterministic behaviors that preclude 
the notion of free will. The unhappiness that plagues a corrupted mind 
is akin to substantial momentum, comparable to a ball rolling down 
a steep slope or a car speeding on a highway. Just as altering the car’s 
course necessitates hitting the brakes, achieving mental freedom requires 
a mental deceleration. Yet, this deceleration introduces openness and 
contentment, negating the urge for change (Figure 20). Hence, only a 
positive mindset truly embodies free will. Paradoxically, possessing free 
will might diminish the incentive to exercise it.
50	  Doing the opposite of what human nature, expectation tells you to do.

Behavior Regulation  95
Being practical is essential to effectively engage with the world. There 
is a notable difference between a person who actively exercises their agency 
and one who is controlled by compulsions and external influences. If our 
life is a play, then the world supplies the script. Our attitude consistently 
serves as a convincing cinematic illusion of control. 
Having Free Will but not Being Able to Use It
“We are pushed hither and thither by external causes, tossed about like 
waves on the sea, and driven by contrary winds, and we never know 
where we are going.” ― Spinoza
The phrase “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” in the United 
States Declaration of Independence is a testament to the belief in free will. 
Social governance rests on the assumption of the capacity for voluntary 
thought and action. While the justice system administers penalties for 
crimes, criminal intent, or negligence, the defense of insanity, which 
indicates a lack of awareness of one’s actions, can exempt an individual 
from prosecution. Thus, free will is a profound inquiry with implications 
for justice, democracy, and equality.
Free will is predicated on the ability to make choices and decisions. 
However, agency is not just an inherent trait, but a skill that can be honed 
and enhanced. Like a muscle, it can be strengthened through regular 
Figure 20. The brain frequencies produce our physiology. Narrow focus is deterministic 
(no free will). Broad focus permits greater mental freedom, creativity, and joy.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
exercise or weakened through neglect. There are instances where it might 
be stifled, such as in conditions like obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). 
If our mental frameworks cater to hidden emotional needs, they reinforce 
those biases. 
Our psychological makeup arises from a 1.5 kg (three-pound) mass 
of brain tissue. The intricate network of nerve cells generates individual 
identity and conduct. As observed earlier, automated actions hold sway 
over our lives, guiding everything from brewing morning coffee to 
spontaneous smiles. Routine behaviors like brushing our teeth necessitate 
minimal conscious involvement. Similarly, external stimuli can trigger 
physiological responses and even emotions without conscious awareness 
(Uhrig et al., 2016). Because the mind associates these resultant reactions, 
even those unforeseen or contradictory, with intent,51 we uphold the belief 
in the presence of free will. The rationale behind this belief is that the brain 
is capable of more than its conscious knowledge. 
Our range of motion is dictated by the functionality of our bones and 
muscles, and our accomplishments often align with the social circles we 
engage with, a phenomenon known as the Matthew effect (Rigney, 2010). 
While imagination may soar limitlessly, actions carry weight; societal 
expectations and personal motivations shape our practical autonomy. As 
Schopenhauer stated, “A man can do as he wills, but not will as he wills.”
Internal Organs: Internal bodily processes often evade our conscious 
awareness, yet our brains consistently receive signals from our internal 
organs. The rhythm of our heartbeat can influence neural activity, with 
perception influenced by the heart’s cycle. Similarly, the gut microbiome 
governs cognitive and social functions, mental growth, emotions, and 
overall well-being (Tooley, 2020).
Parasites and Addictions 
The question of free will revolves around the interplay between intention 
and action. Schizophrenic pathology52 challenges the grasp of free will, 
while behavior devoid of internal motivation can resemble that of a zombie. 
The behavior of a zombie is similar to the implantation of electrodes into 
animal brains, which empowers scientists to remotely control movement 
and emotions, analogous to maneuvering a toy car or drone. However, 
external behavior control evolved millions of years prior via parasitic 
lifestyle.

Parasites, reliant on hosts for nourishment, safety, and even 
reproduction, have developed a disconcerting ability for manipulation. 
Toxoplasma gondii, a single-celled organism reproducing within cats, 
illustrates this phenomenon. In mice, the infection eradicates the natural 
fear of cats, facilitating the cat’s chance to capture its prey and fulfill the 
parasite’s life cycle. Addictions spotlight an even more distressing absence 
of conscious presence. While addicts might furnish elaborate justifications 
for their inexcusable conduct, their actions display a callous disregard for 
themselves and their loved ones, leading to the loss of homes, relationships, 
and lives. We will investigate social lasing next, which exemplifies the role 
of the social environment in forming behavior. 
The Anatomy of Relationships 
“If you can’t have empathy and have effective relationships, then 
no matter how smart you are, you are not going to get very far.” 
— Daniel Goleman
Only a tiny fraction of the multitude of meteors that collide with Earth’s 
atmosphere yearly redirects back into space. Like these falling meteorites, 
negative experiences intrude upon our awareness, planting seeds of 
hopelessness and frustration. Yet, we possess the ability to deflect and 
deter the undesirable. When our intentions and aspirations outweigh our 
challenges, we construct a higher trajectory for our ambitions.
Beyond biological needs, such as air and water, emotional intimacy 
and physical touch are vital for survival. Members of our inner 
circle significantly affect our behavior and perspectives, involving 
sentiment contagion. Drawing from a seventy-five-year Harvard study 
(Ghent, 2011), a direct link emerges between our social connections and 
emotional and mental well-being. Trusted bonds grant us the courage 
to reveal our innermost thoughts, fostering vulnerability that positively 
shapes our quality of life and life expectancy. Close relationships, 
surpassing social status, IQ, and even genetics, serve as shields against 
life’s woes and contribute to the postponement of cognitive and physical 
decline.

Transitioning from Argument to Forgiveness 
Both humans and animals can perceive the energy of their counterparts in 
initial encounters. Vulnerability attracts mistreatment, while confidence 
commands respect. However, patience, diplomacy, and goodwill should 
not be misconstrued as deficiencies; underestimating the power of intellect 
is a perilous oversight.
The Value of Debates: A debate is a discussion in which people support 
opposing sides of a question. Analogous to a sword fight or boxing match, 
well-articulated points weaken opponents and invigorate participants 
with adrenaline. A robust debate enlivens the moment and stimulates 
thought long after the discourse concludes. Constructive discussions are 
characterized by respect and cooperation, unlike arguments that aim to 
assert a point without considering opposing views.
The Nature of Arguments: While debate transpires between parties with 
respect for each other, an argument implies an emotion-driven dispute. 
While violence remains an undesirable means of dispute resolution, 
arguments are equally draining. When conversation partners are 
entrenched in their own perspectives, they only acknowledge each other 
when it aligns with their objectives. Analogous to adjusting binoculars’ 
focus, genuine listening requires a conscious effort to comprehend the 
partner’s viewpoint. This type of listening demands mental deceleration. 
This enriching practice conveys respect, enhancing confidence and 
goodwill. It kindles the imagination to illuminate opinions, concepts, and 
intentions.
Addressing Social Anxiety and Facilitating Connection: Social anxiety corrodes 
self-esteem and trust in interpersonal relationships (He, 2022). Much like 
static electricity, human interactions generate friction that accumulates 
over time. This accumulating tension signifies an emotional distance, 
which can be more agonizing than solitude. Faced with the absence of a 
familial passionate embrace, individuals instinctively instigate conflict to 
reestablish the connection. The conflict triggers a spin-up-down pairing.53 
This pairing restores emotional closeness. In longer-term relationships, 
routine confrontations can evolve into established role-playing.
The Power of Forgiveness: How can we enhance our relationships? (1) 
Replacing arguments with debates and criticism with forgiveness 
improves the tone of interactions. Employing more words of praise 
than discouragement guarantees better connections with everyone. (2) 
Defusing irritation before it festers into a conflict is essential to preventing

its accumulation. Forgiveness prevents the accumulation of negative 
attitudes. Adopting a broader perspective fosters compassion that can 
even retroactively alleviate stress, eliminating the urge for vengeance and 
retaliation. This practice deepens relationships, fortifies mental resilience, 
and augments inner strength.
Dignity in Relationships: This respect extends to others when we respect 
ourselves. Trust extends dignity to humans, emotionally attuned animals, 
and nature. This trust liberates individuals by bestowing unwavering 
strength and inspiring admiration. It permits a profound, affectionate, 
and selfless connection to others. 
The Family, from Past to the Future
“Pain travels through families until someone is ready to feel it.” 
― Stephi Wagner
Certain animal species, like penguins and wolves, mate for life and jointly 
care for their offspring. However, the human capacity for intellectual 
prowess gives rise to a family structure that holds intergenerational 
significance far surpassing that of animals. Families play a pivotal role in 
upholding culture, behavioral norms, and societal stability.
In hierarchical societies, families acted as strongholds that shielded 
individuals from natural and social threats such as hooligans, bandits, and 
local rulers. They served as a form of life insurance for the middle class 
and impoverished while also functioning as instruments of power and 
influence for the affluent. Loyalty to the family often precedes individual 
relevance, and conforming to societal expectations superseded personal 
viewpoints. Opportunities were frequently constrained by class, caste, 
and gender, with marriages continually being economic decisions devoid 
of personal considerations. Those who rebelled risked being ostracized 
and disgraced. Even within the British Royal family, King Edward’s 
marriage to an ‘unsuitable’ woman led to his distancing from the 
monarchy. Curiously, even allegations of sexual abuse have not deterred 
Prince Andrew’s participation in family events.
The Modern Family 
From the Stone Age through the Industrial Revolution, scarcities in housing 
and food, conflicts, and mistreatment were integral to life. Only recently, 
the family’s role, function, and broader social structure have undergone 
dramatic transformations. Occupations are no longer merely handed 
down but reflect individual talents and creative potential. The elderly 

100 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
now has access to social safety nets encompassing pensions, healthcare, 
and end-of-life support, surpassing the care typically provided by family 
members. The emancipation of women has catalyzed their increased 
participation in the workforce.
As financial prosperity permits social independence, the size of 
households gets smaller. In fragmented homes, young parents are often 
deprived of the experienced assistance that extended family members 
could provide. Amid their busy lives, parents frequently fail to allocate 
quality time, even a shared meal, to spend with their children. Perhaps 
this unprecedented social fracturing is the reason for a surge in addiction, 
alienation, criminality, and abuse. 
Upbringing and Personal Life: Personal history is inextricably woven with 
upbringing. Beyond physical attributes and family recipes, children 
internalize their parents’ lifestyles and attitudes. Like chromosomes, 
our upbringing remains an indelible component of our character. 
Reconciliation with our past, even amid the most challenging childhoods, 
can propel us toward a positive future. Tara Westover encapsulated this 
sentiment: “When my mother told me she had not been the mother to me 
that she wished she’d been, she became that mother for the first time.”
Challenges in Family Dynamics 
What are the underlying reasons for the failure to raise successful 
children? One of the gravest forms of parenting failure involves 
abdicating all responsibility. Allowing children to spend time in solitude, 
glued to screens, denies them crucial emotional security and affection. 
The second form of parental failure is creating a tyrannical environment. 
When children grow up in an atmosphere of fear and mistrust toward 
their parents, that fear can gradually morph into defiance, aggression, and 
impulsiveness.
The song “A Spoonful of Sugar” from Mary Poppins harbors a vital 
parenting truth. Just as we must water the seeds we wish to nurture, we 
magnify things by granting attention. Praising good and disciplining bad 
behavior multiplies both equally. Thus, encouragement should precede 
discipline. Children need consistent, meaningful, positive engagement to 
fuel their ambition, creativity, and spirit. Families serving as safe nurturing 
and love havens inspire a more dignified society.
Karma: The earlier discussion on karma focused on the individual. 
Limitations and micromanagement radicalize children, creating either 
revolutionaries or weakened personalities. Emotional indifference 
can produce horrific actions, such as murder and terrorism. Therefore, 
karma has intergenerational importance, as parents grant the size of their 

Behavior Regulation  101
children’s dreams. Thus, a person’s sphere of influence spreads between 
a trusted floor (trust in our social environment) and a limiting ceiling 
(the possibilities provided by our social situation). The secure floor is a 
trust emanating from peace with our parents, families, and the world. The 
trust we carry becomes ever more important after losing loved ones. A 
child with a solid floor can break through any ceiling. 
Karma’s Wider Influence: In the preceding discussion on karma, the focus 
rested on the individual. Limitations and excessive control over children’s 
lives can radicalize personalities, spawning either revolutionaries or 
weakened individuals. Emotional detachment may give rise to abhorrent 
actions such as murder and terrorism. Hence, karma extends its reach 
across generations as parents influence the extent and nature of their 
children’s aspirations. 
An individual’s sphere of impact grows from the solid foundation of 
trust in their social environment. A secure foundation stems from peace 
with one’s parents, family, and the world. The beliefs we carry assume 
increasing significance after the loss of loved ones. 
The Role of Sleep in Learning 
“Sleep is the best meditation.” — Dalai Lama
The brain’s homeostatic regulation is crucial for learning, attention, 
motivation, and memory. Sleep supports our physical well-being by 
facilitating healing and waste clearance. Also, it plays an indispensable 
role in memory consolidation and learning. Sleep disturbances can have 
far-reaching consequences, including depression, weight gain, memory 
issues, premature aging, and even mortality, despite a lack of visible 
pathological signs.
The Connection Between Homeostasis and Learning: In the sleeping brain, 
recently activated synaptic connections play a pivotal role. Replaying 
a diverse range of experiences optimizes the collaborative dynamics 
of neurons, bolstering memory and learning. Consequently, sleep 
contributes to both the strengthening and erasure of emotional memories 
(Yuksel et al., 2023). Emotional memories that remain dormant are 
susceptible to decay during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phase.
However, sleep is not a uniform process; it transpires in distinct 
cycles. Slow wave sleep (SWS) represents the most restorative phase, 
characterized by synchronized, slow brainwave activity. Another phase 
of sleep in REM is when dreaming occurs. During REM sleep, the eyes 
move beneath closed eyelids, and brain activations mirror wakefulness. 

102 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
The duration of REM sleep increases throughout the night, constituting 
approximately 25% of the total sleep duration.
Extraordinary learning capabilities are among the numerous cognitive 
attributes that set us apart from other members of the animal kingdom. 
Before birth, generated neural circuits serve as blueprints that anchor 
experiences after delivery. Babies born with intricate neural mappings 
have an advantageous head start in life. Sleep further triggers unique 
patterns of neuronal firing, which can serve as templates for future events. 
Thus, today’s mental state shapes tomorrow’s psychological disposition. 
This connection between current attitudes and future outcomes gives rise 
to the intricate challenge of aging.
Aging 
“There are six myths about old age: 1. That it’s a disease, a disaster. 
2. That we are mindless. 3. That we are sexless. 4. That we are useless. 
5. That we are powerless. 6. That we are all alike.” — Maggie Kuhn
Children are born with the ability for joy, anger, sadness, and fear. They 
observe the world around them, making predictions about future events. 
Their mental agility enables rapid learning and effective adaptation to 
significant technological and environmental shifts. Emotional intensity, 
like boundless joy and profound sorrow, turns the personal lives of 
teenagers54 vibrant. Emotional electromagnetism—which can flip in an 
instant between adoration, despise, passion, and hopelessness—slows the 
sense of time. Emotional electromagnetism also boosts competitiveness, 
particularly in boys. Although girls may exhibit less overt competitiveness, 
emotional gravity imparts a more mature stability. However, it’s important 
to note that individual variations between sexes can be substantial.
Mental Aging: Aging influences our physical bodies, minds, and emotions. 
With time, individuals rely more on temporal gravity, which tempers the 
tumultuous emotional fluctuations of youth. Existing attachments and 
social connections deepen with age, but new ones remain more superficial. 
While physical discomfort is a source of significant distress for children, 
the graying of emotions over the years diminishes sensitivity to aches and 
pains. This emotional attenuation can also hinder learning efficiency and 
contribute to a sensation of time accelerating.
Our domestic environment shapes our expectations, influencing 
our social aspirations. People’s societal position correlates with their 
confidence, trust, and aspirations. Educational attainment and work

experience act as catalysts for social and professional progression. In 
middle age, attachments can instigate insecurity, eroding trust, social 
standing, and influence. This insecurity renders older adults more 
susceptible to manipulation and deceit.
Dreams are the province of the young, goals characterize the 
confidence, and memories grace the life of the elderly. As individuals 
traverse the stages of life, their aspirations evolve, aligning with their age 
and experience.
In this chapter, we characterized the operational regularities of 
consciousness, the temporal fermion. The mental particle is identical 
to other emotional animals, such as birds and mammals. However, our 
technological achievements put us on a completely different playing field. 
A forty-hour (and soon thirty-two-hour) work week can provide food, 
education, housing, and transportation resources, with many hours left 
for entertainment, social life, and hobbies. Nevertheless, our inability to 
deal with our emotional demons leads us to addictions that represent 
temporary modified consciousness or unconsciousness, not real solutions. 
Regardless, these addictions only make the problem worse over the long 
term. Instead of benefiting us, our generous access to free time becomes a 
handicap and a curse.
The next chapter details the consequences of these problems with 
negative emotions. In contrast, the subsequent chapter offers solutions for 
mental transformation. 
These tools are not impossible or even difficult. In fact, many today 
already live with purpose and meaning. The lucky few have sharpened 
their motivation for achievement during their childhood. Nevertheless, 
this book gives more; it shows that forming responsibility for the common 
good must be the foundation of society to save our planet. Instead of 
looking for a home elsewhere, our job is to produce a common future here 
at home. 
For example, a significant outside threat can be the natural trigger for 
forming a community based on freedom and equality. 

Chapter 6
Compromised Performance
“Any person capable of angering you becomes your master.”
— Epictetus
The previous chapter talked about emotions’ role in normal human 
physiology, and this chapter focuses on how corrupted emotional 
regulation leads to personal, relationship, and social problems. 
As established in the preceding chapter, the human mind constitutes 
the smallest unit of intellect. Our innate thirst for learning, creativity, and 
mental advancement forms the core distinction between us and animals. 
The intellectual need for progress makes mental stagnation dangerous 
for our psychology. The mind equates stagnation to regression, which 
can lead to desperation, addictions, depression, and other psychological 
compromises.55 Stress serves as the initial step toward mental degradation.
The middle class can increasingly afford various cosmetic 
enhancements in the modern era. The obsession with youth inspires diets, 
drugs, and exercise, but one crucial factor overlooked is emotion. Our 
emotional well-being can leave lasting marks on our faces, as suffering 
can be as damaging as heavy sun exposure or alcohol consumption. The 
following pages delve into the long-term risks associated with negative 
emotions and toxic relationships.  
In the Bible, the story of Adam and Eve presents a narrative starting 
out in a state of perfect abundance. However, the couple’s restlessness 
led them into rebellion, losing their privileged position. In everyday 
life, conflict, which often arises from a sense of lack rather than plenty, 
corrodes people’s opportunities even further. Paradoxically, adopting the 
wrong perspective can lead to frequent clashes with reality, reinforcing 
the negative mindset that triggered these conflicts in the first place.

Publishing, 2013.

Corrupted Decision-making
Peter Kropotkin’s study of animal behavior revealed cooperation and 
generosity during times of abundance, contrasted with stress and 
conflict amid scarcity of resources (Connelly et al., 2017; Kropotkin, 
1902). Intellect, generosity, and cooperation require secure and dignified 
societal structures (Tkadlec et al., 2020), while poverty induces cognitive 
stress, fostering insecurity and hopelessness. Furthermore, diminished 
psychological freedom leads to deterministic outcomes, denying free will 
(Gao et al., 2022). 
The thermodynamic understanding of perception shows that 
managing emotions is like operating a car engine. The intricate integration 
of emotions within the brain’s energy framework means that conflicts 
trigger physiological arousal (Saunders et al., 2017). Unlike occasional 
struggle, an inherent aspect of the human experience, chronic stress 
disrupts the reward and motivation system (Padamsey et al., 2022). 
Like using the wrong gear in the car, confused goals, perceptions, and 
focus cause purposeless activities (Schoeller et al., 2018). Low self-esteem, 
anxiety, and depression are mental quick-sand that invariably collapse 
ambitions (Meeusen et al., 2020). 
Dopamine is responsible for cognitive flexibility. Suppression 
of dopaminergic activity blocks the path toward flexibility regions 
(Hua et al., 2020), which activates the “indirect” stress response instead 
(Baik, 2020). This response intensifies self-focus (Berkman, 2018) and 
restricts the degrees of freedom, as depicted in Table I. In turn, a lack 
of liberty imposes a cognitive burden. In addition, individuals with 
anxiety exhibit increased connectivity in specific resting-state networks 
(Gehrt et al., 2022) and regions crucial for social processing, resulting in 
diminished interpersonal warmth and emotional reactivity (Fredericks 
et al., 2018). 
Impaired emotional regulation correlates with subpar social behavior, 
IQ (Goldsmith et al., 2020), and depression (Wade-Bohleber et al., 2020). 
In cases of depression, low entropy insecurity aligns with cognitive 
vulnerability (Wang, 2020), with disease severity directly proportional to 
entropy reduction. This low entropy manifests as rigidity (Stringer et al., 
2019) and a focus on the past (Zanin et al., 2020).
Overcoming Stress
“If the problem can be solved why worry? If the problem cannot be solved 
worrying will do you no good.” ― Shantideva
In the latter part of the twentieth century, improved living conditions 
afforded the masses more leisure time to engage in social activities, sports, 

106 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
and entertainment. Whether rich or poor, young or old, busyness became 
a badge of honor, a validation of social significance. However, when 
schedules are fully packed, unexpected events can swiftly push life out 
of control.
What is Stress? 
Stress is an information flow that invariably accumulates in the resting 
connection map. We can consider how physical systems respond to energy 
input to better understand stress. For example, radiation can act as a 
pump, triggering oscillations, fluorescence, or promoting synchronization 
(Gentili and Micheau, 2020). Pulsations by flickering light, intricate 
patterns, and repetitive noises can trigger specific stress responses in 
people, even if we remain unaware of them. In some people, they can 
trigger epileptic seizures (Fisher et al., 2022),
Similar to mechanical stimuli, repetitive information can provoke 
anxiety. Although our subjective tolerance to stress varies, information 
overload triggers the sense that time is slipping away, causing impatience 
and impulsiveness. Thus, stress functions like a pump, fueling emotional 
swings, fluorescence, or synchronization. For example, passive aggression, 
analogous to fluorescence, occurs in close relationships. Additionally, 
stress can synchronize behavior within a group, contributing to mob 
behavior or social lasing. These varying effects of stress will be explored in 
detail in subsequent sections. Therefore, stress is an information radiation, 
and its predictable results are within the realm of fermionic response, 
underlying the mind’s particle nature. 
Varied Effects 
Stress mobilizes protective mechanisms against danger. Adrenaline and 
cortisol boost our ability to respond to challenges by increasing heart rate, 
respiration, and blood pressure. Nevertheless, these defensive hormonal 
changes can adversely affect the immune system, memory, and cognitive 
processes. Sleep disturbances, weight fluctuations, and digestion issues 
can undermine motivation and hinder performance. Stress wide-ranging 
health consequences make it a significant concern in both professional 
and public health contexts.
Analogous to a small window frame, stress narrows our ability to 
perceive a broader perspective. Nevertheless, the same stressor can impact 
individuals differently. Its subjective nature underscores its connection 
to self-confidence and social support. Although stress transcends social 
boundaries, it is perilous in competitive environments like sports and 
high-pressure jobs. Shame serves as a poignant example.

Compromised Performance  107
The Power of Shame 
Social support is crucial in nurturing self-esteem, providing a foundational 
sense of security that fosters accountability. In such a secure position, 
withdrawal of social validation can lead to intense feelings of shame. 
Higher social rank potentiates shame’s falling or shrinking sensation, 
potentially propelling self-directed or outward aggression (Vries, 2017). 
Self-loathing triggers self-deprecation, compulsive behaviors, and even 
addictions to escape these emotions. Fixating on others’ opinions can breed 
feelings of inferiority, envy, jealousy, falsehoods, and criminal behavior.
Outsiders, including the homeless, tourists, and immigrants, lack 
social support. For them, it is easy to disregard social norms, which 
renders them somewhat immune to shame’s effects. 
Managing Chronic Stress: We are the first generation to analyze scientifically 
how our feelings influence our well-being. Rather than eradicating stress, 
we must learn to manage it by confronting challenges rather than being 
intimidated. Each successful response expands our mental horizons, 
revealing opportunities for growth and development. The subsequent 
section delves into negative emotions and their management.
Negative Emotions
“Again and again I have said to myself, on lying down at night, after a 
day embittered by some vexatious matter, ‘I will not think of it anymore! 
. . . It can do no good whatever to go through it again. I will think of 
something else!’ And in another ten minutes I have found myself, once 
more, in the very thick of the miserable business, and torturing myself, to 
no purpose, with all the old troubles.” ― Lewis Carroll (1893)
Throughout the annals of human history, a grim narrative prevailed. 
Staggering levels of violence and subjugation characterized labor and life 
conditions. Even in eras marked by peace, the yoke of power inequalities 
has weighed heavily on society. Now, at a time when technological 
and social advancements offer unprecedented opportunities for human 
growth, we find that the emotional legacies of our fraught history continue 
to compromise our collective aspirations.
When confronted with physical threats, our bodily protective 
instincts seek security in separation. This opposition is analogous to the 
opposite spin configuration of the Pauli exclusion principle in quantum 
mechanics (Figure 10). Muscles tense to protect vital organs, and the 
“fight or flight” response activates, ready to flee from danger. While this 

108 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
evolutionary adaptation ensures immediate survival, it is detrimental 
in the long run. This primitive, self-centered focus narrows our mental 
bandwidth, diminishing our free will and decision-making capacities. 
The insecurity fuels impulsive and contradictory behaviors, echoing the 
quixotic endeavor of moving the world without a fulcrum. As research by 
Nuno-Perez et al. (2021) indicates, the residual effects of these negative 
emotions distort our intuition and judgment, pushing us into a cycle of 
pessimism. 
The Pitfalls of Insecurity: Stress, consequently, causes insecurity, acting as 
a damper that compromises performance or entirely prevents action. In 
the first case, it prompts individuals to undertake challenging projects 
as a means of validation. However, insufficient planning and effort 
management usually culminates in depleted focus, especially during 
critical junctures like essential examinations or vital presentations, 
exacerbating self-doubt. 
On the other end of the spectrum are those so paralyzed by insecurity 
that they can’t even commence a project, resorting instead to procrastination 
and excuses. The psychological burden of these conflicts further isolates 
people, depriving them of meaningful emotional connections and 
reinforcing their pessimistic outlook. When the mind’s temporal compass 
is thus skewed, it becomes directionless, unable to orient toward progress.
Health Consequences 
“You are already a star; you have nothing to prove—the need to 
project confidence burns out your core. Over time, pride, anger, and 
self-assertion exhaust your energies, and you collapse into your
shadow-self.” — Eva Deli
Pride, anger, and self-assertion are draining for one’s emotional reserves, 
degrading resilience. While negative emotions are crucial in self-
preservation, their prolonged presence drains our energy and undermines 
free will. Aggression accelerates cognitive decline and leads to apathy and 
other adverse health complications. Negative emotions are for the benefit 
of the moment, but dwelling on them is detrimental.
Newton’s First Law of Motion explains the psychological inertia 
carried by human habits: a body at rest tends to stay at rest, and a body 
in motion tends to stay in motion. Habits, thus, can propel us toward 
a brighter future or ensnare us in a cycle of detrimental behaviors like 
addiction and inactivity. Ironically, these damaging habits often originate 
from the issues—such as low self-esteem—that they exacerbate. Because 
emotions arise involuntarily, altering these negatively ingrained patterns

demands a nuanced understanding, almost like decoding a complex 
geometric theorem like the Pythagorean principle.
The Versatility of the Pythagorean Theorem: From 
Geometry to Human Psychology
“Be willing to have it so. Acceptance of what has happened is the 
first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.” 
— William James
The Pythagorean theorem56 is a cornerstone concept in mathematics 
(Figure 21). Originating independently in cultures as diverse as 
Mesopotamia, China, and India, it has been a staple of human intellectual 
heritage for millennia. This theorem posits a relationship between the 
squares of the sides of a right triangle and its hypotenuse. Intriguingly, 
when the hypotenuse remains fixed, the lengths of the other two sides 
display an extraordinary interplay: as one approaches zero, the other 
surges toward infinity.
The generality of orthogonal relationships gives Pythagoras’ theorem 
broad utility. It can predict architectural measurements, engineering stress 
analysis, and quantum uncertainties. With appropriate considerations, we 
can extend its relevance to psychology.
56	 The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the summed 
squares of the two sides.
Figure 21. Orthogonal relationship of the right triangle. The three right triangles (1,2,3) 
have the same hypotenuses. The two sides (a, b) of triangle 2 are similar in length. As the 
sides’ discrepancy  increases, the differences in their squares grow exponentially (1 and 3).

110 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Pythagoras and the Mind 
Earlier, we discussed the orthogonality between the spatial sensory input 
and the temporal nature of cognition. We also applied this perpendicular 
quality between wave functions and fields to the psychology of attention. 
Motivational forces, represented as vectors, can be directed toward the 
past or the future. Past motivation is a futile exercise that CANNOT bring 
results. Consequently, attention is our most valuable asset, best directed 
toward what uplifts and fulfills us. 
Even in social contexts, past focus is detrimental to companies and 
nations. It presents solutions with limited degrees of freedom, excluding 
forward vision. Russia’s dream of restoring lost territories is supposed to 
hide the regime’s increasingly dictatorial leadership style. 
Physical challenges that exceed our capacity risk injury, while too 
simple tasks lead to boredom. The sweet spot lies in aligning tasks with 
our abilities, thus generating a state of flow tailored to our unique skills 
and mental readiness.
The Power of Acceptance 
Personal growth thrives in an encouraging atmosphere, whereas a 
stifling environment smothers ambition. However, changing the focus of 
our attention can powerfully influence our beliefs; thus, acceptance can 
potentially convert negative experiences into opportunities for growth.
As governed by the Pauli principle, personal space depends on one’s 
mindset. Anxious people zealously guard their space, reacting strongly to 
perceived encroachments and attempting to create substantial emotional 
distance from others. 
The Transformative Power of Surrender: While self-defense is a natural human 
reaction, insurmountable difficulties often lead to capitulation (Figure 22). 
Surrender is the realization of the hopelessness of struggle. When we relax 
our guards, the mind accepts the situation rather than fights it. Because the 
thermodynamics cycle of cognition is reversible, yielding to the stronger 
forces reverses the cycle direction. Therefore, surrender represents fresh 
perspectives and deeper understanding originating in organic solutions. 
Success comes from converting hardships into experiences that 
contribute to mental evolution. Acceptance, by tearing down barriers, 
fosters societal unity and advances communal wisdom. We delve deeper 
into the nuances of social support in the final chapter, including actionable 
recommendations for implementation.

The Multifaceted Role of Pain: From Biological Signals to 
Emotional Scars
“Pain changes people, it makes them trust less, overthink more, and shut 
people out.” — Unknown
Pain, a typical symptom in many medical conditions, has a varied and vital 
function. At its simplest, it acts as an alarm system indicating potential 
harm and prompting us to take evasive action. While acute pain can be 
immobilizing, milder forms often spur us into exploratory behavior as we 
search for alternative ways of movement that avoid aggravating an injury.
Treatment for Chronic Pain: More Than Just Relief
Pain is an effective survival tool but depletes emotional and physical 
energy when it becomes chronic. One of the most draining aspects of 
enduring pain is the psychological weight of its seeming permanence. 
Hence, the reassuring words “the pain will soon go away”, which lifts the 
burden of infinity, can bring immediate emotional relief. The belief that 
emotional suffering is also transitory is an equally liberating thought. 
Therapeutic Approaches: Pain management drugs, while effective, often 
come with significant side effects and risks of dependency. Hospitals 
increasingly 
turn 
to 
alternative 
therapies—yoga, 
psychological 
interventions, hypnosis, and cognitive-behavioral therapy—for relief. 

112 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Methods like music therapy, art activities, or simply looking at photos 
of loved ones can enhance pain tolerance. Awareness of pain’s physical 
qualities can also diminish its subjective intensity.
The Ripple Effects of Suffering: Suffering extends beyond immediate pain, 
incorporating the memory, anticipation, and dread of it. Therefore, 
suffering multiplies the pain, resulting in a numbing effect, which 
can spiral into apathy and even lead to conditions like depression and 
addiction. Sharing our struggles can offer therapeutic value. Experiencing 
empathy, whether by understanding others’ pain or through cultural 
means like literature and film, enriches our emotional repertoire; “feeling 
the pain of others” helps us to become better people. 
The promise of treatment is already a powerful physiological remedy. 
Existential Pain and Emotional Scars: Pain also includes emotional and 
psychological trauma, which can be as indelibly imprinted in our minds 
as a photograph. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can 
trap individuals in a temporal loop of reliving traumatic events. Like 
arresting movement to avoid bodily pain, the brain resorts to emotional 
avoidance to escape psychological trauma. However, attempts to suppress 
such thoughts often have a counterproductive effect; Lenz’s law explains 
how thought suppression leaves the emotional pain ever more in focus. 
The biblical Eve, Orpheus and Eurydice,57 and many other literary 
examples depict the destructive outcomes of repressed emotions. Studies 
indicate that emotional suppression amplifies pain and anxiety and can 
trigger depression (Wenzlaff and Wegner, 2000; Ghandehari et al., 2020). 
Crafting an honest and meaningful life story can negate the need for 
thought suppression, leading to a healthier emotional state.
Understanding pain in its multifaceted forms—physical, emotional, 
and existential—enables us to approach it holistically. This understanding 
can inform treatment options and provide insight into our shared human 
experience.
The Role of Belief in Pharmacological Response
Our understanding of the brain has traditionally been rooted in 
neurochemistry and structural biology, emphasizing the roles of 
neurotransmitters, synapses, and neuronal pathways in modulating 
behavior, cognition, and emotion. Pharmacological drugs lead the way

to understanding how external substances can alter brain function. 
Yet, emerging research suggests that nonpharmacological constructs, 
particularly beliefs, might also profoundly influence brain activity, 
perhaps even in a dose-dependent manner akin to drugs.
Initial evidence comes from addiction science. Studies have shown 
that drug abusers display differential brain activity based on their 
anticipation of drug enjoyment. For instance, if they expect a drug, their 
perception of its pleasure is heightened (Kirk et al., 1998; Volkow et al., 
2003). The psychological construct of ‘expectation’ significantly modulates 
their neural responses, potentially priming their brains for a more potent 
reaction to the drug. Similarly, in pain management, the very belief in 
a medication can shape its efficacy. Views about pain medications can 
cause pain catastrophizing, exaggerating pain experiences (Elphinston 
et al., 2021).
Moreover, beliefs also seem to play a crucial role in our immune 
responses. A startling revelation is that non-pharmacological variables, 
specifically beliefs about vaccines, predicted nearly a third of vaccine side 
effect severity (Mattarozzi et al., 2023). Emerging research indicates that 
beliefs influence brain activity in the same systematic, dose-dependent 
manner as drugs (Perl et al., 2023).
For instance, nicotine increases activity in the thalamus (a nicotine-
binding site) depending on belief intensity (Perl et al., 2023), similar to the 
dose-response curves seen with many drugs. Furthermore, robust beliefs 
about nicotine increase the functional connection between the thalamus 
and the prefrontal cortex. This region evaluates rewards and risks.
Such findings hint at a revolutionary perspective: Beliefs can impact 
neural circuits in ways previously reserved for drugs. This challenges the 
traditional separation between ‘chemical’ and ‘psychological’ influences 
on the brain, suggesting a more intertwined relationship.
Therefore, beliefs, long thought to be abstract constructs, have tangible, 
measurable effects on the brain, potentially reshaping our understanding 
of addiction, pain management, and even immunology. This underscores 
the importance of a holistic approach to medicine and recognizing the 
influence of placebo. 
The Power of the Placebo
“I would rather know the person who has the disease than the disease the 
person has.” ― Hippocrates
Modern Medical Advances and Their Limits: The advent of surgeries, 
pharmaceuticals, and vaccines has revolutionized our approach to illness, 
offering effective treatments for many conditions. However, the mental 
aftermath of disease—symptoms like depression, anxiety, and fatigue—

114 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
poses a more complex challenge for healthcare professionals. Clinicians 
often observe a distinction between patients; those who actively engage in 
their recovery process often get well, and those who remain ignorant or 
fake confidence often succumb to their conditions. 
The Mind-Body Connection Unpacks the Psychological Dimensions of Illness 
and Healing: The placebo effect exemplifies how individual differences 
contribute to healing without directly altering the disease. Genetics, 
psychological states, brain chemistry, attitudes, and social context influence 
recovery. The environment in which medication is administered, societal 
expectations, and a patient’s belief in the efficacy of the treatment also play 
significant roles. Transparency and genuineness, both in interpersonal 
interactions and medical settings, positively affect the experience of 
illness. Approaching their disease and treatment options with an open 
mindset reduces patients’ pain levels and boosts placebo impact.
The Nocebo Effect: The Dark Side of Psychological Influence: The “nocebo 
effect” undermines the effectiveness of medical treatments through 
adverse psychological mechanisms. Conditions like depression, disrupted 
sleep, poor appetite, and significant blood pressure drops can result from 
this effect. Anxiety about undergoing treatment can manifest as physical 
symptoms, including pain, nausea, and gastrointestinal problems. Patients 
who fixate on the potential side effects of medication may inadvertently 
bring about those very symptoms, making their fears a self-fulfilling 
prophecy.
The Intersection of Mind and Body: The placebo and nocebo effects 
underscore the extraordinary interplay between our psychological state 
and physical well-being. These effects reveal that our bodies are not 
just passive recipients of medical treatments; our beliefs, attitudes, and 
emotional states can significantly influence how we respond to illness and 
healing.
Understanding the psychological dimensions of medical treatment 
provides a more holistic view of patient care. It highlights the need for an 
integrated approach that considers the physiological aspects of illness and 
the critical role that mental and emotional states play in recovery.
Emotional Temperature and Pressure: The Phases of Matter 
as a Lens for Understanding Social Dynamics
“Anger comes from pain, and it causes pain.” — Le Guin
Transitions of Social Phases: Solids, liquids, and gases are the familiar phases 
of matter in our everyday life. Phase transitions can transform solids 
into liquids and liquids into gases in a process that can also take place in

reverse order. Social formations can also undergo similar phase changes. 
These shifts can be gradual or abrupt, much like how physical properties 
can suddenly alter during a phase transition. For example, the sudden 
societal shift closely aligns with the concept of mob behavior, which we 
will explore further in the next section.
Social Solids: Stability Through Strong Attachments: Strong, stable 
relationships form the building blocks of “social solids”, characterized by 
emotional depth and durable bonds that can be insulators or conductors. 
However, increasing social or emotional ‘temperature’ can introduce 
more fluidity into these solid structures.
Democratic Societies Represent Social Fluids: In the liquid phase, particles 
occupy a defined volume but move freely, offering greater flexibility. 
Similarly, democratic societies behave like fluids, where flexible 
interactions enable the diffusion of attitudes across communities.58 
According to recent studies, fluid dynamics models can accurately 
describe opinion dynamics (Yang et al., 2020). In this analogy, the capacity 
to influence people corresponds to the liquid’s height. At the same time, 
collective mood or sentiment equates to temperature. 
The Universal Gas Law 
At a sufficiently high temperature, heated liquids can transform into gases, 
allowing particles to bounce freely in three dimensions, endowing them 
with high degrees of freedom. Likewise, in a social context, mistreatment 
can reach a critical point when people assume volatile and confrontational 
behavior (Figure 23). The Universal Gas Law,59 which describes the 
behavior of gases in terms of volume, pressure, and temperature, can 
provide insights into this societal dynamics. Although emigration can 
ease social pressure, societies with well-defined social temperatures have 
limited expansion possibilities. In such fixed societal ‘volumes’, emotional 
or psychological tensions boost social ‘temperature’, causing conflict or 
unrest. What can the universal gas law tell us about human psychology?
Emotional Equilibrium and Homeostasis: This pressure is often a stable trait 
that can loosely indicate one’s social class. For example, growing up in 
stressful settings can lead to impulsive behavior or paranoia. When 
conflicts are the exclusive notable events in a child’s life, peaceful settings 
feel uninspiring. Engaging in conflict becomes a self-reinforcing cycle that 
contributes to an individual’s sense of excitement or purpose. 
58	 Totalitarian governments create an atmosphere of fear, effectively freezing the social 
behavior.
59	 Universal gas law describes the relationship between an ideal gas’ volume and pressure at 
a specific temperature.

116 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Subjective Well-being Homeostasis60 shows that we form a stable 
psychology around a set homeostatic equilibrium (Diener et al., 1999). As 
a result, we may start activities with no other use than to generate conflict 
and tension. Confrontation triggers stress and resolution, which satisfies 
the need for a stimulating environment. Understanding our social comfort 
zones is critical to navigating the complexities of human behavior and 
relationships.
Consequences of the Gas Law for Society: Just as varying pressures and 
temperatures can produce unique states in physical systems, fluctuations 
in emotional ‘temperature’ and ‘pressure’ can lead to nuanced and complex 
social formations. Transitions between these states can be dramatic and 
emotionally taxing, akin to the energy consequences of phase transitions 
in physical systems. These changes can raise fundamental questions about 
individual self-worth, creating emotional states that are as puzzling and 
unpredictable as non-Newtonian fluids.61 In analogy, sometimes, people 
are unable to produce intelligible responses immediately. Such freezing 
behavior is analogous to a non-Newtonian fluid. 
Our emotions reveal with clarity our range of social comfort. 
The Psychology of Mobs and Social Uprisings
Boiling is the transition of a substance from liquid to gas, increasing the 
particles’ kinetic energy and range of motion. The boiling point is the 
Figure 23. The relationship between particle collisions and pressure. Molecules form low 
pressure and slow particle velocity (left). Increasing the number of particles (or their speed) 
creates compression, increasing temperature (right).

maintained life satisfaction point.

temperature during boiling, which can change with surrounding pressure. 
The endothermic process can provide a surprisingly valid analogy for 
social science protests, rebellions, and revolutions.
Economic pressure and social tension increase the social temperature 
for masses of people. Because compression increases the boiling point in 
a liquid, oppressive regimes use overwhelming force to suppress public 
displays of discontent and protests. However, releasing the pressure 
triggers a sudden and violent explosion into gas. Indeed, historically, 
uprisings often happened during the easing of oppression, such as in 
France in 1789, Russia in 1917, and China in 1949. 
Behavioral Dynamics in Uprisings: During social unrest, individual 
behaviors often amalgamate into a volatile, collective action. French social 
psychologist Gustave Le Bon observed during the 1848 Paris Rebellion 
that the behavior of crowds differed vastly from that of individuals who 
comprised them. Once the social temperature reaches a “boiling point”, 
collective actions can become dangerous and unpredictable, free from 
individual restraint or control. When the energy dissipates, the crowd 
disbands, leaving individuals to grapple with the aftermath, either taking 
pride in their collective actions or feeling shame for losing control.
Behavioral Hysteresis
“The line between good and evil is permeable and almost anyone 
can be induced to cross it when pressured by situational forces.” 
― Philip Zimbardo
Hysteresis is a memory-dependent behavior in elastic materials and 
ferromagnets. This concept is well-studied in materials science and applies 
to psychological states. For example, the particles line up in stretched-out 
flexible materials, warming and compromising elasticity. The material 
must cool down before its elasticity recovers (Figure 24). 
In psychology, hysteresis explains how the perception of a stimulus 
is influenced by immediately preceding perceptions. The perception is 
gradually modified during successive changes until it is perceived as a 
different category.  However, the decreasing stimulus values produce 
another crossover point when the changes occur in reverse order. This 
phenomenon explains why people are slow to get angry but even slower 
to calm down.
Hormonal Regulation and Emotional States
Hysteresis in Society: In terms of emotional responses, small fluctuations in 
hormonal levels like testosterone and cortisol can lead to disproportionate 

118 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
changes in states of aggression or fear, dramatically disrupting the smooth 
transition between the relaxed and angry state (Figure 25). Testosterone 
generally increases aggressive behavior (‘fight’). In contrast, cortisol 
impels fear (‘flight’), even at high testosterone levels (Knight et al., 2019; 
Mehta and Josephs, 2010). Once an emotional state is triggered, it takes 
significant time for an individual to return to a baseline, calm state. 
Economic Hysteresis: Hysteresis also applies to economic scenarios. 
In economies, the trajectory differs when unemployment increases 
or decreases during the economic recovery. Hysteresis explains that 
Figure 24. Hysteresis The accumulating energy forms a memory, which changes the 
response. The system’s altered memory in the reverse process creates a different trajectory.
Figure 25. Emotional hysteresis of a dog. The behavioral surface has a single solution on 
the far left and the far right. The folded region represents memory-dependent performance. 
The dog can switch between angry and fearful (see fight and flight response in Figure 10). 
The lower situated fold (open to the left) represents flight triggered by fear. The top fold 
(on the right) represents a fight powered by dominance in motivation. A catastrophe is a 
sudden jump in behavior. Within the folded surface, even a tiny shift produces substantially 
different outcomes.

Compromised Performance  119
unemployment rates tend to linger even after a recession has technically 
ended. Various factors contribute to this inertia, including investor 
pessimism and a workforce that may have seen its skills degrade or 
become obsolete during prolonged periods of unemployment. 
The Mob as a Form of Hysteresis: In a societal context, mob behavior can also 
be viewed through the principle of hysteresis. Once conflict escalates to a 
certain point in a crowd, bringing it back to equilibrium can be challenging. 
This lag, or hysteresis effect, makes mob behavior unpredictable and 
sometimes dangerous.
Social Ferromagnetism 
The substantial strength of electromagnetism compared to gravity comes 
into play in bipolar materials.62 When arranged in a lattice, each spin 
interacts with its neighbors63 (Figure 26), forming an ordered, magnetized, 
and stable state. Ferromagnetism is bipolar materials’ ability to align 
with an outside magnetic field into a quasi-bar magnet. Although some 
ferromagnets can maintain the magnetism indefinitely, arbitrary particle 
movements usually restore the disordered atomic orientation.
Emotional electromagnetism represents strong bipolar motivation, 
causing our attitudes to alternate between attraction and despise. As a 
result, it can trigger “Social Ferromagnetism,” an alignment of individual 
beliefs and behaviors within social and cultural ‘fields’. The theory suggests 
that people are highly influenced by their social circles, adjusting their 
opinions and actions to align with those of the group. Our social antennas 
turn us into ferromagnets, absorbing our social circles’ intuitions. Subtle 
bodily signals and intonation (prosody) can carry emotional messages 
without the speaker’s intention or awareness. Emotional nuances, often 
unintentional, are communicated between individuals and can affect a 
group’s collective mood or perspective. 
A shared orientation reflects the social-political climate and the 
members’ perspectives. People in agreement intuitively copy each other’s 
body position; social attunement can lead to sentiment contagion, a 
subconscious transfer of political views, happiness, or discontent. This 
theoretical framework can explain riots or mob actions as phase transitions 
in magnetic materials where increased thermal energy disrupts the 
ordered magnetic alignment, leading to a disordered state.
The “Free Will” section also explores the correlation between 
individual attitudes and social belonging.

like a bar magnet.

Filter Bubble 
The “Filter Bubble” concept focuses on how social media and search 
engines can further entrench people’s preexisting beliefs and attitudes. This 
algorithmic personalization restricts exposure to differing viewpoints and 
can enhance collective bias within a group. The information individuals 
receive aligns with their preexisting beliefs, thereby radicalizing the 
members’ collective bias and creating filter bubbles.64
Emotion-driven information can trigger transitory swings in 
opinions, inspire protests, shift election results, or inspire social change 
(Khrennikov, 2020), as shown in social lasing. The following section 
discusses the emotional ping pong, called “Emotional Fluorescence”, also 
known as passive aggression. 
Emotional Fluorescence
“Don’t hold on to anger, hurt or pain. They steal your energy and keep 
you from love.” — Leo Buscaglia
We often consider the atomic structure a mini solar system due to the 
electron’s quantized angular momentum (Figure 27). Although the 
electron cloud is highly dynamic, individual particles can only occupy a 
discrete energy orbital, which makes them vulnerable to incoming photons. 
Figure 26. The Ising model. The Ising model represents magnetic dipole moments (spins) 
in one of two states (+1 or −1). The spins are arranged in a lattice (where the local structure 
repeats periodically in all directions), allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors.

contradictory information.

High-energy photons can kick the electron out of the atom. Still, typically, 
they push them into an elevated, unstable energy orbital. Eventually, the 
particle returns to its original position and emits the borrowed energy. 
In exceptional cases, the process is a spectacular visible radiation called 
fluorescence.65 
Like the atomic world, society is highly structured, where individuals 
form stable attachments to relatives, friends, and even organizations. In 
turn, these attachments represent distinct energy levels, which give rise 
to our social hierarchies akin to the discrete energy levels of an atom. 
Nevertheless, people are continuously exposed to social energy. When 
information radiation affects people with strong social attachments, it 
boosts the resting state energy level (Xu et al., 2023), pushing it into a 
more energetic disposition. Emotional distance or detachment dictates 
behaviors like the “silent treatment,” also called passive aggression 
(Gao et al., 2022). 
The absorbed energy reduces mental freedom. Like a caged dog that 
walks up and down to find the exit, the stressed mind produces thoughts 
that move back and forth to find a different outcome. However, the past 
has already happened; thus, a solution cannot be found. Eventually, 
the tension of the borrowed energy snaps, resolving itself through 
deterministic and impulsive behavior (Aberg et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022). 
How does passive aggression originate from the mind particle 
organization? Newton’s third law, which states that every action has an 
Figure 27. Fluorescence in an atom. The concentric ellipses indicate the electrons’ energy 
level; the central circle is the atomic nucleus, and small balls represent the electrons. Collision 
with a photon (gray incoming arrow) pushes the particle into a higher, unstable energy orbit 
(gray). When the absorbed energy radiates out, the electron falls back into its original energy 
state. Visible radiation is called fluorescence. 
65	 Fluorescence is the visible light emitted by electrons after being subjected to radiation of a 
shorter wavelength light.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
equal and opposite reaction, is analogous to how stress operates within 
this context. Unhappiness triggers memories that validate their presence 
and foster a desire for retribution, as illustrated in Figure 27. Emotional 
fluorescence66 is a theatric retaliation executed under the banner of 
perceived ‘justice’. This release of built-up tension frees individuals from 
more severe psychological anguish and depression. The outbursts, which 
can target relatives, friends, or even innocent bystanders, are similar to 
avalanches in a sand pile.67 Therefore, the timing and intensity of these 
emotional releases remain unpredictable, contributing to the increasing 
mistrust and division.
Passive aggression, followed by subsequent reconciliation, can coexist 
within stable partnerships. Analogous to a pendulum’s movement, 
negative emotional energy can oscillate regularly between couples and 
friends, detrimentally impacting interpersonal trust. If such attacks are 
one-sided, they fall under the categories of bullying or abuse, explored in 
the following sections.
Harassment and Bullying 
“People who love themselves, don’t hurt other people. The more we hate 
ourselves, the more we want others to suffer.” ― Dan Pearce
Regardless of societal standing, relationships founded on mutual respect 
foster collaboration and generosity, while those built on power disparities 
lead to competition and mistreatment. When intimidation happens 
outside of a personal relationship is commonly termed bullying. This 
coercive need to control others can manifest through cyberbullying in 
various settings, including schools, workplaces, or online. Discrimination 
based on race, religion, gender, age, disability, or nationality constitutes 
harassment.
Harassment and bullying are the tools of insecure people. These acts 
serve as a quick, albeit temporary, boost to their self-esteem. Bullying often 
stems from preexisting advantages, including physical strength, social 
standing, financial status, race, gender, or religious beliefs. This skewed 
power dynamic results in a preordained outcome that elevates the bully 
at the expense of the vulnerable target. In severe cases, sustained bullying 
can lead to learned helplessness, as the constant sense of powerlessness 
erodes one’s social motivation.
While demeaning others may earn short-term approval from 
like-minded individuals, bullying’s fleeting and shallow victories 
ultimately undermine meaningful social relationships. The cycle of 
66	 Emotional or mental fluorescence is criticism, aggravation or physical violence that 
releases accumulated emotional energy.
67	 In the sand pile model, the addition of each sand grain can trigger an avalanche.

mistreatment often cascades downward through society, becoming 
concentrated in underprivileged communities. Bullying can perpetuate 
in a vicious cycle because bullies often were abuse victims during their 
formative years. However, it’s worth noting that bullies can sometimes 
overreach, becoming the recipients of the same abusive behavior they 
once meted out.
The most effective way to combat bullying and harassment is to 
foster a community culture grounded in trust, respect, and accountability. 
Bullies typically avoid those who exude confidence and emotional 
stability, validating the notion that prevention is more effective than cure. 
Echoing Eleanor Roosevelt, “No one can make you feel inferior without 
your consent.” We play an active role in shaping how others treat us, and 
the signals we send inevitably influence the reactions we receive from our 
social circles.
Abuse 
“My father was ‘a merchant of chaos’, a ‘‘bully’ and a ‘coward’ who beat 
his children.” [My father] was the kind of person where, if something 
goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he’d lull 
you in, make you feel safe and then, bang!” ― Tom Cruise
To the casual observer, bear dancing may seem quaint and harmless. 
However, it conceals a methodic cruelty, starting with the abducting 
of a bear cub from his mother. Trainers subject the cub to extreme pain 
by placing it on scorching hot metal sheets while playing music. The 
desperate cub tries to escape the deadly burns by lifting his paws one 
after another, forming a primal association between music and dancing. 
The indelible link in the animal’s mind between the music and the dance 
reflex is a conditioning that destroys the bear’s ability to live freely. 
Similarly, different forms of exploitation—verbal, physical, sexual, 
and psychological—leave enduring emotional scars on humans. Practices 
like slavery, legally sanctioned as recently as 150 years ago, profoundly 
undermined individual autonomy and the drive for independence. Even 
after the formal end of such practices, the residual effects of segregation 
and colonization linger. Tragically, the darkest facets of human nature 
often manifest in the abuse of family members, including children, 
spouses, and the elderly.
Like bullies, abusers are driven by a need for dominance and control. 
Still, their behavior often originates from underlying fears and insecurities. 
The abuser cultivates emotional closeness with the victim but inflicts 
pain timed to a sensitive or vulnerable moment. This way, the abuse 
shatters trust and inflicts emotional wounds, systematically eroding the 
victim’s spirit. 

124 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Abuse engenders a toxic dependency, akin to the dancing bear’s 
conditioned behavior, progressively destroying the capacity for 
escape. Adult survivors of abuse often find themselves navigating 
relationships that mirror the ones they knew as children, perpetuating a 
multi-generational cycle of mistreatment. Overcoming the lingering 
emotional impact of such abuse can liberate future generations from 
its curse. 
Physical Abuse: Any form of abuse is a short-term tactic with long-lasting 
repercussions, notably stunting emotional and intellectual growth 
(Figure 28). The betrayal of receiving pain from those expected to offer 
support warps human psychology and hinders healthy emotional 
development. A 1993 UN report labeled domestic violence as a public 
health crisis, highlighting that corporal punishment like spanking68 
can foster aggression. In response, many countries have enacted 
legal protections against family violence, including banning corporal 
punishment in schools and homes.
Emotional Abuse: Unlike physical abuse, emotional abuse erodes trust 
and damages the psyche without leaving visible physical signs. The 
inability to establish healthy boundaries makes individuals susceptible 
to maltreatment. Children, wholly dependent on their caregivers, are 
particularly vulnerable to emotional abuse, including belittlement, 
suspicion, and rage. The more harm an abuser inflicts, the greater the 
control he gains over the relationship. Such emotional trauma can result 
in self-esteem issues, leading to emotionally withdrawn or volatile 
personalities (Figure 29). Abuse hardens people, forcing them not to trust 
68	 Spanking is non-injurious, open-handed hitting to modify child behavior.

short term effects, the potency of severe punishment quickly evaporates. Love generates 
meaningful results only after building trust, the most crucial step.

and hide any vulnerabilities. We cannot denigrate a child and expect 
her to believe in herself. These insecure people can become ruthless, 
domineering personalities. The broken victims of these relationships often 
end up ensnared in a cycle of controlling and abusive behavior.
The Cycle of Abuse 
An abusive relationship is a tumultuous journey characterized by 
agonizing lows and deceptive highs that isolate the victim from friends 
and family. While the objective of abuse is complete domination, it often 
begins with alluring promises to establish trust. Abusers are adept at 
discovering their victims’ vulnerabilities by constantly pushing the limits 
of what their partners will tolerate. 
The insecure abuser is suspicious of external contact and hints of 
resistance, which can provoke a confrontational reaction. They carefully 
choose moments when their victims are most defenseless and unobserved 
to mete out the pain but cause humiliation when there are witnesses. 
The depth of emotional wounds caused by this brutal behavior triggers 
the abuser’s remorse, marked by conciliatory gestures and ostensible 
generosity as a form of ‘atonement’ for earlier cruelty.
In the quest for total control, the abuser needs ongoing validation, 
setting up a cyclical pattern of tension and relief, aggression and contrition. 
These oscillations deepen the emotional interdependence between the 
abuser and the victim, forging bonds that make it increasingly difficult for 
either party to exit the relationship.
Figure 29. Possible personality consequences of severe discipline over time. Harsh 
punishments harden strong-willed children into inflexible, rigid personalities, while others 
break under its heavy burden. Learned helplessness is a well-known example.

126 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
This cycle of harm and subsequent reconciliation dominates the lives 
of those involved. Anticipating the next wave of abuse fosters a perpetual 
state of defensiveness in the victim. Over time, the victim becomes highly 
attuned to the abuser’s cues and responds with preemptive submission to 
avert conflict. From an external viewpoint, this manipulative relationship 
can deceptively appear functional.
Abuse acts as a perverse coping mechanism for emotional and mental 
insecurity. Simplistic and biased rationalizations reveal the abuser’s 
incomplete or skewed thinking. Abuse can bind people (or animals) to 
unimaginably abhorrent conditions and result in horrible personality 
changes for both sides of the mistreatment, exemplified by Festinger’s 
theory. 
Gaslighting: Gaslighting is a specialized form of abuse named after the 
1944 film Gaslight, in which a husband crafts an utterly unpredictable 
environment to distort his wife’s perception of reality. This manipulative 
tactic is not limited to intimate relationships; it is employed by narcissists, 
cult leaders, and tyrants to control larger groups or entire nations. 
Philosophers dating to Plato in 375 BC have identified the deeply 
corrupting nature of such manipulative control.
Preparing for Independence 
The intense emotional bonds created in an abusive relationship act as 
shackles, which makes it exceedingly difficult to disentangle oneself from 
the situation. The first step toward achieving independence is envisioning 
a life free from abuse. Meditative practices or prayers can fortify internal 
resilience, integrity, self-confidence, and self-belief. The abuse victim’s 
isolation makes seeking spiritual, organizational, and financial help 
challenging. Often, the victim is all alone on the arduous journey to 
freedom. 
Understanding the Energy Dynamics of Abuse: Like other negative attitudes, 
abuse is an information radiation that targets its victim. As remembered 
from emotional fluorescence, this radiation creates contradiction 
(up-down spin pairing), which fosters emotional separation. While the 
impulse for some form of retaliation may be strong, vengeance only 
projects back the energy, inadvertently strengthening attachment. 
It’s vital to see the inherent fragility in the abuser and to respond with 
compassion and acceptance. This elevated perspective can be increasingly 
challenging because the abuser intuitively responds to understanding by 
accelerating the severity and frequency of attacks. This is where external 
emotional and social support becomes so crucial. Setting a realistic 
deadline for leaving the abusive situation can be immensely empowering.

Healing after Abuse: Exiting an abusive relationship doesn’t necessarily 
sever the emotional ties between the abuser and victim; these can 
linger painfully, potentially for a lifetime. Is true liberation achievable? 
Acknowledging the abuser’s insecurities and weaknesses can disarm 
their power and elevate your spiritual fortitude. In a transformative 
process analogous to a clam creating a pearl from an irritant, the agony 
of being a victim can be transmuted into a source of empowerment 
(Figure 7). Replacing fear and conflict with love and compassion provides 
the emotional strength for forgiveness. Breaking free from the vicious cycle 
of abuse, not just individually but also for the sake of future generations, 
deserves global attention.
Recognizing and acknowledging the existence of abuse is an essential 
first step in the healing process.
When the Belief is Crippled: Learned Helplessness
“People do not lack strength; they lack will.” ― Victor Hugo
Unlike saplings in a forest that can wait years dormant in the undergrowth 
for an opening in the canopy to grow into a tall and robust tree, the 
window of opportunity for physical and emotional development in 
animals is genetically determined. Early nutritional deficiencies stunt the 
growth of the body, but emotional neglect and abuse can similarly stifle 
mental maturation. The psychological phenomenon known as “learned 
helplessness” refers to intentionally undermining achievable tasks or 
the inability to escape adverse conditions (Figure 29). The resigned 
expressions of captive animals offer a poignant glimpse into their state of 
emotional defeat.
The Invisible Walls of Psychological Barriers: Our physical environment and 
societal frameworks often shape our mental outlook, creating invisible 
yet compelling psychological boundaries. These limitations can feel as 
real—if not more so—than tangible barriers made of rock and stone. The 
mere approach to these perceived boundaries can induce intense, hidden 
anxiety, making their transgression appear unattainable. One striking 
example is how a young elephant tethered by chains eventually gives up 
trying to escape, its spirit irrevocably crushed. Similarly, children who 
experience abuse often grow into adults who perpetuate the abuse cycle 
in some form. Though they might hide behind inventive excuses, the 
underlying issue is a deeply ingrained fear of facing challenges. As a result, 
the fear of success can ironically become a more potent deterrent than the 
fear of failure. Victor Hugo aptly said, “People do not lack strength; they 
lack will.”

Shopping Addiction 
“It is preoccupation with possessions, more than anything else, that 
prevents us from living freely and nobly.” ― Bertrand Russell
It’s almost inconceivable to think about life a century ago, a time devoid of 
basic amenities like electricity, running water, and household appliances. 
The quality of life for billions has improved dramatically, thanks to 
increasingly sophisticated technologies. Cell phones serve multiple 
purposes today; cars are more than just status symbols, and homes 
reflect our personal and professional standing. Our reliance on amenities, 
from comfortable beds to nourishing meals, ensures a stable, day-to-day 
existence supported by stores, restaurants, and cafes.
Personal Vulnerability: Aristotle once said, “All men by nature desire to

meaning from it. We are attuned to social changes through social media, 
like never before. Instant comparison with peers via social media and the 
relentless news cycle exacerbate feelings of inadequacy, fueled further 
by targeted advertisements. We judge ourselves based on comparisons. 
Without meaning and purpose we feel lagging behind others. 
To keep up others and the world, it is easy to seek material and 
financial pursuits. Such material acquisitions often leave us emotionally 
unsatisfied, creating a perpetual need for more, potentially spiraling into 
addictive behaviors. Shopping and other addictions serve an immediate, 
although painfully transient, gain of control to catch up to others, the 
community, and time. 
The need to compete with the proverbial Johnsons makes us vulnerable 
to the sanitized dreams of advertisements. The probabilistic nature of 
unpredictable and intermittent rewards (Dabney et al., 2020) leads to 
their addictive nature (Rothenhoefer et al., 2021). Uncertainty, novelty, 
the sense of rarity, or special price triggers a highly addictive dopamine 
surge (Figure 30). Companies often offer discounts that require extra steps 
and require providing information to buy the item. The additional work 
makes the process even more rewarding. 
The Illusion of Reward: Our vulnerability is further exploited by the 
tantalizing promises of advertising. The unpredictability of intermittent 
rewards has been proven to be addictive (Dabney et al., 2020; Rothenhoefer 
et al., 2021), triggering dopamine surges that encourage repeat behaviors

(Figure 30). Marketers tap into this by offering discounts that necessitate 
additional steps, creating the sense of a treasure hunt fueling its rewarding 
quality. However, it is often just wasteful spending.
The Pitfalls of Material Excess: When acquisitions don’t fulfill genuine needs, 
they contribute to a growing sense of emptiness and disappointment. Such 
unnecessary items become costly clutter, relegated to forgotten corners 
of our living spaces. This accumulating disorder can induce a sense of 
latent unease, especially when pressed for time to find an item, only to 
face unmanageable clatter. 
The Quest for Lasting Contentment: Ultimately, long-term satisfaction 
hinges on striking a balanced relationship between our needs and wants. 
Accumulating material goods may offer fleeting moments of happiness, 
but it seldom addresses our deeper emotional and psychological needs. 
Therefore, understanding the difference between what we need for a 
fulfilled life versus what we desire due to external pressures is crucial for 
lasting well-being.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Overcoming Shopping Addiction 
Conquering a shopping addiction calls for disciplined effort, much like 
other forms of dependency. While chemical addictions often necessitate 
medical intervention and formal therapy—a subject beyond this text’s 
scope—the shopping addiction approach involves a more psychological 
dimension.
Understanding the Root Causes: Our sense of self-worth and security 
influences our relationship with money and our willingness to spend it. 
While cutting off immediate access to funds can provide short-term relief, 
long-lasting change necessitates digging deeper to address the underlying 
dependency issues.
Strategies for Sustainable Change: (1) Redirecting Attention: Engaging in a 
meaningful and personally fulfilling activity can divert attention away 
from the urge to shop. This replaces the dopamine rush associated with 
shopping with a more constructive form of gratification. (2) Embrace 
Generosity: Donating excess possessions frees up physical space and 
provides emotional liberation. Redirecting focus from accumulating 
more to sharing and giving can encourage more mindful spending habits 
moving forward.
The Virtue of Patience: Success won’t be achieved instantly; change is 
gradual. However, even small positive steps toward improving oneself can 
cultivate a sense of progress. This forward momentum alleviates feelings 
of restlessness and uncertainty. Owning up to past mistakes while actively 
shaping the present lays a foundation for a more empowered future.
The Closed Inner World of Depression
“In separateness lies the world’s greatest misery.” — Buddha
Despite the immense technological advancements, navigating our social 
environment remains a tremendous challenge. Shockingly, almost half 
of Americans (a country where statistical data is available) resort to  
mood-altering, both legal and illegal substances. The global rates of mental 
illnesses, psychiatric diagnoses, and suicides are on the rise, and drug 
deaths account for more than half of all deaths of despair in the United 
States.69 Depression, the primary cause of disability, affects approximately 
4% of the world’s population, according to the World Health Organization. 
Physiological and Psychological Aspects: Depression’s multidimensional 
nature is indicated by physiological and psychological symptoms, such

as worthlessness and guilt. Depression is a complex interplay of brain 
chemistry, where early-life stressors and even gut microbiome play crucial 
roles. For example, the possible role of inflammation in mood disorders 
and anxiety brings attention to treating the whole person rather than the 
disease.
The brainstem’s quick perception serves our intuition. Compromised 
connections between the brainstem and other brain areas, particularly 
the frontal cortex, incapacitate long-term thinking. Without the future, 
attention is locked the past (Belmans et al., 2023), forming guilt and regret. 
The difficulty of remembering positive memories triggers an insidious 
cycle, intensifying the problem. 
Modern life often feels fractured, without meaning and purpose. 
Workers often denied the big picture and forced into micromanaged roles. 
Lacking purpose themselves, parents fail to provide directions to their 
children. 
Therefore, depression often originates early; childhood stress 
increases the susceptibility to depression later in life (Rousson et al., 2020). 
The powerless condition involves indifference to cognitive functions 
and thoughts. Rigidity is energy-expensive, degrading mental energy, 
exaggerating the vulnerable disposition. Telling someone with depression, 
“Just get over it”, is like asking the desert for water. When the inner clock 
slows to a halt, it becomes as inescapable as a black hole. In a cruel twist, 
the weak mind carries the immense weight of its past. 
The 
broader 
societal 
issues, 
including 
rapid 
technological 
advancements that, paradoxically, often leave people feeling disconnected, 
adversely affect mental health. The modern era in the developed world 
had witnessed the almost total subsuming of human life. The loss of control 
or the lack of mental progress predisposes to depression. Problems with low 
self-esteem and distorted social comparisons represent a sense of separation, 
triggering desperate attempts (bribes or abuse) to hold onto relationships. 
While our modern world offers many comforts, it often lacks the 
tightly-knit community bonds that can act as a buffer against mental 
health issues. 
Treatment and Prevention: Healing does not come from the dark but 
from light. Openness shines understanding on our inadequacies, pains, 
and distress. Mindfulness-based interventions, cognitive-behavioral 
therapy, medications, and even newer approaches like neurofeedback 
(see Chapter Six) offer a range of treatment options. These could work 
best in combination and should be customized to suit the individual’s  
unique needs. 
While “healing by one’s own hands” through art and handicrafts 
appears old-fashioned, these activities cultivate a sense of beauty, 

132 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
balance, and joy. Art-making boosts confidence, which can enhance 
resilience toward stress and depression. The creation of beauty, such as 
art and music, reformulates the mind. As a particular benefit, arts and 
crafts—knitting, music-making, and cooking—encourage positive social 
interactions by sharing resources and creations. The tangible achievement 
from our own two hands lends satisfaction. Even for trauma victims, these 
inspiring, meditative actions improve mood. Physical activities and sports 
are also helpful.
Grief: Depression causes separation, and inversely, isolation can trigger 
depression, becoming a spiritual death in a fully functioning body 
(González-Roldán et al., 2023). Chronic diseases, losing a loved one, 
or significant setbacks represent a lonely, outcast status. After a loss, it 
takes time to weave the irreversible changes into an integral part of our 
mental fabric. Still, excessive regret, guilt, or anger can inhibit recovery. 
The willingness to seek professional help might be the first decisive step 
toward healing. Acceptance builds hope, meaning, and wisdom. 
Prevention and Resilience: It’s essential not to overlook the aspect of 
prevention. Whether through fostering more supportive communities or 
individual actions like regular physical activity, small steps can sometimes 
prevent the onset or recurrence of depression. However, these are often 
easier said than done, particularly for those already in a depressive state.
Social connections form the glue connecting families, communities, 
and nations. Depression often starts with an almost irresistible and 
seductive attraction for separation from others. Separation is an exothermic 
process which robs our mental energies. Thus, replacing inward attention 
with meaningful social connections can overcome this destructive drive. 
For example, making a difference in other people’s lives and the broader 
society overcomes separation and the energy-weak state. Deliberate 
actions toward small goals keep the mind open and engaged. Belief in a 
higher power can help renew hope in the possibility of healing.
Connection to Love: Similar to awe, depression can make time feel 
endless. However, unlike joy, which brings people together, depression 
creates a solitary and confined world with no apparent possibility for 
escape. Depression’s isolating nature underlines the healing effect of 
social connections, particularly compassion and love. Breaking the 
urge of isolation by approaching a friend can initiate a non-judgmental 
relationship to lift us. Additionally, some of the tips outlined in “Success 
Boosters” may also aid in overcoming or preventing depression.

Social Fusion: Embracing a Paradigm of Collective Agency
In the preceding chapters, we embarked on a transformative journey, 
dissecting the fundamental nature of emotions and consciousness, and 
framing them as energy states within the brain. This perspective, apart 
from being an intriguing conceptual lens, bestows upon us a potential for 
mastery over our own lives and helping our loved ones doing the same. 
There are apparent ramifications of this understanding, particularly in 
the realms of education and parenting, where motivating young minds to 
flourish into their fullest capacities becomes a conceivable endeavor.
However, the voyage through these chapters also revealed stark, 
unsettling contrasts in how large corporations and organizations 
perceive and treat their human resources. Employees are deemed as 
mere disposable cogs in the giant operational wheel, in some way far 
more demeaning and dehumanizing situation than slavery, where slave’s 
health was paramount. In contrast, government intervention is necessary 
to ensure basic safety and well-being for the workforce, exemplified by 
mandates on essential protective equipment within factories.
We now find ourselves at a pivotal crossroad. The societal view of 
women and minorities has progressed from a place of diminishment to 
a realm of deserved respect and dignity over the last century. In parallel, 
technological advancements, particularly the integration of AI in robotics, 
are redefining the dynamics on factory floors, empowering workers with 
unprecedented levels of responsibility and influence. This coupled with 
the demographic shift of a shrinking population, lays the groundwork for 
a probable elevation in organizational and financial reverence towards 
workers.
Ancient Athens, an important naval power, extensively used ships for 
combat. The enthusiasm and strength of the rowers, made up of common 
people, determined the maneuverability of the ships (Scheidel, 2017). This 
crucial dependence necessitated the City-state highly democratic social 
structure. Like ancient Athens, humanity’s survival rests on the common 
people. 
Therefore, ancient Athens illustrates a vibrant picture of democratic 
principles in action. The metaphor of Athenian rowers, whose fervor 
determined the maneuverability and thus, the fate of combat vessels, 
symbolizes the indispensable value and potential of collective agency. 
A thoughtful, responsible engagement enriches social cohesion, a fabric 
necessary for facing and overcoming the myriad challenges of our times. 
Social cohesion, where everyone feels respected inspires intelligent and 
responsible contribution for the common cause. Such social fusion is 
paramount to tackle the problems and challenges we face. 
The impending AI revolution is poised to thrust every employee

domains. This evolution echoes the urgency to tackle global dilemmas 
like climate change and waste accumulation, which can only be mitigated 
through a conscientiously caring citizenry. Human brain evolution 
endowed us with an ability to extract meaning and purpose, but this 
privilege was largely the privilege of artists, scientists, and philosophers. 
As the oppressed classes were shackled in a void of mental stagnation, 
the cruelty of oppression robbed the rulers of compassion, a necessary 
ingredient of creativity and meaning.
The voyage concludes by urging a renaissance of social structure, 
advocating for a unified, overarching common goal that resonates with 
every stratum of society. Through this, we not only acknowledge our 
intertwined destinies but also foster a culture of shared responsibility and 
mutual respect. Such a social metamorphosis could catalyze an era where 
each individual, unfettered by oppressive class systems, can contribute 
intelligently and meaningfully towards a harmonious, prosperous society.
The exploration in this book doesn’t merely seek to provoke 
thought but aspires to ignite a movement towards acknowledging and 
embracing the profound potential of human emotions, consciousness, and  
collective agency.

“Where a technique tells you ‘how’ and a philosophy tells you ‘what’, a 
methodology will contain elements of both ‘what’ and ‘how’.”
— Peter Checkland
Societal and technological changes make adhering to our traditional 
political and social systems increasingly challenging. Environmental 
degradation, an aging population, and rapid technological advancements 
require us to reconsider our individual and societal ways of life. As the 
Industrial Revolution transformed the feudal system into capitalist 
structures, our technical progress necessitated a fundamental social and 
political fabric transformation. While change can be challenging and scary, 
the deepening societal conflicts indicate the need for structural change.
In modern cities, poverty is a glaring and unyielding reality, 
highlighting the frailty of our social structures and the importance of 
security. The constant threat of financial ruin might create the impression 
and belief that happiness is associated with monetary gains. A deeply 
ingrained belief—often rooted in childhood experiences—urges us to base 
our self-worth on physical appearance, social standing, and innate abilities. 
As a result, people often push themselves into emotionally draining jobs 
and unsustainable work hours to attain a veneer of contentment. Yet, 
these beliefs do not offer opportunities for personal growth. Unless we 
expand our horizons, we cannot move beyond our parents’ limitations 
toward forming a meaning. With grit, determination, and risk-taking, we 
must continually remake ourselves via an active, optimistic lifestyle. 
The Virtue of Continuous Self-Improvement: Drawing inspiration from 
Aristotle’s philosophy, virtue emerges as a cornerstone for genuine 
human flourishing. Achieving long-term success demands more 
than temporary motivation; it requires an unwavering inner drive 
and a solid ethical foundation. This approach to life is not static but 

136 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
involves perpetual psychological growth. Undertaking the journey of  
self-improvement not only paves the way for career advancements but 
also enriches job satisfaction. However, this metamorphic process is not 
for the faint of heart; it’s akin to summiting a mountain. Lenz’s law in 
psychology shows that external circumstances and beliefs oppose rapid 
mental shifts. Therefore, gradual and consistent progress offers a more 
sustainable path.
Emotion Regulation as an Essential Life Skill
It requires a license to navigate complex machinery like cars. Yet, we 
operate the most complex organization in the universe, our brains, without 
understanding where emotions can take us. A deep understanding of 
emotion regulation can significantly elevate personal autonomy and 
self-confidence. This essential individual skill could be a valuable addition 
to educational curricula, empowering the next generation to manage their 
emotional landscapes effectively. As pioneers in this realm experience 
success, their stories can serve as a roadmap for broader societal adoption. 
The beauty of these self-improvement techniques lies in their universal 
applicability, irrespective of age, culture, or religious background. 
Like traffic laws or multiplication tables, understanding emotion 
regulation can endow our social landscape with confidence and an 
Aristotelian virtue. Like traffic laws or multiplication tables, the rules 
of emotion regulation are independent of cultural, religious, or social 
background. Moreover, they can be adapted to any unforeseen situation. 
A society of confident and moral individuals expects the same 
from its government. A cycle of mutual trust between governments and 
citizens can catalyze sweeping societal changes. The ripple effects of 
such transformation will manifest most tangibly in the lives of future 
generations, enabling them to unlock their intellectual potential within 
constructive community environments.
The impressive ability to save time and solve problems with AI 
offers incredible potential for achieving any goal. However, if we do not 
address the moral foundations of our society, the rise of AI could lead to a 
dangerous and explosive period plagued by crime and anarchy.
The Power of Incremental Change: Starting with acceptance and ending 
with love, the following twenty-nine points have essential, transforming 
power. Depending on individual circumstances and aspirations, adopting 
one or two practices at a time is the most effective. 
In an ever-evolving society, standing still is equivalent to moving 
backward. Continuous growth and adaptation are aspirational goals and 
existential necessities for personal and collective well-being. Individually

striving for better versions of ourselves contributes to a broader, more 
resilient, and equitable society. Our ultimate legacy will be the world we 
leave for future generations—a world shaped by our collective choices 
and individual transformations.
Unless we move forward, society is leaving us behind. 
The Law of Orthogonality, Acceptance
“Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance 
can there be recovery.” ― J.K. Rowling
A large percentage of thoughts throughout the day are recurring. Like a 
familiar song, negative emotions like resentment and regret can stick in 
our minds like an infection. And negative feelings are never alone; like 
flies circling around a dead worm, they gather and multiply. Mistakes 
stir up memories, creating a mentally exhausting mixture of worries and 
remorse.
These deeply ingrained recurring patterns can populate our minds 
like an incessant melody. Self-doubt and uncertainty often manifest 
debilitating thoughts: “This always happens to me,” “I can never succeed,” 
or “I’m not smart enough.” These pervasive patterns act as heavy chains, 
anchoring and draining our inspiration, irrespective of our innate talents 
and capabilities. When these automatic thought patterns take over our 
thoughts, we, in essence, cede control over our lives.
The automatic thought loops of self-doubt and uncertainty trigger 
thoughts such as “This always happens to me; I can never do it; I am 
not smart enough.” Independent of personal talent and ability, their 
pessimism and powerlessness weigh down and drain inspiration. When 
we lose control of our thoughts, we lose control of our lives. 
Lenz’s law has shown that conscious attempts to dismiss worries 
or ruminations offer only a fleeting respite. Placing the blame outside 
of ourselves only strengthens the past’s grip over our present. Fighting 
against our circumstances is analogous to pushing down a floating log or 
taming a storm, ultimately futile endeavors. Instead, we must recognize 
problems in our mental world as an indication of the need for personal 
growth. 
Rather than focusing on exerting conscious control over our thoughts, 
we should aim to alter our underlying beliefs. Mental freedom is impossible 
without liberation from repetitive thought loops. Spiritual openness 
requires regularly getting rid of grudges and hurts. The discussion on the 
Pythagorean theorem has shown the transformative power of acceptance. 

138 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Consider the captured Roman soldier Mucius,70 whose deliberate 
act of placing his hand in fire aptly demonstrated his fearlessness to his 
enemies. True confidence is not easy; it arises from an unwavering belief 
in one’s capacity to face hardships, including the ultimate sacrifice. It’s 
about expecting the best while remaining unattached to outcomes. By 
accepting our personal truths, we foster a unified sense of purpose and 
intellectual resilience, enabling us to devise integrated solutions grounded 
in the essence of our being.
Moreover, the practice of acceptance extends beyond ourselves to how 
we interact with others. It means setting aside ego, pride, and biases that 
prevent us from genuinely receiving help or compliments. In doing so, we 
replace antagonism with collaboration, trust, and kindness, epitomized 
eloquently by Mr. Rogers, who asserted that compassion paves the way to 
success (Figure 21).
In summary, the route to mental freedom lies in unshackling our 
minds from cyclical, negative thought patterns. This liberation comes 
not from suppression but from acceptance—of our circumstances, the 
necessity for personal growth, and our own and others’ intrinsic worth. 
Embracing our vulnerabilities, including a broken heart, can be the first 
step toward profound healing.
Find Meaning
“It is not good for all your wishes to be fulfilled: through sickness you 
recognize the value of health, through evil the value of good, through 
hunger satisfaction, through exertion, the value of rest.” — Heraclitus
Paul Gauguin’s iconic painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? 
Where Are We Going? captures the essence of humanity’s existential 
pondering. For much of human history, the grinding reality of poverty 
and survival left little room for such philosophical contemplation. The 
pursuits of our ancestors often stopped at the immediate necessities: 
marrying and raising a family. However, our modern, technologically 
advanced society provides us free time to seek answers to more profound 
questions and define our unique paths. Unfortunately, we lack guidance 
on how to find our purpose, and most of us are navigating uncharted 
territory. This has led to a global mental health crisis, with depression, 
anxiety, and suicide rates on the rise. It’s essential to understand how 
emotions are regulated not only for our individual well-being but for the 
benefit of our social fabric.
Advancements in science and technology have elevated global living 
standards. Still, even the most prestigious jobs can feel hollow without 
70	 In response to the threat of execution, Mucius stuck his hand directly in the burning fire to 
demonstrate that he did not fear death. 

Success Boosters  139
a sense of purpose. Our lives are increasingly dominated by busyness, a 
hectic schedule that leaves scant room for mental or spiritual nourishment. 
This addiction to the adrenaline rush of constant activity and information 
conceals an underlying spiritual emptiness, a vulnerability to fleeting 
pleasures, and a restless urge to constantly shift focus.
So, what defines success? If we liken life to a journey by train, what 
is its ultimate destination? We all seek a form of transcendence, be it 
through a higher power or a trust in the interconnectedness of the cosmos. 
Understanding our role in this grand tapestry lends our lives a sense 
of significance and fulfillment. The key to long-term well-being lies in 
embracing life as an integral element within this more expansive existence.
Although we have infinite potential, our responsibilities do not 
extend beyond what we can handle. By positively contributing to others 
and pursuing meaningful objectives, we gradually align our individual 
purposes with a more universal, cosmic order. We can only take advantage 
of life’s immense possibilities by stepping out of our comfort zone. If 
you’re comfortable, empathize with the pain of others; if you’re suffering, 
allow yourself to be embraced by the world.
In essence, meaning is not a fixed point but a dynamic, ever-expanding 
vision that instills in us a sense of progress and forward momentum. 
While challenges abound, individual and collective growth opportunities 
have never been more substantial. Our existential quest for understanding 
should remain an integral part of our journey through life.
Authenticity
“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and 
go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” 
— Howard Thurman 
We become susceptible to external influences and societal expectations 
when we lack personal meaning. This vulnerability often manifests as 
insecurity, shame, fear, and anger stemming from an intense desire for 
social validation. For instance, insecurity of one’s abilities prompts a 
defensive stance to safeguard one’s social standing. It leads to prioritizing 
others over themselves in a quest for approval, setting the stage for 
resentment if those favors are not reciprocated promptly. 
Insecure people rely on their massive egos for protection. Emotional 
distortions can compromise our authenticity, skewing our words and 
actions until they misrepresent our true selves. The ego’s excessive 
Temporal Mass forms emotional lensing manifested as biased speech, 
behavior, and personality. To free ourselves from ego-driven bias 
requires an honest self-examination and open dialogue with others to 
discover our core values and form our internal compass, which gives rise 

140 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
to an inherent feeling for healthy boundaries. These boundaries rooted 
in our subconscious form a protective mechanism providing courage to 
automatically ward off anything that could harm or threaten our purpose. 
Our core values become our guidance system: the openness to ask and the 
generosity to accept help. 
Cultivating trust and gratitude fosters meaningful interactions, serving 
as the cornerstone for collective engagement. Emotional safety enables 
us to give selflessly without being attached to the outcome. In a space 
where nothing is expected in return, regret loses its foothold, allowing us 
to adapt swiftly to challenges and opportunities. Just as energy naturally 
moves from warmer to colder substances, emotionally calm individuals 
do not need to assert themselves through conflict; instead, they glean 
wisdom and understanding from each experience.
Because authentic individuals can trust and safeguard themselves, 
they enjoy the freedom that comes with emotional security. In contrast, 
by focusing on their ego, insecure people expose their core and exacerbate 
their emotional vulnerabilities. Authenticity, then, is about remaining true 
to our innermost selves.
Learn the Rules 
“You have to learn the rules of the game. And then, you have to play 
better than anyone else.” — Albert Einstein 
In his seminal book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell posits the 10,000-Hour 
Rule, suggesting mastery in any field requires approximately 10,000 hours 
of dedicated practice. This roughly equates to 20 work hours a week for 
a decade. A diligent learner can acquire comprehensive knowledge and 
expertise in a chosen subject during this extensive period.
However, becoming an expert entails more than accumulating 
knowledge and refining techniques. Technical mastery is the foundation, 
but a personal signature and originality require turning the chore of 
study into a confident play. The innovative genius requires ambition and 
constant restlessness to bring forth the future by destroying and recreating 
everything with sheer imagination. 
Understanding the unwritten rules of a community or industry can 
provide helpful shortcuts. By studying the luminaries in their fields, 
aspirants can intuitively grasp underlying patterns and nuances. Experts 
can ask critical questions that uncover unexpected problems before their 
symptoms. 

Success Boosters  141
However, one peril of limited understanding is overconfidence. Mark 
Twain sagely warned, “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into 
trouble. It’s what you know for sure that ain’t so.” Humility is the key to 
acknowledging one’s errors, which opens the hard road from self-centered 
delusions toward progress. 
Take the case of Hedy Lamarr, the Hollywood actress and producer 
who, during WWII, invented a groundbreaking radio guidance system. 
Despite her invaluable contributions, she received no recognition or 
compensation, mainly due to her outsider status and failure to navigate 
the industry’s unwritten rules. This highlights that exceptional skill alone 
is insufficient; understanding an industry’s political dynamics is also 
essential.
The Virtue of Solitude
Although learning from others is crucial, insights deepen into an expert 
understanding in solitude. In Tchaikovsky’s words, such “fertile solitude” 
strengthens the spirit and develops an authentic voice and a love of the 
subject matter. A notable accomplishment resulting from seclusion is 
Einstein’s theory of relativity, a monumental achievement, was primarily 
a product of such solitude. His words show appreciation for this working 
style: “The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulate the creative 
mind.” Solitude does not mean social isolation! Engaging with friends, 
family, and peers is a necessary reality check for our efforts.
Setting Goals
“Vision is the spectacular that inspires us to carry out the mundane.” 
— Chris Widener
Youthful optimism uplifts the imagination of a positive future (Schubert 
et al., 2019). Goals solidify these paper tigers into the realities of the future. 
Studies have shown that goal orientation is crucial for success in humans, 
emotional animals, and robotic simulations (Wissner-Gross and Freer, 
2013). Having a well-defined purpose channels our energy and reshapes 
our mindset to achieve these aspirations.
Setbacks and obstacles are to be expected. The journey toward 
worthwhile goals will undoubtedly involve uncharted territory, detours, 
and pitfalls. However, each stumble provides an opportunity to renew 
our commitment and grow. Just as professional sports teams invest in 
motivational coaches to help navigate disappointments, the most effective 
coaching comes from channeling our deepest desires into enthusiasm. 

142 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
So, what constitutes success? If life were a train ride, where would 
your ticket take you? Selecting a goal that fuels your intrinsic motivation is 
crucial, acting as a catalyst for every thoughtful action, step, and decision 
you make along your journey.
Keep Tabs on Progress
Like glistening faraway mountains, hefty goals appear promising 
and approachable but prove challenging to conquer. Our confidence 
level determines our perceived distance to the target and its clarity. 
Accomplishments make our objective more approachable, but failures and 
disappointments move it hopelessly out of reach. The subjective nature of 
confidence makes mindset an essential element for success. 
The strategy must be updated periodically because even slight changes 
can significantly impact it. A regular appraisal of the progress allows the 
mind to take hold of its objective via a higher perspective. Such intellectual 
upgrading is a necessary part of successful goal-getting. 
Although focusing on the goal is essential, rigid, tight concentration 
inhibits self-correction. Maintaining steady progress is an art that requires 
continuous adjustments with dynamism and flexibility.
Steps of Achievement
The goal should be constant in the mind, guiding decisions representing 
the most direct yet feasible path toward realization. Each decisive step 
forward invigorates the brain’s reward centers and bolsters confidence 
and belief in our abilities.
Significant goals can feel daunting, but they are often possible to break 
down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Beginning with a modest 
project, it becomes easier to build on it diligently, gradually extending 
our ambitions. Solving one problem (one tiny step) accomplished daily 
permits one to incrementally build self-assurance and expertise through 
small victories. The process can provide a stable foundation for more 
considerable success. As a high-speed boat charts a straight and steady 
course, sustained momentum builds unwavering confidence and 
minimizes doubt. A vivid, unshakable vision of the goal guides each step.
The Power of Compound Interest
In a big organization, career and leadership advance with individual 
confidence and skill. Still, in modern, technologically advanced societies, 
unprecedented access to information has democratized the personal ability 

Success Boosters  143
to dream big and achieve even bigger. Like compound interest,71 each 
significant step forward amplifies determination, further fueling progress. 
This creates a synergistic effect where our behavior and thoughts mutually 
reinforce each other, accumulating a momentum that propels us toward 
our goals (Figure 19). Although initial efforts may seem unremarkable, 
consistent and genuine work will eventually bear fruit, optimizing mental 
and physical resources for peak performance.
In conclusion, the power of a well-defined goal cannot be overstated; 
it serves as a compelling catalyst for success. The goal we set charts our 
course, influences our actions and ultimately shapes our destiny.
Anticipating a Change
“For all days prepare…when you are the anvil bear; when you are the 
hammer, strike.” ― Edwin Markham
In his bestselling book Who Moved My Cheese? (1999), Spencer Johnson 
delves into the psychology of decision-making in a world of constant 
change. He argues that to thrive and expand our horizons, we must not 
just react to change but also actively anticipate and drive it. This mindset 
demands a level of mental agility to adapt to shifting circumstances.
Acclimatization
Consider the parallel of mountain climbing, a pursuit that necessitates 
physical stamina and intellectual acumen. Here, unpredictable weather 
conditions bring a new significance to traits like determination and 
discipline. The climber’s need to adjust to changing circumstances and 
acclimatize to high altitudes mirrors the adaptability required in our 
ever-changing world.
Building a Momentum: Educational systems build student confidence by 
designing curricula offering incremental achievement opportunities. Even 
small victories enrich our insight, whether understanding a complex joke 
or winning a game. These mental accomplishments can accumulate into 
a formidable momentum, as Newton’s first law of motion in psychology 
shows. When students finally receive their diplomas, the ceremony 
represents a stamp of approval after years of dedication and effort. That 
sheet of paper, adorned with ornate lettering and backed by respected 
authorities, symbolizes a societal vote of confidence in the graduates, 
whether they’re emerging as doctors, engineers, or educators.

144 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Finding the Forward Path: Embarking on a lengthy journey often involves 
unexpected twists and turns, including the occasional U-turn. Headstrong 
pursuit of an objective without flexibility is rarely the best action. 
Advantageous opportunities can offer shortcuts, but the willingness to 
promptly correct course when required is a critical skill.
When decisive action is necessary, like switching projects or crossing 
metaphorical gaps’, hesitation can be disastrous. The path of progress 
inevitably leads us through unfamiliar landscapes, opening the door to 
fears and uncertainties—a topic we’ll explore in the next section.
In sum, adapting to change isn’t just about surviving; it’s about 
thriving in a world that won’t stand still. From the mountaintop to the 
classroom, mastering the art of adjustment is critical in our complex, 
rapidly evolving environment.
Mastering Fear
“Everything you want is on the other side of fear.” — George Addair
Our life pulses with our sense of security. When we feel confident, we 
make wise decisions, but difficulty or danger initiates anxiety and 
withdrawal. In crises, events outside of our control dominate our lives. 
Traumas and threats disturb the ebb and flow of the body’s energy 
balance, reverberating to the muscle fibers and nerves. 
Fear is both an asset and a liability; it’s an evolutionary survival 
mechanism that can both save and paralyze us. While it serves as an alert 
system to potential dangers, it can also confine us to a state of inactivity 
and stagnation. When we cannot trust our environment, we either seek 
control and dominance or seek isolation, the “civilized’ equivalent of the 
fight or flight response (Figure 10). 
Conquer Fear
Fear narrows focus by illuminating only a small, dangerous section of 
reality. The danger urges steps to increase security but fear can never 
be eliminated this way because every protective action uncovers a new 
terrifying detail, causing paralyzing tightness. How can we escape fear? 
One way to confront fear is through proactive engagement. Facing 
it head-on can dispel the nebulous dread that often magnifies the 
perceived threat.
Conquering Fear through Action: Ultimately, we choose between action 
and inaction. Since fear thrives on immobility, any meaningful action, 
however small, can serve as the first step toward emancipation from fear’s 
clutches. By taking charge, we challenge the validity of our fears and 

Success Boosters  145
reclaim our sense of agency and freedom. No matter how daunting, taking 
a decisive first step dispels the clouds of fear and brings a newfound sense 
of empowerment. The experience of failure, though not enjoyable, is far 
more instructive than remaining paralyzed by the fear of uncertainty.
Simulating and Believing Courage: The rise of simulation technologies 
offers us the unique opportunity to confront our fears in a controlled 
environment. Even without technology, the mental exercise of visualizing 
a supportive environment can go a long way in mitigating anxiety. 
Buddha’s quote, “Imagine that every person in the world is doing just the 
right things to help you”, can be a potent psychological tool.
Accepting Our Mortality: Our existential fear is the fear of death. Embracing 
this inevitability can lead to fearlessness and immunity to defeat. In 
Hegel’s words, “It is only through staking one’s life that freedom is won.” 
Stephen Hawking, who was diagnosed with a fatal illness at a young 
age yet committed himself fervently to scientific pursuit, exemplifies the 
difficulty and triumph of such a choice; he defied the odds and lived well 
beyond his doctors’ prediction. 
Impostor Syndrome
The impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern that reflects the fear of 
being discovered as a fraud. The psychology of the impostor syndrome 
can be explained by Lenz’s law. It occurs when our beliefs remain out of 
sync with significant life changes, such as promotion. Our projected false 
reality will act back on our attitudes, corrupting them. While fear can bind 
us in this mental prison, the key to escaping it is preparation (internal) 
and external support. Practicing for challenging situations can dispel the 
cloud of inadequacy, and seeking emotional and psychological support 
can provide additional strength.
The Power of Beliefs
“You have to believe. Otherwise, it will never happen.” ― Neil Gaiman
Belief systems are the mental frameworks that shape our understanding 
of the world. Ultimately, they provide faith for a guiding principle to 
serve as a compass for our decisions and actions. Interestingly, these belief 
systems affect individual outcomes and have broader social implications.
Self-fulfilling Prophecies: We often unknowingly form behavior supportive 
of our expectations. In psychology, the concept of the self-fulfilling 
prophecy highlights the potent role that our beliefs play in shaping our 
realities. If you believe you’ll fail, you’re more likely to do so. On the other 

146 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
hand, positive expectations often bring forth a favorable outcome. Freud’s 
observation of the long-lasting impact of early positive reinforcement—
being a “mother’s darling”—underscores the enduring nature of these 
formative beliefs. The triumphant feeling and confidence in success can 
bring actual success with it.
Forming a Belief: While we may take it for granted, gravity ensures a firm 
ground under our feet. Similarly, our families laid the early foundation 
for our mental well-being. Our trust and confidence in our future parallels 
the stability and predictability of our social surroundings. Without this 
security, we must form solid commitments for ourselves. We can turn an 
encouragement from a parent, teacher, aunt, or caregiver into a personal 
validation. Alternatively, mentally distancing ourselves from challenges 
can provide a better perspective. 
Optimism as a Strategy: The ability to see the glass as ‘half-full’ is more 
than just a cliché; it represents a mindset. William James’s notion that 
“optimism leads to power” isn’t just feel-good rhetoric; it’s a psychological 
truth. Pessimism can be a self-imposed limitation, while optimism, even 
if against all odds, allows us to stretch the boundaries of what is possible. 
This is not to undermine real challenges but to advocate for a mindset to 
better navigate them.
Belief as a Catalyst for Change: One could argue that all significant 
achievements in history started as an act of defiance against the status 
quo. We cannot achieve more than what is offered by our beliefs. Whether 
it was Archimedes with his lever or countless innovators and thinkers 
who challenged existing norms, their beliefs empowered them to change 
the world.
Adjusting our Sails: Beliefs are not static; they can be reshaped and 
reformed. By revisiting and revising your beliefs, you open the door to 
new possibilities and potentials. In essence, our beliefs set the boundaries 
of our world. Changing them doesn’t just alter the view; it can expand the 
landscape entirely. Convictions can become more of a barrier than a bridge 
to move forward. Nevertheless, beliefs are not set in stone; changing them 
can redefine who we are and what we can achieve.
Introduce Order
“Every disordered soul is its own punishment.” 
― St. Augustine of Hippo
Instituting a predictable routine can effectively rehabilitate abused and 
neglected dogs. Establishing order as a pathway to happiness, well-being, 
and success is deeply rooted in philosophical traditions and modern 

Success Boosters  147
psychology. The order provides scaffolding upon which we can build a 
stable life. Whether establishing healthy patterns for a child or establishing 
a new organization, a structure allows for stability and predictability, 
which offers a sense of security.
Prioritization: Structure can be limiting in nature, but it has a liberating 
aspect because it frees us to focus on what truly matters. These structural 
aspects allow us to navigate the complexities of life with greater ease. 
For example, introducing a systematic approach to tasks can reduce 
stress. People use The Eisenhower Matrix tool to categorize tasks into 
what’s urgent and essential, not urgent but important, urgent but not 
necessary, and neither. Likewise, breaking a formidable project into 
smaller, more manageable tasks makes the challenge less intimidating 
and more achievable. This aligns well with the psychological concept of 
“chunking.72”
Mental Strength and Resilience: Experiences are made up of emotional 
building blocks. These “sensory primaries” improve insight into our internal 
motivations and the structure of our emotional intelligence. For example, 
distress can provoke the feeling of pressure, disappointment forms a sense 
of heaviness, shame might parallel a sense of falling, and anxiety triggers 
an internal tightness. This evaluation is beneficial when we are at a loss in 
a situation. Confusion only makes finding solutions more difficult. Like 
pushing the gas pedal in a car is stuck in the mud, hard work does not 
correct the wrong approach. Asking the right questions can discover the 
root of the problem, making solutions possible. 
Mental Order: Tambini and Davachi (2019) pointed out the cognitive 
tendency to form expectations for the future based on past experiences. 
This can lead to bias in how we perceive and process new information. 
However, even without a specific plan, our minds naturally create action 
steps toward achieving clear objectives. Therefore, good outcomes and 
straightforward solutions depend on mental order, particularly for larger 
projects. 
Discipline and order are particularly essential in accomplishing big 
projects. Recognizing our shortcomings is the first step to rain in our 
handicaps. Empty entertainments and purposeless actions are like empty 
calories, leaving us scattered. Mentally nourishing experiences of beauty, 
learning, and joy can make us more resilient and able to handle life’s 
complexities.
Financial Stability: Our ability to have order in our life also includes finances. 
Economic security can provide the room to breathe, make choices, and 
72	 Chunking is a method of facilitating short-term memory by grouping individual pieces of 
information into larger, more familiar (and therefore, more easily remembered) groups.

148 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
navigate life’s ups and downs. Because possessions and attachments can 
also weigh us down, the economic ‘order’ can directly affect psychological 
well-being and our ability to manage change. Accumulating a safety net 
by living beneath our means ensures long-term financial freedom. 
Although money cannot buy happiness, higher-income people are 
generally more satisfied because financial safety ensures a higher quality 
of life. For example, assistants and gadgets can free them from mindless 
tasks, allowing a broader vision. With the advent of AI, these services 
are increasingly available for everyone, permitting democratization in 
planning and managing our lives. 
Not extraordinary talent nor exceptional determination, but mental 
order is the most crucial ingredient for steady progress. Next, we turn to 
habits essential in creating order or structure.
Forming Effective Habits 
“If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the 
habit in little matters. Excellence is not an exception; it is a prevailing 
attitude.” — Colin Powell
According to research conducted at Duke University, about 40 percent of 
our daily actions are habitual (Neal et al., 2011). Charles Duhigg’s 2012 
New York Times bestseller, The Power of Habit, introduces the robust brain 
regions behind habits driven by the reward molecule dopamine and other 
neurotransmitters. Conscious action requires emotionally motivated effort 
to produce. However, repetition increases synaptic connection strength, 
reducing cognitive effort and emotional involvement. Therefore, repeated 
action sequences eventually become automatic and can be performed 
efficiently without deliberate focus, forming a firm foundation over daily 
life. Although habits can be performed without conscious concentration, 
they can lead to mental fatigue after a more prolonged engagement. 
Feedback loops, such as a reward after a typical behavior, form the 
foundation of routines. As a result, regular practice maintains habits and 
provides a structure for our lives. However, transitions to habitual control 
lead to inflexible regulation, which can be a disadvantage during sudden 
changes. 
Habits’ reliable stability indicates that they are part of the temporal 
field. Their temporal nature emerges from projecting past behavioral 
control into future action sequences. However, we must differentiate 
between good and bad habits. Immediate reward quickly solidifies bad 
habits, whereas good habits require conscious effort to develop and 
maintain. For that reason, good habits are easy to lose; if the practice 
ceases, it takes renewed commitment to resume it. 

Success Boosters  149
Bad Habits: Analyzing the origin of a bad habit can offer a path to gain 
control. For example, journaling can help uncover their connection to 
our reward system. However, eliminating a bad habit is difficult even 
after understanding its roots because of the link to dopamine release. In 
addition, the limbic system in the brain activates the fight-flight-or-freeze 
responses, which lead back to the habit. As a consequence, it is easier to 
replace an unwanted habit with a more desirable one. 
Even so, it takes concentrated, painstaking practice over weeks or 
longer to achieve results due to the difficulty of changing our automatisms. 
However, as change starts, it increases confidence, which inspires further 
improvement. Replacing just one set of behavioral patterns can have 
long-term consequences. Slow, gradual changes redirect cravings and 
reprogram our lives. 
Practice turns imperfections into strengths, which leads us to 
persistence. 
Persistence
“Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they 
were to success when they gave up.” — Thomas A. Edison
The famous 1968 Stanford marshmallow test73 is an experiment testing 
preschool children’s willingness to wait for a reward. It showed that 
patient children had higher SAT scores and greater economic security in 
adulthood. Recent work confirms the results for children whose mothers 
had not completed college (Watts et al., 2018) but cautions from broader 
generalization of the findings. 
The uncertainty over the above results indicates that our early life 
does not define our accomplishments: projects we are passionate about 
can inspire remarkable persistence. Perseverance is the inherent ability 
to regulate emotions, thoughts, and behavior (self-control). However, 
our mindset is influenced by our physical and psychological needs. 
Maintaining persistence and determination when we are frustrated or 
tired is hard. Even minor inconveniences, like hunger or a full bladder, 
can quickly diminish our patience. The following section introduces the 
role of persistence in the three stages of task performance.
Start: The courage and mental investment needed to start a project keep 
some people from moving beyond their dreams. Their ambitions for the 
future never move beyond the planning stage. 
73	 Children were given a tasty snack, such as a marshmallow, and told that if they could wait 
for a short while before eating it then they will get an extra snack as a reward.

150 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
As remembered, Newton’s first law for the mind shows the importance 
of acquiring mental momentum. Learning a chosen field’s basics can be a 
good foundation for long-term progress. Persistence helps to keep going 
during these first steps when efforts are not always rewarding. Progressing 
too quickly without proper understanding at this stage denies the chance 
to embrace the project thoroughly. Ignoring the basics can lead to early 
burnout or exhaustion. 
Therefore, there is a difference between doing things quickly and 
right. Like a little creek forming a Grand Canyon, initiating a big project 
with a tentative, slow, steady investigation can help find the optimal 
path. Similar to the opening scene of a stage production, where the plot 
is introduced with a foresight of the conclusion, starting a new project 
requires envisioning its completion. Proper care and consideration at this 
stage may include noticing discrepancies in the accepted professional 
dogma. Asking the right questions can offer the best path toward progress. 
By adjusting our ambitions gradually, we can pick up momentum as our 
experience and knowledge base increase. 
Middle: Like a tightrope walker who keeps his eyes fixed on his destination, 
unwavering belief in the project’s success drives progress. It is vital to 
maintain a steady focus. If we concentrate too narrowly, we get lost in the 
details. If we focus too far, we lose sight of individual steps. 
The difficulty of the middle section is the grinding nature of the 
process. It is crucial to realistically evaluate our progress, and we must 
persist in the face of discouragement and naysayers. Healthy skepticism 
triggers honest examination, but doubts are defeating. A sustained belief 
can secure progress and ensure the energy to start over if external obstacles 
or mistakes block our progress.
Finish: The care and consideration needed to finish a project differs 
significantly from the earlier steps. Close to completion, impatience can 
urge us to rush things toward completion without proper care. The other 
mistake is constantly upgrading expectations, which can indefinitely delay 
the project’s completion. Striking the right balance requires a realistic 
view of our project and an understanding of the external environment or 
our chosen field. Comparing the qualities of our product with the existing 
competition can help us navigate the project’s conclusion. 
We must gradually adjust our approach with discipline and not lose 
our determination at the first sign of triumph. Reaching the last mile in 
the marathon, adding the final brick to the house, and reviewing the 
presentation one more time moves the project to the home stretch.

We should not settle for where we are today; the pace of technological 
progress makes it increasingly essential to continually further our 
education and skill set. This takes us to responsibility. 
Responsibility: Promises and Commitments
“The promises of yesterday are the taxes of today.” 
— William Lyon MacKenzie 
We live in a society with norms and expectations. Trust is the foundation 
of social existence. We trust that cars stop at the red light, the legal system 
serves the victim, and firefighters and paramedics save people. How do we 
form a trust? According to a 2018 study, trustworthy people consider the 
interests of others besides their own. Respect for others makes it natural to 
act honestly and accountably in all areas of life (Levine et al., 2018). 
Consideration for others is also connected to trust in others. As 
individuals, we can inspire trust and confidence in those around us by 
embodying integrity, honesty, reliability, and loyalty. These qualities have 
the tendency to fill our environments and spread to others. Newton’s third 
law, “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction,” implies 
the reciprocal nature of trust in relationships.
Promises: Promises are integral to job descriptions, appointments, and 
marriage contracts. Nevertheless, decency moves obligations beyond 
written agreements. Keeping commitments builds trust, which goes a 
long way in creating a positive environment. 
Insecure people rush to make promises because they are governed 
by short-term motivations. Their weakness makes it difficult to say 
no, inspiring them to accommodate everyone. However, their mind 
changes with the prevailing social winds, making it easy to forget their 
commitments. Unfortunately, broken agreements erode trust and 
exaggerate uncertainty.
Commitments: Being accountable is essential in developing confidence 
and self-esteem. Living up to our families’ and communities’ standards 
internalizes those expectations until they become second nature. However, 
accommodating every request mindlessly, without understanding or 
verification, is a sign of weakness. Without the strength to say no, we 
compromise our secure boundaries, leading to remorse in the long run. 
We can create a positive environment by committing to our principles 
and beliefs, speaking the truth without deceit, honoring our commitments, 
and standing by our loved ones and friends. Being impeccable with our 
words intersects with and influences our ability to maintain mental order.

152 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
The Power of Attitude
“When you take care of your effort and intention, with a little bit of luck, 
outcome will follow.” — Amit Sood
The role of attitude cannot be overstated, as it significantly shapes our 
perception, awareness, and behavior. Like a powerful magnet, personal 
disposition guides perception, cognition, and behaviors by coloring every 
question and perception in our minds. While happy people may find 
encouragement when fearful people see danger, a positive attitude can 
open the world to us, making everything seem possible. 
Culture and traditions are critical in determining acceptable behaviors 
in families or countries. Collective attitudes shape societal norms and 
expectations, particularly in the age of social media, where opinions can 
change rapidly. Peer pressure can modify views about the stock market, 
housing, or new technologies. Therefore, national experience, as seen 
with atomic power, can dramatically alter what is socially accepted or 
attractive. 
Choosing our Focus
Our focus is crucial in determining the details of our observations, much 
like the microscope’s magnification. Adjusting our attention can help us 
see situations in new and enlightening ways, just as a microscope reveals 
layers upon layers. 
Because changing the microscope’s depth perception takes an 
effort, it takes a conscious effort to modify our attention. For example, 
mistreatment abuse distorts vision, causing distrust or cynicism. Such 
bias misconstrues reality to fuel aggression, racism, cults, and repressive 
regimes, highlighting the importance of having a clear and unbiased 
perspective. Forgiveness is difficult but overcomes accumulated tightness 
by releasing built-up hate, resentment, or anger. Reformulating our 
narrative as a doer and success story can help rejuvenate our well-being.
Taking responsibility for mistakes by correcting and compensating 
for misdeeds is essential because it eliminates intense guilt and shame. 
Instead, self-forgiveness clears the mind of the weight of the past, opening 
the path to personal growth and positive motivation, enhancing mental 
order and persistence. Genuine self-reflection is an integral part of positive 
transformation, which tends to reverberate positively in our environment, 
affecting those we interact with regularly. 
Because attention acts as a magnet for our attention, following every 
lead that competes for our attention fractures our ability to focus. Learning 
to give up our wants can be a liberating experience that clarifies our focus 
on our needs, allowing us to achieve our goals and live a fulfilling life.

The Power of Learning 
“Education is the passport to the future.” ― Malcolm X
Entitlements and privileged positions of kings, emperors, princes, and 
noblemen were often attributed to God. Feudalism during the Middle 
Ages had solidified into an inflexible hierarchy. Individual interactions 
were dictated by strict legal, economic, and military rules, making human 
interaction across class differences virtually impossible. However, the 
Industrial Revolution disrupted this social order, creating an opportunity 
for those outside the aristocracy. 
The hierarchical structure of titles yielded to the power of finance, 
as money and connections drove political and social advancement in this 
new era. In the twentieth century, modern economies moved toward a 
knowledge-based structure, with information, expertise, and intellectual 
capital forming its central pillar. Education and learning became crucial 
to upward mobility. 
As society changes ever faster, social media and the internet have 
become pivotal in shaping social attitudes and mobility. Concurrently, 
there is a growing expectation for respect of the individual, reflected in 
film, politics, arts, sports, and science. Increasingly, the democratization 
of information is once again transforming social mobility. Lifelong 
learning has the potential to level the playing field and act as a great 
social equalizer. Personal growth and transformation can be achieved by 
integrating learned knowledge and experience, ultimately determining 
one’s social status.
Learning and the Mind
Learning goes beyond just qualifying for a job or gaining new skills. It 
expands the mind, promotes spiritual balance, and cultivates patience. 
Hard work, dedication, and persistence lead to long-term fulfillment and 
increased life expectancy (Hummer and Hernandez, 2013). Education 
helps to clear mental clutter, promoting positive psychological states and 
leading to better financial and health decisions. It also inspires individuals 
to make a positive impact in their communities. 
Education is a conscious process that stretches the mind through two 
stages. The first stage involves gathering, absorbing, and conceptualizing 
material, which can be stressful and confusing. The second stage integrates 
the new information through a liberating and empowering process. 
Active learning involves engaging students in hands-on activities that 
require them to think critically about their actions (Bonwell, 1991). This 
approach is particularly effective in the digital age, where abundant online 

154 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
information makes lexical information less critical. The internet’s security 
and accessibility foster openness and encourage knowledge-sharing.
Taking breaks between practice sessions can help improve memory 
consolidation of skills (Buch et al., 2021). During these rest intervals, the 
brain replays faster versions of the patterns from the practice activity, 
which boosts learning. This replay is specific to the trained sequence and 
can predict the amount of skill consolidation.
Mimicking (Copying) 
Copying is the first learning method for children. In a positive 
environment,74 it is often also the most efficient way to acquire knowledge 
and new skills for adults.75
Observing and imitating superior personal and professional 
performance is a well-traversed path toward professional success and 
well-being. In a trustworthy environment, people may unconsciously 
imitate each other’s mannerisms and posture, which can build social 
capital and spread attitudes and opinions through social networks. For 
example, Sentiment Contagion expresses the spreading of views and 
preferences among social network members, whose effects are not always 
positive. For example, stock market bubbles might originate in the shared 
optimistic beliefs of enthusiastic customers, which are disseminated and 
amplified through social interaction. 
Copying within peer groups and organizations permits employees 
to absorb the culture and unwritten rules of their workplace through 
mentoring and imitation. As newcomers gradually build confidence, it 
produces a shared culture, influencing personal and corporate decisions. 
Rote Learning
Learning through repetition, known as rote learning, is a standard 
method for mastering challenging material. Songbirds, such as zebra 
finches, use this technique to learn complex songs by precisely tuning 
connections between neurons. This stepwise approach is also used to 
memorize mathematical tables. Consistent exposure to the material can 
lead to muscle memory and automatic action sequences. Rote learning can 
provide a foundation for technical mastery in theater, dance, music, art, 
drawing, and language. 
Beyond teaching a new skill, rote learning is a meditative practice 
that potentiates positive psychological states, attention, and patience. The 
technique clears the mind from wayward thoughts, generating a fresh, 
75	 Cook et al., 2012.

Success Boosters  155
empowering, and energetic feeling. Gradually increasing the repetitive 
routine duration over time can significantly boost mental energy.
Operant Conditioning
The concept of operant conditioning links a person’s actions to the 
direct consequences that follow. These consequences, whether positive 
reinforcements or negative punishments, will determine whether the 
behavior will likely be repeated. In the corporate world, doing a job 
well can advance a career. At the same time, poor performance can lead 
to demotion or even termination. Various motivations can impact the 
effectiveness of operant conditioning. For example, this learning method 
may not be effective for self-motivated individuals who do not respond 
well to threats. 
Lifelong Learning 
While a college degree is often a requirement for specific jobs, it is not 
essential for leading a successful life. The demand for diverse skills in 
technology and social services is at an all-time high, and the need for 
continued learning has never been greater. Inversely, obtaining a college 
degree does not mean that learning stops there. The flexibility of intellect 
makes its improvement possible, an increasingly necessary requirement 
in our rapidly evolving society.
The Role of Advice
“Never react emotionally to criticism. Analyze yourself to determine 
whether it is justified. If it is, correct yourself. Otherwise, go on about 
your business.” — Norman Vincent Peale
Critiques evaluate work in the arts, sciences, and other professions for 
the recipient’s benefit. The distinction between constructive feedback and 
judgment is crucial. While constructive feedback provides encouragement 
and support, judgment has a negative connotation. While the former is 
meant to guide and better the individual, the latter often arises from 
biases or vested interests, which are often betrayed by their tone beyond 
its oppressive message. 
An environment thriving on judgment will not foster creativity, 
collaboration, or growth. The degree of personal attacks and reproach 
within an organization is inversely proportional to its flexibility and 
progressive drive. Resilient organizations are highly dynamic and show 
lesser polarization (Klimek et al., 2019). They champion constructive 
feedback and view it as an avenue for growth rather than a threat.

156 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Response to advice is a test of the recipient, indicating his inner 
strength. Below, you find three possible reactions to criticism—the list 
represents the increasing independence of the recipient, showing learning 
and confidence stages.
1. Insecurity
Our opinions are rooted in our morals, values, and principles, representing 
an expectation of how we think the world should work. Pronounced 
sensitivity to what others say signals insecurity. This narrow, defensive 
viewpoint can lead to a restless striving for perfection, degenerating into a 
tendency to disappoint others. For an insecure person, even compliments 
can question his firmly-held ideas. For example, praising children with 
low self-esteem predisposes them to shame (Brummelman et al., 2014). 
Playing the victim or demeaning the self builds walls across every road 
that might lead to success. 
2. Accepting Advice
As individuals mature emotionally and cognitively, they recognize 
the value of external perspectives. Advice is a much-needed second 
perspective empowering us to see ourselves through the eyes of others. 
Although it is vital to discern constructive advice from mere judgment, 
we grow every time we respond graciously to criticism. Even unfair 
decisions can deepen understanding and sharpen insight. Listening and 
considering input from others is a sign of respect and a powerful tool to 
learn, grow, and develop. In the words of Dale Turner, “The error of the 
past is the wisdom and success of the future.” We develop inner strength 
and expand our limitations when we correct our mistakes. 
3. Inner Strength
Understanding ourselves and our dreams inspires firm beliefs and 
self-respect in handling feedback. Because individuals at this stage 
profoundly appreciate their values and beliefs, they are open to feedback. 
They can stand firm in their convictions while being receptive to new 
perspectives. Their resilience is not based on avoiding criticism but on the 
ability to sift through it and take what’s beneficial.

and organizations. How feedback is given and received can shape 
organizational culture, leadership styles, and interpersonal dynamics. 
Moreover, understanding these stages of response can be instrumental 
for educators, managers, and leaders to tailor their feedback approach to 
various individuals, ensuring it is both practical and nurturing.
Decisions and Mistakes 
“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.” 
— Albert Einstein
“The new basic principle is that in order to learn to avoid making 
mistakes, we must learn from our mistakes. To cover up mistakes is, 
therefore, the greatest intellectual sin.” — Karl Popper
Arthur Miller’s 1949 play, Death of a Salesman, is about the wrong decisions 
reverberating in our lives and the lives of our loved ones. Because our 
actions have inertia, mistakes must be corrected to avert their gathering 
harmful momentum. The inability to face and correct errors accumulate 
into a tsunami that engulfs and buries our dreams and future. Their 
menace can survive in the hidden corners of the soul for generations, 
exploding and destroying hopes at the most inopportune time. 
Course Correction: Much like navigating a physical journey, our life also 
demands periodic introspection and adjustments. Getting sidetracked 
from our goals indicates the need to reexamine our objectives and correct 
our way. Rephrasing or forming the problem in a question form can 
quickly prompt a meaningful solution. 
Embracing Mistakes
Mistakes are a necessary part of learning because they provide growth 
opportunities. Therefore, being unwilling to acknowledge and learn from 
our mistakes is detrimental.
The ability to rebound from mistakes is essential to resilience and 
vitality. Admitting wrong and apologizing is the best form of ownership, 
forcing us to move out of our comfort zone. Being at peace with our core 
values permits us to listen to our best judgment, naturally making us less 
error-prone. 
Failure as a Catalyst
Failure is a painfully apparent persuasive argument for change. First, we 
must recognize the blunder before we can overcome it. Transformation is 
not easy; it requires work, effort, and time. Correcting failings is the best 

158 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
reinforcement of our goals. Doing the right thing requires courage but 
generates courage. 
The Power of Intuition
In an age of information overload, intuition’s role has become increasingly 
important. While data and facts are crucial, the human mind’s ability 
to intuitively discern the best course of action, especially in complex 
scenarios, remains unparalleled. People with a strong sense of purpose 
trust their intuition and find greater satisfaction. 
As discussed earlier, intuitive decisions follow psychological comfort, 
which can slice through conflicting information. Although insight 
improves with the decision maker’s experience and confidence, the 
more complicated the problems are, the greater the advantage intuition 
provides.
Emotional Intelligence: An understanding of oneself and the emotions of 
others can lead to better, more empathetic decisions. Therefore, emotional 
intelligence and a clear purpose can guide us more truly than mere  
facts alone.
Taking a Break 
 “Every now and then go away, have a little relaxation, for when 
you come back to your work your judgment will be surer.” 
— Leonardo da Vinci 
Biological, physiological needs, circadian rhythms, and psychological 
requirements rely on the brain’s superior energy turnover. The quality of 
our lives depends on the pace of our day.
The Detriments of Chronic Stress: Our biological and psychological needs 
are intertwined. Modern lifestyles often subject individuals to sustained 
levels of stress. Stress and anxiety can worsen conditions such as diabetes 
and heart disease and accelerate aging. 
Proper rest is crucial for maintaining good health. Creating gaps in 
our engagement calendar frees time for reflection and relaxation. Rest is 
a temporal oasis that refreshes the mind, increases resilience, and renews 
determination. Rest allows appreciation of the small things in life, their 
tiny, delicious pleasures, moment-to-moment inspiration, and fulfillment. 
Resting is often associated with laziness but involves engaging 
in activities that rejuvenate the soul. Active rest flushes out the dust of 
everyday life. It can include attending a concert, visiting a gallery, walking

in nature, or reading a meaningful book. Even mundane tasks such as 
cooking, cleaning, or organizing can be relaxing. For example, socializing 
with supportive friends and family or experiencing humor can boost 
confidence instantly. Likewise, helping others can improve our mental 
state and increase goodwill. 
As our biological and psychological needs are interconnected, it is 
vital to prioritize rest and relaxation in our daily lives. More discussion on 
rest can be found in “Learning and the Role of Sleep”. 
Healthy Living and Exercise 
“You’re only one workout away from a good mood.” — Unknown
As human beings, our physical bodies are composed of the dirt under 
our feet. At the same time, our minds carry the reflection of the universe 
or God. Recognizing the boundless potential within our consciousness 
must inspire us to prioritize our psychological and physical well-being. 
Therefore, taking care of oneself is more than immediate comfort; it also 
serves self-respect and ambition. 
We expect our bodies to function for about a century. Investing time 
to learn the needs and potentials of our bodies is a worthwhile endeavor. 
Bodily and Mental Benefits 
Physical and Mental Advantages: Focusing on the future is a testament 
to valuing oneself. Self-improvement serves as a stable framework for 
meeting our health needs and objectives. A disciplined diet that caters to 
both physical and mental health is crucial. For example, eliminating a food 
group entirely is more effective than limiting specific foods. Alternatively, 
fasting for twelve hours or more limits calorie intake and switches the 
cell metabolism from sugar-based fuel to a slower metabolic process from 
fat. In turn, hunger helps regulate blood sugar, improves stress resistance, 
and suppresses inflammation. Fasting can also stimulate autophagy, a 
cellular ‘clean-up’ process, and enhance metabolic efficiency. However, 
it’s important to note that while intermittent fasting can benefit many, 
it may not suit everyone, and it’s advisable to consult with a health 
professional before making significant dietary changes. 
Exercise—The Vital Habit: Exercise keeps the body strong and healthy, 
and the muscles send signals to the brain, positively influencing mental 
health. For example, while weight-bearing movements increase muscle 
mass, they also enhance the biochemical foundation of the nervous 
system. Exercise triggers the creation of new neurons and releases  

160 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
feel-good hormones. It improves physical intellectual performance, 
memory, and life functionality. 
Regular exercise protects against numerous diseases and helps 
maintain cognitive function as we age. Exercise is the only proven way 
to stop or reverse physical and executive decline during aging, making it 
the ultimate fountain of youth. It extends the energy and agility of youth. 
So, just do it.
Letting Go of Control 
“You must learn to let go. Release the stress. You were never in control 
anyway.” — Steve Maraboli
We all want to protect our loved ones. Still, worries can overpower our 
common sense, pushing us toward closer management at any price. When 
we feel insecure, we hold our loved ones closer. Control is born out of 
good intentions but goes awry because of distrust of the environment or 
our loved ones. Strong attachments to people, things, or specific outcomes 
limit options and encourage an unhealthy and abusive need for control. 
The Buddha said, “The root of suffering is attachment.” The need to 
always be right; the fear of being wrong makes us prone to mistakes.
Power of Surrender: Although letting go of control has the chance of loss, 
it offers profound relief and inspires learning. Surrender allows the 
natural tendencies of things to take shape and materialize. It suggests 
that sometimes, instead of forceful action, what’s needed is a step back, 
a pause, a willingness to see what unfolds. This surrender isn’t about 
inaction but trusting in the process and recognizing that we can’t always 
dictate outcomes. There’s a paradox at the heart of control; only by letting 
go can we have better relationships.
Organizations
Cultural formations and rituals have a strong presence. History, people, 
customs, and knowledge promote belonging, cohesion, and purpose. 
New ideas are resisted initially but, once accepted, treated like sacred 
knowledge. The importance of cultural evolution can’t be understated. 
When organizations hold onto outdated models or practices due to fear of 
change, they risk stagnation or even decline. 
Abandoning outdated expectations helps a project develop its organic 
direction. Relinquishing close control encourages group ownership, 
encouraging broader participation and contribution independent of 
position. Community goals with shared support generate a stronger 
momentum, which can sweep everyone with it.

Success Boosters  161
Adaptability is recognizing when to shift direction toward innovation. 
For example, Netflix, a mail-order DVD company, evolved into an online 
server; Lego, a toy brick maker, achieved mega-success from collaborations 
with Harry Potter and Star Wars. In contrast, Kodak was synonymous 
with photography but had to declare bankruptcy in 2013. While Netflix 
and Lego evolved and adapted to changes in the market, Kodak clung to 
its film-based model, missing out on the digital photography revolution. 
Control is often a journey inward. Recognizing our fears and 
insecurities can shift our behaviors and approaches toward a more 
active stance. The balance between control and flexibility can determine 
long-term sustainability and growth in both personal and organizational 
contexts.
Meditation, Prayer
“When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of 
a candle in a windless place.” — Bhagavad Gita
Our awareness has a rhythm undergirded by our psychology. Our 
mental power allows us to rise above minor annoyances or adversities. 
Therefore, psychological stability is not the lack of adverse experiences 
but eliminating their long-term consequences through establishing a 
higher perspective.
Meditation and prayer are prime examples of guiding one’s 
thoughts. Eastern religious practitioners and sages perfected meditation 
into a centering yet relaxing practice. Meditation achieves a higher 
perspective by directing attention toward the present moment. Slowing 
the ‘momentum’ of our thinking encourages mental coherence, improving 
sleep, cognitive flexibility, and learning (Goldberg et al., 2018). Prayer is a 
type of meditation with a focus on a divine being.
Meditation and prayer are only as potent as the focus you devote to 
them. In addition, like other psychological treatments, they can induce 
transient negative impacts (Britton et al., 2021), with religious participants 
and females more immune to the unpleasant side effects. Therefore, to be 
successful, these practices need sufficient mental grounding and patience 
in the first place. Otherwise, they must be introduced slowly with greater 
awareness of thoughts and intentions. 
The type of meditation should be appropriate for our personality, 
life situation, and specific problems. Quote Meditation and Prayer are 
introduced below; many other spiritual relaxation methods can be found 
online. Nevertheless, it is feasible to invent our own personalized way.
An Outside Viewpoint: Meditation is a tool to eliminate the 
information-loaded viewpoint. Meditation emphasizes independence 

162 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
from the world and replaces self-centered, stressful states with emotional 
neutrality, equanimity, and wisdom. The privilege of observing the self 
as if from the outside creates distance for a broader perspective. How 
do emotions feel like? Noticing the physical manifestations of feelings, 
such as their pressure, expansion, or tightness, provides an empowering 
insight, allowing changing their meaning.
Change the Meaning by Reprogramming the Brain: Like a heat pump that 
can switch between cooling in summer and heating in winter, perceptions 
can fuel positive or negative motivation. While positive affirmations 
accumulate mental power, negative ones lose mental power, and their 
effects can reverberate through time into our present. How can we 
transform the adverse effects of past experiences? 
As shown in earlier chapters, beliefs update suddenly, discretely in 
the mind. A good example is riding a backward bicycle. On this type 
of bike, the front tire turns in the opposite direction of the handlebars, 
making it necessary to unlearn traditional riding. It takes several months 
of diligent practice to reprogram the neural and muscle programming 
within the brain. While the synaptic connections may modify slowly, the 
brain suddenly adapts to the skill of backward biking in an empowering 
moment. Therefore, we can leave the pain of the past behind if we 
methodically rewire our brains. In other words, to change the mind, we 
must reprogram the brain. 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a 
standard treatment for anxiety and depression. It entails invalidating, 
minimizing, or controlling unwanted thoughts. However, we have seen 
that emotions are energy states. The difficulty of thought suppression 
shows the impossibility of conscious control over our emotions. Therefore, 
changing the brain’s programming is necessary to update beliefs. It is based 
on the understanding that the observer mind can only hold one vision 
or conviction of any subject at any time. Like changing the vision of the 
Necker cube, adopting a new view forces us to abandon the faulty opinion 
simultaneously. After the belief changes, the emotions and thoughts 
necessarily follow.
Quote Meditation 
The transformative power of quote meditations lies in the consistent 
dedication to understanding and internalizing the wisdom within the quote. 
A quote distills a complex problem into its essential nugget with authority, 
and meditation internalizes its meaning. Like a water leak, starting as a drip 
but turning into a steady flow, the practice slowly turns into a sudden and 
discrete mental shift. At the moment of transformation, a sudden mental 

Success Boosters  163
expansion signals the switch to a new belief. Like learning the backward 
bicycle, significant changes require regular practice over weeks or even 
months that institutes a switch between two mental programs.
Nevertheless, positive effects are noticeable much sooner, as the 
training gradually renews and upgrades our belief system. The recurring 
practice attacks and weakens tightly held and restrictive thought patterns. 
Once the mind expands its perspective, it is impossible to reverse the old 
thinking. 
It’s crucial to choose an appropriate quote. Its meaning should express 
succinctly the truth of the desired belief. Excerpts from great thinkers can 
be found online and available for everyone. The practice consists of keeping 
both ideas in mind simultaneously with a steady focus—which supplies 
the energy for the synaptic reprogramming. A walk or other monotone 
solitary activity is conducive to cognitive juggling, which cements a 
commitment to the new meaning. If done diligently, an hour is sufficient 
to switch to the new belief. However, the change is only temporary; the 
regular practice should continue until the idea solidifies in the mind. 
Learning a demanding musical piece, a foreign language lesson, 
or doing arts and crafts projects inspires confidence and can lead to 
positive mental transformation. Therefore, equanimity is the natural and 
unintended side effect of technical mastery. 
Prayer 
Religious rituals and prayer have been a part of human existence for 
millennia. Although the self constantly changes, belief in a Higher Power 
can fulfill an innate need for permanence and meaning. Today, religion 
is often considered outdated because a personal appeal to a Higher 
Power in prayer can reinforce a weakness and abdicate responsibility. 
Nevertheless, the contemplative opening up to God, the universe, and 
each other incorporates us into the flow of creation, giving us confidence 
in its wisdom.
Consultation with an advisor, such as a priest, imam, or rabbi, can 
provide a higher perspective and is instrumental in motivation and 
transcendence. Prayer meditation can form steadfast beliefs in supporting 
goals and the betterment of the self. It builds inner strength by encouraging 
meaningful, honest efforts. These psychological changes are, perhaps, the 
most critical, elevating outcomes of prayer. Trust in a higher power creates 
a mindset unafraid to fail. 
Regular meditation or prayer increases satisfaction and joy.

Being Grateful
 “A grateful heart is a beginning of greatness. It is an expression 
of humility. It is a foundation for the development of such virtues as 
prayer, faith, courage, contentment, happiness, love, and well-being.” 
— James E. Faust
Social Connections: The strong association of gratitude with happiness 
gave birth to positive psychology. Belonging and feeling connected are 
fundamental human needs (Baumeister, 1995). Gratitude is the currency 
of appreciation granted only to optimistic and trustworthy people. The 
gesture costs nothing, yet its inspiring, encouraging message improves 
the social environment.76 For example, partners who took time to express 
gratitude in a relationship felt more positive toward the other person 
(Chang et al., 2022) and felt more comfortable expressing concerns about 
their relationship. While expressing gratitude can enhance relationships, 
authenticity is crucial (Algoe et al., 2016). People can discern genuine 
appreciation from mere flattery.
How we experience the good, the bad, and the ugly dictates our 
thoughts and behavior. Although stress is an unavoidable aspect of life, 
we can choose where we focus our attention. Therefore, gratitude is a 
choice, but it requires humbleness, the affirmation to eliminate pride. 
Perfection is not the goal; progress is. Like dormant seeds carrying the 
promise of harvest, subtle positive mental shifts will flower into visible 
achievements.
Gratitude Training: Those who engage in gratitude training or exercises 
report less distress, increased satisfaction, and a more profound sense of 
purpose in life. By bolstering self-confidence and emotional security, it 
reduces stress. For example, depressed patients expressing appreciation 
and meaning experienced significant long-term improvement. 
Positive Reframing: Studies have demonstrated the benefits of positive 
reframing. It fosters positive emotions such as joy, enthusiasm, love, and 
generosity, and improves physical health, including immune function. 
A strong correlation exists between the absence of negativity and good 
mental health, such as sleep quality and overall well-being. Shedding 
emotional baggage allows one to adopt a lighter disposition that improves 
social aptitude.77 Compassion allows one to acknowledge the difficulties 
of others, and altruism compels one to help. 
76	 Lenz’s Law in psychology shows that building a positive environment acts back inspiring 
in positive motivations in us.
77	 Social aptitude is the ability to relate to others on an emotional level. Children and 
adolescents with low social aptitude scores are at increased risk of mental health problems.

Success Boosters  165
Interconnectedness of Life: Gratitude underscores the fundamental 
interdependence and interconnectedness of life. The world unfailingly 
mirrors our degree of decency.
Gratitude helps set aside egoistic tendencies, paving the way for 
deeper, more meaningful relationships, improving mental and physical 
health, and promoting longevity.
Ambition: The Art of Leadership 
“A leader will find it difficult to articulate a coherent vision unless it 
expresses his core values, his basic identity ... one must first embark on 
the formidable journey of self-discovery in order to create a vision with 
authentic soul.” — Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
Ambition involves selecting challenges and setting higher goals. It’s about 
having a long-term vision and the audacity to pursue it. The journey of 
achieving goals fosters self-confidence and growth. Like gradually moving 
up the mountain, every solved problem improves our confidence in our 
abilities. Because our attention follows our focus, positive expectations 
encourage better performance, learning, and creativity. Intrinsic 
motivation and ambition are essential in personality development and 
wellness throughout one’s lifespan.
Ambition and Leadership: These two qualities are interlinked. While 
purpose fuels the desire, leadership provides the framework for achieving 
those desires. It is essential not just for a chief executive officer (CEO); 
from corporate positions to personal relationships, leadership can unlock 
individual talent, social dynamism, and enthusiasm.
Team Building
Self-centered leaders trigger defensiveness and discord, but collective 
ownership depends on collaboration. Exceptional leaders stimulate 
achievement through motivation rather than manipulation. They respect 
their colleagues and subordinates. They view learning opportunities as 
honest mistakes, inspiring loyalty, confidence, and openness. Associates 
who feel respected can walk through fire for their leaders. 
In any business, a team is only as good as its people and as strong 
as its weakest link. Therefore, helping and mentoring others formulate 
shared responsibility, motivating productive participation. 
Visualization: The most motivated and confident competitor generally 
wins the Olympic gold medal. A winning mindset does not materialize 
from thin air. It grows by living in the future of the problem. Immersing 
in a goal allows one to anticipate challenges and plan solutions.

166 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Female Leadership
Women like Mary Curie78 and Emmy Noether79 rose to the top of their 
professions in male-dominated fields. Nevertheless, until recently, many 
professional fields remained closed to women. Policy measures to balance 
the scales, such as gender quotas and blind auditions,80 have produced 
varied results. Nevertheless, these initiatives have brought the problem 
into the public consciousness. 
One result of our traditional outlook is that men generally command 
more respect from both sexes. Some reasons for this are biological. Men 
are taller and typically have lower-frequency voices, which represents 
greater power. Although the female voice has deepened over the past 
decades, women’s increasing social, corporate, and political influence 
reflects more fundamental factors. For example, emotional intelligence 
(a more feminine trait) inspires openness, trust, and consensus-building in 
the corporate environment. A diverse leadership representing every color 
of the human experience is better equipped to navigate the accelerating 
social and technological progress. 
Ultimately, leadership is about believing in one’s capability to drive 
progress and inspire others to join in that journey.
Creativity
“The principal mark of genius is not perfection but originality, the 
opening of new frontiers.” — Arthur Koestler
Creativity is the fuel of achievement. Here, we follow the theoretical basis 
of this essential skill in Chapter Four. Creativity always appears to arise 
as a random event that cannot be planned. However, we can take practical 
steps to improve and cultivate this essential skill. 
As earlier sections have shown, mental house cleaning is an 
emotionally demanding and meticulous task that very often immediately 
frees mental space for creative ideas. Do not get discouraged if you find 
unworkable, faulty ideas; if you are persistent and optimistic, innovative 
solutions will visit you.

Six Steps to Nurture Creativity
1. Understanding the Problem
Problems can present confusing details or contradictions that make 
understanding appear hopeless. “If you can’t explain something in 
simple terms, you don’t understand it,” said Richard Feynman. Without 
identifying the crux of the problem, a solution can remain impossible. 
Sometimes, phrasing a problem in a question form can uncover a hidden 
connection, making a solution possible. Thinking outside the box, using 
an interdisciplinary approach, is often more productive than detailed 
knowledge. A cross-pollination of disciplines has been the source of 
remarkable accomplishments in art, music, science, and engineering. 
2. Finding the Starting Point
Creativity is not a linear process with a convenient recipe that one can 
follow. Complex problems can be overwhelming. Sometimes, dissecting 
them into manageable parts offers a convenient starting point toward a 
solution. Occasionally, better insight is found by stepping back to gain a 
broader perspective. Other times, it is necessary to dig deep into the roots 
of the challenge, taking systematic steps. 
3. Being Immersed in the Problem
An unwavering commitment to the problem frees one from petty conflicts, 
allowing an essential insight. Creativity flourishes even in challenging 
and stressful situations. For example, financial and personal difficulties 
did not quench the imagination of Mozart and Einstein. Similarly, mental 
genius is not exclusive to Einstein or Mozart but everyone with a genuine 
ambition and enthusiastic desire toward a goal.
4. Keeping a Light Disposition
Children are uninhibited in their creative drive, but the freedom of endless 
playful investigations also benefits adults. Playing has been shown to 
release endorphins, improve brain functionality, and stimulate creativity 
(Trezza et al., 2010). Eliminating social pressure and criticism creates a 
relaxed environment where playful creativity and imagination flourish. 
5. Collecting the Unedited Thoughts
Once the ideas flow, their originality must be preserved. Ideas result from 
the brain wave-like quantum operation, making them fleeting, which may 

168 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
never recur. In addition, short-term memory has enormous energy needs 
that can tie down the imagination. A journal at the bedside, in the car, or 
in the purse permits one to write down or sketch ideas as they occur. Even 
small thought snippets can accumulate into an interconnected whole with 
originality and direction. We will discuss note-taking in the next section. 
6. Following Up on the Idea
The non-linear fluctuations of mental time alternate between stressful 
pressure and expanding insight. In addition, insights are only as good 
as the diligent, persistent work that follows them. Ideas demand action 
for fruition. The time to work out the initial inspiration into detailed and 
wholesome creations can be substantial. 
Because creativity is not a straightforward process, success requires 
perseverance in refining and realizing the concept. Therefore, success 
often come not the most brilliant creators, but those who never give up. 
They prevail by learning from mistakes and failures.
Take Notes 
“Note-taking is important to me: a week’s worth of reading notes (or 
‘thoughts I had in the shower’ notes) is cumulatively more interesting 
than anything I might be able to come up with on a single given day.” 
— Teju Cole
Working memory is fundamental to everyday function as the foundation 
of complex behavior, reasoning, and planning. The high energy needs of 
working memory limit its information capacity and temporal range. There 
are numerous advantages to note-taking.
Memory Augmentation: Note-taking effectively acts as an external extension 
of our working memory. By jotting down important points, we can ensure 
that we can revisit and refresh information anytime.
Enhanced Comprehension: Actively taking notes requires processing and 
understanding the information, which can uncover gaps in our knowledge 
and deepen comprehension.
Focus: Writing can make one more present during lectures or meetings, 
potentiating focus and reducing the chances of getting distracted. 
Summarizing ideas into a concise record guarantees better retention 
of the information and organizes mental clutter into a crystallized,  
complete story. 
The real fun is in reading the notes later. Periodically reviewing our 
writing helps to connect related ideas. Gradually improving the outline of 

Success Boosters  169
the material will generate organization and mental brilliance. There are 
several popular methods used today. 	
1.	 The Cornell Method: It allows the visual organization of the material.
This structured method encourages active recall and review, helping
understand and retain.	
2.	 The Outlining Method: It is hierarchical, making it easy to discern
main ideas from sub-points. This method can be especially beneficial
for linear thinkers or those who prefer a step-by-step breakdown of
information.	
3.	 The Mapping Method: Visual learners might find this method
particularly appealing. By seeing how ideas interconnect, one can get
a clearer picture of the subject matter.
Incorporating Technology: While traditional pencil and paper have their 
charm and effectiveness, the digital age offers a plethora of tools that can 
enhance the note-taking experience:
Digital Note-taking Tools: Apps like Notion, Roam Research, and Obsidian 
have become increasingly popular due to their ability to link different 
ideas and notes, creating interconnected information.
Voice Notes: For those who might find it cumbersome to write or type, voice 
notes can be a handy tool. Speaking out loud can also reinforce memory.
Digital Stylus and Tablets: Tools like the Apple Pencil with the iPad or the 
Surface Pen with Microsoft’s Surface devices combine the tactile feeling of 
writing with the advantages of digital storage and organization.
Like taking photographs on your vacation, note-taking helps you 
remember. Therefore, note-taking isn’t just a passive act; it’s a dynamic 
process that aids in understanding, memory retention, and knowledge 
application. Developing an effective note-taking habit can prove 
invaluable.
The Need for Renewal 
“Predictability can lead to failure.” — T. Boone Pickens
After the barren winter, spring brings new life and growth. The changing 
seasons are perhaps the most poetic representation of renewal. This 
cyclical process is a constant reminder of the impermanence of phases and 
the inevitable renewal.

170 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Personal Renewal: It’s about bouncing back from setbacks and overcoming 
challenges. Change is the currency of the future. Adapting to change and 
learning from experiences are hallmarks of personal renewal.
Renewal can also manifest in personal well-being. Environmental 
changes, such as moving to a new house, city, or country, inspire fresh 
perspectives. Nevertheless, activities like meditation, physical exercise, or 
even a change in diet can rejuvenate the mind and body. For example, 
self-improvement books, videos, audio, or seminars almost always spur 
some degree of mental progress. If utilized with sincerity, any new 
interest, habit, psychological intervention, or practice provides a mental 
slowing down, resulting in openness and renewal.
Societal and Economic Renewal
Innovation: In the business world, renewal often comes in the form of 
innovation. Large firms usually protect their successful product line by 
suppressing upcoming companies. However, the companies that stand 
the test of time are the ones that continually evolve, innovate and adapt.
Reformation: In societal and governmental contexts, renewal often takes 
the form of reforms. The power of lobbyists, political donors, and party 
polarization is inversely proportional to social progress. Societies and 
nations must constantly reassess and reform their systems and structures 
to ensure justice, equity, and progress.
The Role of Failure
Learning Opportunities: Every setback is a setup for a comeback. Failures 
offer unparalleled learning experiences. The most successful individuals 
and companies have often faced significant disappointments before 
achieving success.
Pivoting: Failure, which teaches respect for the problem’s difficulty, is the 
best argument to start over. From Plato to Martin Luther King Jr., history’s 
greatest thinkers appreciated the importance of forming a new beginning. 
In essence, renewal isn’t just about starting fresh but also about 
embracing the journey of growth and evolution. Whether in personal 
life, business, or society, periods of renewal are necessary for progress 
and prosperity. Embracing this concept in thought and action can lead to 
unparalleled growth and development.

The Menace of Multitasking
“Multitasking the art of doing twice as much as you should half as well 
as you could. — Anonymous
Our modern existence depends on constant engagement with technology 
and information flow. Our jobs, schools, and communities encourage 
us to take on more than we can comfortably handle. Busyness became a 
modern-day status symbol, an area where we can outdo others and prove 
our importance. Multitasking offers a seemingly brilliant solution to 
accomplish several objectives simultaneously. However, our brains aren’t 
wired for simultaneous attention on multiple tasks. 
Pitfalls of Multitasking
Reduced Productivity: While multitasking gives an illusion of efficiency, 
it reduces productivity. Shifting focus between tasks can result in a 
40% reduction in productivity, according to some research (Rubinstein  
et al., 2001).
Memory Impairment: Multitasking can hamper transferring information 
from short-term to long-term memory, making it harder to retain and 
recall information.
Increased Stress: Dividing attention between several tasks hinders  
problem-solving and increases difficulty tuning out distractions (Janet  
et al., 2020). At the same time, we often miss meaningful signals from our 
immediate environment. Therefore, while registering distractions, we 
might miss important information. This can result in heightened stress 
levels as the brain releases more cortisol, a stress hormone.
Loss of Quality: When attention is divided, the quality of work often 
suffers. Full attention can only flow toward one subject at any time. Errors 
are more likely to occur when multitasking than concentrating on a single 
task. Shoving more things into the same time slot impairs concentration, 
particularly for long-term multitaskers. 
In a world that’s always buzzing, there’s a counter-cultural but 
essential need to sometimes step back and single-task. By doing less, 
paradoxically, we often achieve more. The quality of our work improves, 
and our mental well-being benefits from this focused approach to tasks.
Benefits of Focused Attention
Deep Work: We lose concentration, and performance declines when 
working on any task for a long time. As coined by Cal Newport, “deep 

172 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
work” refers to periods of intense concentration without distractions. 
These periods allow for higher-quality outputs in less time.
Enhanced Creativity: Focused attention allows the brain to think deeply and 
make connections that might not be evident in a scattered mental state.
Improved Mental Well-being: Mindfulness, the act of being fully present in 
the moment, is tied to focused attention. Slowing down, switching back 
and forth between errands, and taking brief breaks to deactivate and 
reactivate focus can refresh awareness. Mindfulness can reduce stress, 
increase happiness, and improve overall mental health.
Efficient Learning: Concentrating on one topic at a time allows for more 
efficient learning and better comprehension.
Fostering Focused Attention: Allocating specific blocks of time to individual 
tasks. This ensures dedicated attention without the temptation to juggle. 
Meditation practices can help improve focus and reduce the impulse 
to constantly switch tasks. Prioritizing tasks based on importance and 
deadlines allows tackling the most critical chores during peak focus and 
mental energy periods.
Using Technology 
“Stimulation of brain pleasure centers can eliminate feelings of rage, 
fear, and depression.” — James W. Prescott
The advancement of technologies, at the intersection between technology 
and cognitive, psychological, and behavioral growth, holds tremendous 
promise for enhancing human capacities and treating disorders. Two 
areas are up-and-coming for personal development and psychological 
improvement. 
Brain Stimulation in Healthy Subjects: Brain stimulation can safely and 
effectively enhance mood and boost normal brain function in healthy 
subjects by changing or even inducing synapses. The process can increase 
creativity and endurance. 
Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is essential in memory consolidation. Electric 
stimulation during slow-wave sleep potentiates synapses and improves 
cognitive performance and memory. Brain modulation technology, 
such as home-administered and remotely supervised protocol, can 
artificially create or cancel memories and open new, noninvasive 
avenues to treat mental disorders, depression, PTSD, and others. Similar 
brain augmentation methods can boost learning and achieve telepathy 
(brain-to-brain communication). A better theoretical understanding of

brain stimulation’s long-term effectiveness and side effects will ensure its 
broader utility. 
Using AI for Life Coaching: AI can potentially revolutionize how we 
approach personal development. With vast data and the ability to analyze 
individual preferences and needs,  AI can tailor self-improvement for 
physical fitness, cognitive training, and social functioning.  The AI life 
coaching revolution can reach more people, particularly those who could 
not afford life coaching services due to cost or location, and they are 
available 24/7. For example, AI life coaches can help identify patterns and 
triggers contributing to mental health issues and provide personalized 
strategies and support for individuals to overcome challenges and 
improve mental well-being.
Ethical Considerations: Nevertheless, there are important ethical 
considerations. Brain-computer interfaces and AI life coaching could pose 
significant privacy risks due to their intimate access to personal data. 
There are also questions on the nature of technology to change or improve 
human performance. How much should we modify or enhance our 
abilities? Where do we draw the line between therapy and enhancement? 
How will access to these technologies influence social inequalities?
Future Directions
Tailored Education: Brain-computer interfaces81 (BCIs) and virtual reality82 
(VR) could revolutionize education, offering highly personalized learning 
experiences based on individual neurocognitive profiles.
Emotion Regulation: Future interventions might allow users to regulate 
their emotional states better, combating issues like anxiety or depression 
more effectively.
Cognitive Augmentation: As we understand the brain’s workings better, 
there may be opportunities to augment our mental capacities, making us 
better thinkers, learners, and creators.
Enhanced Interpersonal Communication: In the future, BCIs may enable 
more profound forms of communication where thoughts and feelings can 
be shared directly.
81	 A brain-computer interface or brain-machine interface is a direct communication pathway 
between the brain’s electrical activity and an external device, which allows people to 
control machines using their thoughts. These interfaces can help people with disabilities 
as well as enhance human-computer interactions.
82	 Virtual reality uses an audio-visual headset in 3D virtual reality.

Challenges
Safety: Any invasive procedure, like brain implants, comes with risks. As 
these technologies develop, ensuring they’re safe will be paramount.
Misuse: There’s potential for abuse, especially in areas like memory 
manipulation. How do we ensure these technologies are used ethically?
Dependency: Could there be an over-reliance on AI for life coaching or 
BCIs for cognitive tasks? What happens if these technologies fail or are 
unavailable?
The fusion of technology and neuroscience offers a tantalizing 
glimpse into a future where human capabilities might be significantly 
enhanced. With the evolution of these powerful tools, society will need to 
balance the potential benefits with the associated risks, ensuring that these 
advancements serve humanity’s interests. 
Shoot from the Hip!
“Action is the real measure of intelligence.” — Napoleon Hill 
Absolutely! It’s essential to acknowledge the danger of venturing into the 
unknown. The fear of failure and even the risk of success can hold us back. 
However, embracing challenges and facing them head-on paves the way 
for growth and innovation.
Negativity and self-doubt can cripple our ability to progress. In the 
face of adversity, it’s easy to craft excuses for holding back, which leads 
to a cycle of avoidance and stagnation. This mindset leads to seeking  
short-term comforts and distractions, which might feel good but do not 
bring lasting fulfillment or growth.
Keeping a Balance: Although people are different in temperament, 
psychological make-up, and life approaches, we are universal in our 
vulnerabilities and hopes. Blunders can supply a more advanced 
understanding, nurturing confidence and courage. True success is not 
just about crossing the finish line but about the grit, determination, and 
spirit we show. It’s about lighting and keeping that inner fire burning, no 
matter the odds. Confidence to take charge and seize the moment comes 
from honest, thorough preparation. So, when challenges arise, we can face 
them with courage. We must be able to fire.

The Power of Love
“We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.” — Goethe
Trust and love are universal themes that have permeated human culture, 
thought, and behavior since immemorial. Trusting others and the future 
leads to generosity, honesty, and cooperation. Trust is the currency of genuine 
human interaction. Although trust opens us to potential pain and betrayal, 
it can lead to deeper bonds, understanding, and cooperation. This element 
of vulnerability also offers a sense of freedom to live fully. Without love, the 
intellect cannot flourish.
Love’s manifestations range from the nurturing love between a parent 
and child to the romantic love between partners and even the love one feels 
for one’s ideals, God, or a higher purpose. Indeed, religion often serves as 
a guidepost for our moral compass. Although it requires no money or 
position, faith is a powerful social capital. It allows tenacity and patience 
when success (as it often happens in real life) is delayed. 
Forming Love: Love originates in trust and self-respect, the source of 
generosity. This expanding nature engenders a shared attitude, the 
unity of two exposed, vulnerable hearts, defying the Pauli principle. St 
Augustine’s words “love and do as you will” capture its elevating power. 
Love in literature, from folktales to contemporary cinema, memorializes 
its ability to transform and inspire a moral upper ground. Still, every lover 
discovers love anew—making it as individualistic as snowflakes. 
Mating creates oneness, inspiring the caring for the young in 
emotional animals. In its higher form, romantic love enables the formation 
of families, where love can grow during our thoroughly dependent 
earliest years. The failure to develop this trusting love in childhood causes 
a devastating estrangement from the self. However, the adult heart can 
develop devotion through a steadfast commitment to love. The fidelity 
to a person, God, or a high ideal fortifies our trust and replaces weakness 
and insecurity with love. 
Influencing Others: Love and trust also play a pivotal role in influencing 
others. Leaders like Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi exemplified 
how love and trust could break barriers, unite divided communities, and 
inspire transformative change. Their actions were steeped in love and 
trust, not just in their followers but also in their ideals and the inherent 
goodness of humanity.
On the other hand, intimidation and fear might achieve immediate 
compliance, but they lack the endurance and depth of trust. Authentic 
leadership and genuine influence stem from a place of love, understanding, 
and trust.

176 Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Lastly, as societies evolve and traditional family structures change, 
genuine human connection’s importance becomes ever more critical. 
Investing time and effort into nurturing relationships and fostering a 
positive social environment is indispensable for holistic well-being. 
To truly live and find meaning, one must heed the heart’s calling, for 
without love and trust, existence is devoid of depth and purpose.

Conclusions
“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can 
change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”
— Margaret Mead
Humanity fought and won in the struggle for dominance against the 
largest, most dangerous animals. Our unique role gives us exclusive 
responsibilities. We have control over every other species and the whole 
ecosystem. We have made animals disappear and now may bring them 
back from extinction. Not the fight, but victory teaches us humility and 
appreciation. The poor’s welfare and the whole biosphere’s fate are 
interconnected.
In India, colonial rule was not defeated by military might but by 
public opinion. Newspaper articles, which detailed the brutalities of the 
British army, made colonial rule exceedingly unappealing. The disparities 
in education and health outcomes resulting from inequality are morally 
untenable. Contribution to technological and social development requires 
openness and honesty. 
Positive psychological states orient us toward the future, growth, 
creativity, and joy. These feelings are in line with the expanding universe. 
Negative sentiments like anger are painful because they contradict the 
universe’s momentum. The mental map on these pages lets you replace 
insecurity with confidence and wisdom. Serving your mind with all your 
heart and energy gives you a home turf advantage. Your future is in your 
hands; if you know how the physical world works, you know how the 
mind works. Applying just some of the information in this book will put 
you ahead of the curve. 
Life is like a trip. If you do not enjoy the scenery, you waste your time. 
As individuals, our bodies have distinct requirements and abilities. 
We can reach our full potential by honoring and supporting these needs 
and talents. We should treat ourselves as our most valuable possessions.

Epilogue 
“To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you 
something else is the greatest accomplishment.”
— Ralph Waldo Emerson
Religion, the traditional foundation of morality, defines right and wrong 
by the rules set by God. Evidence indicates the beneficial effects of religion 
in nearly every aspect of social concern and policy. Yet, the tradition, if not 
the belief in a higher power, is losing social importance. The satisfied body 
does not seem to think about the soul. Religion, the moral center of human 
existence for tens of thousands of years, is becoming secondary to science, 
the supreme authority over knowledge. Yet, science cannot provide moral 
guidance, leaving people scrambling to find their motivation. The results 
have been an epidemic of social alienation and mental diseases. 
The ideas presented herein allow you to observe life (including your 
own) with greater insight and wisdom. The most surprising message is the 
vast interconnectedness of existence. Matter, mind, and the universe form 
a unified system where everything touches everything else. Depending 
on your personal beliefs, you reflect a Higher Power or the Universe, the 
cosmos’ creative intellect. Wisdom is recognizing, understanding, and 
respecting our mutual inspirations shared by the faithful, atheists, and 
agnostics.
Elementary school provides primary skills, such as arithmetic and 
reading, but does not prepare students for social functioning. As corrupted 
global positioning system (GPS) misleads direction, inappropriate 
motivation leads to failures and mental disease. The prevalence of social 
ills indicates a gap in our understanding of emotions and social skills. 
In achievement, there is no free lunch. The mind projects its thoughts, 
experiences, and actions forward to dictate what we can and cannot 
accomplish. Understanding emotional regulation provides confidence 
and perseverance for achievement. 

Epilogue   179
Progress and innovation require a fluidity of intellect. Emotions 
influence every aspect of life every day. They affect how a police officer 
responds to crime, how companies find balance in serving shareholders 
and customers, and how teachers interact with students and politicians 
with their constituents. 
Technology, arts, and music advance by the brightest and most 
advanced minds, but social explosions stem from desperation and 
disadvantage. In a fractured, increasingly unequal world, we cannot 
isolate ourselves from terrorism and environmental dangers. Global 
communication brings local wars, religious persecution, and economic 
hopelessness into the collective consciousness. 
The ease of travel and interconnectedness of commerce, social, and 
cultural institutions increase the possibility of global epidemics, refugee 
crises, and terrorism. The refugee influx from distant lands contributes to 
social tension. Temporary fixes cannot possibly stem the expansive and 
desperate tide. We must address the origin of the oppressive and stagnant 
conditions in the developing world.
In the traditional view, success transpires at the detriment of others. 
The achievement and prosperity advocated in this book benefit the whole 
community. We are the children of the universe. When we embrace our 
common origin, wealth creation becomes part of collective responsibility. 
Exceptional achievements require honesty, trust, and a high moral code. 
These character traits are also preferable for the common good. Thus, 
individual and social interests center on the same premise. 
How do we create a genuinely democratic society? Providing people 
confidence in their social worth cultivates decency and socially productive 
behavior. A humane world allows everyone to contribute productively 
to the common good. I believe that every person has an innate need for 
belonging, including the need to contribute. 
The security against disasters caused by disease and economic 
misfortunes elevates people and transforms society. Mental diseases 
and addictions are often the long-term consequences of insecurity. A 
cooperative and humane society requires basic human security. Because 
successful people lift the world, abundance, and success should be a 
human right and a destiny. 
Instead of prescribing rigid rules, this book gives you understanding 
and a higher vision. Its inspiration urges you to better your work and 
private life. Today, the internet influences every aspect of entertainment, 
business, learning, and relationships. The internet’s democratized access 
to information can inspire better decisions, from consumer choices to 
social media and elections. Access to different perspectives allows us to 
learn new skills and develop social grace. 
Before long, new, renewable energy sources might offer inexpensive 
or free energy. Automatization can expand production based on needs,

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
providing people affordable housing, transportation, and goods. In a 
decentralized economy, individuals profit directly, exerting personal 
control and freedom. To take advantage of our new, expanded 
opportunities requires a high moral code of behavior. 
We are part of a coherent cosmic reality in which everything 
touches everything else. Increasing trust in our social institutions and 
each other decreases social distance and increases democratic freedom. 
Comprehending our sophisticated surroundings requires the flexibility 
to adapt to change. Thus, technological advancement parallels increasing 
intellectual abstraction and the ability to maneuver highly complex 
environments. 
Our globe is the only boat available to the future, and we all have a 
valid ticket for the journey. As the Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated, 
we cannot save ourselves without saving our global brotherhood. 
Increasing integration and interdependence of humanity, built on 
trust, inspire hope, which glues humanity into one giant community 
motivated by cooperation (Tkadlec et al., 2020), the singleton hypothesis 
(Bostrom, 2006).
Governments should be concerned for the common good and human 
flourishing in all areas of life. Because political leaders reflect their 
electorate, citizens are enormously responsible for this anticipated and 
necessary climactic transformation. Providing social safety for everyone 
starts shifting behavior toward social collaboration and generosity.
The highest achievement of our civilization is a web of trust in society.
To The Reader
Thank you for choosing this book for your self-betterment. It laid down a 
new science with the power to transform our world. Confidence in your 
abilities provides optimism about the future and makes cheating and 
ruthless competition pointless. Trust inspires cooperation and generosity, 
which can become primary motivations for human interaction. In a secure 
society, protecting the environment becomes natural and second nature. 
I introduced a new science of consciousness and emotions. Brain 
organization and intellect are an organic and inalienable part of the 
universe. Our continuously shifting life experiences vary, like the surface 
of the ocean. A sense of expansion feels like the top of the world. In contrast, 
a sinking, tightening feeling is a sense of insignificance. Maintaining a 
constant motivation, free of the rises and abates of those emotional tides, 
is wisdom. 
The elegant summary of this book: only mental progress gives you 
meaningful, lasting fulfillment. Positive psychological states help us orient 
toward the future, mental expansion, creativity, and joy. Negative 

Epilogue   181
sentiments, which orient us toward the past, such as anger, are painful. 
The mental map on these pages about feelings lets you replace insecurity 
with confidence and wisdom. 
As individuals, we are vulnerable to cheating, terrorism, and 
dictatorial leaders. We must actively work for a better social existence.

Afterword
“Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.”
— Ralph Waldo Emerson
My journey began with a failing marriage and severe health issues. I could 
hardly walk or move at times due to excruciating back pain. Digestive 
problems and low self-esteem contributed to my anxiety. Although  
I did not know it, my life spiraled out of control. My husband was also 
struggling. His bold attempt at forming a biotech company was highly 
challenging. On occasion, he unleashed his frustration on his family. 
I felt alone and helpless. My personal life turned into a tunnel, wrapped in 
darkness, with no way out. 
In earlier times, I regularly visited the library with my children. As their 
independence blossomed, their need for my assistance diminished. The 
library became my refuge. I sought solace in books about the self, 
relationships, and meaning. Learning about human behavior alleviated 
the fog I was living under. I began to observe my husband’s struggles 
in a broader context. I recognized the need to hold onto others is analog 
to the hold of gravity. Investigating this possible connection spurred my 
studies in theoretical physics, neuroscience, psychology, and evolution. 
Those studies confirmed my intuition of the similarities between the 
organization of the physical world and the mind. My science background 
helped to formalize my research into a novel hypothesis. 
Six years of solitary work resulted in my 2015 book, The Science of 
Consciousness. The work introduces a consciousness hypothesis centering 
on emotions. It establishes the physical basis of intellect, promising to turn 
psychology and social sciences more predictable. Considering the mind 
as a physical system reveals the energy nature of emotions. The fermionic

mind hypothesis serves as the basis of this volume. Do not let the name 
confound you. This is twenty-first-century science. 
Future Prospects 
 “The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old 
ones.” — John Maynard Keynes 
I grew up in a religious household where God was supposed to know 
and observe everything. As a child, I wondered how God could know 
everything in the past, present, and future. This contrasted with free will 
because I could not decide to change my mind without God knowing 
it. The argument presented herein shows that our options relate to how 
stimulus distorts the brain’s energy balance. The meaning of the stimulus 
determines the size of the energy change of interaction. However, we 
can choose the direction of energy, whether it triggers endothermic or 
exothermic processes. 
The powerful has a vested interest in keeping the status quo. 
Nevertheless, the effort to keep back the tides of history is bound to fail. 
The incoming AI revolution will provide tools to everybody to have a 
personal assistant, housemaid, or repair technician. However, suppose 
our free time only increases the hours spent on television and other 
empty entertainment. In that case, these changes will only generate 
more suffering. A mental revolution is necessary and inevitable. Greater 
intellectual awareness will lead to demands for democratization and 
social transformation. 
Assuming that we all share the same space and are ‘one’, universal 
spiritual connectedness inspires people to contribute to society according 
to their abilities. 
I firmly believe that we will manage the necessary changes peacefully. 
Plato lived in a time when memorization gave great orators the 
skill to mesmerize and convince their audience. Plato lamented that 
the development of writing might make remembering unnecessary, a 
detrimental transformation degrading human intellectual abilities.
Today, we grapple with a similar transformation. The ease of looking 
up information on anything at any time makes it increasingly unnecessary 
to remember facts, the purview of scholars and experts. Today, 
increasingly, imagination, not factual knowledge matters. This might 
usher in a new era where originality will be valued more than knowledge. 
According to Einstein’s prescient words, “Imagination is more important 
than knowledge.” Perhaps, finding relevant information in seconds will 
liberate human intellect, allowing everyone to plan, discover, and create. 
AI can become the great social equalizer, because anyone with 
internet access can plan, discover, and create. These abilities, in the wrong 

184 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
hands, can become terrifyingly dangerous. For that reason, learning about 
emotional regulation is more important than ever. I believe that people 
can change, and we can make it happen with the right tools. This book 
contains the tools for such fundamental global transformation. 
Darwin’s idea of evolution was so shocking that he waited twenty 
years to present it to the broad community. Although Darwinian evolution 
became a fundamental principle of biology, it also raised questions about 
evolution’s tendency toward complexity. This book shows the common 
operational principles of physical and biological systems, evolution, 
psychology, and social sciences. We formulate emotional separation 
from our loved ones or neighbors based on physical distance. The 
fermionic mind hypothesis posits unexpected connections supported by   
well-respected studies. 
The FMH is the first hypothesis offering a physical basis for motivation 
and human behavior. It is also the first overarching idea encompassing 
physics, the mind, and evolution. The universe is made up of orthogonal 
spatial and temporal energies. The existence of the particle organization on 
three different levels of the universe (the material fermion, the emotional 
fermion, and the universe) explains power-law distributions in geology, 
physics, population dynamics, biology, sociology, and other fields. 
FMH supports humanity’s intuition throughout the ages and 
cultures about an underlying unity of all existence. In agreement with 
the Aristotelian physical worldview, physical reality abhors a vacuum. 
Matter and the universe have symmetric energy structures. Still, the mind 
is positioned between matter and the universe, with characteristics of 
both. The negative attitude mind is entirely directed by the environment 
(making it matter-like). Only the positive attitude mind has free will 
(making it God-like). However, the positive attitude has no incentive 
or motivation to change. The idea that evolution, including social 
development, is guided toward complexity and order suggests a shining 
future for the cosmos’ intelligent occupants, including mankind. 
Some of the expressions you find in this book: 
Anxiety: Anxiety is the emotional state of not having options. 
Consciousness: Consciousness is the awareness of being a separate entity 
within the environment. 
Emotions: Emotions (sentiment or feeling) are the brain’s energy 
states that trigger appropriate behavior to recover the energy-neutral  
resting state. 
Emotional Gravity: Emotional gravity (temporal gravity) is the strength 
of attachments toward people and things. 

Afterword  185
Emotional or Social Temperature: Emotional temperature is the social 
equivalent of temperature in physics. As particle collisions form 
temperature, brain frequencies determine free will. 
Emotional Distance: Emotional distance is the degree of trust. Sizeable 
emotional separation spares one from attitude effects (emotional 
magnetism, such as the Pauli exclusion principle). We form conceptual 
distance to abstract entities, whereas emotional distance characterizes 
relationships.
Festinger’s Cognitive Dissonance Theory: Conflicting attitudes, beliefs, or 
behavior produces a feeling of mental discomfort, leading to an alteration 
in one’s opinions or actions to restore balance.
Interaction: Mental interaction is energy/information exchange with 
the environment via stimuli. The resulting synaptic changes modify the 
brain’s energy state. In this way, the brain participates in the environment’s 
energy cycle. 
Intellect: Intellect is the ability to comprehend the environment with 
foresight. Abstraction is the ability to maneuver highly complex 
environments. 
Intelligent Systems: Intelligent systems are aware of their past and use 
them to solve problems and utilize energy efficiently. Engaging with the 
surroundings in flexible ways increases opportunities in the future. 
Mental Energy: Mental energy is an abstract mental quality that permits 
happiness, confidence, focus, motivation, and productivity. It is a 
necessary ingredient of achievement.
Mental freedom is the ability to act uninhibited. Freedom correlates 
with survival needs in biological systems, such as air, food, or water. 
For example, a good lunch increases liberty, testifying about the time-
dependence of life. 
Psychological Lensing: Psychological lensing generates two different 
answers about the same event.
Social Energy: Social energy is a special form of motivation boosting 
decision-making. 
Stress: Temporal pressure resulting from positive temporal curvature.
Temporal: Temporal concerns time.
Temporal Field: The social environment represents the local curvature of 
the temporal field. Therefore, it determines the perception of time.

186 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Temporal curvature (field strength) corresponds to information-
loaded, automatic thinking patterns. 
Temporal Gravity: Temporal gravity shows a close correlation with  
social status. 
The Temporal Landscape: The willingness for interaction depends on the 
energy state of synaptic connections, which reflect the individual’s history. 
Our behavior correlates with our mental state because our memories 
form a topological surface that influences the neuronal activation path’s 
trajectory. 
Temporal Pressure (Stress): Decreasing the volume of gases increases 
particle collisions and temperature. In biological systems, the dependence 
on physiological needs determines our welfare. The shortage of air, 
water, food, and money increases alertness for survival. The stressful, 
heightened mental state can trigger desperate, dangerous, risky, or even 
lawless actions. 
Uncertainty: Uncertainty is having several possible alternative 
explanations for personal histories. Uncertain individuals cannot tolerate 
uncertainty in the environment.
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): In CBT, the so-called ABC 
Technique of Irrational Beliefs is used. In life, there can be an activating 
event (A) or situation that triggers a negative thought based on beliefs 
(B) in a patient, which then evokes an emotional response in the patient. 
The patient then acts on these thoughts and emotions, which result in a 
consequence (C).
The therapist will help the patient interpret the event, showing that 
his/her interpretation is incorrect. 

Appendix
This book introduces an innovative theory of consciousness known as 
the “fermionic mind hypothesis.” It presents numerous compelling 
examples that validate this theory in individual and social behavior 
and highlights the growing significance of quantum cognition across 
various fields, including language, decision-making, memory, reasoning, 
judgment, perception, social sciences, and economics. Scientific literature 
has demonstrated and confirmed several predictions in my 2015 book, 
“The Science of Consciousness.” For example, the physical foundation 
of sentiment contagion led to a detailed understanding based on fluid 
dynamics. Moreover, many more instances of validation can emerge in 
the future. 
In the following, the fermionic mind hypothesis is pitted against 
the physical characteristics of fermions using category theory from 
abstract mathematics. Category theory, which studies structures and 
the relationships between them, offers a panoramic perspective that 
can demystify connections between diverse disciplines, including 
neuroscience, psychology, general relativity, quantum theory, and 
mathematics (Anderson, 2021; Ehresmann and Gómez-Ramírez, 2015; 
Phillips, 2022). As a result, similarities or equivalence between fermions 
and consciousness become discernible. 
At the core of category theory lays the Yoneda lemma, postulating 
that an object’s nature can be fully apprehended by scrutinizing its 
relationships and interactions with other entities (Tsuchiya and Saigo, 
2021). This lemma enables equivalence between objects A and B, up to 
isomorphism, contingent on their relational dynamics within a category, 
implying that they share the same structure. The object’s structure 
serves as a guide to its essence, offering a valuable tool for unraveling 
complex and elusive phenomena, such as consciousness. In this context, 
a morphism is an oriented “relationship,” “process,” or “transformation” 
between objects.

188 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
By applying category theory and the Yoneda lemma to the fermionic 
mind hypothesis, we establish a mathematical foundation that elucidates 
the relational interplay between consciousness and material systems 
(Tsuchiya and Saigo, 2021). This innovative framework can verify the 
hypotheses by aligning harmoniously with existing empirical evidence. 
Temporal Orientation: The Orthogonality of 
Sensory Reality and Cognition
The nature of consciousness, whether a continuous stream of experiences, 
emotions, or thoughts occurring at specific moments, has been a 
longstanding and intriguing question among philosophers, psychologists, 
and neuroscientists. However, there is a significant duration of unconscious 
processing before conscious perception and awareness emerge. Moreover, 
despite our continuous flow of experiences, we remember episodes as 
discrete sequences of events (Shapiro, 2019) and see the future as steps on 
the temporal measuring stick of our imagination, which is consistent with 
discrete processing. Thus, consciousness shows continuous and discrete 
qualities and a framework that reflects both might represent how we 
perceive the world around us. 
For example, directly manipulating attention postdictively, i.e., 
at short time delays (Shen et al., 2020), influences choice. Therefore, 
cognition is not instantaneous, moment-by-moment consciousness 
constructions but incorporates information after perception by the so-
called postdictive effect. In the above example, substantial periods of 
continuous unconscious processing precede discrete conscious percepts 
(Herzog et al., 2020). Likewise, despite the constant flow of experience, 
we remember memories as discrete sequences of events (Shapiro, 2019).
Next, we turn to the cognitive process. Conscious experience is 
intrinsically tied to the “now,” representing an unbroken stream of 
awareness, seamlessly transitioning from one moment to the next. 
Nevertheless, each present moment uniquely represents discrete 
conscious experiences of successive “nows” that become memories. This 
twofold nature of consciousness signifies a constant shift in focus, where 
observation changes its underlying parameters, making it impossible 
to grasp—analogous to the observer effect. In quantum mechanics, the 
observer effect is the change of an observed system by observation. It also 
suggests that investigation via measurement causes the discrete collapse 
of the wave function, the so-called wave-particle duality.

Appendix  189
The lens of a “monoid” can effectively examine the conscious duality 
concept. A monoid can encompass multiple morphisms, each representing 
the ongoing flow of consciousness. In a monoidal category where only 
the identity morphism exists, the arrow returns to itself, symbolizing the 
continuous unfolding or extension of conscious experience (Figure 1).
ida ○ f = f = f  ○ ida
The concept of consciousness as a monoid closely aligns with the 
brain’s ability to coalesce disparate and disorderly information into a 
unified perception (Tring et al., 2023). Unity aligns along a temporal arc 
(Smallwood et al., 2021) that endows intellect with a remarkable predictive 
ability (Northoff et al., 2019). “Therefore, time touches the eternal now at 
each moment,… disappears moment by moment and is born moment by 
moment… as a continuity of discontinuity (Nishida, 1948, p. 342, after 
Taguchi and Saigo, 2023).” Similarly, with time, consciousness stays 
constant yet continuously updates, shaping our social insights, thoughts, 
and actions (Smitha et al., 2017; Wolff et al., 2019). 
Morphisms of consciousness can be viewed from the perspective of 
the monoid, where the morphism is always from the same object to the 
same object. “One morphism and another, one morphism and itself, can 
all be composed because the morphism of a monoid has only one object, 
which means that all morphisms (‘passages’) are connected at the same 
object (‘now’) because their starting points (domains) and endpoints 
(codomains) are the same objects (Taguchi and Saigo, 2023).” The flow of 
consciousness perpetually remains in the same place because it originates 
from the same object as their domain and returns to it as their codomain. 
In essence, the dynamic, streaming aspect of the present corresponds to 
the diverse morphisms within a monoid. In contrast, the static, standing 
aspect aligns with the unique object of the monoid. This monoid framework 
effectively captures consciousness’ intricate structure, encompassing its 
ever-changing and constant facets (Figure 2).
Now, we return to the orthogonality question. The brain’s spatial 
data compression formulates an orthogonal sensory temporal hologram 
(Saaty and Vargas, 2017), representing an orthogonal projection onto the 
two-dimensional cortical surface (Déli, 2020a,b). In neuroscience, the 
hippocampus’ place cells transform spatial relationships into a temporal 
projection (Shimazaki, 2020), with the intermediate hippocampal CA1 
serving the spatial aspects and the dorsal hippocampal CA1 serving the 
temporal aspects of episodic memories (Barker et al., 2016), and coordinate 
collective behavior (Forli and Yartsev, 2023).

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
The arrow of time, a fundamental concept in physics, demonstrates a 
profound connection to the rate of entropy generation (Lucia and Grisolia, 
2020). The brain’s ability to consistently form endothermic processes 
entails entropy generation by enhancing the degrees of freedom (Shi et al., 
2019; Yang et al., 2019). Therefore, intellect is an orthogonal orientation vis-
à-vis material structure, where entropy generation represents complexity 
and order. 
In category theory, orthogonality defines relationships between 
objects and morphisms within categories. For example, in the category of 
sets, two sets are considered orthogonal if they have an empty intersection. 
In a class of morphisms X in a category C, the orthogonal complement of 
X within C is a class of morphisms Y in C. These morphisms Y in C are 
such that for each morphism f: X → Y in C × C, there is a unique morphism 
g: A → B in C such that f is orthogonal to g. Therefore, for a composable 
pair of morphisms (f,m), there is an operation → called “composition” 
that makes the morphism m ○ f called the “composite of m and f.” 
Likewise, for the composable pair of morphisms (e,g), the operation ○ 
called “composition” makes the morphism g ○ e called the “composite of 
g and e.” The domain of m  ○  f and g  ○  e coincide with the domain of 
d, and the codomain of m ○ f and e ○ g coincide with the codomain of d. 
Figure 1. Conscious (a) as a monoid. The arrow represents the identity morphism.
Figure 2. Consciousness as a continuous and discrete temporal flow. Memory and 
expectation materialize at discrete temporal locations marked: time points a, b, c.

Appendix  191
Two morphisms e: A → B and m: C → D are orthogonal if for any f: 
A → C and g: B → D, there exists a unique morphism d: A → D such that 
m ○ f = g ○ e. 
The Mind’s Particle Nature and the Resting Equilibrium
So far, we have shown that consciousness is a temporal, complexity-
generating system ensuring a rich variety of reference frames (Gaio 
and Rizzuti, 2022). Category theory can differentiate between different 
reference frames. Like the gravity field governs particle movement, 
temporal orientation defines our cognitive freedom. Temporal orientation 
rests with the resting state. Like particles following the geodesic dictated 
by gravity, the resting state’s mental expanse functions as a steady force 
shaped by memories and experience (Li et al., 2019). 
Another 
intriguing 
analogy 
is 
the 
so-called 
emotional 
electromagnetism, which rapidly oscillates between attraction and 
repulsion (Drigotas, 1993). For example, a dog’s wagging tail and raised 
hackles are analogous to electric polarities, an instant feeling for or against 
it (Surov, 2022). Emotions action-producing capacity (Nazmi et al., 2020) 
is a spin-like, positive, or adverse energy condition (Kao et al., 2015; Deli, 
2023) supported by the hormone oxytocin (Anpilov et al., 2020) (Table I). 
Partiality can spread to social groups, creating divisions (Krems et al., 
2023).
The dilation of time perception in negative experiences potentiates 
their action-producing power while averting action in positive emotions 
(Remmers and Zander, 2018; Rudd et al., 2012), underlying their energy 
nature. Emotions are the forces of motivation.
Quantum Physics and General Relativity Characterizes 
Human Thought
Psychology often turns to classical physics to explain individual or 
social behavior. Sentiment Contagion explains the spontaneous spread 
of emotions and related behaviors in social groups by heat conduction 
(Goldenberg et al., 2018). Social media groups can act as Filter Bubbles 
that confirm or enhance individual bias (Holone, 2016). Finally, hysteresis 
can explain aggravation, unemployment (Plotnikov, 2014), or the mob.
Adherence to resting balance represents particle-like stability, which 
makes it impossible to govern or predict our emotions and behavior. 
Like scattering experiments uncovering the atom’s internal structure, 
perceptions expose our ineffable, private, and inaccessible mental attitude

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
structures. The mind’s abstract world model flexibly adapts to different 
situations and experiences (Tring et al., 2023; Wolff et al., 2021). Unruly 
thought processes (Zanin et al., 2020) converge into a coherent self-narrative 
(Smitha et al., 2017), the foundation of a subjective, transcendental, and 
uniquely personal psychological equilibrium (Kolvoort et al., 2020). 
Surgical separation of the brain’s two hemispheres leads to the 
famous split-brain experience of distinct personalities (Pinto et al., 
2017), but further partitioning of the brain annihilates consciousness, 
indicating that the mind is fundamental and irreducible: the elemental 
unit of intellect (Déli, 2020a); see Table I. Nevertheless, the well-defined 
observational outcomes of cognition emerge from the dynamic intrinsic 
activation patterns on the cerebral cortex (Pang et al., 2023; Selesnick & 
Piccinini, 2018). These fluctuations and uncertainties profoundly influence 
arousal (Anderson et al., 2019), surpassing the impact of external stimuli 
(Dempsey et al., 2022). The wave-like characteristics of these fluid and 
vague thoughts, emotions, and concepts settle into discrete convictions 
and beliefs (Herzog et al., 2020), akin to the complementarity principle in 
quantum physics (Basieva et al., 2019),
Quantum cognition uses the mathematical principles of quantum 
theory 
to 
explain 
comprehension 
and 
decision-making 
(Deli, 
2020.a,b; Khrennikov, 2020; Tring et al., 2023; Wolff et al., 2021). The 
indistinguishable intrinsic properties of fermions, such as charge, mass, 
and spin, find emotional analogies, allowing us to identify with others 
and form comparisons.

Fermions’ ability to form stable objects is due to their adherence to 
the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents them from simultaneously 
occupying the same quantum state within an atom, causing their resistance 
to compression. This is analogous to the human tendency for competition, 
contradiction, and criticism, the source of territorial needs in the animal 
world and societal hierarchical structures (Saaty and Vargas, 2017; Wato 
et al., 2020). Therefore, the quantum qualities become the foundation for 
classical behavior. 
Classical Analogies in the Brain’s Operation
The human brain is an intricate system of neural networks, electrical 
impulses, and complex cognitive processes. Mental balance is highly 
dynamic, yet it can give rise to the resting equilibrium (Zanin et al., 
2019). The memory dependence of the brain’s resting state turns it 
into a temporal field, shaping our thoughts and actions even beneath 
the threshold of consciousness. The resting state, characterized by 

194 
Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
coherent low-frequency resting oscillations, provides many degrees of 
freedom, allowing intellectual capacity (Yang et al., 2019) and creativity 
(Shi et al., 2019). It encodes individual and social expectations to impact 
what we perceive, hear, and see (Xu and Schwarz, 2018) and catalyze 
behaviors between creativity and self-destructive tendencies (Beall and 
Tracy, 2017). The social world represents emotional gravity. 
The energy of attachments dictates our loyalty to people, places, and 
habits. Losses are profound reminders of attachment power, which makes 
their true strength painfully evident. The time pressure of stress increases 
emotional temperature, the social analog of temperature (Stewart and 
Plotkin, 2012). Its cognitive burden erodes our mental energy reserves 
and diminishes intellectual capacity (Makharia et al., 2016; Mani et al., 
2013). On the other hand, supply abundance lowers social temperature 
(Tkadlec et al., 2020).
Akin to gravity, emotional gravity regulates the individual’s mental 
landscape. Inversely, people within a network influence the social structure 
of their surroundings, thereby impacting the entire interconnected web 
(Li et al., 2019). This interconnectedness highlights the broader social 
dynamics of the brain operation. Like the relationship between the gravity 
field and its particles, the social sphere intersects the personal world. 
Category theory provides tools to differentiate between frames of 
reference (Gaio and Rizzuti, 2022). The temporality of consciousness is an 
orthogonal transformation t between consciousness G and the fermions F 
(Figure 3), hom (x, _): G ≅ hom (x, _): F (Table II). 
Emotional electromagnetism is another intriguing analogy that 
can be drawn from the brain’s operation. Emotions’ multidimensional 
representations and varied cultural and brain activity profiles hide their 
involuntary nature and action-producing ability (Nazmi et al., 2020). 
Therefore, like photons, emotions represent energy (Kao et al., 2015); see 
Figure 4. 
Consciousness (C) and fermions (D) have some shared characteristics 
(Figure 4). A functor F from C to D is a mapping that associates each object 
in C to an object in D.

Figure 3. The isomorphism of consciousness and fermions. Quantum mechanics and 
relativity were developed to describe fermions. Neuroscience in the past decades has shown 
that consciousness shows both quantum and classical characteristics. Therefore, n can be 
obtained by  the isomorphism of consciousness (C) and fermions (D) by composition.

Emotional Reasoning: Insight into the Conscious Experience
Conclusions
Physics and cognitive science have their concepts of objects and processes, 
i.e., morphisms, organized into categories with many standard features. 
Consciousness and artificial general intelligence (AGI) should exhibit a 
similar abstract structure, forming an isomorphic relationship. The likely 
analogy between artificial or neural-based intellect is due to their physical 
organization. A strong argument and mathematical verification support 
the fermionic mind hypothesis; its fate ultimately depends on further 
testing against the physical universe. 
While our memory library evolves, emotions emerge as the driving 
forces behind the motivation to maintain the resting state, the anchor for 
our sense of self. Much like the permanence of particles, the resting state 
ensures the continuous identity of the self. Furthermore, our memories 
are a temporal field that guides our thoughts and actions, even when these 
processes remain beneath the threshold of consciousness. The duality of 
consciousness bears a striking resemblance to the wave-particle duality 
observed in quantum mechanics. Moreover, consciousness’ temporal 
nature can be viewed as orthogonal to physical processes, representing an 
endothermic quality. 
Recognizing the mind’s isomorphism with fermions provides 
historical, philosophical, and psychological comfort. We are the children 
of the universe and our environment, but our words and actions formulate 
the world. The fermionic mind hypothesis represents a significant step 
forward in understanding consciousness and its implications. It can 
significantly aid AI research, psychology, and social sciences.
