editorial
a thing or two about a thing or two
Within the walls of our office, people 
often say “go big or go home” when it 
comes to building a system. Multiple 
graphics cards, unnecessary amounts 
of memory, and irresponsible volumes 
of storage space. And while it’s fun and 
entertaining to build monster systems, 
there are times when a compact, 
practical, and affordable system can 
equally be a beast in a different manner.
People generally try to aim for the 
$700 mark. For the most part, this is a 
good price for a budget system. A cheap 
build may come in at $500, which is pretty 
svelte when it comes to keeping money in 
your pocket. So, what if it were possible 
to have a full-fledged PC that is as potent 
as it is thrifty?
When money’s no object, things 
actually become fairly easy. Pick the 
best parts or choose the most expensive 
stuff you can get your hands on. It’s a 
greater challenge to be strategic about 
component selection in order to achieve 
a low price. How low? We’re talking an 
obscenely low $300.
Building such a system, however, 
requires a bit of careful planning, not only 
in parts selection, but prices, discounts, 
and other factors. You basically have to 
put on a bargain hunter’s thinking cap, 
and be smart about how and where to 
source your parts. Shipping charges are 
accounted for. Rebates are tallied. And 
price-history tools are an invaluable 
asset with which to arm yourself.
Once you’ve mastered the art of being 
frugal, it’s time to learn how to squeeze 
the most performance out of the system. 
Everything matters, and learning how to 
control what goes on when you’re using 
your PC is critical. Which is why we show 
you how to dish out an exacting command 
of Windows’ Task Manager.
Often overlooked, Task Manager is 
more powerful now than it has ever been. 
Sure, you can use it as a tool for seeing 
system load and resource usage, but it 
can do so much more. We show you how to 
control individual processes, and how 
to give jurisdiction over their utilization of 
your CPU’s precious cycles. Then learn 
the ins and outs of services and start-up 
applications, so you can ensure nothing 
is running that isn’t needed.
Due to the nature of our jobs, our team 
of editors is often swimming in pools of 
hardware. We’re always just an arm’s 
reach away from some piece of gear that, 
by itself, costs many times more than our 
challenge build. Have I ever built such a 
system myself? Yes, but not nearly at the 
skill level that Zak and Alan exerted this 
issue. The cheapest system I ever built 
was a measly $600, which doesn’t even 
hold a candle to their builds. If I were to 
build such a system, I would more than 
likely hunt for pre-owned parts—which 
is absolutely acceptable, and is actually 
part of timing your purchases.
There’s little doubt that a $300 system 
will deliver maximum value for maximum 
savings. Go small or go home.

Is AMD finally going to get its competitive edge back?
Ryzen: The First  
AMD Zen Chip
has AMD claiming there is a 
“true artificial network inside 
every Zen processor.” A trifle 
optimistic, perhaps, but we 
get the idea, guys: It’s better 
at predicting. AMD claims that 
all this trickery gives Zen a 40 
percent instructions-per-cycle 
improvement on the previous 
Excavator architecture.
To enable more flexible 
and effective DVFS—Dynamic 
Voltage and Frequency Scaling—
Ryzen is fitted with a matrix of 
embedded sensors to monitor 
temperature, frequency, and 
voltage. This enables more 
effective 
management 
of 
power consumption, and a new 
system called Precision Boost. 
This works seamlessly to ramp 
up selected cores in 25MHz 
increments. More interestingly, 
though, we also have XFR—
Extended Frequency Range—
which will enable higher clock 
rates if the system detects 
sufficient cooling. Sounds like 
automatic overclocking, doesn’t 
it? Effectively, it is.
Early benchmarks using 
engineering 
samples, 
and 
AMD’s launch  presentations, 
have been tantalizing. It shows 
itself as a match for the mighty 
i7-6900K across a range of 
benchmarks, including some 
awesome 
60-plus 
fps 
4K 
gaming. Count us impressed. 
Early indications (all right, then, 
leaks from the fabs in China) 
have four Ryzen chips ready for 
launch early in the year. The 
3.4GHz SR7 and SR7 Black 
Edition are the range-toppers, 
with eight cores, 16MB of L3 
and 4MB of L2 cache, and an 
impressive TDP of 95W. A six-
core SR5 and a four-core SR3 
are to follow. 
All well and very good so far, 
but the clincher is the pricing. 
The SR7 is “expected” to retail 
at $349, and the lovely tinkering-
friendly Black Edition at $499 
(all prices are a little fuzzy as 
yet). That’s near enough half 
what Intel will charge you for 
a comparable Core i7. The SR5 
and SR3 are similarly attractive 
at $249 and $149. That last price 
puts it into Core i3 territory. 
The 
SR7 
Black 
Edition 
will probably grab the early 
headlines. It is a “3.4GHz+” 
chip. How far that “+” can be 
stretched is going to be fun. 
To 4GHz on all cores and 
5GHz on a single core without 
liquid cooling, if the rather 
over-excited early testers are 
to be believed. Ryzen has the 
dream combination of effective 
multithreading across multiple 
cores and decent clock speeds.
Even 
allowing 
for 
the 
expected huff and puff from 
AMD and its fans, Ryzen is going 
to put AMD back on the map in 
a big way. The next few months 
are going to be interesting times 
indeed. If you are planning a 
new rig in the near future, it 
looks like the “AMD or Intel” 
decision just got real again. –CL
This is an important release 
for AMD. Yes, every processor 
launch is important, but AMD’s 
Ryzen chip is the first to feature 
its Zen core architecture. This 
is AMD’s first serious assault 
on the high-end and enthusiast 
market for five years, and 
there is an awful lot riding on 
its success. Ryzen is an eight-
core barnstormer, built using 
a 14nm production process. 
Intel chips have been top dog 
in serious machines for a while 
now—AMD fanboys will tell you 
how AMD chips can run faster, 
but it always seems to require a 
specific set of circumstances to 
achieve the trick. Ryzen looks 
to have the raw power to tackle 
Intel’s finest across the board. 
The Zen core architecture 
is a clean-sheet design that’s 
been cooking since 2012. The 
development team has been led 
by Jim Keller, the man behind 
the original Athlon architecture 
(which was great). Highlights 
from the feature list include 
a write-through L2 cache, 
simultaneous multithreading 
(at last), and a clever new 
branch prediction system. This 
XFR will enable higher 
clock rates if the system 
detects sufficient cooling.

Qualcomm has launched a new flagship 
processor, the Snapdragon 835. It’s the 
first the company has built using a 10nm 
process. It has eight cores, four running at 
2.45GHz and geared for performance, and 
four running at 1.9GHz and configured for 
efficiency. The company claims a 27 percent 
improvement on performance, and, more 
importantly, a drop of up to 40 percent in 
power consumption—although not at the 
same time. The new Adreno 540 GPU is 
25 percent faster and now supports 10-bit 
4K screens at 60Hz, which is pretty good 
going under any circumstances, let alone for 
something this small.
Much of the work has been geared toward 
improving 
VR, 
including 
eye-tracking 
in hardware, and support for Google’s 
Daydream VR. One of the first bits of gear to 
use an 835 comes from the Osterhout Design 
Group. It has produced two smart glasses: 
the $1,799 R-9, with an 1080p display, and the 
720p $1,000 R-8. They both run Android and 
can display augmented, virtual, and mixed 
reality overlays. The company is best known 
for making headsets for the US military; this 
is its first foray into consumer sales.
The glasses are quite chunky and weigh 
in at 6oz and 4.5oz respectively. They might 
look cool enough in studio photographs, 
although whether you’ll look so cool walking 
around outside is another matter. Google 
Glass trod this path before, of course, 
although with much cruder hardware. It had 
all sorts of problems, not least concerns 
about privacy with the front-facing camera, 
which these two also sport. It does show 
what a powerful graphics engine the 835 
has, though. We can expect to see this very 
capable chip in phones, mobile VR, and 
other tasty gadgets in the course of the year. 
Which is good for Qualcomm, because it has 
just been handed a $865 million fine by the 
South Korean Fair Trade Commission, for 
violation of anti-trust laws. –CL 
VR has been “this year’s big thing” 
for years now—it’s almost getting 
ridiculous. What it needs is decent and 
affordable hardware, and widespread 
support. Microsoft’s Holographic platform could be one half of that equation, 
and Lenovo has launched a new headset, which could be the other. The Verge is 
a lightweight headset; the company is aiming for a commendable 350g. It sports 
two 1440x1440 OLED screens, which are suspended in front of your eyes, rather 
than strapped to your head, as with the PlayStation VR.
Since the system doesn’t require external cameras for head-tracking, the 
price has been kept down. An exact figure has yet to be released, but Lenovo is 
talking of under $400—closer to $300, in fact. The Verge is lighter, has higher 
definition, and is cheaper than the big two rivals, the HTC Vive and the Oculus 
Rift. Maybe this year really is the year…. –CL

Windows gets 
Game Mode
It looks as though the forthcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will include a new Game 
Mode, as sharp-eyed beta testers have noted a file called gamemode.dll. Nobody is exactly 
sure how it’ll work, but some sort of tweaked resource allocation that gives the game more 
attention and shuts down background tasks looks likely. Similar to the way the Xbox One 
works, which makes sense, as they share so much code these days. 
The plot thickened, though, when it emerged that it’s also likely to only work with 
Universal Windows Platform games, so only those bought through the Windows Store. The 
Windows Store is not massively popular as yet, so any incentive Microsoft can offer will 
help, but it’s tough for Steam users. It certainly shows how serious Microsoft is getting 
about gaming on the PC, and tying the PC and the Xbox together. –CL

Looking Forward to 
AMD’s Vega GPU
Along with working silicon, AMD provided the first 
official details on Vega, and it’s shaping up to be 
(ahem) out of this world. It builds on everything that 
makes Polaris great, but it’s not simply a bigger chip 
with more cores. AMD didn’t provide Vega’s core 
count or clock speed, but it will likely be 4,096 cores 
clocked at around 1.5–1.6GHz. The reason we can be 
so specific is that AMD also announced a new line 
of machine intelligence accelerators, called Radeon 
Instinct MI6, MI8, and MI25. The MI25 uses Vega, and 
will provide up to 25 TFLOPS (with FP16—half that 
for FP32), which means Vega should be 45 percent 
faster in gaming performance than the Fury X.
But it’s not just about TFLOPS. AMD has reworked 
several elements of its GCN architecture, a major 
one being the memory subsystem. Vega includes 
8GB (possibly 16GB) of HBM2 memory in two stacks. 
These deliver the same 512GB/s bandwidth as the 
four stacks of HBM1 in Fiji, but with two stacks, 
the silicon interposer doesn’t need to be as large. 
AMD isn’t just calling this HBM or VRAM; it’s now 
a High-Bandwidth Cache (HBC), and there’s also a 
new High-Bandwidth Cache Controller (HBCC). The 
distinction is important, because the HBCC plays a 
much more prominent role in memory accesses. 
AMD profiled VRAM use for The Witcher 3 and 
Fallout 4. In both, the amount of VRAM allocated is 
two to three times larger than the amount of VRAM 
accessed. The HBCC takes this into account, allowing 
At AMD’s Tech Summit in December, we got some concrete details and 
demos for Zen (now Ryzen) and Vega. Ryzen should be available around 
the time you’re reading this, but Vega is further out, with a release target 
of “first half, 2017”—probably June/July, judging by AMD’s past history.
the GPU to work with far larger data 
sets, with a 512TB virtual address 
space. AMD also demonstrated 
a real-time physically rendered 
image of a house using more than 
600GB of data, running on what I 
assume is an 8GB Vega card. If the 
HBCC works properly, even a 4GB 
card could behave more like an 
8–12GB VRAM card, while an 8GB 
card would equal a 16–24GB one.
Vega also has a new geometry 
pipeline. AMD notes that there 
can be a 100x difference between 
polygons in a scene and those that 
are visible. The new geometry 
engine will have over twice the 
throughput per clock compared to 
AMD’s previous architecture. The 
compute unit is also improved, with 
native support for packed FP16 
operations, which should be useful

for machine learning applications. 
AMD’s Mike Mantor also stated, 
“We’ve spent a lot of time tuning 
and tweaking to get our frequencies 
up significantly and power down,” 
though the Radeon Instinct MI25 
still has a “<300W” TDP.
Finally, 
AMD 
improved 
the 
pixel engine, with a new Draw 
Stream Binning Rasterizer that 
helps cull pixels that aren’t visible 
in the final scene. All the render 
backends are also clients of the 
cache now, reducing the number 
of memory accesses. This should 
provide 
significant 
performance 
improvements 
with 
deferred 
rendering engines, which is what 
many modern games are using.
Based on performance numbers, 
Vega would be impressive, but 
factor in the other changes and 
AMD’s DX12/Vulkan performance, 
and 
we’re 
looking 
at 
another 
exciting year in graphics cards. 
The GTX 1080 leads the Fury X by 
around 35 percent (less at 4K), so 
a 45 percent boost would put Vega 
well ahead, and if the architecture 
improvements can add another 10–
15 percent, Vega might even exceed 
Titan X. For graphics junkies like 
me, June can’t come soon enough.
If the HBCC works properly, a 
4GB card could behave more 
like an 8–12GB VRAM card.
AMD called this mockup of four 
Vega modules with 100 TFLOPS 
of compute a “brain-in-a-box.”

The problem is, Canonical said the same thing with 
Snaps when it released Ubuntu 16.04 in April 2016. 
So what gives? First, it helps to know what exactly 
these new formats look to accomplish. The “purest” 
way to get software on a Linux system is to compile 
it from source. But compiling from source is a huge 
pain in the butt, and takes time. Which is why most 
people prefer to download packages.
Packages have all of the program’s files in a 
single file, while a package manager reads, extracts, 
and performs any set-up operations that are needed 
(such as installing dependencies first). Not everyone 
agrees with where the files should go, which is why 
each Linux distribution does things differently. (The 
package manager and the choice of what packages to 
include are probably the biggest things that set one 
distribution apart from another.) This disagreement 
over locations and formats resulted in the myriad of 
distributions we see today. It has also created a lot 
of extra work.
When an upstream project—such as VLC, for 
example—pushes a release, the developer has to 
determine how it wants to distribute its binaries. If 
a developer releases a .deb for Debian and Ubuntu, 
someone else has to maintain the packages for 
Fedora, Arch, and others. There is 
an army of package maintainers 
who spend their days and nights 
repackaging software to fit neatly 
into a distribution’s structure.
That’s the problem Flatpak and 
Snap want to solve, and they do 
it by siloing applications in their 
own little bubbles of reality. The 
idea of sandboxing is nothing new, 
and isn’t too far off from Docker, 
which 
is 
built 
to 
containerize 
programs for servers. Flatpak 
and Snaps distribute runtimes for 
their programs to run on. These 
runtimes allow a program to be 
written for a particular version of 
a library, so that when the system 
is updated, the program still has 
access to the library it was designed 
for. This makes Snaps and Flatpak 
all-in-one solutions for desktop

The Next Big Linux Fight 
is Flatpak vs. Snaps
One of the biggest problems with Linux has been the duel of competing 
standards. The battle between Flatpak and Snaps wants to take the fight 
between package standards beyond the distro. Back in November of 
2016, the Fedora project came out with version 25 of Fedora Workstation, 
and with it came official support for the Flatpak package format, which 
promises to unify package software distribution.

it’s going to be interesting to see 
which format wins.
Right now, Ubuntu has more

Snaps,

Agreement that developers and 
contributors have to sign. Fedora 
claims that Flatpaks are more open,

the user is running Wayland instead 
of X). The problem is, there isn’t a

BY MAtt hanson
Most of us use the humble web browser more than any other program. These ubiquitous 
apps act as portals to the Internet, and because we use them daily, we want them to be 
reliable and easy to use, as well as secure. By far the most popular browsers on Windows are 
Chrome (with 57.1 percent of the market in November 2016) and Firefox (with 11.1 percent). 
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer has fallen from grace, but the software giant is pushing its 
new browser, Edge, in Windows 10, in a bid to gain its lost market share. There are other 
browsers, such as Opera, but we’re looking at the three major players, to see which is best.
Firefox vs. Chrome vs. Edge
ROUND 1
ROUND 2
ROUND 3
Extensions 
Extensions (aka add-ons) can 
expand the functionality of 
your browser, giving you quick 
access 
to 
your 
most-used 
services (such as Google Drive), 
or improving your experience 
(such as ad-blockers that make 
sites load faster, while ditching 
ads). Chrome’s popularity gives 
it a huge advantage, as pretty 
much all add-on developers 
build an extension for Chrome 
before other browsers. Google 
apps and services are very well 
served in Chrome, and the add-
on store—plus the installation 
process—is 
straightforward. 
Firefox also has a robust add-
on store that makes it easy to 
find and install the add-ons 
you need. Firefox’s popularity 
means that most major add-
ons are available. Edge is the 
least flexible, as it has only 
recently started to support 
extensions. Unlike Firefox or 
Chrome, it’s not open source, 
so we can’t see Edge add-ons 
taking off in the same way as 
those of its competitors.
Winner: 
Chrome
Performance
We want a number of things in 
a web browser. First, it needs 
to be able to display even the 
most graphic-heavy websites 
quickly, while showing any 
embedded 
media 
without 
problems. It also needs to 
remain fast and responsive, no 
matter how many windows or 
tabs you have open. Chrome is 
a notorious memory-gobbler, 
especially when you have a 
number of extensions installed, 
and Firefox can also be a victim 
of its own add-ons. Edge’s 
current lack of extensions 
works to its advantage, giving 
a more sprightly feel. However, 
in the Kraken JavaScript 1.1 
benchmark, which records the 
speed of various JavaScript test 
cases, Chrome 55 came out on 
top, taking 1,129ms to complete 
the 
tests, 
compared 
with 
Edge’s 1,180ms and Firefox 
46’s 1,376ms. However, Edge 
came out top in the JetStream 
1.1 and Octane 2.0 benchmarks, 
showing that Microsoft’s focus 
on optimizing Edge has paid off.
Winner: 
Edge
Usability
Installing Chrome or Firefox is 
simple—head to their websites, 
and click “Download.” Edge has 
an advantage, as it is preinstalled 
in Win 10. The interface of all 
three is very similar. You have an 
address bar at the top, and they 
all double as a search box, with 
Chrome and Firefox defaulting 
to Google, while Edge uses 
the less popular Bing. Firefox 
also includes a search box, 
which feels redundant. Firefox 
drops the forward button, yet 
maintains the back button, 
while Chrome and Edge feature 
both forward and back buttons. 
The interfaces of Firefox and 
Chrome can be altered with 
extensions and themes, unlike 
Edge. All three have a cloud sync 
feature that lets you synchronize 
your bookmarks, history, and 
passwords over many devices. 
However, Edge is only available 
on 
Windows 
10 
machines, 
while Firefox and Chrome are 
available over a wide range of 
platforms and devices.
Winner: 
Tie between Chrome  
and Firefox
Firefox is a stalwart web 
browser that offers plenty 
of cutting-edge features.
Chrome is the most popular web 
browser on the Internet— but is 
its success warranted?
Edge is the newbie in this test. 
Has Microsoft learnt from 
Internet Explorer’s sins?

ROUND 4
ROUND 5
ROUND 6
And the
Winner 
Is… 
It 
appears 
that 
Chrome’s 
popularity has a reason, because 
in our tests, Chrome came out on 
top—or near the top—in almost 
every aspect. This is a robust and 
feature-rich web browser that 
makes surfing the Internet a joy, 
thanks to its speed, standards 
support, cloud sync features, and 
huge selection of extensions. The 
only area it falters in is resource 
use—this can be a demanding 
browser, especially if you add 
loads of extensions and open 
up tons of tabs when browsing. 
However, Firefox is still a very 
compelling alternative, and if 
you love Mozilla’s web browser, 
we recommend sticking with it, 
because you’re not missing out 
on much. Finally, Edge has a lot 
of improvements over Internet 
Explorer 
(not 
particularly 
difficult), and while this browser 
is still a relative newcomer on 
the block, it shows potential, 
especially since the Windows 10 
Anniversary Update. 
Security
It’s a sad fact of life that if 
you’re on the Internet, at 
some point you’re likely to be 
subjected to malicious code, so 
security and privacy features 
of web browsers are welcome 
additions. Chrome and Firefox 
both use the Google Safe 
Browsing API, which identifies 
potentially malicious sites, and 
warns you about accessing 
them. Both Firefox and Chrome 
also have a number of add-
ons from security companies 
such 
as 
Kaspersky, 
which 
can 
add 
another 
layer 
of 
protection when you’re surfing. 
Chrome can also scan files you 
download, and warn you if you 
have any infected files. Edge 
isn’t as robust, as it doesn’t 
feature those add-ons, though 
it does use the SmartScreen 
Filter from Microsoft, which 
can help identify potentially 
dangerous websites or files. 
Edge has also ditched support 
for third-party toolbars, which 
were big security threats in its 
predecessor, Internet Explorer. 
Winner: 
Chrome 
Resource Use
Resource use focuses on the 
amount of RAM and other 
resources 
that 
a 
browser 
commands. If a browser is too 
RAM-hungry, it can slow down 
your entire computer, even 
when the browser’s not in use. 
Chrome is notorious for loading 
processes. You can see this in 
Windows Task Manager. We 
opened 10 pages in Chrome, 
which launched 16 processes, 
and gobbled up 512MB of RAM. 
On less powerful devices, you’ll 
see a real drop in performance. 
CPU usage when on sites with 
animated images peaked at 
80 percent. Firefox was more 
restrained, with three loaded 
processes, a memory usage 
of 270MB, and a CPU peak of 
62 percent. Edge brought up 
12 processes, using 420MB 
of memory, with CPU usage 
peaking at 40 percent. No web 
browser excelled here, though 
Firefox was the most efficient. 
However, some lesser-known 
browsers pride themselves on 
keeping resource usage low. 
Winner: 
Firefox
Standards Support 
You don’t want to come across 
a site that uses a standard or 
language that your browser 
doesn’t support. Chrome has 
been built from the ground up 
to support as many standards 
as possible, and it shows. In 
particular, Chrome is known 
for its HTML5 compliance, 
and in the HTML5 compliance 
benchmark it scored 502—
with 555 being perfect. Firefox 
scored 466, with Edge scoring 
453. Chrome is based on 
the WebKit engine, which is 
renowned for passing all the 
Acid3 web standards tests (try 
your browser at http://acid3.
acidtests.org). 
Firefox 
also 
scored 100/100 for Acid3, as 
did Edge. This might not be an 
exciting result, but it means that 
no matter which of the three 
browsers you use, you won’t 
find their standards support 
lacking. A shout-out must go to 
Chrome’s WebKit engine, while 
Microsoft has also been making 
moves to ensure that Edge’s 
support is cutting edge.

THIS MONTH THE DOCTOR TACKLES...
↘ submit your questions to: doctor@maximumpc.com
Sneaky Software
Hi Doctor. I downloaded and 
installed Adobe Acrobat Reader 
DC, and was shocked to see 
two other applications, McAfee 
Security Scan Plus and True 
Key by Intel Security, being 
installed at the same time, 
with no option to cancel. As I 
recall, there was no checkbox 
dialog asking if I wanted those 
apps prior to loading Adobe’s 
software on to my PC.
Do you have any idea what 
might have prompted this 
uninvited intrusion? Are other 
program downloads using the 
same forced install for software 
we didn’t ask for? I was able to 
uninstall True Key and disable 
McAfee in “Task Manager > 
Startup,” however, I would have 
preferred Adobe not to push 
them through on the back of 
its Reader.
–Phil Saunders
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Bundled software is the bane 
of an enthusiast’s existence, 
and most go to great lengths to 
keep bloatware from slowing 
their systems down. The Doc 
visited Adobe’s site using 
Firefox and Windows 10 to 
replicate your issue, Phil, and 
found that Security Scan Plus 
and True Key were optional 
offers, selected by default, 
before clicking the “Install 
now” button. He then visited 
using Chrome, and discovered 
that only True Key was listed. 
Finally, he tried the same link in 
Microsoft Edge, and was given 
an offer to download Chrome.
An Adobe representative on 
the company’s forums confirms 
that the installer displays these 
offers based on detected OS 
and browser. For those who 
see no offer and end up with 
software they don’t want, 
it’s possible that an installed 
ad-blocker is preventing the 
checkboxes from showing up, 
leaving you with the default 
selection. Adobe says the 
choices also don’t show up 
when the optional software 
is already installed. Now, 
that’s not to excuse Adobe for 
creating a situation where you 
end up with unwanted bloat 
unless specifying otherwise. 
At the very least, those boxes 
should be unchecked to start. 
The Doc found complaints to 
Adobe dating back five years. 
You would hope someone over 
there is listening.
Squashing Bugs
Doc, I am a long-time reader, 
and like to open up your column 
as soon as I receive my issue 
of the magazine. My problem 
is that ever since I upgraded to 
Windows 10, whenever I click on 
a URL in an email (I use Outlook 
2007), I get a dialog box asking 
me to choose how to open it. 
The options are IE and Edge, 
or get an app from the Store. 
I have IE set as default, but 
keep getting asked even after 
checking “Always use this app.” 
Any ideas?
–Jim Moraseski
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: This is 
a known issue that applies to 
Windows 10, Internet Explorer 
11 set as default browser, and 
Outlook 2007/2010 installed. 
According to Microsoft, it 
occurs because certain 
information is missing from 
your Registry. The company 
says it’s looking into it, but last 
reviewed the Knowledge Base 
entry more than a year ago.
Fortunately, there is a 
relatively simple resolution. 
The problem is detailed at 
https://support.microsoft.com/
en-us/kb/3094186, and you 
have two options: download 
Microsoft’s easy-fix wizard and 
follow its prompts, or scroll to 
“Let me fix it myself,” and add 
the missing Registry entries.
The Perfect Monitor
Hey Doc, I’m really hoping you 
can help me! I own a BenQ 
XL2720Z Black 27-inch 144Hz 
gaming monitor. It’s great for 
first-person shooters, thanks to 
that 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms 
response time. I’ve also bought 
an Nvidia Titan X (Pascal).
But what I really want is a 
nice ultra-wide monitor. My 
Acer’s Predator Z35 is a solid ultra-wide option for gamers with 
GeForce cards and a proclivity for high refresh rates.

> Random Shutdowns

problem is that the current crop 
of ultra-wides is missing both 
144Hz and 1ms grey-to-grey 
response times, which I need 
for competitive FPS gaming. I 
recently saw LG’s 38UC99 and 
34UC79G-B, and want to know 
if either would satisfy me, or 
should I continue waiting? I 
don’t want to take a step back on 
response rates just to get ultra-
wide resolution.
–Erik Figler
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: While 
the Doc hasn’t had a chance to 
use either LG display, he can 
tell you that neither satisfies 
your requirements exactly.
The 34UC79-G seems to 
come closest with its 144Hz 
refresh and 1ms Motion Blur 
Reduction feature. However, 
its real response time is 
actually 5ms GTG. The 1ms 
claim comes from a strobed 
backlight feature used by LG 
to minimize motion blur at the 
expense of peak brightness. 
Turning it on disables AMD’s 
FreeSync technology, but that’s 
not a deal-breaker, given your 
Titan X. A $700 price tag does 
sound steep for a resolution of 
2560x1080. If you’re enamored 
with a 21:9 aspect ratio, though, 
the 34-inch curved monitor 
strikes an imposing figure.
At around $1,600, the 
38UC99 is even more deluxe. Its 
3840x1600 resolution should 
be serviceable by Nvidia’s Titan 
X in most games. However, a 
peak refresh rate of 75Hz falls 
well under your target. And that 
screen similarly has a 5ms GTG 
response rate. Fortunately, it 
also includes LG’s 1ms Blur 
Reduction, if you don’t mind a 
strobed backlight at 75Hz.
Acer has some interesting 
alternatives with G-Sync 
support, rather than FreeSync, 
which is more apropos to your 
graphics card. The Predator 
X34 uses a 34-inch IPS panel 
with a 3440x1440 resolution, 
offers 4ms response time, and 
a 100Hz overclocked refresh 
rate. The Predator Z35 is even 
larger at 35 inches, but uses a 
curved screen with a 2560x1080 
resolution, so lacks the X34’s 
pixel density. A VA panel might 
not be the best for fast action. 
You’d probably love the 144Hz 
refresh rate, though, even more 
so as it overclocks up to 200Hz.
Windows Mail Woes
Doc, I have been a Maximum 
PC reader for years and love 
the mag. A quick question: 
I’m using Windows Mail 2012 
to manage email messages 
from three accounts, and was 
running Windows 7 Ultimate 
until I upgraded to Windows 10 
Professional. My problem was 
the same under both versions of 
Windows. I save a lot of emails. 
Some are important and need 
to be referenced at a later date. 
To keep them organized, I use 
many different folders within 
the app. As an example, I might 
have a folder called “Maximum 
PC” with 10 messages. But 
later, when I try to access that 
folder to look at saved emails, 
all 10 appear the same. I can 
scroll through the messages, 
but their content is identical.
I’ve searched for answers, 
but there is no cure as of yet. 
Every folder has been scanned 
by Norton’s Internet Security, 
and nothing comes up. Not all of 
my folders exhibit this issue, but 
many do. I noticed that Win 10’s 
built-in email app looks pretty 
good. Might that be an option?

–Randy Hardman
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
Doc believes you may be better 
off finding an alternative 
to Windows Mail 2012 than 
trying to diagnose its behavior. 
Microsoft made some changes 
to its service early in 2016 
that required anyone with an  
@outlook.com, @hotmail.com,  
@live.com, or @msn.com 
address to patch Windows 
Mail. This update caused other 
issues, though, prompting the 
company to suggest moving 
to newer software, such as 
Windows 10’s Mail app.
If you value integration 
with services such as Skype, 
PayPal, and Uber, or want 
your messages synchronized 
across devices and accessible 
through a common interface, 
consider creating an account on 
Outlook.com. There’s always 
the ubiquitous Gmail, too.
Random Shutdowns
Hello Doc, I love the mag and 
your advice, so I hope you can 
help. I have a pretty awesome 
gaming rig and I’m fairly savvy, 
but this issue has me stumped. 
My system consists of a 
Gigabyte Z68XP-UD3, Core i7-
3770K with an Intel closed-loop 
liquid cooler, 16GB of G.Skill 
DDR3-1866, a Thermaltake 
Toughpower 850W 80 PLUS 
Gold PSU, a Gigabyte GeForce 
GTX 980 Ti, a 128GB SATA-based 
SSD, two 2TB storage drives, 
one of which is complemented 
by a 64GB SSD cache, all in a 
Corsair 760T. I’m giving you as 
much detail as possible to help 
with troubleshooting.
Intermittently, the system 
turns itself off without warning. 
Most often, it’s while playing a 
game, but I’ve also had it happen 
browsing the web and sitting 
on the Windows desktop. It’s so 
random that I cannot figure out 
where the problem lies.
I’ve looked into Windows’ 
reliability history, which shows 
the PC was simply shut down 
incorrectly. I also changed the 
Startup and Recovery setting 
where, on system failure, the PC 
should not automatically shut 
down. I was hoping I’d get a blue 
screen with an error message. 
The system still just turns off 
randomly. I also tried using 
the second PCIe slot for my 
GPU, running with peripherals 
removed, and removing RAM, 
to no avail. I haven’t yet tried 
integrated graphics, but if you 
think my GPU is a suspect, I will. 
Most of all, I’d like to know that 
if I upgrade my motherboard, 
RAM, and CPU, this problem will 
go away. I don’t think the PSU is 
my culprit; it’s only a couple of 
years old, Gold-rated, and high 
quality. I was, however, running 
two Radeon R9 290s on it, which 
may have stressed its output 
limits. I’m most suspicious 
of the mobo as it’s the oldest 
component and fairly value-
oriented.
–Adrian Sultana
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: As you 
know, troubleshooting is often 
a process of elimination, and 
it sounds like you’ve covered 
several possible causes. 
But heat is the first malady 
that comes to mind when 
the Doc hears about random 
shutdowns, which happen to be 
most prevalent in demanding 
applications such as games.
Have you checked the 
closed-loop cooler’s fan to 
make sure it’s still blowing? Is 
the radiator clogged with dust? 
Might the thermal interface 
material on your CPU be due 
for a fresh application? How 
about airflow in your chassis? 
Download Core Temp or Intel’s 
Extreme Tuning Utility—both 
help monitor a CPU’s health.
If heat isn’t an issue, how 
about a BIOS update? You’re 
using a Z68-based mobo and an 
Ivy Bridge CPU. That Platform 
Controller Hub first launched 
with Intel’s second-gen Core 
CPUs; support for your Core i7-
3770K was added via firmware. 
Make sure you have the latest 
version. Gigabyte published a 
beta UEFI in 2013, which could 
iron out compatibility issues 
with modern storage and 
graphics devices. 
The Z68P-UD3 motherboard launched alongside Intel’s Sandy 
Bridge, but was updated to support Ivy Bridge-based CPUs, too.

Every issue, we’re set new challenges. Whether it’s 
via our executive editor, our editor-in-chief, or the 
management bods who want those big headlines on 
the front cover, we’re thrown into the belly of the beast 
with a new conundrum to tackle. And each issue, those 
challenges get more extreme. This time, we were sat 
down and told: “$300— that’s your budget. We want a 
250GB SSD, and 8GB of memory. Do it!” 
And so here we are. Maximum performance at the 
absolute minimum budget. A base system that can 
operate efficiently and quickly, yet is fully capable of  
being upgraded to compete with some of the most 
prestigious mid-range gaming or office PCs out there. 
But who are we if not suckers for punishment? Instead of 
one single $300 bunker-busting bomb, we decided to pit 
those two old processing dogs against each other—Intel 
versus AMD—in the ultimate budget build-off, to finally 
settle the debate once and for all (or at least until Ryzen 
and Kaby fully launch, and we have a whole plethora of 
new parts to consider).
Prices correct at the time of going to press.

Intriguingly, we flipped the boat 
on this one and went with a 
slightly more expensive AMD chip. 
Because we managed to neatly 
make some savings elsewhere 
in the build, we could splurge a 
touch more, so opted to go for the 
now-slightly-ageing 
quad-core 
A8-7600. Although AMD does have 
the X4 845 at a slightly cheaper 
price point, the lack of integrated 
graphics is a real deal breaker. 
We’ll be honest: We pinched this 
cooler from an A10-7670K, but rest 
assured, both this and the Intel 
chip do come with stock coolers 
as pictured, so there’s no need to 
worry about your chip overheating.
Gigabyte’s a fond favorite of 
ours, 
providing 
good-quality

features at a respectable price. 
Well, at least once you hit the 
$100 mark, of course. To even 
attempt to reach our allocated 
Intel budget, we had to settle 
for the H110 chipset. What this 
meant was a microATX form 
factor motherboard, with USB 
3.0, a single PCIe 3.0 slot, no M.2 
support, semi-acceptable audio 
(fortunately), four SATA 3 ports, 
and an HDMI connection as a 
backup. Not exactly perfect, but 
not too shabby either.

Asus A68HM-K 
$47
More budget offerings—this time 
from another favorite: Asus. The 
A68HM-K is a microATX budget 
mobo, primed with an FM2+ socket 
ready for any of the Kaveri line of 
processors. With relatively slim 
pickings on board, you net access 
to four SATA 3 slots, two USB 2.0 
headers, two PWM fan headers, 
and a very limited set of rear I/O. 
It’s almost plain sailing if it weren’t 
for the lack of HDMI connectors. 
Time and again, we’ve slated AMD 
for being too many chipsets behind 
its rival, and the A68HM-K makes 
that painfully obvious. However, 
budget is budget, and you can still 
equip this with dependable SSD 
storage, 16GB of DDR3, and any of 
the latest and greatest GPUs.

The old adage states that if you’re 
on a budget, you’ll get better 
value per buck by hopping over to 
AMD. Although that has become 
somewhat diluted in recent years, 
it is still true in essence. So, our 
choice of Intel’s Pentium G4400 
is on the bottom rung of Team 
Blue’s processors. But, featuring 
two 14nm cores, Intel Iris HD 530 
graphics, and 3MB of L3 cache, it 
touts support for Intel’s latest and 
greatest chipsets, alongside some 
phenomenally beefy single-core 
performance for the price.

8GB (2x 4GB) Patriot 
Viper 3 DDR3-1600 $46
Crucial MX300 
275GB SSD 
$81
DDR3 may not be the latest memory technology, 
but it’s still more than sufficient when it comes 
to normal day-to-day operations and even 
gaming. With slightly higher latencies, lower 
capacities, and increased power draw, you’re 
not losing out on much in contrast to DDR4. We 
chose 8GB of Patriot memory here, because it’s 
the absolute minimum amount we recommend 
for any new build, and Patriot is a brand that 
we’ve come to trust to provide good-quality 
components, along with a solid warranty. The 
only downside is that, in the long run, it’s not 
going to be as easy to upgrade with as the DDR4 
kit featured in the Intel build, because all the 
latest platforms are finally shifting across to 
the new standard. 
This is arguably one of the few places you 
could shave money off those budgets. Running 
a system off a single 120GB SSD has been the 
norm for quite a few years, but as both these 
configurations lack any additional storage in 
the form of a traditional spinning hard drive, we 
decided that bumping up the SSD with a chunk 
of extra gigabytes would waylay some of those 
storage woes later on down the line. Crucial’s 
MX300 series is a solid-performing, well-
priced range of SSDs, built by the respectable 
foundries of Intel’s partner company, Micron. 
With reads and writes well above the 500MB/s 
mark, this is well worth the cash.

Kingston SSDNow 
UV400 240GB

Another circa-250GB SSD hitting the block 
here. This time, it’s a slightly smaller offering 
than the Crucial MX300, but no less of a 
performer. This budget-busting solid-state 
drive performs well into the 500GB/s 
range as standard, and comes at 
the astronomically low price of $68. 
Although that may look cheaper than 
the Crucial MX300, you have to bear in 
mind that you do lose an additional 35GB, 
so the price of the two drives is almost identical 
when it comes to dollar per gigabyte. You could 
always get away with a 120GB SSD instead, to 
drop the overheads, but we feel that double that 
capacity will keep you happy long-term, until 
you decide to upgrade at a future date.

Eight gigabytes is widely regarded as the 
absolute minimum amount of memory you 
should be looking at when building any new 
system on a modern platform. DDR4 is the 
go-to for any new Skylake-based system, 
and, surprisingly, 2,400MT/s is actually just as 
cheap as the 2,133MT/s kit. In reality, Gigabyte’s 
GA-H110M-S2H can only support DDR4 up to 
2,133MT/s, so we would be running this kit at 
a slightly lower frequency than its advertized 
spec—but, honestly, you wouldn’t be able to 
tell the difference, and it does provide you with 
some future-proofing if you want to swap out to 
another motherboard later down the line.

EVGA 450B 450W  
80+ Bronze  
Certified $37
NZXT Source 
210 ATX 
Chassis $40
EVGA has constantly impressed us ever since 
it first launched its range of power supplies, 
because it provides some fantastic value 
options, all the way up to the most premium of 
Platinum-punching PSUs. The EVGA 450B is a 
450W Bronze-certified power supply, and is 
more than capable of supporting this system, 
even if we wanted to include an additional GPU 
later down the line. It’s a non-modular, ATX-
sized variant, granted, but for the price, plus 
the included warranty, and EVGA’s legendary 
reliability, this a is no-brainer for anyone on a 
tight budget.
This is the ATX budget case of choice, as far 
as we’re concerned. For $40, you net yourself 
a full-sized midi tower capable of housing an 
ATX motherboard, multiple fans to support 
cooling, 5.25-inch drives, and a plethora of 3.5-
inch hard drives. Unfortunately, there’s no easy 
way of mounting 2.5-inch SSDs, but with a bit of 
double-sided sticky tape, you can hide them or 
mount them on the floor or side of the chassis 
without worry. We’re using the Elite version of 
the S210 here (as NZXT doesn’t sample cases 
any lower than that), but the only difference 
between the two are the included fan, and the 
tool-less 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch bays.

Fractal Design

MicroATX

It’s not the fanciest chassis out there, but for 
the price, it’s hard to find much better. Fractal’s 
Core 1100 offers a simple yet somewhat 
antiquated design, ideal for anyone looking 
to build their first system. Only supporting up 
to microATX motherboards, it does limit your 
upgrade potential, and the lack of cooling 
support beyond the front 120mm fan is a little 
unnerving, but you can still build a snazzy little 
system inside, without taking a huge hit on 
performance. The top-mounted PSU is a little 
old-school, but it does help improve internal 
airflow inside the chassis by shifting more  
air out of the rear, and if cooling becomes a 
worry, you can always mount a 120mm fan on 
the side panel.

Corsair CX500 500W 
80+ Bronze

We’ll be honest—you could easily get away with 
using the EVGA 450B PSU we suggested for 
the AMD system on this config. In fact, even if 
you added an additional hard drive and modern 
GPU, neither system would be pulling more 
than 250W from the wall under load. However, 
we wanted to showcase two separate power 
supplies for this feature. There’s very little 
difference between the two, though, short 
of manufacturer—however, brand loyalty, in 
this case, does cost you. Generally speaking, 
though, if you do plan on upgrading, we would 
suggest you invest in a Corsair RM series  
power supply, to reduce cable clutter with a 
relatively cheap modular PSU.

Rise of the Tomb Raider @ 768p
26fps
Rise of the Tomb Raider was run at 1366x768 on integrated graphics 
at the lowest possible settings. Average frames recorded in the 
integrated benchmark.
Our AMD build looks quite dainty 
compared to Intel’s behemoth. 
The microATX Core 1100 offers 
little room for cable management, 
though. We tucked a lot of the 
cables inside the 5.25-inch bay, 
while sticking the Kingston SSD to 
its side with double-sided tape.
We contemplated using AMD’s 
more price-aggressive and newer 
X4 845 quad-core CPU, but it 
lacked integrated graphics. So we 
opted for the three-year-old A8-
7600. Still featuring a quad-core 
processor clocking up to 3.8GHz, it 
should be a meaty choice. However, 
we had trouble getting it to clock 
any higher than 1.9GHz with 50 
percent utilization in most of our 
CPU-intensive benchmarks. It took 
several reinstalls of the chipset 
and some BIOS tinkering to get 
it to hit the mark, and even then 
consistency in other benchmarks 
failed on several occasions.
We were impressed with how 
well it ran in-game, though. Even 
with that ageing APU architecture, 
frame rates in Rise of the Tomb 
Raider (on low settings at 728p) 
were impressively comfortable, 
nearing 30fps, demolishing Intel’s 
Iris HD 530 graphics. All of which 
bodes well for the low-end offerings 
coming up with Ryzen, too.
Simply buying a better graphics 
card and throwing a larger hard 
drive at it may not be the best 
upgrade choice. AMD’s single-core 
performance has always held it 
back and can lead to bottlenecks. 
It’s pricier, but for gaming we 
recommend investing in an A10-
7890K 
for 
better 
single-core 
performance, on top of the 500GB 
HDD and GPU of your choice, 
bumping the upgrade price up to 
$300. If it’s a home theater you’re 
after, a low-end GPU might do you 
more favors, with an RX 460 2GB 
and 1TB HDD setting you back $140.

Rise of the Tomb Raider @ 768p
11fps
Rise of the Tomb Raider was run at 1366x768 on integrated graphics 
at the lowest possible settings. Average frames recorded in the 
integrated benchmark.
When it came to building this 
PC, the most important decisions 
revolved 
around 
how 
best 
to 
attempt the cable management, 
and what limited cooling you could 
achieve with the included fans. 
Overall setup was a cakewalk. 
A quick installation of Gigabyte’s 
chipset and motherboard drivers 
gave us a rig that ran smoothly 
with little issue. Getting the games 
up and running was trickier, with 
most erroring on first attempt. 
We found we had to directly install 
the VGA driver from Gigabyte’s 
site, something we usually leave 
to Windows Update, then force a 
DirectX install on top of that. 
Choosing 
which 
game 
to 
benchmark was tricky, as we 
didn’t meet the minimum spec for 
a lot of them. Metro 2033 was our 
first attempt, but upon successive 
crashes, we caved in and opted for 
an old favorite, Rise of the Tomb 
Raider (at the lowest settings 
and 1366x768). Impressively, on 
integrated graphics we managed an 
almost watchable 11fps in-game. 
Although that doesn’t sound like 
much, you could play some of the 
older classics at lower resolutions 
without too much of an issue.
In its current state, the Intel 
machine breaks our $300 budget 
by 41 bucks. It would’ve been 
possible to drop that price simply 
by shrinking the SSD and using a 
cheaper EVGA PSU, but we advise 
sticking with a named brand in 
case of power surges. That aside, 
for day-to-day office use, it’s 
exceptionally good value for money. 
If you were looking at upgrading 
in the long term, for gaming we 
suggest grabbing a 500GB HDD 
and potentially a GTX 1050 or RX 
470, for around $143 in total. For a 
home theater machine, simply grab 
yourself a 1TB HDD for around $50, 
and you’d be on to a winner.

SSD Mounting
Along with some 
double-sided sticky tape 
trickery, we’ve also threaded 
the SATA power through the 
bottom of the 5.25-inch bay to 
keep it tidier. 
       
Front I/O 
Annoyance
Due to a lack of any cable 
routing options, and a front 
80mm intake fan, cable-
tying the front I/O cables is 
a necessity. 
       
Top-mounted PSU
It’s a little old-school, 
but the top-mounted power 
supply isn’t too much of an 
issue—however, we would 
suggest installing it before 
anything else.
       
Cable 
Management
Fortunately, the Source 210 
comes with plenty of cable 
management room in the rear, 
so we managed to route the vast 
majority of the cables  
out of sight. 
       
Hidden SSD
We actually managed 
to tuck the Crucial MX300 right 
out of the way in the 5.25-inch 
drive bay, keeping it out of sight, 
but easily accessible. 
       
Front I/O 
connectors
The only problem with having 
a microATX board in a full-
sized ATX tower is that you 
end up stretching the front I/O 
connectors all the way up.

Take a peek at the inner 
workings of Windows with 
Task Manager. By Nick Peers
Forensically 
examine 
your PC’s 
processes
E
ver wondered what goes on under 
the hood of Windows? If your PC 
is running smoothly, doing its job, 
then probably not. It’s when things start 
to go wrong—your PC slows to a crawl, 
or non-responsive application errors 
keep popping up—that you suddenly take 
a keen interest. There are plenty of tools 
out there that promise to speed up your 
computer, fix errors, and make things as 
good as new again (whatever that means), 
but there’s always an element of risk 
involved in trusting your PC to a program 
that doesn’t really explain what it’s doing, 
failing to point out that cleaning out the 
Registry doesn’t—on its own, at any rate 
—speed things up, and, more often than 
not, introduces problems you later can’t 
unpick to resolve without a refresh or, 
worse still, full-blown reinstall.
We may live in a post-truth world, but 
your PC doesn’t care about any of that. 
Knowledge is power, and understanding 
how Windows works arms you with the 
insights you need to make more informed 
choices about what to do the next time 
your PC decides to slow to a crawl. In this 
feature, we’re going to take a close look 
at the programs, processes, handles, and 
threads that make up the bulk of what 
your PC does. And if all that sounds like 
gobbledegook, don’t worry, because we’ll 
also explain how everything fits together 
to help you understand exactly what’s 
going on. 
We kick things off by having a look at 
Windows 10’s powerful Task Manager 
tool to take a closer peek—you’ll even 
learn a clever trick that can sometimes 
help bring frozen applications back to life. 
And if you want to go deeper, we’ll take 
you on a tour of Process Explorer, which 
offers a forensic look at exactly what’s 
going on—both in the foreground and 
behind the scenes. You’ll discover how 
to free up system resources, track down 
troublesome processes, and generally 
keep your PC running a bit more smoothly.
We’ll also take a brief look at some 
other tools that can help you monitor your 
PC and track down fixes to your problems. 
But enough natter—it’s time to arm 
yourself with the tools and techniques you 
need to better understand your PC.

T
he main focus of our feature is the 
programs and processes that are 
running 
whenever 
you’re 
using 
Windows. These include apps, games, and 
other programs you launch yourself, as 
well as background processes, such as 
Windows Services, your security software’s 
auto-protect 
features, 
and 
Windows 
Explorer itself. Windows ships with its own 
built-in tool for monitoring and—to some 
degree—managing all of these in the form 
of Task Manager.
Task Manager has evolved into quite 
a powerful tool in recent versions of 
Windows—launch it by right-clicking the 
Taskbar. The default basic view merely 
shows running programs—right-click to 
close it or switch to that program (handy if 
it’s hidden from view). Note that the “Always 
on top” option merely ensures that the 
Task Manager window can’t be hidden by 
other windows.
To tap into Task Manager’s full range of 
features, click “More details,” which splits 
things into a multi-tabbed view. The main 
tab is “Processes,” an expanded view of all 
the processes and threads running on your 
PC. By default, these are split into three 
groups: apps are programs you launch from 
Windows Explorer; background processes 
are third-party programs running in the 
background, and Windows processes refer 
to core processes related to Windows.
You’ll see four additional columns of 
information, labeled “CPU,” “Memory,” 
“Disk,” and “Network.” These represent 
the process’s usage (as a percentage in 
CPU terms). You can quickly see which 
processes are hogging system resources 
by clicking any of the columns to sort the list 
accordingly. Once identified, you can decide 
whether or not to close the program or 
process in question—if you don’t recognize 
its name, right-click it, and choose 
“Properties > Details” for a more verbose 
description, or choose “Search online” to 
search Bing for both the process name and 
its underlying filename.
Tip: Cloud storage apps often hog 
all  available network resources, which in 
turn can result in sluggish performance. 
Once verified as the culprit in Task Manager, 
open their settings, and look for a section 
where you can apply limits to their upload 
and download speeds—OneDrive users 
should go to “Settings > Network tab,” 
for example.
Recover Frozen Apps
If a program is not responding, the process 
should be highlighted—from here, you can 
attempt to close it by selecting the process 
and clicking the “End task” button. If that’s 
too drastic a step, you may be able to 
recover it by right-clicking and choosing “Go 
Windows 10’s Task Manager provides a decent system overview.
Programs, 
processes, 
handles, 
and 
threads—what are they, and how do 
they link together? It can get confusing, 
particularly given the way that both Task 
Manager and System Explorer present 
running programs, processes, and threads.
Programs are a series of files that are 
combined to provide you with the tools and 
functionality you use on a daily basis, from a 
web browser or office package to your game 
collection. They can also include underlying 
Windows programs (such as File Explorer) 
and lower level Services, which work in 
the background to provide features such as 
networking and automatic updates.
Processes provide resources to run 
a program, which are stored in “virtual 
address space,” a reserved portion of RAM. 
They comprise the program, open “handles” 
to system objects, which determine what 
resources are required (such as DLL 
files), as well as environment variables. 
Processes are assigned a security context, 
which determines their level of access to 
the system, plus a unique process identifier 
(PID). They’re also assigned a priority class, 
which determines how fast the process runs 
in relation to other processes. Minimum 
and maximum “working set sizes” are also 
applied, to set limits on how much physical 
memory the process requires.
Each process is split into threads, 
which allows Windows to allocate CPU 
time between processes. Each thread can 
execute any part of the process’s code, 
and shares the process’s virtual address 
space and resources. They have their own 
properties, such as unique identifiers and 
exception handlers, and they stop and start 
to a schedule, so they don’t all run at once.

to details.” This takes you to the “Details” 
tab, where processes are listed with more 
information—their 
status 
(running 
or 
suspended), the user who launched them 
(typically you, SYSTEM, or a SERVICE), and 
a PID (Process ID).
To try to free up a non-responding thread 
from here, right-click it again, and choose 
“Analyze wait chain.” This lists any threads 
that are using or waiting to use resources 
being used elsewhere. Ending the thread 
may be enough to free up the original 
process—we’ve done this a few times in 
Firefox when an individual tab has become 
non-responsive, for example.
There are some other handy options 
under the “Details” tab—you can alter 
thread priorities here, which in turn can 
stop particular processes from taking over 
your PC, and slowing everything else down. 
Simply right-click the offending process, 
and choose “Set Priority > Below Normal” 
to see whether it helps. You can also give 
threads more priority if you feel they need 
extra attention, but avoid giving any thread 
“Realtime” priority, because it brings 
Windows grinding to a halt.
Another option is “Set affinity.” This 
determines which processor cores a 
program or service can use—if you have 
a dual-core CPU or better, you might find 
older applications designed in the era of 
single-core processing run better if you limit 
their access to a specific core, rather than 
allowing them to use all available cores. In 
most cases, you’ll find Windows is perfectly 
capable of assigning resources efficiently, 
so it’s of largely academic interest only.
Trim Startup
One other Task Manager tab is worthy of 
attention: “Start-up.” This doesn’t just 
list which programs are set to start with 
Windows—it provides a “Start-up impact” 
tab that rates apps’ resource usage as 
“High,” “Medium,” or “Low.” Keep an eye 
on those rated “High”—if start-up times 
and overall performance suffer, preventing 
these from starting with Windows (right-
click the program and choose “Disable”) 
may help improve matters.
Task Manager’s other tabs enable you to 
monitor performance over time via a series 
of graphs (“Performance”), plus keep 
an eye on apps you’ve installed through 
the Microsoft Store by measuring their 
resource usage over time (“App history”). 
The “Users” tab is handy when two or more 
users are logged on at once, providing a 
list of user-generated running processes. 
Finally, “Services” provides a cut-down 
version of which low-level processes are 
running (or not). You can manually start, 
stop, and restart services from here, but 
for more granular control (such as setting 
a Service’s start-up setting), right-click the 
service, and choose “Open Services.”
Process Explorer
The Windows 10 Task Manager tool goes 
a long way to giving you a peek inside your 
system, as well as the tools for dealing with 
runaway and non-responding programs, 
processes, and threads. But you can 
delve even deeper into your system with 
the help of Process Explorer, a free tool 
developed 
by 
Microsoft’s 
Sysinternals 
team. Find out more and download it from 
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/
sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx—it’s 
completely portable, and can be run directly 
from your web browser (go to https://live.
sysinternals.com/procexp.exe to do so).
We’ll assume you’re downloading it: once 
done, right-click “ProcessExplorer.zip,”  
choose “Properties,” check “Unblock,” 
and click “OK.” Now extract its contents, 
then 
right-click 
either 
“procexp.exe” 
or “procexp64.exe” (depending on your 
Windows system type), and choose “Run as 
administrator.” Process Explorer doesn’t 
require elevated access, but if you want a 
complete look at your system, you should 
do so to allow it to peer wherever it needs to.
Process Explorer opens to a single-
pane window. Expand the “Options” menu, 
and check “Hide When Minimized” and 
“Allow Only One Instance.” The former 
option ensures that when you close or 
hide Process Explorer, it minimizes to the 
Taskbar Notification area, where a real-
time graph lets you keep an eye on CPU 
usage (roll your mouse over it, and a pop-up 
window reveals overall CPU usage, as well 
as that of the most demanding app running). 
Go to “Options > Tray Icons” to measure 
additional metrics via their own system tray 
icons, with seven choices on offer, including 
“GPU 
memory” 
and 
“Commit” 
(total 
predicted memory the system may need at 
any one time based on current usage).

Process Explorer can also help 
track down potential security 
risks that are running, by 
comparing a process’s parent 
file with the VirusTotal online 
database, which checks files 
against dozens of reputable 
antivirus engines. Switch the 
feature on by choosing “Options 
> VirusTotal.com > Check 
VirusTotal.com.” Click “Yes” to 
agree to the VirusTotal terms 
of service (these are displayed 
in your browser), and then 
Process Explorer will submit 
the hashes of every running 
process and thread to the 
VirusTotal website. It also adds 
a new VirusTotal column to the 
main view. You’ll see a list of 
clickable links reading “0/56” 
or “3/57.” Each one links to the 
antivirus scan results for that 
individual file. 
Any files listed as “0/57” or 
similar have been rated safe by 
all the antivirus engines used; 
focus your efforts on those 
marked in red, where the score 
is 1 or higher. Click the link 
and you’re taken to a web page 
of results, with the suspected 
infections placed prominently 
at the top, along with the source 
antivirus engine and suspected 
infection. Google the result, 
together with the filename, to 
see what’s out there, but unless 
there are multiple matches, it’s 
likely to be a false positive.
If 
your 
file 
isn’t 
listed 
there, that means it hasn’t yet 
been scanned by VirusTotal’s 
engines—right-click the file and 
choose “Submit to VirusTotal” to 
upload it, then wait for it to be 
scanned. The results appear in 
due course.
You can also check files 
for their digital signatures— 
double-click the process and 
switch to the “Image” tab, then 
click the “Verify” button. Look 
for “(Verified),” followed by the 
name of the digital certificate 
authority under “Image File.” 
This, on its own, is no guarantee 
of whether or not a file is 
safe, but it is an extra layer 
of security.
Check for Malware
The more flags on VirusTotal, the more dangerous the file.
processes. You’ll see some processes 
are nested inside others in a tree-like 
structure. This makes it clear from which 
process a particular process or program 
spawned (for example, if you open a 
program in the usual way, it appears nested 
underneath explorer.exe; however, if you 
open your web browser by clicking a link in 
another program—Word, say—it appears 
underneath the parent program instead). 
Processes are also color-coded to 
help you identify what’s going on with 
each—to see what the colors represent, 
from recently launched threads (green) to 
threads ending (red), choose “Options > 
Configure Colors.”
Note this view is lost if you click any 
of the other column headings—such as 
“CPU”—to determine resource hogs. But 
if you double-click the process to open its 
Properties dialog, you can see the name of 
its parent process underneath the “Image” 
tab with other useful information (such as 
which user the process is running under).
As an aside, look carefully at the System 
process. You’ll see an entry marked 
“Interrupts.” This is an artificial process 
in that it actually tracks the system’s 
interaction with your hardware. If you spot 
high CPU consumption for this figure, 
then it indicates a potential problem with 
your hardware or—more likely—a driver 
bug. Don’t bother clicking it for further 
information, though—there’s nothing to 
see, literally.
Microscopic Examination
One of the many ways in which Process 
Explorer enables you to see what’s really

happening under the hood is through its 
support for showing detailed information 
about a process’s threads. Switch to the 
“Thread tab”—ignoring the warning about 
missing symbol files (not needed unless 
you’ve got the chops to go the extra mile, 
or you’re a developer)—and you’ll see a list 
of all threads associated with that process. 
You get to see the CPU usage for individual 
threads, as well as the files calling 
that thread, which helps pinpoint where a 
resource leak may be occurring. You can 
kill or suspend individual threads from this 
dialog box, but save any work before doing 
so—you could easily bring down the parent 
process from here, or even Windows itself if 
you don’t know what you’re doing.
A process’s “Properties” dialog contains 
a wealth of potentially helpful information. 
Use the “Performance” and “Performance 
Graph” tabs to measure its impact over 
time, for example. Switch to the “Service” 
tab to list which services it utilizes, or select 
“Environment” to view any environmental 
variables used by the program. The 
“Strings” tab is linked to the list of values 
provided by any DLL files used—these can 
help identify a process if you’re struggling 
to work out what it relates to.
Handles and DLL Files
Process Explorer also enables you to 
take a close look at a process’s handles 
and DLL files (the resource files that can 
be shared between multiple programs). 
Select your thread and press Ctrl-H—a 
new pane appears listing its handles. From 
here, double-click a handle to get more 
information about it (most specifically, a 
description of the handle type, such as 
“Section” or “WindowStation.”) It’s possible 
to close individual handles by right-clicking 
and choosing the “Close” option—but, as 
with threads, if you don’t know what you’re 
doing, it’s likely you’ll bring the whole 
process crashing down.
Press Ctrl-D, and this lower pane 
switches to DLL view, listing all the 
DLL files that the process in question is 
accessing. Double-click a DLL file to access 
its properties—switch to the “Strings” tab 
and you’re shown a list of string values it 
contains. Press Ctrl-H to switch back to 
Handles view, or Ctrl-L to toggle the lower 
pane on and off.
What does this information tell you? 
It gives you detailed insights into what 
makes up a process—how it’s composed 
of multiple threads, and what resources 
it utilizes in the form of handles and DLL 
files. Not only does it enable you to see 
exactly what’s happening with individual 
processes, but it also helps you to learn 
exactly how programs and processes run.
Get More Help
Process Explorer is a powerful tool, and it 
can take a while to get your head around 
it. The Help file is a good place to start—
press F1 to access it—but you’ll find some 
handy online resources, too. There’s a PDF 
handout from Kansas State University 
(http://bit.ly/procexplhandout) that provides 
a good introduction—it was written back in 
2009, but is still relevant. And don’t forget 
the official Process Explorer forum (http://
forum.sysinternals.com), which contains 
an FAQ, among other handy resources.
It’s also worth taking a look at some of 
Sysinternals’ other tools as well—Autoruns 
(http://bit.ly/autoruns) gives you a similarly 
detailed view of the start-up process, split 
across major tabs. It’s easier to grasp than 
Process Explorer, and provides you with 
all the tools you need to streamline your 
startup. If you want to monitor file system, 
Registry, process, thread, and DLL activity 
in real time, then Process Monitor (http://
bit.ly/processmonitor) is the tool to go for—
this is particularly handy if a program is 
crashing, because it provides you with more 
detail as to where in the process things 
might be going wrong. Finally, RAMMap 
(http://bit.ly/ram-map) lets you take a peek 
into how your system RAM is managed. 
Struggling to identify a window’s parent 
process or thread? Open Process Explorer, 
then drag the target-like icon next to the 
binoculars icon on to the window in question, 
and its associated thread is highlighted.
Click the binoculars icon or press Ctrl-F 
to open the search tool—this enables you 
to search by handle or DLL substring to see 
which processes are using (and possibly 
holding on to) resources. If you can’t 
access a file because “it’s open in another 
program,” this can find what’s locking it.
Choose “View > Select Columns,” and 
you’ll see you can view pretty much any kind 
of data about a process or thread that you 
want. Most useful views can be found on the 
“Process Image” (for additional info about 
the process) and “Process Performance” 
tabs (check “CPU History,” for example, to 
track a process’s resource consumption 
over time on a graph). Many of these options 
are overkill, but Google any terms to find out 
more about them. Also take the time to look 
at the “Handles” and “DLL” tabs—you can 
add extra information to both panes.
We like running Task Manager and 
Process Explorer together, but if Process 
Explorer offers all the functionality you 
need, you can make it your default task 
manager—choose “Options > Replace 
Task Manager.” Now, pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del 
or right-clicking the Taskbar and choosing 
“Task Manager” launches Process Explorer.
Should you wish to reset Process 
Explorer to its defaults, right-click its 
system tray icon, and choose “Close Process 
Explorer.” Press Win-R, type “regedit,” and 
hit Enter. Navigate to “HKEY_CURRENT_
USER\SOFTWARE\Sysinternals.” Right-
click the “Process Explorer” subkey, choose 
“Delete,” then close Registry Editor.

Games  
for 2017
Keeping the PC ahead of the pack 
By  Dan Griliopoulos and Alan Dexter
It’s a great time to be a PC gamer. The console battles for 
audience (and the fact that they’re cheap PCs inside anyway), along 
with the utter saturation of the phone game market, mean that 
publishing on PC is the safest, easiest bet developers can make. 
For the consumer, that means anything and everything you 
want to play is on PC—except if some lunatic at a console 
company has dropped a million or two on buying a temporary 
exclusive. Indeed, the number of games released on 
Steam every year has grown so much that it always 
exceeds the total number of games from previous years—and that’s 
happened for three years running. 
We’ve drawn up a list of the games we think are going to be the 
best over the coming year. We’ve judged them on innovation and 
implementation, rather than on how convincing their bullshots 
are, or how shiny the protagonist’s hair looks. If we’ve missed your 
favorite, well, that’s life.
Of course, there’s a ton of games we did want to include but didn’t 
have enough space or enthusiasm for—but 
they still deserve a mention: Tekken  7, 
Red Dead Redemption 2, World’s 
Adrift, Vampyr, Bloodstained, 
Quake Champions, Kingdom 
Come: Deliverance, Lego City 
Undercover, 
Nidhogg 
2, Mu Cartographer, Battle Chef, 
Spellforce 3, Sea of Thieves, The Church in the Darkness, 
Thimbleweed Park, Full Throttle Remastered, and Xenonauts 2.
Scalebound Release date: 2017
An action RPG in which you have a giant 
noble dragon as a sidekick, which you can 
order about or take direct control of. Using 
your dragon, you explore the strange 
world of Draconis, and defeat the enemies 
that threaten it and Earth. Combat is 
combo-driven, and the game can be played 
through in co-op—though you each have 
your own dragon.

Star Citizen Release date: TBC
Star Citizen is Chris “Wing Commander” Roberts’ return to video games. It’s actually two 
games in one: a single-player/co-op FPS campaign packed with Hollywood stars such as 
Gary Oldman, Gillian Anderson, and Mark Hamill, and a massively multiplayer FPS/combat/
trading/exploration game in a huge persistent universe. It’s built on the CryEngine, so it’s 
pretty as sin, and supports all the VR headsets. It’s also ridiculously ambitious.

Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon 
Wildlands Release date: March 7, 2017
Tom Clancy may have passed away, but his dystopian militarism 
continues. Ubisoft has said that Wildlands is one of the biggest

Boot Times
It only seems like yesterday that I 
would hit the switch on my BitFenix 
Shinobi, make a run for the throne, 
grab a drink, and head back to my 
room at varsity, waiting for my system 
to boot into life. An SSD was the 
solution to those waits. It annexed the 
ancient hard drive, enabling booting 
from UEFI to login screen in less time 
than it takes to identify the console 
gamer in the room (about 10 seconds).
Things have improved drastically 
since those first SSDs. PCIe SSDs are 
now available to the masses, which, 
on paper, should be far faster than any 
SSD from days past. The latest budget 
250GB Samsung Evo 960 comes with 
sequential reads of 3,200MB/s—six 
times faster than the height of SSD 
power, with reads being the key factor 
when looking at boot times. However, 
in my experience, it doesn’t correlate 
well when it comes to boot times. 
As the motherboard takes time to 
identify the PCIe drive as a bootable 
device, it can take 20–60 seconds for 
a PCIe system to boot. The obvious 
benefit is when you’re on desktop, 
with near instantaneous program 
loading and super-fast file transfers, 
but it’s still sluggish from power-on 
to login. RAID solutions don’t help, 
because the system cycles through 
the necessary prompts to allow you 
to enter the RAID UEFI setup each 
bootup as well, further increasing load 
times. So, the answer? Well, it sounds 
ridiculous, but if you’re just after a 
quick booting system, and aren’t really 
a professional just yet, the SSD still 
might be the best choice for you.
Skype recording
Use Skype a lot? If you like to keep a backup of your calls, a nifty 
piece of freeware called MP3 Skype Recorder is exceptionally 
handy. It monitors your Skype account, looking for audio 
activity, and as soon as a call starts, it begins recording the 
session for you to play back later. There’s also an ad-free Pro 
version for business use, with extra features, that costs less 
than two cups of coffee. https://mp3skyperecorder.com

BACKGROUND
Good news, everyone! Microsoft has made its first desktop 
ever. The Surface Studio is big, expensive, powerful, and 
most importantly, it’s on our teardown table. Is this a machine 
for creative pros, or a me-too entry in the modern wave of 
fashionably disposable hardware? If it survives this teardown, 
we’ll have our answer. 
MAJOR TECH SPECS
• 28-inch adjustable PixelSense display, with 4500x3000 
resolution (192 dpi), supporting sRGB, DCI-P3, and Vivid 
color profiles, plus 10-point multitouch.
• Sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 CPU, with 8GB, 16GB, and 
32GB RAM configuration options.
• Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU (paired with 2GB GDDR5), or 
GTX 980M (paired with 4GB GDDR5).
• 1TB and 2TB hybrid storage options.
• 802.11ac Wi-Fi/Bluetooth 4.0/Xbox Wireless built in.
• Supports Surface Pen and Surface Dial.
KEY FINDINGS
• We tip the Studio on to its back and inspect the base, hoping 
to find a way in. A strip of air vents borders the bottom panel, 
and at each corner we find a round rubber foot, concealing a 
Torx screw. The two on the front corners are of the extra- 
long variety. As manufacturers continue the fight against 
visible screws, we’re OK with this solution—it’s certainly 
better than gluing the entire thing shut. Screws jettisoned, 
the heavy bottom cover still holds on by way of several clips. 
So, we apply a little suction power to yank it free.
• Pulling the back cover off reveals a myriad of components. 
There’s a strict order of operations here. First out are two 
fans, but they remain anchored by wires with hidden leads. 
That midframe will have to come out before we can proceed 
further. As we lift it away, it brings an attached speaker out 
with it, along with a third wire tethered to the motherboard.
• Finally, we have access to some guts—this Studio is chock- 
full of ’em. But we need to delve deeper to see if it has the 
glory. We start with the high-powered half of the hybrid 
storage: a standard, removable, 64GB SanDisk Z400s M.2 
SSD. And on board we find two SanDisk 05466 032G 32GB 
NAND flash storage modules, and a Silicon Motion 
SM2246XT SATA III 6Gb/s DRAM-less SSD controller. 
• It’s time to return to that huge 28-inch glass display. Gulp. 
Unsure what kind of adhesive lies in wait, we throw down a 
pair of iOpeners to soften it up. Many swipes of the iMac 
opening tool later, and we’re ready to call this glue the 
in-between. It’s not the overkill tar of the Surface Pro, but it’s 
also not slice-it-down-the-middle clean iMac adhesive. It’s in 
between. A bit of a struggle, but not impossible. 
• Repairability Score: 5 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). 
The base is easy to open and home to several modular 
components—including the standard SATA hard drive and 
M.2 SSD—that can be replaced without disassembling the 
display. The entire display assembly can be replaced as a 
piece, without dismantling the display or the base. The RAM, 
CPU, and GPU are soldered to the board, and cannot be 
upgraded. You may want to think twice about that 8GB 
configuration. A few components embedded in the display 
(buttons, front sensors, and speakers) would be difficult to 
replace if they failed.

Studio
Two PCs in one? Almost.
Fortunately, that display is fairly 
easy to replace if damaged.

Connect Securely 
with OpenVPN
1 
Getting started
The following tutorial works with your basic Ubuntu 16.04 
install—the only real requirement is that your PC is on and 
connected to the Internet at home whenever you want to employ 
your VPN’s services abroad.
>> First, let’s install OpenVPN Server. Although it’s part of the 
official Ubuntu repositories, you can’t install it through Software 
Center, so open a Terminal window, and type the following:
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install openvpn easy-rsa
Just how secure is your Internet connection? The answer is often “not very.” One of the 
most dangerous places to surf the web or check your email is via a public Wi-Fi hotspot. What you 
need is a guaranteed form of encryption to keep your business private, and that’s where a virtual 
private network (VPN) comes in.
VPNs are designed to add an extra layer of security to the Internet and other public networks. 
They basically create a secure “tunnel,” inside which all your data is encrypted before being sent 
over the network. Their main use for home users is to provide a secure connection to the Internet, 
even over insecure networks. Commercial VPN services offer free packages, but these are slow 
and limited.
A much better option is to add your own VPN to your Ubuntu computer for free. Thanks to 
OpenVPN, you can set up your own server, then configure it to provide one or more devices (mobile 
or computer) with a secure on-demand VPN whenever it’s required. Without further ado, then, let’s 
get started. –Nick Peers
You’ll need this
Dynamic DNS address 
Get a free one from NoIP (www.
noip.com/free) and point your 
client at that.
UFW Firewall 
Visit https://bit.ly/openvpn-ufw 
for the steps you need to follow to 
configure it (substitute  nano  for  
 vim  in the instructions).
>> This installs two packages—the latter (easy-rsa) 
sets up and manages the certificates required to encrypt 
your network traffic. The easy-rsa package allows you to 
use OpenVPN in a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), which 
consists of public and private keys for each server and 
client, with the public keys being used to identify trusted 
clients and servers to each other. These public keys are 
signed using certificates to verify their identity, and your 
server needs to be configured as a Certificate Authority 
(CA) to create, distribute, and manage these certificates. 
>> First job, then, is to set up your CA, and build the 
server’s private and public keys—check out the step-
by-step guide opposite for details. Once that process is 
complete, it’s a good idea to “harden” your VPN’s security 
further with the following Terminal commands:
 $ cd ~/openvpn-ca
 $ ./build-dh
 $ openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key
2 
Configure OpenVPN Server
Now it’s time for the nitty-gritty: configuring your 
OpenVPN Server, and getting it up and running. 
First, you need to copy the encryption keys and other files 
you’ve just created to the “/etc/openvpn” directory, again 
using the Terminal:
A
Open up a Terminal, and then type the 
following command in order to create an 
empty file:
 $ nano ~/openvpn-ca/client-configs/ 
 make_config.sh
Now you need to carefully enter the 
following lines:
 #!/bin/bash
 # First argument: Client identifier
 KEY_DIR=~/openvpn-ca/keys
 OUTPUT_DIR=~/openvpn-ca/client- 
 configs/files
 BASE_CONFIG=~/openvpn-ca/client- 
 configs/client.conf
 cat ${BASE_CONFIG} \
    <(echo -e ‘<ca>’) \
    ${KEY_DIR}/ca.crt \
    <(echo -e ‘</ca>\n<cert>’) \
    ${KEY_DIR}/${1}.crt \
    <(echo -e ‘</cert>\n<key>’) \
    ${KEY_DIR}/${1}.key \
    <(echo -e ‘</key>\n<tls-auth>’) \
    ${KEY_DIR}/ta.key \
    <(echo -e ‘</tls-auth>’) \
    > ${OUTPUT_DIR}/${1}.ovpn
Once created, save and close the file, 
before typing the following command to 
make it executable:
 $ chmod 700 ~/openvpn-ca/client- 
 configs/make_config.sh

 $ cd ~/openvpn-ca/keys
 $ sudo cp ca.crt ca.key MyVPN.crt MyVPN.key ta.key dh2048. 
 pem /etc/openvpn
>> Replace  MyVPN.crt  and  MyVPN.key  with the value you 
allocated to  KEY_NAME  in the walkthrough above. Next, you need 
to generate your OpenVPN configuration file:
 $ cd /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files
 $ sudo cp server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn
 $ sudo gzip -d /etc/openvpn/server.conf.gz
>> Now follow the second step-by-step guide (over the page) 
to configure your server for basic usage. Once done, you need to 
perform one critical step to allow your clients to actually access 
the Internet through your VPN. First, enter the following command:
 $ ip route | grep default
>> Make a note of the interface listed next to “dev”—on 
our machine, this is “enp0s3.” Now enter the following 
command, substituting  enp0s3  with the interface listed 
on your PC, if applicable:
 $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o 
 enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE
3 
Start and test your server
It’s time to get things up and running. Type the 
following Terminal command, which launches 
OpenVPN using the server.conf file you’ve configured:
 $ sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
1. Set up Certificate Authority directory
First, you need to copy the easy-rsa template directory to your 
home directory, so your custom certificates aren’t overwritten 
when the package is updated. So, open the Terminal and type 
the following:
 $ make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca
 $ cd ~/openvpn-ca
 $ nano vars
2. Edit vars file
Scroll down to the group of lines beginning “export KEY_
COUNTRY,” and fill them in with your own personal information—
see the screenshot for an example. Note “KEY_PROVINCE” 
should be filled with the state, such as “Mississippi” or 
“California.” Put your name or organization in “KEY_ORG,” and 
fill “KEY_OU” and “KEY_NAME” with whatever you like, such as 
“MyVPN.” Save the file (Ctrl-O) and exit.
3. Build Certificate Authority
At the Terminal, verify you’re still in the openvpn-ca directory, 
then type: “source vars” and hit Enter. You should see a “NOTE” 
appear (see screenshot). Now type “./clean-all” and hit Enter, 
followed by “./build-ca” and hit Enter. You’re taken through the 
root certificate authority key and certificate. Hit Enter when 
prompted to confirm each edit you made in the previous step.
4. Generate server’s keys
Type “./build-key-server MyVPN” and hit Enter, replacing 
“MyVPN” with the value you entered for “KEY_NAME” in step 2. 
Hit Enter to accept the default choices as before. When prompted 
to create a challenge password, hit Enter to leave it blank, and 
hit Enter again when prompted for an optional company name. 
Complete the process by pressing Y to the last two prompts.
Set up your Certificate Authority

>> Now check the server is running correctly:
 $ sudo systemctl status openvpn@server
>> You should see a list of messages appear on screeen, including 
the all-important “active (running)” message [Image A], along with 
“Initialization sequence completed” at the bottom—press Ctrl-C to 
interrupt the status check. Next, check that the OpenVPN interface 
is available:
 $ ip addr show tun0
>> If it shows a configured interface ending with “valid_lft forever 
preferred_lft forever,” things should be working correctly. You can 
now configure OpenVPN to launch automatically at startup with the 
following line: 
 $ sudo systemctl enable openvpn@server
4 
Make client configuration easy
The simplest way to configure your client is through 
the use of specially made .ovpn files, inside which 
the required key files are embedded, along with the 
settings needed to connect. These are created on your 
server, and here’s what you need to do.
>> Create a directory structure inside which your client 
configuration files are stored, then lock down the directory 
permissions, and create a base config file to work from:
 $ mkdir -p ~/openvpn-ca/client-configs/files
 $ chmod 700 ~/openvpn-ca/client-configs/files
>> Now open the Nautilus file manager, click the 
“Computer” link on the left, and browse to /usr/share/
1. Define server keys
Open the configuration file you’ve just created using  sudo nano /  
 etc/openvpn/server.conf  at the Terminal. We’re going to focus 
on the bare minimum settings required to get your server up 
and running. Start by scrolling down to the “# SSL/TLS root 
certificate…” section, and changing the “cert server.crt” and 
“key server.key” lines to point to the files you created in step 
four of the previous walkthrough.
2. Implement extra encryption
Now press Ctrl-W, and type “tls-auth”—you’re taken to a line 
marked “;tls-auth ta.key 0.” Remove the semi-colon from the 
beginning of this line (a process known as uncommenting) to 
enable it. Now add the following line underneath it, as shown 
in the screenshot above: “key-direction 0”—this ensures that 
the extra TLS authentication that you set up earlier is enabled 
for OpenVPN.
3. Configure web direction
These next tweaks instruct all connected clients to route their 
web traffic through the VPN. Press Ctrl-W to locate “redirect-
gateway,” and uncomment the line it’s on: “push….” Uncomment 
the next two instances of “push” referring to DNS servers, as 
shown above. Finally, search for “nobody,” and uncomment the 
“user nobody” and “group nogroup” lines. Save and exit.
4. Enable IP forwarding
Type  sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf  and uncomment out the 
following line by removing the preceding # symbol from it: 
“#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1.” Save and exit, then type the following 
command to reload sysctl:  sudo sysctl -p . You should see  
“net.ipv4 ip_forward =1” appear, indicating the setting has been 
correctly applied. That’s it!

You can access your OpenVPN server 
through a variety of platforms—there’s an 
official client for Windows, Android, and 
iOS (visit www.openvpn.net for details), 
while MacOS users can use Tunnelblick 
(www.tunnelblick.net). Transferring  the 
.opvn configuration file varies from 
device to device: you can simply copy the 
file to C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config 
in Windows, for example, or double-click 
it to import it into Tunnelblick on MacOS.
If you’re running an Ubuntu client, you 
can install some additional packages and 
manage your connection through the 
GUI-friendly Network Manager. Open 
Terminal and type the following:
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install network- 
 manager-openvpn-gnome
Once installed, open the Network 
Manager from the menu bar, select “Edit 
Connections,” then click “Add.” Choose 
“Import a saved VPN configuration…” 
from the drop-down menu, and click 
“Create.” Select your .ovpn file, and 
click “Open,” then verify the settings 
are correct across the four tabs (click 
“Advanced > TLS Authentication tab” to 
confirm it’s also recognized the TLS key). 
Give your connection a more suitable 
name—the name you assigned your VPN 
under KEY_NAME, say—and click “Save.”
Once done, connect through the 
Network Manager’s VPN submenu—you 
should see a lock appear over the menu 
bar’s icon, indicating the connection has 
successfully been made. The final step 
is to open your browser to verify the 
connection works.
Set up your client
doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/. Copy the client.conf 
file from here to ~/openvpn-ca/client-configs. Double-click the 
copied file to edit it in gedit [Image B]. First, locate the line marked  
 remote my-server-1 1194 , and change this to point toward your 
server’s public IP address or dynamic DNS name—for example,  
 remote 1.2.3.4 1194  or  remote dynamic.ddns.net 1194 .
>> Next, uncomment both  ;user nobody  and  ;group nogroup , 
before commenting out the lines  ca ca.crt ,  cert client.crt , and  
 key client.key , because they’re added by the batch file. Last, but 
not least, add the following line beneath  ;tls-auth ta.key 1  (which 
should remain commented out):  key-direction 1 . Save and 
exit, then follow the instructions in the box on page 58 to create 
the make_config.sh file, which you’ll use to generate the client 
configuration files whenever they’re needed for each client.
5 
Generate a client configuration file
You’ve now got all the tools you need to create your client 
configuration files. Here’s the process you need to follow in 
order to build them. First, you need to generate a certificate and key 
for your client using the following two commands:
 $ cd ~/openvpn-ca && source vars
>> This time, ignore the note—we don’t want to clean anything—
and then type:
 $ ./build-key client1
>> You need a unique name for each client certificate you 
generate—so, for subsequent certificates, you would use  client2 , 
 client3 , and so on. Again, you’re taken through a similar 
process as when you ran the build-server-key command, 
and the answers are exactly the same—no challenge 
password, and accepting the default choices.
>> Once generated, build the configuration file:
 $ cd client-configs
 $ ./make_config.sh client1
>> You’ll find a file marked client1.ovpn inside the client-
configs/files subfolder. This now needs to be securely 
transferred to your client—the box above reveals the 
different options available to you, and how to configure 
a VPN connection to your server from another Ubuntu 
PC. Congratulations—you’ve just made your Internet 
connection more secure [Image C].

Create Pro Streams 
with Gameshow
1 
Starter’s orders
Let’s start from the very beginning. Download Gameshow, 
install it, and run it. Skip past the release notes window, and 
you’re given your most basic creation options. You could, if you’re 
playing a popular game, opt for a template related to the likes of 
CS:GO or Dota 2, or choose one of Gameshow’s pre-built generic 
templates, but don’t. Although we’re in this for an easier time, that’s 
not going to teach you anything, and it certainly won’t make your 
stream unique. Instead, select “Blank,” then click “Next.” Now click 
the radio button for the service you’ll be streaming to, type in the 
title of the game you’ll be streaming, and, if you have a discrete 
graphics card, change up the encoder from the basic x264 software 
encoder to something with a bit more muscle. 
>> Users of the free version are stuck with a large animated 
watermark overlaid over any stream of 30fps 720p at 1,750Kbps or 
more, so drop the encoder settings down [Image A], unless that’s 
something you really want, or you are a paid-up user. Streamers to 
anything other than YouTube should also pick the most local server 
here. Hit “Next,” and you’re asked to authorize with your streaming 
service of choice, which only happens on your initial setup; you 
won’t be asked again if you create a new template in future. Just 
like that, you’re in—and doesn’t Gameshow’s dark exterior look 
intimidating? It does. But it’s a puppy inside. 
The streaming market on YouTube, Twitch, Hitbox, et al is growing quickly. So quickly, in fact, 
that if you’re not putting out a professional-looking stream, you may struggle to gain any viewers 
at all. This is easier said than done. Open Broadcaster Software certainly gives you the flexibility 
to produce a fully custom stream, but it’s among the most ugly and finicky pieces of software ever 
created. XSplit provides a beautiful overlay and a similarly beautiful interface, but a subscription 
involves a not-insignificant outlay. The solution? Streaming’s new kid on the block, Gameshow. It’s 
only been around for just over a year, but the fact that it was spawned from the labs of streaming 
expert TeleStream makes it the perfect tool to add a professional shine to your streams. It’s not 
free, unlike OBS, but there’s a limited-resolution or watermarked trial to use to see if you like it, and 
the full version involves just a $29, one-time outlay for 12 months of updates. –Alex cox

Get the shot
Let’s give you a quick primer. Gameshow uses three 
base components to create a streaming template: 
shots, layers, and, er, shot layers. Shots hold your 
delicately composed picture elements—your webcam, 
game, explanation text, and the like. Because they can 
be reordered in any manner you choose, these elements 
are called shot layers. Plain ol’ layers, on the other hand, 
enable you to slather several fully composed shots on top 
of one another. If you create, say, a stream overlay shot 
in the top layer, with your branding smeared all over it, 
and put a nice background shot in the bottom layer, you 
can easily flick through several shots on the middle layer 
without affecting these in the slightest.
>> We’ll start by creating the most basic of shots. So, 
fire up a game—absolutely any game will work for this—
and make sure that it’s running, ideally in a window or on 
a second monitor, so you can still see Gameshow. You’ll 
see, in the bottom portion of Gameshow’s main interface, 
that you have one blank shot at the moment, in the middle 
layer. This should be highlighted, and it’s the one you’re 
about to make changes to. In the left-hand column, 
click the plus button, then click “Screen capture” to tell 
Gameshow you want to capture something. This is a slight 
B

R&D

misnomer, because this option enables you to capture a full screen, 
a window, or—as you’re now able to do by changing the capture type 
appropriately—a game. Click “Select Window/Monitor,” deselect 
“Capture any full screen game,” then select your game’s process in 
the upper drop-down box. Hit “OK,” and the game’s content, minus 
any ugly window borders, should appear in the preview window 
[Image B]. Hit “OK” once more, and your game now appears front-
and-center in your shot.
3 
Face time
What streamer worth their salt would omit a good old 
facecam from proceedings? Presuming you’ve got a webcam 
hooked up and pointing at your visage, this is a trivial matter: Just 
add a new element to your shot as before, but this time select 
“Capture devices,” and then your webcam. Here’s where things 
get a bit more tricky, though. For one, that camera is now going 
to be obscuring some of the game. And if you’re anything like us, 
it’s also going to be capturing the strewn detritus of a particularly 
disorganized office. Time to make use of Gameshow’s Properties 
panel to set things right. First, click your game capture layer in the 
left column, then click the slider icon above. Dragging the scale 
C
sliders [Image C] enables you to resize the game to your 
liking, and you can click and drag it in the central shot 
composition window to place it exactly where you want it. 
>> Now head back to the shot layers section, and select 
your webcam. Back in the Properties panel, scroll to the 
bottom, and expand the Crop menu. You can use these 
sliders to trim away the abandoned chip bags and dirty 
plates, and then resize and reposition your webcam as you 
did before.
4 
All the elements
If you were to start your stream now (by clicking 
the broadcast icon, at the top-left of the shot 
composition window), your viewers wouldn’t get a very 
good show. In fact, they would see what’s currently in the 
live view on the right-hand side—a boring gray screen. 
This is down to the way Gameshow handles its output; 
you can compose shots and make tweaks on the fly, but a 
shot, or any changes you’ve made to it, aren’t (by default) 
broadcast until you explicitly make it so by selecting it and 
hitting the Space bar. This is super-handy for maintaining 
Great sound is absolutely critical for 
online 
streaming—some 
say 
even 
more so than a great picture. While 
Gameshow’s primary focus is on making 
awesome-looking streams, it’s adept 
at improving your audio, too. Your 
individual shot layers can be muted or 
unmuted by clicking the speaker icon 
next to them, or you can click a shot layer, 
then hit the speaker icon above, to alter 
individual volumes and pans. Clicking 
the headphone icon below any of the 
vertical meters enables you to monitor 
what sounds are coming out (useful for 
checking your mic before you stream), 
and you have access to quick volume 
controls if anything starts to hit the red.
The meat of Gameshow’s audio 
tweaks, though, are found in the Audio 
Mixer, which you can bring up by hitting 
Ctrl-U. Activate a shot with, say, your 
microphone in it, and that element 
appears here. You can then add various 
equalizing and boosting effects, or alter 
the balance of your audio to ensure you 
can be heard over your blaring game.

a professional appearance, but something you’ll have to remember 
to do as you stream.
>> Even if your shot had gone live, your viewers still wouldn’t be 
getting a very good show, as you’re broadcasting with no audio. You 
can add different audio sources to different shots, but this is a good 
opportunity to make use of a layer to ensure your system audio is 
audible, no matter what shot is live. In the uppermost layer, click 
the plus button to create a new shot, and select “Capture Devices 
> System Audio Capture.” Bear in mind this grabs any sound 
your machine makes, not just that of the game, which is perfect 
if you want to involve chums on Discord or Skype, but less neat if 
Windows 10 is going to shout at you with repeated noisy pop-ups, 
so make sure your Windows notifications are all switched off. You 
also have no microphone audio at this point. We’ll leave adding this 
particular shot layer as a little exercise for you—if you’re going to 
create, for example, a BRB shot, you may wish to add it to individual 
shots on the central layer, rather than having it active at all times. 
5 
Shot for shot
Gameshow is adept at transitioning between 
different shots, so let’s try that now. Right-click 
your shot in the lower portion of the interface, and select 
“Duplicate shot.” Change the copy by using the shot layer 
properties controls to make your webcam bigger and your 
game smaller, then hit the red dot button at the top-right 
of the Gameshow window to see only the live view. Switch 
to your new shot by highlighting it and hitting Space, and 
you’ll see the components smoothly resize themselves; 
switch back using the same process, and you’ll see the 
opposite happen. 
>> You can create more complex transitions between 
shots using the Switch menu on the main menu bar. Select 
your choice of an immediate cut, a smooth transition (which 
is what we’ve been using so far), or one of a number of 
fancy dissolves and wipes [Image D]. Note the “Go” option 
at the top of the menu—using Space still pulls off the old 
smooth transition; if you want to use your new one, either 
select “Go,” or hit Ctrl-G. Alternatively, and this basically 
does away with the “compose your shot before it goes live” 
deal, you can switch on AutoLive in the Switch menu, which 
changes shots, using your fancy transition, as soon as you 
click on them. If you’re going to use this, make sure you’ve 
planned out your stream, and composed all the shots you 
need, before going live.
6 
Stream away
Now would be a good time to test your stream, and 
the only way you can really do this is by going live. 
There’s a broadcast icon at the top-left of the preview 
window; click this, and you start sending your stream to the 
Internet. Keep an eye on the stats that now pop up. They let 
you know the bitrate you’re broadcasting at, the amount of 
CPU power your stream is draining, the number of viewers 
your stream currently has, and, importantly, the number 
of frames you’ve dropped. If you start dropping a lot of 
You can add just about anything to your 
Gameshow streams. We’ve discussed 
media files, a category that covers 
images, videos, and audio. Then there 
are 
screen 
captures, 
encapsulating 
windows, monitors, and games. You can 
also add text boxes, either static or drawn 
from an RSS feed, and make them scroll if 
you wish. You can pull in your Twitch chat, 
giving your viewers a chance to see their 
carefully chosen words (or hastily typed 
Kappas) on the stream itself. There’s a 
social media widget, which is a quick way 
to publicize your social feeds, as well as 
a live Twitter layer, which compiles your 
latest tweets. You can even run donation 
drives, as long as you’re signed up with 
imraising.tv and have an API key.
If your desired layer isn’t in the long 
list of included options, it could be time 
for a little improvisation on your part. 
Twitch users, for instance, should head 
over to www.streampro.io and link 
their Twitch account to the StreamPro 
service. You can then create your very 
own custom overlay, and include a whole 
host of live information. Copy its overlay 
URL, then go back to Gameshow, and add 
a new “web display” shot layer, pasting 
the URL into the appropriate box to see 
your chosen design pasted on top of your 
regular stream.

frames, look for potential issues with your Internet connection, or 
drop your bitrate (“Output > Output Settings”) to the point where 
your broadband connection can handle it properly.
>> While you’re streaming, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on your 
Twitch (or YouTube, or Hitbox) dashboard [Image E], reachable via 
the Output menu, to ensure you’ve titled your video correctly, and to 
keep an eye on chat. Professionalism in presentation is one thing, 
but you need a keen eye on your audience if you want to keep them 
coming back. As we’re only testing, though, it may be a good idea to 
cast an eye over your stream to make sure everything’s coming out 
as you expect. Listen to the audio—if there are problems, follow the 
steps in the “Sound Advice” box, pg. 63, to fix them. Watch the video, 
and check your transitions—this is where you’ll understand exactly 
what you’re doing wrong.
7 
Adding flourishes
With a test stream out of the way, now’s the time to start 
delving further into Gameshow’s features to see what else 
you can do. Visual shot layers—game capture, webcams, any videos 
you might have added in—can be manipulated beyond scaling and 
cropping. Try tweaking the X and Y rotation to put these elements 
on a wacky angle, for instance. This isn’t recommended for the 
main focus of your footage, but might be a nice effect for your 
webcam. You can also add mattes, trimming or blurring the edges 
of your shot layers, and while the built-in options aren’t particularly 
good—unless you want your game surrounded by a cartoon heart 
[Image F] or a silly spiky edge—you can import your own images as 
custom mattes.
>> The more pallid among us may wish to tweak the color options, 
too. Boosting the saturation and contrast can make a big difference 
to the output of poor webcams, and there’s a handy reset button if 
you happen to leave yourself looking like a diseased alien. If you’re 
lucky enough to be sitting in front of a brightly colored background, 
you can also use Gameshow’s built-in chroma key options to mask 
it out altogether. Click the head-and-shoulders icon to bring them 
up, switch chroma key on with the appropriate checkbox, check 
the box that lets you pick the key color, and click in your preview 
to isolate your background. There may be a fair amount of 
slider tweaking required before you get brilliant results, 
and bear in mind that this is chroma key, rather than color 
key, which means it can only remove bright colors, not 
whites or blacks.
8 
Finishing touches
You’re pretty much familiar with the basics of 
Gameshow now, so let’s go about tidying up 
your stream layout with a final spit and polish. Add in a 
background on the bottommost layer (to go behind your 
game and webcam) by creating a 16:9 image in your favorite 
arty program, and adding a new “media file” shot layer. 
Now create yourself a BRB shot in the uppermost layer, 
for when you’re away from your PC, or getting your stream 
set up. Create a new shot (ideally, this time, without your 
system audio or microphone input attached), add an image 
by adding a media file as before, and—hey, why not?—add 
some royalty-free music, too. It’s added in the same way 
as you would add an image, and is set to automatically loop 
while the shot is active. Happy streaming!

Create Your Own 
Comic Book Panel
1 
Get source images ready
Get an idea in your head of what you want your finished panel to 
look like. We like helicopters and explosions, but if you want to 
do something involving androgynous young men and their feelings, 
that’s OK, too. Find some source images, either taking them 
yourself or picking public domain photos from the Internet. We’ve 
roughly composited three photos into one image using the Magic 
Wand tool to select and remove the sky behind the helicopter and on 
top of the explosion, then dropping a blue sky into the background, 
and using Free Transform to stretch it to fit [Image A]. 
2 
use layers
The bright colors of a comic book panel are instantly 
recognizable, so to begin with, we can increase the saturation 
of our image a bit. Place a Hue/Saturation Adjustment layer on top 
The hand-drawing of comic book panels is a beautiful and time-consuming process that can create 
great works of art, and it’s one in which the medium—generally cheap paper—and the formatting of 
the pages are part of the overall form, meaning the comic-book “look” is immediately recognizable.
It’s not a new medium, either. Comic books date back to at least 1842 in the United States, with 
the publication of The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck, a story told through a series of illustrations, 
each with a caption. American comics entered a “golden age” in 1938, with the launch of Superman. 
Meanwhile, Japan was printing books of illustrated short stories as long ago as the 1700s, which 
have developed into the enormous media franchises of today’s manga. It’s the American look we’re 
going to try to recreate here.
Creating comic book panels from photos is, frankly, cheating, but when you haven’t got the time 
or the talent to go to the trouble of penciling, inking, coloring, and lettering, you can create a similar 
effect in Photoshop. –Ian Evenden

of your layer stack by going to “Layer > New Adjustment 
Layer > Hue/Saturation” [Image B]. Using an Adjustment 
layer means you don’t need to flatten your existing layers 
into one, as the Adjustment layer affects every layer below 
it in the stack. You can move it up and down the Layers 
palette to change how many layers it affects. Make sure 
your elements are in the right positions, as you’re about to 
flatten the image. Perhaps create a new Snapshot in the 
History palette, so you can come back to this point in the 
future if you’re not happy. Head to “Layer > Flatten Image.”
3 
Add a comic book effect
Now we’re going to apply the comic book effect. 
Cheap, poor-quality paper—completely unlike 
the thick, smooth paperstock this magazine is printed 
on—is a hallmark of comic-book publishing. The books 
were often marketed at children, and meant to be thrown 
away at the end of each week, so why bother with quality 
materials? The way the ink soaks into the paper is part of 
what gives comic books their distinctive look. We’re going 
to add a little grain to our image, so open the Filter Gallery 
(“Filter > Filter Gallery”) and choose “Film Grain” under 
“Artistic” [Image C]. We’ve gone for Grain: 7, Highlight Area: 
0, Intensity: 5, but the settings will vary depending on the 
source images you’ve used. Once it looks good, hit “OK.”

Apply the color halftone filter
As you flattened earlier, the only layer you have is a 
Background. Double-click this to make it Layer 0, then 
duplicate it by right-clicking it, and selecting the appropriate option 
from the menu that appears. We’re going to add the halftone effect 
to the top layer, to make our image look as though it was printed 
using a series of dots, varying in size or spacing, to represent the 
transitions between colors. There’s a simple filter for this: “Filter > 
Pixelate > Color Halftone.” We chose a setting of 6 for “Max Radius,” 
and left the other settings alone. The “Screen Angles” represent 
the way different colors’ screens would be rotated relative to one 
another in the printing process, to minimize the effects of moire 
patterns and other distracting visual flaws. Annoyingly, there’s no 
“Preview” checkbox on this filter, so the only way to experiment is 
to hit the “OK” button, and be ready with Ctrl-Z if you don’t like the 
effect. Remember, selecting the filter name that appears at the top 
of the “Filter” menu reapplies it with the same settings it was last 
used at, so you have to select it from the “Pixelate” submenu to run 
the filter again with different settings. The next step changes the 
look of the image, so it might be worth changing your mind only 
after you’ve seen the result.
5 
bring some detail back
With your top, halftoned layer selected, change its 
blend mode to “Darken” using the drop-down menu 
on the Layers palette. This makes the effect of the Halftone 
filter less obvious, and puts back a little of the detail that 
was lost when the filter was applied.
6 
Finishing touches
If you’re happy with the result, add a few more comic 
book touches, such as a black outline, by selecting 
the whole composition with Ctrl-A, then going to “Edit > 
Stroke,” and stroking a black line around the inside of the 
selection rectangle’s edges. If you want to add a caption, 
draw a rectangle in one of the corners, and stroke its edges 
with black, but this time fill it with white or yellow, and 
simulate a hand-drawn border by using the Ocean Ripple 
filter (“Filter Gallery > Distort > Ocean Ripple”) set to 
“Large Waves.” Add your text in a suitable font—Comic 
Sans if you must, but other fonts are available online that 
are free for personal use—then save your image, flatten it, 
and export it as a jpeg for sharing or printing [Image D].

This ancient form of printing originated in 
China a thousand years ago, helped by the 
fact that silk was readily available to make 
the mesh for the ink to pass through. 
Nowadays, silk screen printing is used 
for high-cost, low-repetition print jobs 
by those who like to carry out the process 
by hand—such as Andy Warhol, who used 
the process for the garish colors of his 
Marilyn Diptych. Its legacy lives on in 
the dots used to make up the images in 
almost all printed material, expanding 
the model to four different colored inks 
through four different meshes to create 
full color.

The Maximum PC 
Test Bench
Every issue, we dissect a plethora of 
hardware for your reading pleasure. It could 
be anything from headsets to processors, 
graphics cards to motherboards. And 
for the vast majority of that hardware, 
it needs to be put through its paces on a 
quantifiable, standardized test bench. In 
short, we keep the system we use for each 
product we review identical, in order to 
ensure that our results across multiple 
motherboards, GPUs, CPUs, or memory 
kits aren’t affected by any spurious system 
irregularities or instabilities.
Getting these things set in stone is 
imperative for providing solid, reliable 
results, and something many a hardware 
reviewer 
will 
pride 
themselves 
upon, 
ourselves included. But when it comes to 
building a solid test bench, there’s a whole 
variety of factors to consider. First of which 
is the choice of chassis. Generally speaking, 
you have two routes: You can go with a fully 
enclosed case, or you can opt for an open-
air test bench. The latter, however, tends 
to be less conducive to accurate cooling 
benchmarks (after all, it doesn’t replicate 
a typical, everyday fully enclosed system). 
But case choice, accessible airflow, and 
ambient temperatures vary so widely among 
our audience, that it’s often less about what 
specific temperature the coolers and fans 
can maintain, but more what variances in 
temperature and noise are noted between 
two different cooler designs, something 
we then balance with strict ambient 
temperature controls and thermal load 
testing. On top of that, opting for an open-air 
test bench makes swapping out hardware far 
easier and quicker. Which means that when it 
comes to supertests and error testing, it can 
be achieved far faster than when we’re using 
a closed chassis. 
As you’ve probably guessed, we’re about 
to show you our test bench for 2017—which 
hardware we’ve chosen, which niggles we’ve 
found, and how we’ve overcome them.

Hardware Variations 
So, where did we start with our new test bench? With the fixed 
components. We knew we wanted a new test bed, and Raijintek’s 
Paean Aluminum ATX Bench Table caught our eye. Squeaky clean 
and providing far better mounting options than our previous one, 
it was the obvious choice. Next up was the cooler. We stuck with 
our trusty NZXT Kraken X61, coupled with two Noctua NF-A14 
iPPC fans. It’s not the fanciest AIO, but its vast surface area and 
fantastically easy mounting system make it a snap to set up. 
We also decided to play around with our storage solutions this 
year. Moving the OS from the 500GB 850 Evo to the 250GB 960 
Evo M.2, and using the Crucial MX300 1TB as our games and file 
storage drive, as opposed to the 2TB Samsung 850 Pro, made 
sense. Finally, Be Quiet!’s Dark Power Pro 11 1,200W PSU would 
be providing the juice, as it has done for the last 18 months. 
This is where things get interesting—as we test a variety of 
products, the test bench has to rotate to compensate. A new X99 
board? Then it’s four sticks of DDR4 Dominators, alongside an 
Intel Core i7-6950X. AM4+ and Ryzen? A new motherboard and 
high-end processor should do the trick. GPUs launched? We’ll 
stick with the Z270 setup, and swap the GTX 1080 out instead. 
A test bench constantly changes, so while it has to adhere to 
strict principles on what hardware is included, it must be flexible 
enough to change depending on the gear being tested.
Test beds take the most abuse of any system we put 
together here in the Maximum PC office. They have all 
sorts of hardware installed and pulled out again several 
times in one day, often three or four times a week. And 
because of that, they have to be built from the right 
stuff. Unfortunately, just one week in, we accidentally 
broke the front I/O on Raijintek’s Paean, which meant 
we had to repair it using good old packing tape, just 
to keep it in one piece. It doesn’t look particularly 
glamorous, but most test benches we’ve used prior to 
this lacked a front I/O altogether, with us either booting 
via an onboard switch or shorting the two power pins on 
the motherboard itself most of the time.
Next up were cooling issues. By design, the Paean is 
meant to be a fully liquid-cooled test bench solution. The 
theory is, you place a combi res in here, with a pump to 
the right of the motherboard, then a triple thick radiator 
to the right of that. Although that’s certainly a possibility, 
we’re not keen on deviating from the more common AIO 
yet, because it’s more relevant to consumers, at least 
in our eyes. That said, mounting it the traditional way 
means our tubes aren’t long enough—so, to circumvent 
this, we attached the radiator sideways on the radiator 
panel, by carefully threading cable ties through the 
corners of each fan, using the radiator screw as our 
anchor point. This keeps it secure, and means we can 
still reach the processor with ease.

R&D
We’ve been a big advocate of M.2 PCIe drives for quite some 
time now. In fact, if you’re building a modern system, using any 
of the new chipsets from either Intel or AMD, your best bet is 
to go for an M.2 PCIe SSD for your OS. The sequential read and 
write speeds alone are mind-bending. It was a tricky decision 
to make, though, because they’re still not widespread just yet, 
and on top of that, booting from them requires Windows 10, and 
you also need that chipset support or an add-on card to make 
it a reality. However, the 960 Evo won us over, purely due to its 
exceptional value for money performance-wise .
Ok, so this isn’t the tidiest build we’ve ever done (actually, 
we’ve always been pretty lax when it comes to cable 
management), but this is entirely for good reason. Because 
we swap out hardware at an alarming rate, we need slack 
cables to cater for the constant shuffling around. The last 
thing we want is to struggle to unplug a CPU or PCI power 
on the fly. You’ll also notice we’re still running our trusty 
1,200W Be Quiet! Dark Power Pro 11 PSU. It’s super, er, 
quiet, and has enough headroom to plug in multiple GPUs 
without much issue, making it one sweet piece of kit. We’ve 
also thrown in a few CableMod sleeved cables for good 
measure—although, due to the fact that this $240 PSU is 
semi-modular, we refused to plug in the extension lead for 
the 24-pin ATX.

The New Standard 
Storage Changes
Multi GPUs
Cable Management? What’s that?
Not only did we decide to swap out the operating system 
to an M.2 PCIe SSD, but we also transferred all of our 
benchmarking files across from the Samsung 850 Pro 2TB 
on to this Crucial MX300. Now, let’s be honest, it’s not going 
to blow anyone away when it comes to performance, but as 
a workhorse drive for mass storage, it’s exactly what we 
need. The Sammy 850 was being underused acting just as 
our games and files storage drive, and it has been put to 
better purpose elsewhere because of this change. On top 
of that, this neat mounting mechanism means we can pull 
the Crucial MX300 out whenever we need it, to hook it up 
to any system we choose with a USB 3.0 to SATA cable with 
relative ease.
One of the neat features of the Paean is the PCIe bracket. 
Now, we know what you’re thinking—why on earth is this such 
a big feature? The thing is, the vast majority of test bench 
manufacturers seem to fail every single time they attempt this, 
with many using either pins or disproportionate supports for the 
GPUs, leading to frantic and troublesome mounting solutions. 
Fortunately, with its tempered glass, the Paean is just as much 
a showcase as a test bench, so the mounting solution here 
is exceptionally solid, and enables us to test up to four-way 
CrossFire or two-way SLI if we so desire.

Our NZXT Kraken X61 is looking a 
little withered at the moment, but 
we’ll probably swap it out for a custom 
closed loop, featuring a triple 120mm 
radiator, later in the year.

Corsair’s Dominator Platinums 
replace our trusty Crucial 
Ballistix Elites this time around, 
primarily because they’re part of an 
8x 8GB kit that we can use in our X99 
platforms, too.

We had to make a special request 
to get the Maximus IX Hero in from 
Asus to be our dedicated test bench for 
2017. It’s a true performer, and looks 
pretty classy to boot.

We’ll probably run this test bench 
with the glass side panel off. It 
makes it easier to access the insides, 
and the risk of getting fingers caught in 
fans is the least of our concerns.
Our zero-point PC (the old test bench) uses a Core i7-6700K, 16GB of Crucial Ballistix Elite DDR4 at 2666, an Nvidia GTX 
1080, and a 500GB Samsung 850 Evo. All games tested at 1080p on max settings, with HD texture packages installed.
Out with the old and in with the new, eh? 
It was a sad occasion when we benchmarked 
our Z170 test bed for the last time. It’s 
performed admirably this year, and to be fair, 
a large chunk of it is staying with us. You may 
have noticed the Samsung 850 Evo 500GB is 
still plugged in the back, for instance, sitting 
next to the Crucial MX300—but, alas, it won’t 
be making the journey with us, as it’s purely 
there to transfer over any files we may need 
from the desktop, and is soon to be removed.
So, how was it to piece together? Well, 
open-air test benches are some of the easiest 
builds we ever create. The biggest challenge 
was assembling the Paean itself. The case 
comes flatpacked, so you have to attach 
the eight legs, then add all the other major 
components. The instructions could use some 
work, as we struggled to find the right screws 
for mounting the front I/O panel (probably 
what caused us to break it), and installing the 
PSU was a pain as well. 
The biggest decisions were with regard to 
finalizing test benches for this year. We’ve all 
but wrapped up our Broadwell-E processor 
testing, so there’s no need to pick a single 
X99 motherboard. As such, that test rig will 
remain pretty much cemented in place, with 
motherboards swapping in and out until we 
start seeing Skylake-X and its Kaby-X twin. 
For X99 motherboards, we’ll use the Intel Core 
i7-6950X, with 32GB (4x 8GB) of Dominator 
Platinums. SSD testing will be handled by the 
new Kaby Lake base test bed, aka the Z270, 
with the same going for any new GPUs and 
coolers that come out, until a new consumer 
chipset arrives as well. And, of course, Z270 
motherboard testing will be handled by the 
Core i7-7700K, the GTX 1080, and the storage 
solution we have on board. The real wild 
card  is Ryzen. We’re not sure what’s going 
to happen with AMD’s new champion and its 
chipset. However, it’s unlikely we’ll swap out 
from Z270, at least not until 2018. Same goes 
for GPUs, with AMD’s Vega looking likely to 
launch in June of this year. 
The big question is, do we get some proper 
water cooling on the go? We’ve certainly got the 
hardware to do it, but there are pros and cons. 
The positives? It would allow us to potentially 
push overclocks higher, as we wouldn’t be so 
limited by thermal issues. And we can ensure 
the tubing is the correct length and the entire 
cooling table is controlled by us directly. Plus, 
it looks awesome. The negatives? Well, there’s 
the fact that if we’re reporting temperatures 
on CPUs (which we do, occasionally, for a new 
processor launch), it would mean swapping 
out the loop for an AIO, because the number 
of people using fully water-cooled loops like 
that would be very few. And, once Ryzen does 
launch, the AMD prodigies won’t be using the 
same socket design as Intel, so we’d need to 
drain the loop and attach a new waterblock. 
Decisions, decisions….

Pull up a seat, and get comfortable. 
The following is gonna get philosophical, 
maybe even a little epistemological. The 
new Intel Core i5-7600K is very cool, you 
see. But it’s also kinda crappy.
Hold that thought while we square 
away the speeds and feeds. The 7600K is, 
of course, part of Intel’s new Kaby Lake 
family. That makes it a Tock in Intel’s now-
defunct “Tick Tock” cadence of processor 
development, where a Tock represents 
an architectural revision, rather than a 
new production process. Actually, it’s the 
second such Tock on Intel’s prevailing 
14nm process, which reflects the fact 
that Tick Tock is dead, and now we have 
“Process, 
Architecture, 
Optimization.” 
In simple terms, Intel can’t keep up with 
its self-imposed strategy of introducing 
a new production process and then chip 
architecture in successive years. So Kaby 
Lake, with hindsight, has been classified 
as an optimization, the third 14nm family 
of CPUs following Broadwell and Skylake.
The 
7600K 
slots 
into 
what 
has 
traditionally been the gaming enthusiast’s 
favored slot, namely the top of the Core 
i5 model tree, complete with unlocked 
CPU multiplier for simple overclocking. 
As a Core i5 chip, it doesn’t offer Hyper-
Threading. Four cores and four threads are 
your lot. But with a base clock of 3.8GHz 
and a Turbo speed of 4.2GHz, it’s 300MHz 
faster than its progenitor from the Skylake 
generation, the Core i5-6600K. 6MB of 
cache and support for dual-channel DDR4 
Third time lucky with 14nm
Intel Core i5-7600K
memory up to 2,400MHz round out the key 
CPU specifications.
The chip also has Intel’s latest integrated 
graphics in HD 630 trim. That’s unlikely to 
be of much interest to most customers, 
almost all of whom will be pairing the 
7600K with some kind of dedicated graphics 
solution. The possible exception to that 
involves support for 4K Netflix streaming, 
though that itself may be problematic in 
concert with a discrete graphics card, and 
immediately we are going round in circles. 
A complication for another day, we think.
Against the clock
Anyway, to the benchmarks. At stock 
clocks, the new 7600K is unexciting. 
It’s quicker than the old 6600K by about 
the amount you’d expect, based on the 
increased clock speeds. So that’s single-
digit increases in performance across 
the board, in percentage terms. That’s 
definitely better than nothing. But it’s also 
the sort of incremental improvement that’s 
become the norm from Intel of late. The 
harsh truth is that you will struggle to feel 
the difference in the real world between 
the old 6600K and the new 7600K.
Until, that is, you throw overclocking 
into the equation. This thing really flies 
when you open up the overclocking taps. 
The old 6600K could typically crank up an 
extra 600MHz or so, or 4.5GHz overall. But 
the 7600K winds up to 5.2GHz with ease 
using auto voltage settings. That’s a nice, 
round 1GHz overclock. It’s been a long time 
coming, but with Kaby Lake, Intel CPUs are 
once again absolutely worth overclocking.
That’s a very welcome and exciting 
development. 
But 
here’s 
where 
the 
philosophizing comes in. Even with that 
overclock, you’re only looking at about a 
10 percent improvement in performance 
over Skylake. That’s not a huge surprise, of 
course. Kaby Lake is a minor revision, not 
a brand new architecture. It doesn’t have 
any additional CPU cores, either. Thus it’s 
a far cry from the kind of step forward we 
once saw when Intel, say, first introduced a 
dual- or quad-core processor, and virtually 
doubled performance in one fell swoop.
Meanwhile, AMD’s Ryzen is just around 
the corner, and if it’s as good as we hope, 
we might finally see Intel pull out the stops 
and start adding cores to its mainstream 
CPUs in order to keep things competitive. 
All of which means the extent to which Kaby 
Lake and the new 7600K get you fired up is 
all about context. Compared to other recent 
refreshes, it’s great. It’s also indisputably 
the weapon of choice for gamers on a 
middling budget. But in the broader context 
of CPU development over the past decade, 
the 7600K is hardly revolutionary. It’s not 
exactly cheap, either. –jeremy laird

The Core i5-7600K is a  
familiar package, but with  
an overclocking twist.

mar 2017

We once heard the original Xbox described 
as “Batman’s briefcase crossed with a 
supercomputer.” Apologies to Microsoft, 
but Eurocom’s Sky X9E2 now deserves that 
mantle. This beast of a gaming machine is 
one of the most powerful portable systems 
we’ve ever tested. Of course, “portable” is 
something of a relative term. The Sky X9 
itself weighs in at (only) 12 pounds—not 
bad, considering the hardware inside—but 
it requires two massive 330W power bricks 
to run at full juice, and those weigh nearly 
three pounds each.
Of course, all that weight is well spent. 
Packed inside the Sky X9’s minimalist 
black case is more power than most 
high-end gaming desktops. An Intel Core 
i7-6700K clocked at 4GHz serves as the 
brains of the operation, with a turbo up to 
4.2GHz supported. We actually managed 
to overclock the CPU even higher, but 
more on that later. For storage, our 
unit was equipped with a single 512GB 
Samsung SM951 NVMe SSD, but the 
system can support an additional M.2 SSD, 
as well as up to two 2.5-inch drives. RAM 
amounted to 32GB of DDR4-3000, while 
ports included five USB 3.0 (one of them 
powered), two Thunderbolt 3, two mini 
DisplayPort 1.3, and one HDMI 2.0 output. 
The full-size keyboard features full RGB 
backlighting, and the touchpad is equipped 
with a biometric fingerprint reader. But the 
crowning component is the twin desktop-
class GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs in SLI. 
It should go without saying that the Sky 
X9 is more than capable of running any 
game at 1080p max settings. However, in 
our testing, we found that GTX 1080 SLI 
does not play nice with lower resolution 
formats. Rise of the Tomb Raider and Far 
Cry Primal both performed better in 1080p 
with SLI disabled, pulling in an average of 
130fps and 104fps respectively, compared 
to 101fps and 80fps with SLI activated. The 
Division, on the other hand, benefitted from 
the extra GPU at 1080p ultra, performing 
at an average of 137fps, as opposed to 100 
without SLI enabled. 3DMark Fire Strike 
A portable gaming monster
Eurocom Sky X9E2
also enjoyed the extra GPU juice, scoring 
20,237 without SLI, and 22,473 with.
But why would you want to game at 
1080p when you have two GTX 1080s and, 
more importantly, a G-Sync enabled 4K 
screen. (The system can also be configured 
with a 2560x1440p 120Hz TN screen, also 
with G-Sync.) We’re usually hesitant to 
recommend gaming at 4K, as even the 
GTX 1080 struggles to consistently lock 
down 60fps without a twin to share the 
load. But that’s exactly what the Sky X9 
has inside, and it does the job swimmingly. 
Luckily, every game we tested benefitted 
from the second GPU. More impressively, 
the pair of cards was able to consistently 
stay above 60fps in 4K resolution, even 
with the settings cranked up to the max. 
We recorded an average of 78fps across 
Rise of the Tomb Raider’s three-part 
benchmark at 4K max settings, while Far 
Cry Primal and The Division scored 73 and 
66fps respectively. Needless to say, it’s 
incredibly impressive to perform at such a 
high bar—to do it on a laptop is just insane.
Some like it hot
With all its stellar gaming performance, 
the most impressive thing about the Sky 
X9E2 is its portability. Sure, you’ll never 
actually use it on your lap, but even with 
its massive twin power bricks in tow, the 
Sky X9 can be put in a backpack and lugged 
across town—or across the country. It 
would be heavy, yes, but not nearly the 
weight of carrying a full-size desktop rig. 
It also doesn’t require an external cooling 
dock, like the Asus ROG GX800VH we 
reviewed way back in our Holiday issue. 
It’s worth noting that, despite being listed 
as optional, we found the second power 
brick to be a requirement. The system 
boots up and charges with only one PSU 
attached, but as soon as the GPU heats 
up and the fans start spinning—even with 
SLI disabled—it draws too much power 
for the single brick to handle. After a few 
minutes playing Overwatch (in 1080p with 
SLI disabled), the brick shut itself down,

switching the system over to battery, and 
massively throttling performance. 
Speaking of heat, man does it get hot. 
Eurocom says the system’s “state-of-the-
art thermal solution” uses industrial-grade 
copper heatsinks, centripetal fans, and a 
layered, socketed motherboard system 
designed for thermal efficiency. What that 
means in practice is a trio of crazy-loud 
fans blasting heat out the back. They keep 
the components cool, as we didn’t have 
any internal thermal issues, even when 
overclocking, but we’d be wary of situating 
anything heat-sensitive around back. 
All 
the 
testing 
(and 
benchmarks 
opposite) 
were 
conducted 
without 
overclocking, but thanks to Sky X9’s Z170 
chipset, you can squeeze a bit of extra power 
out of the CPU and GPUs. The unlocked 
Core i7-6700K is clocked at 4GHz and listed 
as overclockable up to 4.2, but we managed 
to push it as high as 4.5GHz without major 
instability. The GPUs, similarly, can handle 
a bit of extra juice, though we only saw an 
improvement of 2–3fps in Tomb Raider at 
4K. It didn’t really seem worth the effort, 
but then, every frame matters when trying 
to eke out 60fps in 4K.
All told, the Eurocom Sky X9E2 is an 
incredibly impressive system. Could you get 
equal or better (and quieter) performance 
out of a desktop build? Sure, but you can’t 
toss a desktop into a backpack, and take it

The Spectre is delightfully 
thin, but it’s not to 
everyone’s tastes.

The dream of power and portability is 
often pondered on these pages. We see 
plenty of powerful desktop replacements, 
and a fair selection of svelte ultrabooks, 
too, but very few systems have managed 
to successfully combine both disciplines. 
The latest system attempting to tackle 
this tricky marriage is the HP Spectre—a 
super-thin machine that appears to pack 
a list of impressive hardware into its 
diminutive form.
First, a quick word on looks—this 
machine isn’t going to excite everyone. 
The faux bronze rear bar and hinge are a 
touch too kitsch for some, and the large 
bezel around the screen annoyed a couple 
on our team as well. So, even if you like it, 
don’t expect everyone to swoon in a similar 
way. The materials do feel a little plasticky 
compared 
to 
a 
certain 
fruit-themed 
competitor, too. Even so, the system’s 
weight and size are well balanced—it’s 
light, but not flimsy, and compact without 
being pokey.
The screen is a sensible compromise of 
current tech—the 13.3-inch Full HD display 
offers a reasonable 166 pixel per inch, and 
gives the integrated Intel HD Graphics 520 
an (admittedly slim) chance of rendering 
games at the native resolution. We’re sure 
there’s a marketing bod somewhere who’s 
apoplectic about it not being a 4K display, 
but at this screen size, such a move would 
do little more than give you a headache.
Working our way around the laptop, 
there’s not much on offer in the form of 
Portability and power—fantasy or the new reality?
HP Spectre
connectivity. The sides are too thin to 
house USB slots, so the only ports you’ll 
find are on the back edge of the machine. 
There you’ll find three USB 3.0 Type-C 
ports (one of which doubles as the charging 
port) alongside a 3.5mm audio jack. The 
latter being useful should the built-in Bang 
& Olufsen speakers not quite fit the bill 
for your public audio entertainment—the 
sound quality is reasonable enough, mind.
USB Type-C connectors may be the 
future, but as any Apple fanboy will attest, 
you’re going to need a USB converter 
until that future arrives. The good news is 
that most things are covered well by the 
Spectre itself. The keyboard is comfortable 
to type on, and there’s subtle under-key 
lighting to help you navigate in the dark. 
The touchpad is a good size and silky 
smooth in use. However, we did find the left 
and right buttons took some getting used 
to, although because you can’t easily plug 
in a mouse (due to the lack of Type-A ports), 
it’s worth persevering with that touchpad.
Counting cores
On the whole, the criticisms thus far have 
been minor: Our main reservation is with 
the processor. The Core i7-6500U may have 
you thinking this is a veritable cutting-edge 
powerhouse, but it’s better thought of as a 
Core i3, as it only boasts a pair of physical 
cores. Yes, it does boost this with Hyper-
Threading, so it can handle four threads at 
once, but with most Core i7s laying claim to 
four physical cores and eight threads, this 
CPU looks a little less impressive than the 
specs may suggest.
Our 
fears 
are 
born 
out 
in 
our 
benchmarks, with scores roughly half of 
what we’d expect at this price. At least 
the storage subsystem provides a fair lick 
of speed—and, to be fair, when it comes 
to normal use, it genuinely feels speedy. 
And given the form factor, it’s arguably 
the portability that is more important. 
That said, we weren’t overwhelmed by the 
machine’s stamina either—managing just 
under four hours when playing Full HD 
video is hardly remarkable. We would have 
liked to see much more from this machine.
 Overall, while the Spectre checks many 
of our boxes, particularly on the aesthetic 
and form factor front, it ultimately pulls up 
short in areas where it needs to excel. More 
raw power from the processor would be an 
obvious place to start, and a better battery 
wouldn’t hurt either. An updated spin of this 
machine boasting a Kaby Lake CPU will be 
available soon, and that could help things 
significantly. As of right now, though, it’s 
just shy of brilliant. –Alan dexter

So many Motherboards! This certainly 
isn’t the first, nor shall it be the last Z270 
mobo we review. MSI’s XPower Gaming 
Titanium is the new Z270 motherboard 
from the Micro-Star labs, and boy is she 
pretty. Lacquered from head to toe in 
a combination of black and silver, this 
ATX mobo is as striking as it is powerful. 
Designed for overclockers seeking the 
maximum level of performance possible, 
the XPower supports a plethora of 
overclocking choices, including voltage 
measure points, an additional section of 
PCB with onboard buttons to increase and 
decrease voltage and multiplier, and, of 
course, full support for LN2 and disabling 
fast boot mode, to whip those high-end 
frequencies into shape.
But that’s not what really interests us 
about this motherboard. No, it’s something 
a little more down to earth: storage. If 
you’ve glanced over at the shot on the 
left, you may have spotted a curious little 
addition, resting snugly in the middle of the 
bank of PCIe slots. A small, thin, detailed 
strip of metallic alloy, adorned with the 
words “M.2 Shield.” It addresses one of 
the biggest issues M.2 PCIe drives face: 
thermal throttling. Regardless of whether 
you have a $1,400 2TB Samsung 960 Pro, or 
a $120 256GB ADATA XPG SX8000, you’re 
A Z270 return for silver surfer
MSI Z270 XPower 
Gaming Titanium
going to encounter thermal throttling 
issues. No matter how much it costs, at a 
certain point, every drive begins to throttle. 
Samsung claims that its new 960 Pro 
drives dissipate just enough heat—thanks 
to an intuitively designed “heat-spreader 
label” (yup, that’s a thing)—that they don’t 
begin to throttle until after 333GB of data 
has been transferred on to or across from 
the device. That’s a hefty figure, but as 
you reduce price and investment, thermal 
throttling becomes more of an issue.
Shield everything
This is where MSI comes in. The M.2 shield 
is comprised of two components: the 
metal top, and an additional thermal pad 
below the guard. This touches the very 
top of the memory chips on the M.2 drive, 
drawing heat up and away from it, and into 
what effectively becomes a heatsink. This 
means that more aggressive workloads 
can be handled for longer, without the drive 
throttling—plus, it hides those god-awful 
ugly green PCBs neatly away.
Keeping with storage, there’s a few other 
tidbits we really appreciated here, too. The 
inclusion of three M.2 ports, RAID-enabled 
for astronomical sequential reads and 
writes, is a nice touch. And although we’re 
still not certain whether it’s a dud or not, 
Intel’s U.2 connection standard (something 
that was limited to Asus motherboards, 
last gen) is also supported below the usual 
plethora of SATA ports.
On to performance, then. In short, we 
weren’t super-impressed with how well 
the XPower Gaming Titanium performed 
this time around. As we write this, we’re 
still strictly under NDA, with Intel not 
set to launch its new Kaby Lake desktop 
experience for at least another two 
weeks—however, first impressions aren’t 
exactly 
overwhelming, 
especially 
for 
an overclocking board. In our tests, we 
achieved lower overclocks, with higher 
voltages, across our testing range. The 
XPower needed 1.3V on the Vcore to achieve 
5GHz on our current Core i7-7700K, versus 
the Asus Maximus IX Hero’s 1.27V. It 
achieved a maximum stable overclock of 
5.0GHz, versus the Asus’s 5.1GHz. And 
the lowest voltage we managed to keep 
the core running stable with at stock was 
a dismal 1.09V, versus the Hero’s 1.07V. 
Now, you could say we’re splitting hairs 
here, but the Hero is designed to be a 
mainstream board, while the XPower 
is aimed at the upper echelons of world 
record breakers. It’s possible we may see 
some improvement in the future, thanks 
to BIOS updates and software reworkings, 
but, for the time being at least, the XPower 
doesn’t quite hit the mark. –zak storey

Kaby Lake has launched, and we’re on 
our way to being buried by the latest and 
greatest from the big three motherboard 
manufacturers. Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte 
are churning out new iterations faster than 
we can say “Conway Twitty,” and that’s 
no bad thing. These boards have been in 
development for some time, and with the 
first murmurs heard back at CES 2016, it’s 
easy to understand why manufacturers 
are so eager to get their foot in the door, 
and your money in their pockets. 
Here we have the kingpin of Asus’s 
motherboard arsenal, and a follow-up to 
one of its best-selling mobos of all time. 
The Maximus IX Hero is a beauty. Asus 
has done away with the black and red of 
its eighth-generation ROG predecessor, 
opting for a dark black and metallic 
aesthetic instead. The reason is obvious, 
and something Asus corrected with the 
launch of the Maximus VIII Formula: If 
you have a red motherboard, it’s not going 
to work well with any color other than 
red, white, or black. This new aesthetic, 
combined with the lighting on both the 
chipset and the rear I/O plate, ensures 
that you can color-coordinate your system 
without worry.
Moving on, Asus has included an 
additional M.2 port below the processor, 
Small changes, 
big difference
two 
more 
fan 
headers 
along 
the 
side closest to the 24-pin 
power, a direct USB 3.1 port 
on board, and it’s relegated the 
USB 3.0 front I/O connector to the 
bottom of the board, as opposed to 
its usual position cozying up to the 24-
pin. On top of that, Asus has stripped the 
Maximus IX Hero of SATA Express ports 
entirely, and as a result, it’s also lost two 
of the SATA 3 ports. Considering the damp 
squib that SATA Express became, we’re 
not sad to see it go. An interesting change 
we didn’t expect to witness is the lack of 
U.2 port, especially as Asus reintroduced 
the Hero Alpha featuring the U.2 port as 
standard. Diving into the box, there isn’t 
even an M.2 to U.2 adapter. This suggests 
that Asus isn’t putting as much faith in U.2 
as it is M.2, which makes sense, especially 
when you consider just how tightly locked 
Intel has the U.2 connection standard. 
And, to be frank, with the likes of Samsung 
producing some fantastic M.2 drives, with 
higher capacities and better performance 
than many of Intel’s best U.2 SSDs, we’re 
not particularly surprised.
BIOS-wise, 
the 
Hero 
IX 
is 
the 
same familiar affair we’re all used to. 
Overclocking features remain resolutely 
identical to Z170, 
with trademark tools 
such as Asus Enhanced 
Ratios, and the ability to 
adjust the VRM efficiency still 
remaining inside AI Tweak. The board’s 
overclocking performance is strong as 
well, with our chip achieving an impressive 
5GHz, with a meager 1.25V on the VCore. 
VDroop is less than 0.01V, and overall 
performance is exceedingly similar to our 
other Asus board.
All in all, this update to the Hero board 
changes a good deal of aesthetic properties, 
while removing a lot of the wasted space 
allocated to older connection standards 
that just weren’t cutting it anymore. We 
do wish Asus had included one additional 
USB 3.0 internal header, but otherwise 
there’s very little for us to complain about. 
If you’re thinking of upgrading from Ivy 
Bridge or Haswell, the Maximus IX Hero, in 
combination with a Core i5-7600K or above, 
is a fantastic solution. –Zak storey

Samsung’s premium “Pro” drives are 
pretty much the go-to SSDs for enthusiasts 
seeking the best in solid-state storage 
performance. The latest 960 Pro is a 
barnstormer of an SSD. But it ain’t cheap.
In 512GB M.2 configuration, the smallest 
option, it rocks in at a recommended retail 
of $329. That’s pretty fancy for the 500GB 
segment, which is where the 960 Evo steps 
in, again in M.2 format. Like previous “Evo” 
models, it gives you much of that Samsung 
SSD goodness, just in a more affordable 
package. That’s the theory, at least.
The core specs certainly look promising. 
For starters, you can have it in 250GB 
format, as tested here, which brings the 
price down dramatically. It’s well under 
half the price of the smallest 960 Pro. But 
like the Pro, the Evo also comes with the 
Polaris controller chip. That’s Samsung’s 
latest controller. With the Polaris chip 
comes support for both quad-lane PCI 
Express 4.0 connectivity and the solid-
state-friendly NVMe control protocol.
Where things begin to differ involves 
the flash memory. Both drives sport 
Samsung’s cutting-edge V-NAND, so-
called because of the layers (48 of them) 
of memory cells, stacked vertically atop 
one another. The difference with the Evo 
compared to the Pro is that it gets triple-
level cell memory to the Pro’s dual-level. 
The former makes for greater data density 
Proof that cache comes at a cost
and thus lower prices. But it also comes at 
a cost to both performance and durability.
In terms of the official specs, the impact 
varies. The peak sequential numbers look 
solid at first glance, even for this entry-
level 250GB drive. Samsung says it’s good 
for 3.2GB/s reads and 1.5GB/s writes. The 
latter is a fair distance off the 2.1GB/s of 
the smallest 960 Pro, for instance, but it’s 
still a big old number.
Cache flow
Look closely at the spec sheet, however, 
and you’ll note that write performance is 
enabled by the SLC write cache, a block 
of flash memory running in single-level 
mode and acting as a write buffer. For this 
250GB drive, it measures 13GB. Problem 
is, if you exhaust the cache, performance 
drops off dramatically. Samsung says 
sustained performance once the cache is 
filled comes in at just 300MB/s. Yikes.
Drive endurance, meanwhile, tumbles 
from 400TB for the entry-level 960 Pro to 
100TB. Similarly, Samsung clips the Evo’s 
warranty down to three years from the 
Pro’s five years. That said, there’s less 
collateral damage to the cost-cutting when 
it comes to random access performance. 
The Evo 250GB is good for 330K IOPS reads 
and 300K writes. 
The Evo delivers on its claimed peak 
performance in a benchmark like ATTO, 
with 3.2GB/s reads and 1.5GB/s writes. 
More nuanced metrics that sidestep tricks 
such as on-the-fly compression, however, 
show the limitations of the Evo’s cost-
conscious configuration. For starters, 
it only musters around 1.7GB/s reads in 
CrystalMark’s sequential benchmark.
The more revealing measure is the 89 
seconds the Evo needs to motor through 
our 30GB internal file copy test—roughly 
twice as long as the Pro needs. On the 
other hand, the Evo is seriously slick in 
CrystalMark’s 4K random access tests. 
4K performance makes a big difference to 
how responsive a drive feels, so it’s great 
to see that the Evo scores well there.
How much you’re worried by the patchy 
sequential performance depends on your 
workloads. The Evo is still fast, especially 
compared to anything that hooks up to 
an old-school SATA interface. But if you 
routinely shunt large files around, you will 
inevitably keep bumping into the limitations 
of that SLC cache. Those caveats aside, this 
is a nice little M.2 drive from arguably the 
best in the SSD business. –jeremy laird

SteelSeries has ladled on the gimmicks 
with its sport-inspired Arctis series, 
and while the model 3 lacks the USB 
connectivity and RGB lighting of the 
Arctis  5 ($20 more), and the wireless 
convenience of the Arctis 7 ($70 more), it’s 
still toting the lion’s share of the family’s 
genius touches. So, let’s dissect, starting 
with that funky ski-goggle headband, a 
feature most commonly seen on concept 
VR headsets. It makes the Arctis 3 infinitely 
adjustable and, once you’ve got it set just 
right, monumentally comfortable. It does 
take a little getting used to, since—despite 
claims that it eliminates pressure points—
it seems to exert more direct pressure 
across your dome than a traditional padded 
band would. We’d like to blame at least 
one early headache on wearing it before it 
was properly adjusted, although our legal 
advisors point out that it could equally 
have been caused by our simultaneous, 
unblinking analysis of 4K footage. 
Next up on the block, the Arctis’s 
modular cabling. It’s wonderfully long 
and stylishly gray. It gives you the option 
of switching between a four-pole and a 
pair of three-pole jacks in a tidy way. It is 
also a colossal pain in the rear. Several 
times during our test, we had the heart-in-
mouth worry of audio dropping out. Would 
we have to send a trashed headset back 
to SteelSeries with a groveling apology? 
No. We’d have to plug the cable back in to 
the right earpiece, or into the mid-cable 
join, where it had worked its way loose 
because we’d deigned to move our head 
just slightly. A little thing—probably not a 
deal-breaker, considering you’re unlikely 
to end up in a situation where a frayed 
Cool, but by no means calm, audio
cable renders your $80 headset useless—
but it’s irritating nonetheless.
The slide-out bendy mic is super-neat, 
and among the best microphones we’ve 
tested on headsets in this price range. It’s 
clear, sensitive, and stands up very well 
to being boosted by software. If you’re 
buying this for speaking, you won’t be 
disappointed. Again, though, the specter of 
irritation creeps in. It’s bendy, but doesn’t 
seem to want to stay exactly where you’ve 
put it, and it’s an absolute magnet for 
disgusting breathing noise. What’s more, 
the mic mute function is reached through 
a tiny, lightly recessed button on the right 
ear; finding it while wearing the headset is 
hard enough, let alone finding it without 
inadvertently knocking the cable out…. 
Skullduggery
Despite a couple of questionable design 
choices, the Arctis 3 is a well-constructed, 
sexy-looking set of closed-back cans, with 
90-degree earpiece rotation, and pillow-
soft velour pads—dubbed “Airweave” by 
SteelSeries—that feel just awesome. It’s 
light enough, and we found it a lot less tight 
on the head than other headsets, perhaps 
because of the unusually narrow head of 
your reviewer, or perhaps because it really 
is a little looser. Whether this is a positive 
or negative feature depends on both your 
skull and your personal preferences. 
We’ve hit a lot of negative niggles, so 
here’s the turnaround: the Arctis 3’s audio 
quality is fantastic. Seriously, it’s delicious. 
There’s a brilliant, well-balanced sound 
stage on offer, one that doesn’t fight you 
with overwhelming bass, or pierce your 
ears with spiky treble. The middle doesn’t 
get lost, and the details remain pin-sharp. 
But don’t make the mistake of thinking 
it’s at all flat—this headset is the elected 
mayor of Rich City, and it’s not going to be 
leaving office for some time. We could, and 
did, sit and listen to the Arctis’s S1 drivers 
all day, although the 7.1 surround didn’t 
blow us away like we thought it might. Does 
it stand up to the same-price HyperX Cloud 
II in terms of overall construction quality 
and design acumen? No. But it could be 
more comfortable if your head suits it, 
and it’s a definite contender in the audio 
stakes—niggles and all. –Alex Cox

Not 
a 
self-aware 
calculator 
from 
Cyberdyne Systems, but the latest in a 
familiar line from Razer. The Elite marks 
the DeathAdder’s tenth anniversary in 
style, by adding a couple of extra buttons, 
for a total of seven.
That’s a little unfair. There’s a new 
optical sensor, too, squeezing an extra 
6,000 dots into every inch when compared 
to the DeathAdder Chroma, and new 
Razer-made switches under the buttons, 
now rated for 50 million clicks.
The DeathAdder has always been 
Razer’s Jack-of-all-trades gaming mouse, 
aimed at those who don’t like to specialize 
in one kind of title, but let their fingers 
wander all over the Steam store. Despite 
this, Razer has chosen to plaster the 
promotional material with its eSports 
branding. For once, however, it makes a 
bit of sense—the DeathAdder Elite is built 
around accuracy and speed, two things 
that might have an effect when a few pixels 
make a difference between who wins and 
who’s left crying into their Gatorade. 
Anybody who’s not competing for large 
prize pots will be happy with the mouse, too, 
unless you try to hold it in your left hand. 
There’s not even a hint of ambidexterity 
about the DeathAdder, and Razer produces 
a left-handed version of the DeathAdder to 
compensate for those who, according to a 
study from the University of Montpellier, 
are better in fights. The strictly right-
handed ergonomics means that it’s a 
good fit for a lot of hands, with the rubber 
pad below the side buttons providing a 
particularly grippy surface from which to 
flick your thumb up to the switches above. 
There’s another grippy patch on the 
other side, perfect for the third finger 
When he had pressed the seventh button, there 
was silence in heaven
while your first two are on the main 
buttons, which are molded into the top of 
the mouse, and have a cute little cleft in 
them, so your fingers can slip perfectly into 
the sweet spot. The back of the mouse is 
humped, ready to support your palm as you 
bash away at your games, leading to less 
fatigue if you’re in the habit of spending 
hours twitching back and forth before 
achieving a satisfying conclusion. The two 
new buttons nestle just above the wheel, 
which has newly sprouted nodules on it, 
in a departure from the chunky divisions 
of the DeathAdder Chroma. We don’t know 
whether it makes it any easier to rotate, 
as the Chroma’s wheel was already pretty 
good at that, but you certainly know when 
your finger is gently caressing it, with no 
chance of mistaking it for the body of the 
mouse and making a horrible mistake.
Clicky questions
Unlike 
every 
other 
gaming 
mouse 
manufacturer in the world, Razer doesn’t 
use Omron switches. Instead, it creates 
its own.... in association with Omron. This 
puts us in a philosophical situation—are 
the switches Omrons or not? And does 
it matter? The answer is “not really”—
Razer’s switches are responsive, give a 
decent click (every bank of buttons makes 
a different noise, the wheel and two new 
buttons rather muted compared to the 
bright, trebly clicks of the main buttons, 
with the side switches somewhere in 
between), and with the huge lifespan now 
built into them, could be bothering your 
online opponents for many years to come. 
Underneath, two shiny plastic panels

very understated rectangular window. 
As this isn’t the kind of customizable 
mouse that keeps weights handy, there’s 
no removable panel to go poking around 
behind. Customization comes from the 16.8 
million color Chroma lighting system and 
the programmable buttons, all controlled 
through the usual Synapse software.
This is a reasonably priced mouse in a 
world where you can spend a great deal 
more money and not get such a well-
made product. What it lacks in bells and 
whistles, it makes up for in subtlety and 
class, and by concentrating on accuracy 
and speed, it zeroes in on the things mice 
are meant to do. –Ian Evenden

BitFenix has long been a favorite for 
those looking for a mid-range chassis. 
The Shinobi, for instance, was exceedingly 
popular because of its simple design and 
affordable price point. Over the years, the 
company has continued to innovate, turning 
away from the traditional rectangular box 
in search of ever more outrageous angles 
and designs. First came the Prodigy, 
followed by the Pandora, then the Aurora, 
all featuring the curvaceous style that 
BitFenix is now known for. Speaking of the 
Pandora, it’s one of the few cases we’ve 
never 
reviewed—until 
now. 
However, 
instead of requesting the little-bitty 
microATX variant, we decided to opt for the 
more rambunctious full-tower version. 
From the get-go, it certainly hits the 
mark for that bonkers style we associate 
with BitFenix. The curved steel side panels 
meld into the front of the chassis, held on 
by two screws at the rear and a simple 
pop-hinge near the front. They’re not the 
sturdiest of panels, and there’s a degree of 
flex to the two of them, but they get the job 
done, and should easily help mask cable 
management issues without worry.
The real showpiece, however, is the LED 
logo at the front of the case. Connecting 
to the motherboard via a single internal 
USB header, you can change and adjust 
the logo that’s shown on the 2.8-inch color 
display through software. It’s worth noting 
that this option isn’t available on the more 
budget-friendly Core variant, though.
The internal layout looks good, too. 
There are mounting trays for two 2.5-
inch SSDs to be displayed through the 
window, a 3.5-inch mount just above 
the PSU cover, and a rubberized pump 
mount, too, along with the usual plethora 
of rubber grommets. Looking behind the 
motherboard tray, you’ll find two additional 
2.5-inch mounts, and a second 3.5-inch 
hidden below the PSU cover, as well.
But it’s the cooling support where you’ll 
find the really neat features. There’s a 
recessed radiator port—which supports up 
to a 360mm radiator in the roof—just above 
Budget cooling 
craftsmanship
the motherboard tray, carefully tucked 
away out of sight, followed by additional 
support in the front for one more 360mm. 
The neat thing is, you can hide both of them 
if you desire, and still install the fans on 
either the inside or outside. The Pandora 
also comes with an integrated reservoir 
mounting system in its roof. For anyone 
not interested in the rigor and expense 
of liquid cooling, there’s still ample room 
for both traditional tower coolers and AIO 
solutions, too.
Material world
However, the Pandora isn’t without its 
caveats. As we mentioned earlier, the 
choice of material is one of them—the steel 
side panels feel flimsy. And the rest of the 
case is made from a type of ABS plastic 
that feels a little too brittle for our liking. 
On top of that, the pop hinges, although 
simple in design, don’t provide much of a 
handhold when it comes to shifting this 
beast around. BitFenix has somewhat 
remedied this by installing a grip in the 
back of the chassis, but it doesn’t give you 
much confidence when trying to hold on to 
the front of this substantial chassis as well.
All in all, the Pandora ATX is a nicely 
rounded mid-range ATX tower, filled 
with innovative features to support water 
cooling and provide you with a particularly 
easy, clean building experience. The dust 
filters located under the PSU, on the roof, 
and in the front panel are intuitive, and help 
to keep it clean, and for the price, it’s hard 
to beat. –Zak storey

THE GLOBAL AUTHORITY ON PC GAMES

The name Serif has long been associated 
with budget design apps, usually ending 
with 
“Plus.” 
There 
was 
DrawPlus, 
PhotoPlus, and even PagePlus, and while 
they were cheap, they were outclassed by 
other software packages, often costing a 
great deal more, and which ran on Macs. 
While the products improved over time, 
Serif decided to break with the Plus range 
when it launched Affinity Designer, a vector 
graphics app that was initially released only 
on Apple computers, followed by Affinity 
Photo, a raster-editing app. Both then made 
their way to Windows after beta periods 
(in the case of Affinity Photo, a very short 
one, as anyone trying to follow last issue’s 
tutorial may already have found out).
The Affinity products are pro-grade, 
Adobe-troubling apps sold at a reasonable 
price, with no monthly subscriptions. If 
you can do it in Photoshop, the chances 
are you’ll be able to do it in Affinity Photo, 
although sometimes without the same 
levels of user-friendliness we’ve come to 
expect from Adobe’s more mature product, 
and sometimes with remarkable levels 
of thought put in by Serif’s engineers. 
The benefit of the year it spent as a Mac 
exclusive, though, is that the thick-black-
framed-glasses brigade has done the beta 
testing for us.
Affinity is split into parts known as 
“personas,” each of which has its own 
workspace that has a slightly different 
layout and function. Things are in the 
Pro image editing at a reasonable price
same general places, but tools you need 
in one persona aren’t present in another. 
Opening a raw image file takes you to the 
Develop persona, and when you’ve finished 
with your adjustments there, you move 
it into the Photo persona for more edits. 
There’s an Export persona for creating files 
matched to specific requirements, Liquify 
for distortion and warping effects, and 
Tone Mapping for HDR image creation. The 
chances are you’ll spend most of your time 
in Photo, and Develop if you shoot in raw. 
Switching between personas is a simple 
case of clicking an icon at the top of the 
interface—the change is instant, and your 
image moves over with edits intact.
Raw power
Develop only operates on one image at 
a time, like Adobe Camera Raw, rather 
than Lightroom. It’s a full-featured raw 
image converter, with a Clarity slider that’s 
capable of extracting more detail from your 
images, and a useful split view showing 
your image before and after your edits, 
divided by a bar that can be dragged across 
the image with the mouse, to show the full 
scope of your changes.
The Photo persona is where the bulk 
of the editing is done, and while anyone 
who has used Photoshop or Photoshop 
Elements will feel at home, there are some 
differences that can take a while to get used 
to. The tools live on the left, with a selection 
of floating palettes docked on the right, 
where you’ll find common actions such as 
Levels adjustments and Hue/Saturation. 
Affinity also has a top toolbar, populated 
by automatic adjustments, such as Auto 
Levels, plus selection and pasting tools. 
Filters live in their own menu, and as the 
app supports layers, there’s a palette of 
that name with a familiar layer stack, and 
buttons at the bottom for creating new 
layers, masks, and so on. Liquify acts like 
Photoshop’s Liquify filter, enabling you to 
drag areas of your image around as though 
it were made of soft clay, making invisible 
changes or more caricaturish edits.
If you’re looking for a photo-editing 
app to get started with, Affinity makes a 
lot of sense. It’s cheaper than Photoshop 
Elements or a year of Photoshop CC’s 
photographers’ bundle, and while it lacks 
those packages’ organizational abilities—
it’s not going to help you make sense of a 
vast photo library—its editing skills stand 
alongside Adobe’s finest. –ian Evenden

Heroic hackers hound corporate bullies
Watch Dogs 2
A game in which you spend 30 hours 
conspiring to bring about a giant DDoS 
attack by getting people who like you to 
backdoor their own PCs and phones may 
seem like it’s casting you as the bad guy, as 
would the beatings you hand out to security 
guards. But as you’re sticking it to a large 
corporation that keeps records of people’s 
private lives, you get some rebellious cool 
points that elevate you to hero status.
Watch Dogs 2 takes a trip through the 
headlines of today’s and tomorrow’s news 
sites, having you hack emails and take 
on corporate interests for the presumed 
benefit of San Francisco’s grateful citizens. 
It’s presented as an open-world stealth 
game, as you use your hacking powers to 
move unseen through the environment by 
taking over cameras and opening electronic 
locks from afar. It undoes this by requiring 
your physical presence at keyboards and 
terminals, meaning you must make your 
way there past the NPC guards you could 
circumvent by piloting one of your drones.
Despite three-word backstories for 
you to read while you drain their bank 
accounts, most NPCs are a bit robotic. 
Remote-controlling a forklift truck to run 
over and kill the director of a really bad 
movie alerts the security guards just fine, 
but they’re more interested in the guy in the 
hoodie watching them from afar than they 
perhaps should be. Leave your car blocking 
the road, and they patiently queue for hours 
like they’re British or something, or loiter in 
the doorway of a shop watching the fallout 
from an explosion you set off earlier (we 
have questions about how you hack pipes, 
but given that you re-route power supplies 
by playing Pipe Mania, perhaps it shouldn’t 
come as such a surprise) until you get 
frustrated and drive a motorcycle through 
them. Then, someone round the corner 
dials 911, and the police kill you. 
If some of this is starting to sound a bit 
like a GTA game, that’s because Rockstar’s 
series is the obvious point of comparison, as 
you steal cars to get around and carry out 
phoned-in missions. While your aims are 
more altruistic than Franklin and Trevor’s, 
you can still go blasting your way through,

In this park, there’s always room for high rollers
Planet Coaster
Sunny skies have been missing from 
videogames for much of this century, so any 
opportunity to escape the grimdark worlds 
of COD or Gears of War is welcome. This 
month’s other game review, Watch Dogs 2, 
presents players with a suitably sweltering 
San Francisco, but no game can match 
Planet Coaster for sheer summer fun.
Another thing we haven’t seen much 
of, unless you’re into soccer or farming, 
is management games. 2013’s SimCity 
wasn’t a huge success, and now Frontier 
is resurrecting theme park management.
And what a resurrection. Planet Coaster 
is sunshine collected and condensed 
into something endlessly entertaining, a 
game dedicated to making people happy, 
rather than making them dead. Frontier’s 
experience with Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 
and Thrillville shows through, and across 
the Career, Challenge, and Sandbox 
modes, there’s a wealth of imagination and 
friendliness on offer.
Building rides is fiddly due to the need to 
run paths to and from the ride’s entrance 
and exit. For the entrance, a special “queue 
path” is needed, while any old path will do 
for the exit. This isn’t obvious if you haven’t 
watched the tutorials, which are hosted on 
YouTube, and open in a browser window on 
the game’s opening screen. Doing it this 
way takes agency away from the player, and 
isn’t really a substitute for a proper tutorial. 
You can work through the easiest scenarios 
to pick up the basics, but when something 
doesn’t click, like the queue paths didn’t for 
us, frustration can set in.
The rest of the time, building your 
park is a breeze. Sandbox mode allows 
you to alter the terrain, leveling it under 
rides, and creating the perfect slope 
for a large rollercoaster. Rides are built 
from blueprints, apart from the large 
rollercoasters, 
which 
are 
bespoke, 
assembled from a kit of parts, and graded 
on the excitement, fear, and nausea they 
provoke. The key to a great coaster is to 
get a balance of the three, and a heatmap 
is provided during testing to show where 
the puke may fly, but it’s always wise to hire 
janitors to clear up spillages in the exit path, 
and mechanics to make sure things don’t

I’ve been chatting with the team a lot 
about high-end builds. The current debate is 
whether or not such systems should opt for 
a single GTX Titan X or a pair of GTX 1080s. 
I’ve always assumed that the dual-card 
setup would perform better, and at a lower 
price, but after finally having the chance to 
try both options out, I’m beginning to lean 
toward a single Titan as the way to go.
Why? Because SLI is a nightmare to 
work with. Not only does it lead to more 
system instability, it’s also a complete 
crapshoot in terms of performance output. 
Depending on the game and resolution, not 
only did a second GPU often not give me the 
performance increase over a single card 
you might expect, I sometimes found that 
the dual-card setup performed worse than 
if it were a single GPU pulling all the weight. 
To make matters worse, SLI does not play 
nice with DirectX 12, and is useless 
for games using Unity or Unreal Engine. 
Meanwhile, the dearer Titan X performs 
admirably in almost every situation, despite 
technically not being a “gaming” GPU.
The only situation we’ve found where dual 
1080s are better is when gaming at 4K. For 
all its power, the Titan X doesn’t have enough 
juice to consistently hold 60fps at 4K at max 
settings in the most demanding games. Dual 
1080s seem to be able to pull that off much 
better (provided the game supports SLI). 
But is it worth the lack of support and sense 
of uncertainty that comes with SLI? I think 
no. The solution? Get a single Titan X and 
game at 1440p. Instead of fooling with SLI 
or 4K, opt for a G-Sync enabled high-refresh 
monitor and thank us later.
Is two always better than one?

“Bluetooth sports headphones? What 
is this? A lifestyle mag?” Don’t worry, we 
haven’t gone mad. Creative dropped by 
last month to show off its new hardware, 
and chief among other crazy offerings, 
such as an RGB LED lit soundbar, were 
these dainty Bluetooth headphones. 
Why did I decide to take a look? 
Well, I’m a bit of a mountain bike junky. 
Crashing very expensive carbon fiber 
bikes down particularly gnarled hills is 
how I get my kicks. And to do that, I need 
to train. Currently, I use a pair of $15 
Sennheiser MX 365 in-ears for my gym 
work, and although the bass is plentiful, 
and the sound quality quite charming, 
they do have a habit of falling out when 
I’m lying flat-back on a bench.
Because of this, I decided I’d give these 
little beauties a shot. They’re available in 
green, black, or orange, are sweat-proof 
(up to IPX4), boast an impressive 11-hour 
battery life, come with an integrated mic 
for calls, and are held in place by two 
terrifying rubber hooks.
As far as audio is concerned, the 
Outliers are fairly well balanced. They 
do need a bigger presence in terms of 
bass and mids, but it’s still an enjoyable 
experience. My biggest gripe rests with 
the plastic-coated cable, which refuses 
to lay flat on your neck. Are they worth 
$70? It depends if you have the cash. They 
definitely offer some ease of access, but 
the nuisance of having to charge them 
every few days puts me off replacing my 
trusty Sennheiser MX 365s just yet. –ZS

oculus rift lens 
inserts
One 
of 
the 
most 
annoying things about 
VR goggles is using 
them 
with 
glasses. 
This is why I stopped using my Rift and Vive 
headsets after just two weeks of play time. If 
you wear contact lenses, though, you’re fine.
But now there’s a solution for us glass-
wearing folks: VR Lens Lab, a company in 
Europe that produces prescription lens 
inserts. The company takes your glasses 
prescription and creates custom lenses that 
fit over the lenses in the Rift and Vive. They 
clip to your VR headset and deliver crisp, 
clear vision. VR Lens Lab can even provide 
you with lenses if you have astigmatism.
I customized my lenses for the Rift, as 
that’s the headset I use most often. You 
can customize your lenses to be plain-
Jane lenses, or with options such as high-
index, premium lenses, and something the 
company calls Blueguard Coating—which 
reduces strain from blue light. Damage 
came in at a very reasonable $100.
I went from virtually zero use to using the 
Rift every day. If you wear glasses, and love 
VR, you need these. VR Lens Lab currently 
only makes lenses for the Rift and Vive, so 
if you intend on using, say, a Samsung Gear 
VR, you’re out of luck.

Corsair & 0dB Fan 
Technologies
I am obsessed with 
noise, or the lack of it. I 
started 2016 with a fully 
liquid-cooled machine, 
propped up by the magnificent power of the 
Noctua NF-F12 iPPC 2,000rpm fans, and 
a Corsair AX1200i. However, after a fitting 
failure, I decided to scrap it in favor of an AIO 
alternative and an aftermarket GTX 1070.
However, it still wasn’t quiet enough, 
so I purchased the Corsair ML120 Pros for 
my new build. On top of that, I installed a 
massive Corsair HX1000i PSU, as I knew 
it took advantage of 0dB fan tech until it 
reached 50 percent load. The difference is 
astronomical. Running the three ML120s 
off the NZXT Kraken X62 means they run 
whisper silent, and are easily configurable 
in the CAM software suite. I have them 
running at around 40 percent load, and 
can barely even hear them. The two GPUs 
also feature 0dB fan tech, and as I lack any 
spinning platter hard drives, noise is almost 
non-existent. At least, until I start typing.
Is this the end of my noise pursuits? 
Likely not. While the Corsair ML120 Pros 
are the things my dreams are made of, 
keeping the din of the GTX 1080s down while 
gaming is impossible. The solution may well 
be another go at hardline liquid-cooling.

WE TACKLE TOUGH READER QUESTIONS ON...
Overclocking SLI
I love your magazine. As 
a constantly deployed US 
Navy sailor, it is always 
great to see when it comes 
into my ship. Your article on 
overclocking was great in 
December 2016. Very clear 
and precise, and better than 
scouring forums. 
On to my questions: I have 
two Nvidia GTX 980 SCs in 
SLI. Do I need to overclock 
them both individually using 
the steps you provided? Or 
can I just do one, and then 
apply the same settings to 
the other card? Can I use 
MSI Afterburner as you guys 
suggested, or do I have to 
use EVGA’s software? MSI’s 
looks more user-friendly 
than the EVGA software I 
have (and kind of hate).
–Nikolai “MUFFS” L.
Reviews Editor Zak Storey 
responds: When it comes to 
overclocking two graphics 
cards, you can either 
treat them individually, or 
as a pair. If you use MSI 
Afterburner, you have the 
option of keeping the cards 
either linked together or 
not—this isn’t related to 
SLI or CrossFire, merely 
overclock settings.
In the default view, 
where your card’s name is 
stated, click the tab that 
says “GPU.” This lists all 
the cards you have installed 
in your system. There 
should be a little up and 
down line symbol to the 
right of each card—if you 
want to just apply one lot 
of settings until either of 
the cards gives way, make 
sure that the two lines are 
identical, and that there’s 
two white dots by both the 
cards’ names. Hit “Apply,” 
and your overclock profile 
is applied to both cards 
simultaneously. If you’re 
curious about whether 
you’ve lucked out a bit 
more on one than the other, 
you can do the opposite, 
and manually overclock 
both, by clicking those two 
lines again, then swapping 
between each card using 
the tab, and applying the 
settings in the UI as normal.
Regarding the EVGA 
software, I’m totally with 
you—I can’t stand it most 
of the time. It can be a little 
trickier with brand new 
cards to find a tool that 
unlocks the voltage; EVGA’s 
was the first, so it was our 
natural port of call. That 
said, like you, I find MSI’s 
far more user-friendly. 
Hypothetically, you can use 
any overclocking software 
you want, on any card, 
regardless of brand. Some 
come with certain security 
locks in place to make sure 
you don’t damage third-
party cards, but otherwise 
you should be fine.
With MSI Afterburner, 
if you want to unlock the 
voltage controls outside 
of power limits, click the 
settings cogwheel, then in 
the third subsection of the 
“General” tab, you should 
see a checkbox that says 
“Unlock voltage control.” 
Make sure it’s checked, then 
click the drop-down box and 
(specifically for your EVGA 
980 SCs) change it to “Third 
party.” It asks to restart the 
application, and you’re good 
to go.
Dust Devil
I am going to be doing one 
of my favorite(!) jobs later 
today—cleaning all the dust 
and gunk out of my desktop 
rig. Though this thing lives in 
a fairly clean environment, 
it does get dirty. So, I got to 
thinking: There has to be a 
simple and reasonable way 
to filter all the air the fans 
are blowing through my rig 
so I can cut my cleaning 
back to... Never! How about 
an article sometime with 
some practical suggestions 
on how to do this, short of 
disconnecting my blowers?
–Garth Cooper
Reviews Editor Zak Storey 
responds: At Maximum PC, 
all of our systems run what 
we call positive-pressure 
fan setups. In essence, 
every place we can install a 
fan, we do so, and in a way 
that means it’s drawing air 
into the chassis. That way, 
all the air entering the case 
is filtered first, and the air 
inside the case is pushed out 
of all of the unfiltered gaps, 
holes, and cracks, stopping 
dust entering the system 
as easily, at least while 
it’s running.
I used to run a balanced 
system, but noticed that 
I was cleaning it out with 
a can of pressurized air 
every couple of weeks. After 
swapping to positive only, 
I could get away with just 
doing it every month or so 
with the same results.
That said, if you’re after 
a quick fix, and don’t fancy 
messing around with your 
fan orientation, you can 
always buy fan filters online. 
Silverstone sells the FF143B 
and the FF123B, which are 
fine gauze 140/120mm, 
respectively, magnetic black 
fan filters, and they only 
cost around $7-8 each. Just 
search Newegg or Amazon 
for “Silverstone fan filter,” 
and they should come up. I 
use two of these in my own

Budget-Busting
Thanks for your “Linux 
Budget-Busting Box” article 
in the January issue. It 
has inspired me to finally 
replace my Linux computer I 
built based on the “Building 
the $300 Budget PC” article 
from the January 2006 issue 
of Maximum PC. It is still 
chugging along after more 
than 10 years. It has seen a 
lot of iterations of Linux in 
that time, and is currently 
running OpenSUSE 13.1.
I want the new computer 
to be as small as possible, 
but still have a slot for a 
DVD burner, so I am looking 
at the Mini-ITX In Win 
BP655 case. The CPU will 
be the same as the one you 
used—Core-i5 6500. Using 
Mini-ITX really cuts down 
on my choices, but I think 
I will go with the Gigabyte 
GA-Z170N-WIFI Mini-ITX 
motherboard. I don’t need 
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, but this 
mobo has a DVI-D port for 
my old monitor. No GPU, just 
integrated graphics.
I’ll probably use the same 
Samsung PM961 256GB M.2 
drive you used, without any 
HDD at all. My old Linux 
PC only has an 80GB hard 
drive, and I didn’t fill it up 
in 10 years, so 256GB will 
be plenty. I’ve been reading 
that these M.2 drives can 
get really hot. It will be 
mounted on the back of the 
Gigabyte motherboard, and 
then the motherboard will be 
mounted in the case. There 
are no airflow holes on the 
back of the In Win case. I’m 
afraid there just won’t be 
enough airflow to keep the 
M.2 drive cool. Do you think 
this is really going to be a 
problem? Do you have any 
suggestions?
–Mike Hamm
Reviews Editor Zak Storey 
responds: I understand 
your pain when it comes 
to Mini-ITX boards. I’ve 
always been a big fan of 
them—in fact, I’ve got a 
real soft spot for Micro-
ATX, too—but you’re right, 
there’s certainly not a lot of 
them out there. That said, 
the GA-Z170N is a solid 
motherboard. We’ve played 
around with a few Z170 
motherboards this year, and 
Gigabyte has produced some 
of our favorites.
With regard to thermal 
throttling and M.2 drives, it 
is true they do have a habit 
across the board of doing 
so. In fact, even Samsung 
claims that its best 960 Pro 
M.2 drives begin to throttle 
once they’ve transferred 
beyond 333GB. Some brands 
are better at countering 
this than others, and we 
are aware of motherboard 
manufacturers trying to 
combat this with some 
intuitive new features 
included in their Z270 
offerings (which we can’t, 
unfortunately, talk about 
just yet). However, this 
thermal throttling generally 
only occurs in high usage 
scenarios, mostly when 
you’re transferring huge 
files, or running excessively 
aggressive benchmarks for 
prolonged periods of time. 
For day-to-day operations, 
running an operating 
system such as Debian or 
OpenSUSE in particular, 
you shouldn’t have any 
problems whatsoever.
To clarify, the liquid-
cooled hard-piped machine 
I pieced together in our 
July issue used a Samsung 
950 Pro drive tucked away 
behind the motherboard, 
and I never had any issues 
with it whatsoever, outside 
of some flaky boot times 
brought about by a suspect 
BIOS update.
One-Sided
So, here’s the thing. I am not 
an obsessed fan of either 
Nvidia or AMD, but do find 
it a bit annoying when one 
is included while the other 
isn’t. Case in point: The 
gaming system upgrade you 
recommended in the January 
2017 issue for the graphics 
card was the Nvidia 1060, 
with no mention of the RX 
480. Why is that? The 1060 
has a limited system life. No 
DX12 or SLI support, so the 
480 is more future-proof as 
it offers both. If you consider 
the cost, the RX 480 is about 
30 to 40 bucks cheaper, 
which could be spent on an 
aftermarket cooler like the 
CoolerMaster Hyper 212, and 
then playing with the CPU 
overclock. Anyway, would 
sure like to see you mention 
both options in any future 
upgrade issues. Otherwise, 
great issue, as always.

–Kent Durgen
Executive Editor Alan 
Dexter responds: While 
certainly an interesting 
discussion, the merits of 
the RX 480 over the GeForce 
GTX 1060 wasn’t really 
the point of the upgrade 
feature—it was about the 
process of upgrading, and 
what choices we would 
make with certain systems. 
For us, the GeForce GTX 
1060 got the nod, because 
it offered better value for 
money—the RX 480 may be 
cheaper, but the GTX 1060 
offers better performance, 
and ultimately provides a 
higher frame rate for each 
dollar spent. 
The DX12 argument is 
mostly moot because there 
are still very, very few 
DX12 games around, and 
there isn’t a compelling 
performance delta for those 
titles that do exist. As for 
SLI, while we do lament 
the lack of support on the 
1060, it still wouldn’t sway 
us from our decision—
we’ve suffered enough SLI/
CrossFire woes in our time 
to still be sceptical of its 
true usefulness. 
You’re obviously free to 
pick whatever hardware 
you want for your upgrades. 
Whether you use an RX 480, 
a 1060, or a Titan X is purely 
down to your preferences. 
The case studies are simply 
illustrations of what we 
would do, and we would 
pick the same hardware 
if we were to repeat the 
process today.

AMD Announces 
Radeon Instinct
We recently attended 
the AMD Tech Summit, a 
now-yearly event where 
AMD details some of its 
upcoming products, and 
frequently demonstrates 
working prototypes. Now 
we can officially talk about a 
new brand: Radeon Instinct. 
Radeon Instinct is AMD’s 
alternative to Nvidia’s Tesla 
line of products, though 
the previous FireStream 
(discontinued in 2012) and 
FirePro lines competed in 
this market as well. What 
makes Instinct different 
is the focus on machine 
intelligence, which in this 
case equates to running 
the calculations required 
for deep neural networks.

While there was little positive news for the pricing of our budget 
system, things get off to a much better start with our mid-range PC. 
Corsair’s impressive RM650x is a healthy $30 cheaper this month, 
and the EVGA graphics card also saw its price squeezed, giving us a 
$20 saving over last month’s pricing. That’s $50 before we really get 
started. We did see minuscule price increases for the SSD and hard 
drive, but nothing to get too upset about. RAM continues its upward 
trend, though, with the G.Skill NS Series costing $15 more this month. 
Looking around for alternatives proved that this trend is universal, 
and as we’re loath to go with no-name brands, we’ll stick with these 
for now. So, no changes on this machine either, but we did do a major 
overhaul of the system last issue, and with a major shake-up coming 
in the form of Ryzen, we’re happy with the price-performance ratio of 
this machine right now.
The gorgeous Evolv ITX case sets the ball rolling this month with a 
price hike of $10. An increase that is continued by other components 
to set a bleak tone for anyone looking to build our budget machine—
although, if things are really tight, you should check out our main 
feature on building a super-budget PC, on page 26. The Gigabyte 
motherboard saw a $15 price bump, while the Zotac GTX 1060 saw 
a $10 increase as well. Normally, we would look for alternatives 
for these core components, but as we’re waiting for Kaby Lake to 
really shake things up, we’ll avoid any serious changes right now. 
At least the outgoing Skylake Core i5 hasn’t been affected, and 
remains steadfast at $205. Finishing off the rather grim news, we 
saw price increases for the RAM and SSD, too, meaning that overall 
this machine costs $46 more this month than it did last. For the exact 
same hardware.

When it comes to our Turbo build, we’re less concerned about 
hitting a specific price point, and more focused on getting as close as 
possible to best-in-class performance—without completely nuking 
the bank. This lead to a couple of tough decisions, as there have 
been a few movements on the core components. For reasons that 
aren’t too clear, pricing on GTX 1080 graphics cards has increased 
substantially—at least 10 percent. This meant that our previous 
choice wasn’t as competitive, so we’ve switched to a Gaming X 
rendition of Nvidia’s top-end mainstream GPU. This still represents 
a $50 increase over last month’s card, but demand for 1080s doesn’t 
seem to be diminishing, which is why prices are continuing to rise. 
We did see a big-name GTX 1080 in a dull shroud for less than $600, 
but for that sort of cash, we weren’t confident enough in its cooling 
capabilities to recommend it. The other area that saw a sizable price 
increase was the SSD, namely the 1TB Samsung 960 Pro. An $84 
hike in a month is hard to swallow, and we were tempted to find an 
alternative, drop the capacity, or switch to the EVO, but just couldn’t. 
Truth is, the 960 Pro is an incredible drive, and given the impact it’ll 
have on your machine, there isn’t a realistic alternative. Other than 
that, pricing was fairly stable, with a $10 reduction in Intel’s 6800K a 
nice bonus—signs of Intel responding to the might of Ryzen? We jest, 
but expect some movement when AMD does get its chips out.  
Upgrade of the Month
We are in a relative lull in the graphics card market—the full 
line-up of current-gen cards has (mostly) been released, so it’s 
a case of picking a winner and settling in with it. The GTX 1080 
has the lead, and until the 1080 Ti comes out (rumored to be 
March) that isn’t going to change. So if you need a graphics card 
now, and have the money, these 1080 Gaming Xs get the nod 
from us. We used them in last year’s Dream Machine, and they 
pack an incredible punch. Vega and Volta are around the corner, 
but something new and exciting invariably is in this market….
