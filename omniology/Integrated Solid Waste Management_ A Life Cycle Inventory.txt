Preface to the second edition
‘The life cycle of waste can be considered to be a journey from the cradle (when an item
becomes valueless and, usually, is placed in the dustbin) to the grave (when value is restored by
creating usable material or energy); or the waste is transformed into emissions to water or air,
or into inert material placed in a landﬁll.’
So began the preface to the ﬁrst edition of this book, which ﬁrst appeared at the start of
1995. Since then, the whole subject of Integrated Waste Management (IWM), and the use of
life cycle tools to assess waste systems have travelled a considerable way on their own journey.
The journey so far . . .
In 1995, many debates were raging on the beneﬁts of recycling versus energy recovery, and on
how to implement kerbside collection schemes for recovering recyclable or compostable
waste fractions. Today, there is growing acceptance that a combination of integrated options, is
needed to handle all materials in municipal solid waste in an effective way. There are also now
excellent examples of integrated waste systems on the ground, as detailed in this book. In fact,
the debate has progressed further than the Integrated Waste Management advocated in the
ﬁrst edition, and is now focused on sustainable resource and waste management. There is
recognition that waste needs to be regarded more as a resource, and that its management
needs to be environmentally effective, economically affordable and socially acceptable. If this is
achieved then such systems will contribute to the sustainable development of society.
But how can we assess the sustainability of waste management systems? In 1995 decision
makers relied on the hierarchy of waste management options, which ranked treatments in
order of preference, but which was not based on any scientiﬁc or technical evidence. The ﬁrst
edition of this book provided an alternative approach by modelling the whole solid waste sys-
tem, including any combination of options, to provide both an environmental and economic
overall assessment. This was one of the ﬁrst attempts to apply the tool of Life Cycle Inventory
(LCI) to solid waste management to produce a tool for waste managers, policy makers, regu-
lators and other decision makers.
Since 1995, this idea of using LCI tools for solid waste has travelled far too. The model pro-
vided in the ﬁrst edition (IWM-1) has been applied at local, regional and national levels. It has
been used by municipalities to assess Integrated Waste Management systems in many countries
in Europe and elsewhere. It has been used by waste management companies to assess the
tenders they submit to municipalities, and by the municipalities to assess such tenders. It has
Preface
xxiii

been used by consultants in reports on waste management strategy for the European Com-
mission (Coopers & Lybrand, 1996). 
Since the appearance of the ﬁrst model, we have also seen the development of a number of
other, more sophisticated LCI tools for solid waste management. In the UK, the Environment
Agency has launched WISARD – a software package for use by municipalities; in the USA, the
Environmental Protection Agency is completing its own model, while in Canada, two industry
organisations – CSR (Corporations Supporting Recycling) and EPIC (the Environment and Plas-
tics Industry Council) – have launched a further model speciﬁc to Canadian conditions. LCI
models for solid waste systems are also available from several consultants.
This mushrooming of interest in the application of LCI to solid waste suggests that this is an
idea whose time has come. Talking to users shows that there is growing experience of using the
tools for several different functions:
1 A planning tool – to do ‘What if . . .?’ scenarios of possible future systems.
2 A system optimisation tool – to model existing systems and look for improvements.
3 A communications tool – the tool has been used in public meetings to explore, with all
stakeholders, the possible ways in which a community’s waste could be handled, and the
environmental and cost implications of such options.
4 A source of data – for use in other tools or assessments.
There is also now an International Expert Group on Life Cycle Assessment for Integrated
Waste Management, supported by the UK Environment Agency and the US Environmental
Protection Agency, where workers in this ﬁeld can discuss applications and resolve issues. Two
of the authors of this book are members of this International Expert Group.
Why write a second edition?
The ﬁrst edition proposed a vision of IWM, and the use of tools such as LCI to provide a way
to assess the environmental and economic performance of waste systems. We now see actual
examples of IWM systems on the ground, and published accounts of how LCI models for solid
waste have been applied. This seemed a good time, therefore, to stop and take stock of what
has been achieved, and to draw out the lessons learned. For that reason, a signiﬁcant part of
this edition focuses on case studies – both of IWM systems, and of where LCI has been used
to assess such systems. 
The second reason for a new edition was to provide a more user-friendly model (IWM-2)
for waste managers. The feedback we received from readers of the ﬁrst edition was that while
the book effectively conveyed the concepts of IWM and the application of LCI to solid waste,
only computer experts felt comfortable with the spreadsheet tool provided. To make the tool
more widely accessible, this edition provides a new tool in Windows format, with greatly
improved input and output features, and the ability to compare different scenarios. A signiﬁcant
part of this edition provides a detailed user’s guide, to take the reader through the use of the
IWM-2 model, step by step.
Finally, the whole ﬁeld of LCI has progressed over the past 5 years, with the acceptance of
ISO standards (14040 Series on Environmental Management) which stress the need for trans-
xxiv
Preface

parency. The new model, IWM-2, presented here allows for total transparency as to how it
calculates results, and as to the sources of data used.
Do we need another computer model?
When the computer model IWM-1 was released in the ﬁrst edition of the book, it was a rela-
tively novel concept. Today, however, as listed above, there are more sophisticated LCI mod-
els for solid waste available, so where does this IWM-2 model ﬁt? It is designed to be an ‘entry
level’ LCI model for solid waste – user-friendly and appropriate to users starting to apply life
cycle thinking to waste systems. More expert users may ﬁnd many of the advanced features of
the IWM-2 model helpful, but in time they will probably graduate onto one of the more
sophisticated models, with perhaps more geographically relevant data. If IWM-2 helps intro-
duce waste managers to the concept of Integrated Waste Management and the need to take an
overall approach, it will have served its purpose.
Why did Procter & Gamble write this book?
As explained in the previous edition, Procter & Gamble (P&G) is concerned with solid waste
because some of our products, and most of our packages enter the solid waste stream. Our
products are found in 140 countries around the world. Our consumers want us to do every-
thing we can to make sure that our products and packages are sustainable, in environmental,
social and economic terms. This involves us in constantly seeking improvements in the design
and manufacture of our own products, but in addition we have been working with others in
many countries to help develop improved Integrated Waste Management systems that are
environmentally effective, economically affordable and socially acceptable. As part of this, P&G
has set up a Global Integrated Solid Waste Management Team, made up of its experts around
the world – many of whom have contributed to this book. The aim of the team is to promote
effective integrated systems for municipal solid waste; this book forms part of that ongoing
effort.
Who are the intended readers?
The intended audience is large and diverse:
• Waste managers (both in public service and private companies) will ﬁnd an holistic approach
for achieving sustainable solid waste management, together with an improved modelling
tool to help assess the environmental and economic aspects of their own, or proposed
schemes.
• Producers of waste will be able to understand better how their actions can inﬂuence the
operation of effective waste systems.
• Designers of products and packages will beneﬁt by seeing how their design criteria can
improve the compatibility of their product or package with Integrated Waste Management
systems.
Preface 
xxv

• Policy makers will see examples of effective approaches to waste management and the tools
needed for their implementation.
• Regulators will see the impact of existing and proposed regulations on the development of
more sustainable Integrated Waste Management systems.
• Politicians (trans-national, national or local) will see how specialists in many areas are com-
bining their expertise to seek better ways of handling society’s waste. They will ﬁnd data and
management approaches that they can use and support as they seek to provide direction to
the social debate on the emotive issue of solid waste.
• Waste data specialists (whether in laboratories, consultancies or environmental managers of
waste facilities) will appreciate the importance of their data, and the ways in which its scope,
quality and quantity can be improved to facilitate better management of solid waste.
• Life Cycle Assessment specialists will see an LCI tool that has already been used in many
countries to support decisions on Integrated Waste Management.
• Environmentalists (whether or not in environmental organisations) will see how the applica-
tion of science, ﬁnancial management and social involvement can be combined in the search
for solid waste systems that do not cost the earth.
• Concerned citizens will see some of the efforts being made to improve solid waste manage-
ment around the world, and the tools used to assess this progress. They will also see recog-
nition that science and management do not have all the answers. In the democratic process,
there is a role for the concerned citizen to inﬂuence developments and to ensure that rea-
soned decisions are made.

Concepts and Case Studies
Summary
The concept of waste as a by-product of human activity and the current concerns over 
waste disposal are discussed. From these the objectives for sustainable waste management are
formulated. Current approaches to reaching these objectives rely on both end-of-pipe and
strategic legislation, and voluntary initiatives such as Eco-Efﬁciency and Design Waste Out. The
principles of, and difﬁculties with, present legislation are discussed. An alternative approach,
Integrated Waste Management, is introduced as the underlying theme of this book.
The aims of the book
This second edition of the book Integrated Solid Waste Management: A Life Cycle Inventory has
four key aims. 
1. To provide data, in the form of case studies, that support the concept of Integrated Waste
Management (IWM) as a sustainable method of managing solid waste. 
2. To provide data, again in the form of case studies, that support the use of Life Cycle Inventory
(LCI) as a tool for the environmental and economic optimisation of solid waste management
systems.
3. To introduce and describe in detail a new LCI computer model for Integrated Waste Manage-
ment. This model allows the development of Integrated Waste Management systems in practice.
It is easy to use, transparent and contains a range of default data to help the modelling process. 
4. To present detailed descriptions and data on current waste management practices, such 
as waste generation, collection, sorting, biological treatment, thermal treatment, landﬁll and
recycling.
What is waste?
Deﬁnitions of ‘waste’ invariably refer to lack of use or value, or ‘useless remains’ (Concise
Oxford Dictionary). Waste is a by-product of human activity. Physically, it contains the same
materials as are found in useful products; it only differs from useful production by its lack 
of value. The lack of value in many cases can be related to the mixed and, often, unknown
composition of the waste. Separating the materials in waste will generally increase their value if
uses are available for these recovered materials. This inverse relationship between degree of
mixing and value is an important property of waste (Box 1.1).

Waste can be classiﬁed by a multitude of schemes (Box 1.1): by physical state (solid, liquid,
gaseous), and then within solid waste by: original use (packaging waste, food waste, etc.), by
material (glass, paper, etc.), by physical properties (combustible, compostable, recyclable), 
by origin (domestic, commercial, agricultural, industrial, etc.) or by safety level (hazardous, non-
hazardous). Household and commercial waste, often referred to together as Municipal Solid
Waste (MSW), only accounts for a relatively small part (<10% based on a ﬁgure of 
522 million tonnes reported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), 1997) of the total solid waste stream. Every year the countries of the OECD produce
over 5 billion tonnes of waste (OECD, 1997), which includes, in addition to MSW: agricultural
and mining wastes, quarrying wastes, manufacturing and industrial wastes, waste from energy
production, waste from water puriﬁcation, construction and demolition wastes.
There are good reasons for addressing MSW. As the waste that the general public 
(and therefore voters) have contact with, management of MSW has a high political proﬁle.
Additionally, household waste is, by nature, one of the hardest sources of waste to manage
effectively. It consists of a diverse range of materials (glass, metal, paper, plastic, organics) 
totally mixed together. MSW composition is also variable, both seasonally and geographically

from country to country, and from urban to rural areas. In contrast, commercial, industrial and
other solid wastes tend to be more homogeneous, with larger quantities of each material.
Thus if a system can be devised to deal effectively with the materials in household waste, it
should be possible to apply such lessons to the management of other sources of solid waste. 
The concerns over waste
Historically, health and safety have been the major concerns in waste management. These still
apply – wastes must be managed in a way that minimises risk to human health. Today, society
demands more than this – as well as being safe, waste management must also be sustainable.
Sustainability or Sustainable Development has been deﬁned as ‘development which meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs’ (WCED, 1987). This identiﬁes the synergy between economic development, social
equity and the environment (see Figure 1.1). Therefore, sustainable waste management must
be:
• economically affordable
• socially acceptable
• environmentally effective. 
In the past, the economic cost of a waste management system was the major controlling fac-
tor in the decision-making process; more recently however environmental considerations have
played a more important role in this process. The inclusion of the social aspects of waste man-
agement in the decision-making process, although not a new concept in itself, has been limited
as research into how to measure social concerns is only just beginning (Nilsson-Djerf, 1999). 
Environmental concerns over the management and disposal of waste can be divided into
two major areas: conservation of resources and pollution of the environment.

of each is necessary otherwise the whole system will become unbalanced.

The old concern – the conservation of resources
In 1972 the best-selling book Limits to Growth (Meadows et al., 1972) was published. It argued
that the usage rates (in 1972) of the earth’s ﬁnite material and energy resources (non-
renewables) could not continue indeﬁnitely. The sequel, Beyond the Limits (Meadows et al.,
1992), told the same story, but with increased urgency; raw materials are being used at a faster
rate than they are being replaced, or alternatives are being found. The result of such reports
was the development of the concept of Sustainable Development. This is deﬁned in the
Brundtland Report Our Common Future (WCED, 1987) as ‘development that meets the needs
of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs’ (see Box 1.2 and Figure 1.2). Sustainability requires that natural resources be efﬁciently
managed, and where possible conserved but not to the detriment of the individual’s quality of
life.
The original concerns of Meadows et al. about the imminent depletion of natural resources
have proved to be incorrect (Beckerman, 1995; UNDP, 1998; UNDESA, 1999) (see Table
1.1). For each raw material the proven reserves in 1989 were greater than the proven
reserves in 1970. This is because ‘proven reserves’ are deﬁned as reserves that could be
extracted with today’s technology and price structures. Technology and innovation have result-
ed in most resources being more available, and at a lower extraction cost today than 20 years
ago (Meyers and Simon, 1994; Simon, 1996). Consumption has changed in favour of less
material-intensive products and services – ‘eco-efﬁciency’. Energy efﬁciency has improved and
technological advances and the recycling of many raw materials have increased the efﬁciency of
material use. These factors have led to material use now growing more slowly than many
economies (UNDP, 1998). The per capita use of basic materials such as steel, timber and cop-
per has stabilised in most OECD countries (OECD, 1997) – and even declined in some coun-
tries for some products. This is not to argue that resources can never be depleted to
unacceptable levels, but in most cases, the time period required for this to happen is extreme-
ly long, allowing time for the implementation of technological developments.

Box 1.2 The World Commission on Environment and Development’s view
of Sustainable Development as a dynamic process.
‘Our report, Our Common Future, is not a prediction of ever increasing environmental
decay, poverty, and hardship in an ever more polluted world among ever decreasing
resources. We see instead the possibility for a new era of economic growth, one that must
be based on policies that sustain and expand the environmental resource base. And we
believe such growth to be absolutely essential to relieve the great poverty that is deepening
in much of the developing world. … sustainable development is not a ﬁxed state of 
harmony, but rather a process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction
of investments, the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are
made consistent with future as well as present needs.’

The new concerns – pollution and the deterioration of renewables
The depletion of non-renewables is now not the urgent problem (UNDP, 1998), but two
other concerns have become critical with respect to the ‘needs of future generations’. These
are:
• the generation of pollution and wastes that exceed the ability of the planet’s natural sinks to
absorb and convert them into harmless compounds and
• the increased deterioration of renewables such as water, soil, forests, ﬁsh stocks and 
biodiversity. 
The relative importance of these concerns within and across regions are indicated in Figure 1.3.
It can be seen from Figure 1.3 that urban and industrial contamination and waste are thought
to be reaching critical levels in all regions except Africa and the Polar caps. This book aims to
address part of the issue of solid waste management. 
Sustainable Waste Management
Against the background described above, the production and disposal of large amounts of
waste is still seen by many to be a loss of the earth’s resources. Putting waste into holes in the
ground certainly appears to be inefﬁcient materials management. It needs to be remembered,
however, that although the earth is an open system regarding energy, it is essentially a closed
system for materials. Whilst materials may be moved around, used, dispersed or concentrated,
the total amount of the earth’s elements stays constant (with the exception of unstable radioac-
tive elements). Thus although resources of ‘raw materials’ may be depleted, the total amount
of each element present on Earth remains constant. In fact, the concentration of some useful
materials is higher in landﬁlls than in their original raw material ores. Such materials could be
dug up at a later date.

issues by regions. Source: UNEP (1997).

Putting waste in holes in the ground, i.e. landﬁlling, could therefore be considered as 
long-term storage of materials rather than actual disposal. Is this the most efﬁcient way to 
manage such materials, however?
Concerns over conservation of resources have led to calls for, ﬁrstly, general reductions in
the amount of waste generated, i.e. waste minimisation or waste reduction, and secondly, for
ways to recover the materials and/or energy in the waste, so that they can be used again.
Recovery of resources from waste should slow down the depletion of non-renewable
resources, and help to lower the use of renewable resources to the rate of replenishment (see
Figure 1.4).
Pollution
Potential or actual pollution is the basis for most current environmental concern over waste
management. Historically, the environment has been considered as a sink for all wastes pro-
duced by human activities. Materials have been released into the atmosphere or watercourses,
or dumped into landﬁlls and allowed to ‘dilute and disperse’. At low levels of emissions, natural
biological and geochemical processes are able to deal with such ﬂows without resulting changes
in environmental conditions. However, as the levels of emissions have increased with rises in
human population and activity, natural processes do not have sufﬁcient turnover to prevent
changes in environmental conditions (such as the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide). In
extreme cases of overloading (such as gross sewage pollution in rivers) natural processes may
break down completely, leading to drastic changes in environmental quality.
Just as raw materials are not in inﬁnite supply, the environment is not an inﬁnite sink for emis-
sions. Environmental pollution produced by human activity will come back to haunt society, by
causing deterioration in environmental quality. Consequently there is growing awareness that

space consumption and less emissions.

the environment should not be considered as an external sink for wastes from society, but as
part of the global system that needs careful and efﬁcient management.
As well as such broad concerns over environmental pollution, speciﬁc concerns emerge at
the local level whenever new facilities for waste treatment are proposed. Planned incinerators
raise concerns over likely emission levels in general, and recently, of dioxin levels in particular.
Similarly, landﬁll sites are known to generate landﬁll gas. At the global level this has a high Glob-
al Warming Potential (GWP), but more immediately at a local level it can seep into properties
with explosive consequences. There is also increasing concern of the risk of groundwater pol-
lution from the leachate generated in landﬁll sites.
Such local environmental concerns (plus, no doubt, concern over the effects on property
prices) have given rise to several acronyms describing the attitudes facing waste management plan-
ners, which will have to be met with a viable response and a clear long-term strategy (Box 1.3).
Whilst such attitudes are understandable, they ignore our common responsibility for waste
management. All human activities generate waste. Each person in the European Union for
example, generates an average of 430 kg of Municipal Solid Waste each year (OECD, 1997).
This waste has to be dealt with somehow, somewhere. Whilst all the methods for treating and

disposing of waste are known to have environmental impacts, the waste still must be dealt
with. Waste cannot be moved to ‘other people’s back yards’ indeﬁnitely. What is needed is an
overall strategy to manage waste that reduces environmental burdens, at an affordable cost.
Objectives
Clearly, the ﬁrst objective is to reduce the amount of waste generated. However, even after
this has been done, waste will still be produced. The second objective, therefore, is to manage
the waste in a sustainable way, by minimising the overall environmental burdens associated
with the waste management system (see Figure 1.4). Environmental sustainability addresses
both pollution concerns and resource conservation, but can it be assessed, and if so how? 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an environmental management tool that attempts to predict
the overall environmental burden of a product, service or function, and it can be applied to
waste management systems (White et al., 1993). In this book, the technique of Life Cycle
Inventory (LCI) – part of LCA (see Chapters 4 and 5), will be used to look at whole waste
management systems, to predict their likely environmental burdens. Then, by selecting appro-
priate options for dealing with the various fractions of solid waste, the environmental burdens
of the whole waste management system can be reduced.
Current approaches – legislation
Waste management in developed countries is governed by legislation, the detail of which could
ﬁll this volume several times over. Looking at the basic approach of legislative tools, they fall into
two main categories, ‘end-of-pipe’ regulations and strategic targets. 
End-of-pipe regulations
These are technical regulations and relate to the individual processes in waste treatment and
disposal. Emission controls for incinerators are a prime example. Such regulations may be set
nationally (e.g. the T.A. Luft (1986) emission limit for Germany and US federal Standards of
Performance (1995)) or, increasingly, internationally by bodies such as the European Commis-
sion (EC). Municipal waste incinerator emissions are the subject of two EC Directives
(89/369/EEC for new incinerator plants and 89/429/EEC for existing plants), and there is also
an EC Directive (1999/31/EC) on Landﬁll.
Such regulations are important to ensure safe operation of waste disposal processes. They
operate as ‘ﬁne tuning’ of the system, by promoting best available technology and practices, but
as with other end-of-pipe solutions, they are not tools that will lead to major changes in the
way the waste management system operates. These will be produced by strategic decisions
between different waste management options rather than reﬁning the options themselves.
Strategic targets
Strategic legislation is becoming increasingly used to deﬁne the way in which solid waste will be
dealt with in the future. This legislation has several common threads: it builds (either explicitly
or implicitly) on the ‘hierarchy of solid waste management’, and within this it sets targets for
Current Approaches  – Legislation

recovery and recycling of materials. Much current legislation is also directed at speciﬁc parts,
rather than the whole, of the municipal waste stream. Packaging, in particular, has been target-
ed. Consequently attention has been diverted away from the overall problem of dealing with
all of the waste stream in an environmentally and economically sustainable way. Packaging
waste represents between 16–17% (by weight) of the Municipal Solid Waste generated in the
European Union (EU) (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 1998). Setting targets for recycling of pack-
aging alone, therefore, only deals at most with this 17% of the Municipal Solid Waste stream
(EC Discussion paper, 1999). For example, a 50% reduction in packaging waste would only
result in a 9% reduction in total Municipal Solid Waste. Given that Municipal Solid Waste rep-
resents 13–15% of the total solid waste production in the EU (OECD, 1997 and EEA, 1998),
this means that special measures directed at packaging will have little impact (1.1–1.3% reduc-
tion) on the overall solid waste management scenario. At national levels, the German Packag-
ing Ordinance, Dutch Packaging ‘Covenant’ and UK Environmental Protection Act (1990) all lay
down either rules or guide-lines on the waste management options (mainly recycling), which
will be used for at least part of Municipal Solid Waste. At the European level, the EC Packaging
and Packaging Waste Directive requires member states to set deadlines for meeting value
recovery and recycling targets for packaging materials and this has been incorporated into the
national legislation of all member states.
The hierarchy of waste management options is headed by source reduction, or waste min-
imisation. This is the essential prerequisite for any waste management strategy – less waste to
deal with. Next in the hierarchy come a series of options: reuse, recycling, composting, waste
to energy, incineration without energy recovery and landﬁll, in some order of preference. At
the time of writing, there is increasing recognition within the ﬁeld of waste management that
the hierarchy has several limitations (see Chapter 2). It will be argued in this book that, although
useful as a set of default guide-lines, using this hierarchy to determine which options are prefer-
able does not necessarily result in the lowest environmental burdens, nor an economically sus-
tainable system. Different materials in the waste are best dealt with by different processes, so
to deal effectively with the whole waste stream, a range of waste management options is desir-
able. Thus, there are no overall ‘best’ or ‘worst’ options; different options are appropriate to
different fractions of the waste.
Instead of relying on the waste management hierarchy, this book looks at the whole waste
management system, and attempts to assess its overall environmental burdens and economic
costs on a life cycle basis.
Recycling targets, similarly, are useful ways to measure progress towards recycling goals, but
they may not always measure progress towards environmental objectives. Recycling typically is
used to reduce raw material consumption, and in many cases also energy consumption. It must
be borne in mind, however, that it is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Rigidly set recycling
targets may not produce the greatest environmental beneﬁts. Environmental beneﬁt (e.g.
reduction in energy consumption) does not increase linearly with recycling rates (Boustead,
1992; Gabola, 1999). At high levels of recovery, proportionately more energy is needed to
collect used materials from diffuse sources, so there is little, if any, environmental gain. In such
cases, Life Cycle Assessment could be used to determine the optimal recycling rate to meet
deﬁned environmental objectives. A sign that this more ﬂexible approach may be gaining
ground is the inclusion in the EC Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive of the provision that
‘life cycle assessments should be completed as soon as possible to justify a clear hierarchy
10
Chapter1: Introduction
Concepts and Case Studies

between reusable, recyclable and recoverable packaging; ...’. Such LCA studies have now
been carried out (RDC/Coopers & Lybrand, 1997). It is worth noting that, as argued by the
European Organisation for Packaging and the Environment (EUROPEN, 1999) and others,
LCA offers the opportunity to replace rather than reinvent the waste management hierarchy.
At a more fundamental level, how waste is best recovered, treated, or disposed of depends
on the nature of the materials in the waste, not on the original use of the discarded object.
Whatever legislative instruments (e.g. recycling targets) are used, they should relate to the
whole municipal waste stream. Otherwise, as has been seen in Germany, packaging-speciﬁc
legislation can lead to the development of separate and parallel waste management systems for
such packaging waste. Duplication of systems on the basis of original use of the material, or for
any other reason, will give rise to increased environmental burdens and economic costs
(Staudt and Schroll, 1999).
This book proposes that if real and sustainable environmental improvements are the 
objective, a single, integrated collection and sorting system, followed by material-speciﬁc recovery/
treatment/ disposal represents the most promising approach. It shows that a scheme designed
to deal with all fractions of household waste can also deal with other sources such as commer-
cial and some industrial waste. Fragmenting the household waste between different waste
management systems rules out an integrated approach, and any economies and efﬁciencies of
scale.
Economic costs of environmental improvements
Environmental improvements to waste treatment and disposal methods should be welcomed,
where they are scientiﬁcally justiﬁable. Improvements, however, usually have economic costs
associated with them. This is invariably the case with such end-of-pipe solutions as installing
new technology to reduce emissions following tighter regulatory control. It can also be the case
when introducing strategic solutions aimed at reducing the environmental impact of waste
management, such as recycling. Take, for example, the ‘Blue Box’ schemes that have been
introduced for kerbside collection of recyclable materials in many parts of North America, and
in some areas of the UK, or the Dual System operating in Germany for packaging materials.
Whilst these systems can collect large quantities of high-quality materials, the collection
schemes operate in parallel with existing household waste collections. Two vehicles call at each
property, where only one did before. These systems, as additions to residual waste collection,
clearly involve additional cost. Any other similar ‘bolt-on’ systems, whether for recovery of
materials or collection of compostables will suffer from the same economic problems. This
trade-off between economic cost and environmental burden has been seen as a major hurdle
to environmental improvements in waste management. However, two concepts that are
becoming established can help to overcome this obstacle.
Internalising external environmental costs 
Environmental and social costs of waste disposal have historically been seen as external costs.
For example, the effects of emissions from burning waste, or the leachate and gas released
from landﬁll sites were not considered as part of the cost of these disposal methods. More
recently, however, as emission regulations have become tighter, the costs of emission controls
Economic Costs of Environmental Improvements 
11
Concepts and Case Studies

have been internalised in the cost of disposal. Similarly, when legislation (e.g. UK Environmen-
tal Protection Act, 1990) requires monitoring of waste disposal sites after closure, and the pro-
vision of insurance bonds to remediate environmental problems that may arise in the future,
the real (i.e. full and inclusive) cost of each waste management option becomes apparent.
Under such conditions, waste management options with lower environmental burdens, which
may have appeared more expensive, can become economically viable. 
Building environmental objectives into the waste management
system
An additional ‘bolt-on’ system or an end-of-pipe solution will entail additional costs (Box 1.4). If,
however, a waste management system is initially designed to achieve environmental objectives

it may include such features at little or no extra cost compared to existing practices. An inte-
grated system that can deal with all the materials in the solid waste stream represents the Total
Quality approach to waste management. Such a system would beneﬁt from economies of scale,
since an integrated material-based system allows for efﬁcient collection and management of
waste from different sources. The Total Quality objective would be to minimise the environ-
mental burdens of the whole waste management system, whilst keeping the economic costs 
to an acceptable level. The deﬁnition of acceptable will vary according to the group concerned,
and with geography, but if the cost is little or no more than present costs, it should be accept-
able to most people (Box 1.4).
An integrated approach to solid waste management
An integrated approach to solid waste management can deliver both environmental and eco-
nomic sustainability. 
It is clear that no one single method of waste disposal can deal with all materials in waste in
an environmentally sustainable way. Ideally, a range of management options is required. The
use of different options such as composting or materials recovery will also depend on the col-
lection and subsequent sorting system employed. Hence any waste management system is
built up of many closely related processes, integrated together. Instead of focusing on and com-
paring individual options, (e.g. ‘incineration versus landﬁll’), an attempt will be made to synthe-
sise waste management systems that can deal with the whole waste stream, and then compare
their overall performances in environmental and economic terms.
This approach looks at the overall waste management system, and develops ways of assess-
ing overall environmental burdens and economic costs. As part of this, the various individual
techniques for collection, treatment and disposal of waste are discussed. This book gives an
overall vision of waste management, with a view to achieving environmental objectives using
economically sustainable systems tailored to the speciﬁc needs of a region or community.

Summary
This chapter discusses the needs of society: less solid waste, and then an effective way to man-
age the inevitable solid waste still produced. Such a waste management system needs to be
both environmentally, economically and socially sustainable and is likely to be integrated, market
oriented, ﬂexible and operated on a regional scale. 
The current Hierarchy of Waste Management is critically discussed, and in its place is sug-
gested a holistic approach that assesses the overall environmental burdens and economic costs
of the whole system.
The Key features of IWM are:
1. an overall approach
2. uses a range of collection and treatment methods
3. handles all materials in the waste stream
4. environmentally effective 
5. economically affordable
6. socially acceptable.
The basic requirements of waste management
Waste is an inevitable product of society. Solid waste management practices were initially
developed to avoid the adverse effects on public health that were being caused by the increas-
ing amounts of solid waste being discarded without appropriate collection or disposal. Manag-
ing this waste more effectively is now a need that society has to address. In dealing with the
waste, there are two fundamental requirements: less waste, and then an effective system for
managing the waste still produced.
Deﬁnition: Integrated Waste Management (IWM) systems combine waste streams, waste
collection, treatment and disposal methods, with the objective of achieving environmental
beneﬁts, economic optimisation and societal acceptability. This will lead to a practical waste
management system for any speciﬁc region.

The generation of less waste
The Brundtland report of the United Nations, Our Common Future (WCED, 1987), clearly
explained how sustainable development could only be achieved if society in general, and indus-
try in particular, learned to produce ‘more from less’; more goods and services from less of the
world’s resources (including energy), while generating less pollution and waste. 
In this era of ‘green consumerism’ (Elkington and Hailes, 1988; Elkington, 1997), this con-
cept of ‘more from less’ has been taken up by industry. This has resulted in a range of concen-
trated products, light-weighted and reﬁllable packaging, reduction of transport packaging and
other innovations (Hindle et al., 1993; IGD, 1994; EPU, 1998). Production as well as product
changes have been introduced, with many companies using internal recycling of materials as
part of solid waste minimisation schemes.
All of these measures help to reduce the amount of solid waste produced, either as 
industrial, commercial or domestic waste. In essence, they are improvements in efﬁciency, 
i.e. ‘eco-efﬁciency’, whether in terms of materials or energy consumption. The costs of 
raw materials and energy, and rising disposal costs for commercial and industrial waste, 
will ensure that waste reduction continues to be pursued by industry for economic as well as
environmental reasons.
There has been interest in promoting further waste reduction by the use of ﬁscal instru-
ments. Pearce and Turner (1992), for example, suggest ways to reduce the amount of packag-
ing used (and hence appearing as waste) by internalising the costs of waste disposal within
packaging manufacture, by means of a packaging levy. It is not clear how effective such taxes
would be, however, since they only affect a small section of the waste stream, packaging mater-
ials constitute approximately 3% by weight of the UK’s total waste stream (INCPEN, 1996)
and 3% by weight of the total European waste stream (Pricewaterhouse Coopers, 1998). Fur-
thermore, economic incentives for waste reduction already exist. Experience has often shown
that extra taxes add to the total cost but do not reduce the base cost of waste management.
Often they become in effect an additional revenue stream rather than being used for speciﬁc
environmental purposes. 
Interestingly, there is one area where there are often no economic incentives for waste
reduction – household waste generation. In some communities, notably in the USA (Skumatz
et al., 1997; Canterbury, 1998; Horton, 1998), and also in Germany, waste collection charges
are on a scale according to the volume or in some cases mass of waste generated, but in most
communities, a ﬂat rate collection fee applies. Charging according to waste generation could
lead to the generation of less household waste, provided that unauthorised dumping or other
alternative disposal routes could be prevented. The issues to be resolved are the level of the
charge, and an effective way of managing it. Introducing such charging structures to societies
not used to them can be politically unpopular.
‘Waste minimisation’, ‘waste reduction’ or ‘source reduction’ are usually placed at the top of
the conventional waste management hierarchy. In reality, however, source reduction is a
necessary precursor to effective waste management, rather than part of it. Source reduction
will affect the volume, and to some extent, the nature of the waste, but there will still be waste
for disposal (see Figure 2.1). What is needed, beyond source reduction, is an effective system
to manage this waste.

Role of Integrated Waste Management

The concept of Sustainable Waste Management
Solid waste management systems need to ensure human health and safety. They must be 
safe for workers and safeguard public health by preventing the spread of disease. In addition 
to these prerequisites, a sustainable system for solid waste management must be environ-
mentally effective, economically affordable and socially acceptable.
1. Environmentally effective: the waste management system must reduce as much as possible
the environmental burdens of waste management (emissions to land, air and water, such as
CO2, CH4, SOx, NOx, BOD, COD and heavy metals).
2. Economically affordable: the waste management system must also operate at a cost accept-
able to the community, which includes all private citizens, businesses and government. The
costs of operating an effective solid waste system will depend on existing local infrastructure,
but ideally should be little or no more than existing waste management costs.
3. Socially acceptable: the waste management system must operate in a manner that is accept-
able for the majority of people in the community. This is likely to require an extensive dia-
logue with many different groups to inform and educate, develop trust and gain support.
Clearly it is difﬁcult to minimise three variables – cost, social acceptability and environmental 
burden – simultaneously. There will always be a trade-off. The balance that needs to be achieved
is to reduce the overall environmental burdens of the waste management system as far as possi-
ble, within an acceptable level of cost. Deciding the point of balance between environmental bur-
den and cost will always generate debate. Better decisions will be made if data on environmental
burdens and costs are available; such data will often prompt ideas for further improvements.
Characteristics of a Sustainable Waste Management system
A Sustainable Waste Management system is likely to be integrated, market oriented, ﬂexible
and socially acceptable. The execution of these principles will vary on a regional basis. A key
requirement, is the ‘customer–supplier relationship’.
An integrated system
‘Integrated Waste Management’ is a term that has been frequently applied but rarely deﬁned.
Here it is comprehensively deﬁned as a system for waste management that has control over:
1. All types of solid waste materials. The alternative of focusing on speciﬁc materials, either
because of their ready recyclability (e.g. aluminium) or their public proﬁle (e.g. plastics) is
likely to be less effective, in both environmental and economic terms, than taking a multi-
material approach.
2. All sources of solid waste. Wastes such as domestic, commercial, industrial, institutional,
construction and agricultural. Hazardous waste needs to be dealt with within the system,
but in a separate stream. Focusing on the source of a material (on packaging or domestic
waste or industrial waste) is likely to be less productive than focusing on the nature of the
material, regardless of its source.
18
Chapter 2: Integrated Waste Management
Concepts and Case Studies

An integrated system would include an optimised waste collection system and efﬁcient sorting,
followed by one or more of the following options:
1. Materials recycling will require access to reprocessing facilities (see Chapter 14, Materials
recycling).
2. Biological treatment of organic materials will ideally produce marketable compost and also
reduce volumes for disposal. Anaerobic digestion produces methane that can be burned to
release energy (see Chapter 11, Biological treatment).
3. Thermal treatment (such as incineration with energy recovery, burning of Refuse-Derived Fuel
(RDF) and burning of Paper and Plastic-Derived Fuel (PPDF)) will reduce volume, render
residues inert and should include energy recovery (see Chapter 12, Thermal treatment).
4. Landﬁll. This can increase amenity via land reclamation but a well-engineered site will at
least minimise pollution and loss of amenity (see Chapter 13, Landﬁlling). 
To manage all solid waste arisings in an environmentally effective way requires a range of the
above treatment options. Landﬁll is the only method that can manage all types of waste; since
recycling, composting and thermal treatment all leave some residual material that needs to be
landﬁlled. In a landﬁll the organic fraction of solid waste can be broken down if the appropriate
conditions for the growth of aerobic and then anaerobic bacteria occur. These relatively uncon-
trolled biological processes can take several years to start in a landﬁll and continue many
decades after the landﬁll has been closed. Methane emissions arise from the breakdown of
organic material and groundwater pollution may occur due to leaching of toxic materials from
the solid waste. Landﬁlling operations also require large amounts of space. Use of the other
options prior to landﬁlling can both divert signiﬁcant parts of the waste stream and reduce the
volume and improve the physical and chemical stability of the ﬁnal residue. This will reduce
both the space requirement and the environmental burdens of the landﬁll.
Market oriented
Any scheme that incorporates materials recycling, biological or thermal treatment technologies
must recognise that effective recycling of materials and production of compost and energy
depends on markets for these outputs. These markets are likely to be sensitive to price and to
consistency in quality and quantity of supply. Managers of such schemes will need to play their
part in building markets for their outputs, working with secondary material processors, and
helping set material quality standards. They must also recognise that such markets and needs
will change over time, so such standards should not be rigid and based in prescriptive legisla-
tion, but be set as part of a customer–supplier relationship.
Flexibility
An effective scheme will need the ﬂexibility to design, adapt and operate its systems in ways
which best meet current social, economic and environmental conditions. These are likely to
change over time and vary by region. 
Using a range of waste management options in an integrated system gives the ﬂexibility to
channel waste via different treatments as economic or environmental conditions change. For
example, paper can either be recycled, composted or incinerated with energy recovery. The
option used can be varied according to the economics of paper recycling, compost production
or energy generation at the time.
Characteristics of a Sustainable Waste Management System 
19
Concepts and Case Studies

Scale
The need for consistency in quality and quantity of recycled materials, compost or energy, the need
to support a range of management options, and the beneﬁt of economies of scale, all suggest that
Integrated Waste Management should be organised on a large-scale, regional basis. This is certain-
ly the case for waste collection, which can cost up to 75% of the total waste management budget
for an area (ERRA, 1998). The cost beneﬁt of the economy of scale with regard to collection is
shown in Figure 2.2; this beneﬁt is mirrored in the construction and operation of both treatment
(EC, 1997; Biala, 1998; Reimann, 1998; Kern et al., 1999) and disposal facilities. 
Experience is beginning to suggest that an area containing upwards of 500,000 households is a
viable unit (White, 1993) where large-scale additions to infrastructure are necessary. This may
not correspond to the scale on which waste management is currently administered. In many
cases, therefore, implementation of such schemes will require local authorities to work together.
Schemes on a smaller scale can be viable (Schauner, 1996), but essentially have to rely on re-
cycling using source-separated material, bring systems (see Chapter 9) or composting. These less
expensive treatment options can still result in a signiﬁcant diversion of material from ﬁnal disposal
to landﬁll. 
Social acceptability
For Waste Management Systems to operate effectively public participation is necessary. Whether
simply putting bins by the kerbside for collection on the correct day, taking paper or glass to
streetside recycling containers or sorting out all recyclable material from their household waste,
individuals must understand their role in the Waste Management System and co-operate with the
local authorities for the system to work. Low participation rates in recycling schemes can be
improved by communication strategies. Objections to waste management facility siting can be
minimised through considerate facility design and by public consultation and education.

Public support can also be enhanced by stable waste management systems where changes
to waste sorting habits or to the waste collection system are rarely required. Where system
changes are necessary, effective communication material will inform the public as to the bene-
ﬁts of the new system (environmental, economic and social), thus increasing the chance that
they will accept the changes. Public perception of waste management facilities will also have an
effect on the acceptance of the overall waste management system. Any facilities that are seen
to be dirty, polluting, sources of odours or litter are likely to result in reduced acceptability of
the whole waste management system. Clean, well-managed facilities that are known to be
operating up-to-date pollution control technology meeting high regulatory standards are more
likely to be accepted by the public. The integrity of the waste management system is also
essential: the public must be conﬁdent that any material they source separate for recycling, is
sent for recycling and not landﬁlled or incinerated. If source-separated material is found to have
been sent for incineration or directly to landﬁll, the credibility of the waste management system
is reduced and public support will fall. Good public support is as essential to a waste manage-
ment system as good planning and good management. 
Development of the Integrated Waste Management concept
A systems approach to waste management was proposed by W.R. Lynn in 1962. This
approach was described as ‘viewing the problem in its entirety as an interconnected system of
component operations and functions’ and therefore recognised the full complexity of waste
management practices. The acceptance that systems analysis and mathematical modelling were
necessary to optimise waste management operations and strategy development was the ﬁrst
step on the road to the concept of IWM.
The concept further evolved in 1975 when the newly formed Solid Waste Authority of Palm
Beach County, Florida presented their ﬁrst mission statement. This statement proposed that
the Authority would ‘Develop and implement programs in accordance with its Comprehensive
Plan by integrating solid waste transportation, processing, recycling, resource recovery and dis-
posal technologies.’ 
The penultimate step in the evolution of the concept was made by R.M. Clark, a systems
analyst with the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1978, when he observed that ‘[Waste]
Management methods, equipment, and practices should not be uniform across the country
since conditions vary, and it is vital that procedures be varied to meet them.’ This simple state-
ment of fact has been ignored by supporters of a hierarchical approach to waste management
and by certain policy makers who try to develop a generic national or even international
approach to waste management.
The ﬁnal and most signiﬁcant deﬁnition of IWM took place in 1991, when a task force from
the Economic Commission for Europe published a Draft Regional Strategy for Integrated
Waste Management that deﬁned IWM as a ‘process of change in which the concept of waste
management is gradually broadened to eventually include the necessary control of gaseous, 
liquid and solid material ﬂows in the human environment.’ This brought all waste arisings under
the umbrella of IWM. 
The concept of IWM now included all waste types, the option of using a range of treatment
technologies depending on the situation and an overall approach being taken with respect to

the analysis, optimisation and management of the whole system. These basic points were
reﬁned only slightly to give the deﬁnition of integrated solid waste management presented in
the ﬁrst edition of this book (White et al., 1995). 
The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP, 1996) recognised the importance of
Integrated Waste Management, which it deﬁned as ‘a frame of reference for designing and imple-
menting new waste management systems and for analysing and optimising existing systems’. This
UNEP document also described Integrated Waste Management as ‘an important element of
sound waste management practice’ because of the reasons presented in earlier sections. 
Implementing Integrated Waste Management 
The operations within any waste management system are clearly interconnected. The collec-
tion and sorting method employed, for example, will affect the ability to recover materials or
produce marketable compost. Similarly, recovery of materials from the waste stream may
affect the viability of energy recovery schemes. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the entire
waste management system in an holistic way. What is required is an overall system that is both
economically and environmentally sustainable (see Table 2.1). Much effort has been directed
towards schemes focusing on individual technologies, e.g. recycling, or on materials from one
source only (e.g. the German Green Dot system to collect packaging). From the perspective of
the whole waste management system, such schemes often involve duplication of efforts, mak-
ing them both environmentally and economically ineffective.

Table 2.1 Designing a sustainable solid waste management system

The relevance of looking at the whole system could be challenged, since waste management
is often split up into many different compartments. Collection of Municipal Solid Waste is usual-
ly the duty of local authorities, though may be contracted out to private waste management
companies. Disposal often comes under the jurisdiction of another authority, and perhaps
another private company. Different operators may contribute to recycling activities – in the
case of material collection banks, these may be the material producers. Similarly, thermal treat-
ment, biological treatment and landﬁll operations may all be under the control of different
operating companies. Each company or authority only has control of the waste handling within
its operation, so what is the feasibility of taking an overall systems approach when no-one has
control over the whole system?
The holistic approach has three main advantages:
1. It gives the overall picture of the waste management process. Such a view is essential for
strategic planning. Handling of each waste stream separately is inefﬁcient.
2. Environmentally, all waste management systems are part of the same system – the global
ecosystem. Looking at the overall environmental burden of the system is the only rational
approach, otherwise reductions in the environmental burdens of one part of the process
may result in greater environmental burdens elsewhere.
3. Economically, each individual unit in the waste management chain should run at a proﬁt, or at
least break even. Therefore, within the boundaries controlled by each operator, the ﬁnancial
incomes must at least match the outgoings. By looking at the wider boundaries of the whole
system, however, it is possible to determine whether the whole system operates efﬁciently
and whether it could run at break even, or even at a proﬁt. Only then can all the constituent
parts be viable, provided that income is divided up appropriately in relation to costs.
The importance of a holistic approach 
To achieve fully, Integrated Waste Management will require major system changes from the
present situation. The objective of an integrated system is to be both environmentally and eco-
nomically sustainable. This is a Total Quality Objective (Oakland, 1994, 1995); it can never be
reached, since it will always be possible to reduce environmental burdens further, but it will
lead to continual improvements to processes and systems. 
Application of Total Quality thinking can be of further use in waste management. To reach a
Total Quality objective one builds a system to achieve this objective. To deliver environmental-
ly and economically Sustainable Waste Management requires building a system designed for
this purpose. This is a key point. When designing or re-designing a waste management system,
an approach must be taken that considers the system in its entirety. 
Different components of the system are inter-connected so it is necessary to conceptually re-
design a whole new system rather than constantly making minor changes to the old system. For
example, simply adding recycling to a waste management system just adds the cost of the new
recycling system to the cost of the original waste management system. A systems approach would
ensure that the cost of recycling was kept to a minimum by operating fewer collections for rest-
waste (the material remaining in MSW after the removal of recyclable material), as there should be
less restwaste remaining once the recyclable material has been removed. Further system changes
based on a holistic viewpoint may also allow previous economic inefﬁciencies to come to light,
which can be used to offset any increased costs.

Paying for Integrated Waste Management 
All beneﬁciaries of the Integrated Waste Management system, the public, the recycling industry
and local authority, should pay for waste management services. An Integrated Waste Manage-
ment system minimises risks to public health and results in a clean, healthy environment for all
citizens. The recycling industry beneﬁts from a steady supply of recyclable materials. The sys-
tem must be affordable for all sections of the community but the full cost of the waste manage-
ment system must be recovered to ensure that the system is sustainable. This is another of the
great challenges of waste management. 
Waste management planning and the Hierarchy of Waste
Management
Past waste management strategies have relied on the ‘Hierarchy of Waste Management’. This
has varied in its exact form (see Figure 2.3), but usually gives the following order of preference:
waste minimisation; re-use; materials recycling; biological treatment; thermal treatment with
energy recovery; thermal treatment without energy recovery; landﬁlling. 
A rigid use of a priority list for waste management options has serious limitations.
1. The Hierarchy has little scientiﬁc or technical basis. There is no scientiﬁc reason, for exam-
ple, why materials recycling should always be preferred to energy recovery.
2. The Hierarchy is of little use when a combination of options is used, as in an IWM system.
In an IWM system, the Hierarchy cannot predict, for example, whether biological treatment
combined with thermal treatment of the residues would be preferable to materials recycling
plus landﬁlling of residues. What is needed is an overall assessment of the whole system,
which the Hierarchy cannot provide.
3. The Hierarchy does not address costs, therefore it cannot help assess the economic afford-
ability of waste systems.
4. The Hierarchy cannot account for the wide variety of speciﬁc local situations where waste
management systems must operate effectively, such as small islands, sparsely populated
areas, or popular tourist destinations, where large increases in the population occur on a
seasonal basis.

Figure 2.3 A Hierarchy of Waste Management.

The limitations of the Hierarchy of Waste Management are becoming increasingly apparent,
especially in relation to IWM systems. The UK Waste Strategy, Making Waste Work (DOE,
1995), for example, states that although useful as ‘a mental checklist’, ‘the Hierarchy will not
always indicate the most Sustainable Waste Management option for particular waste streams’.
The limitations of the waste management hierarchy were also identiﬁed in a document by the
United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP, 1996) as ‘the hierarchy cannot be followed
rigidly, since in particular situations the cost of a prescribed activity may exceed the beneﬁts,
when all ﬁnancial, social and environmental considerations are taken into account’. Similarly, a
study comparing different solid waste management options in the European Union concluded:
‘the social cost-beneﬁt analysis of MSW management systems in the European Union seems to
support the conclusion that the “waste hierarchy” is too simplistic, and that blind adherence to
its tenets can lead to welfare losses’ (Brisson, 1997).
Rather than a hierarchy of preferred waste management options (as in Figure 2.3) a holistic
approach is proposed, which recognises that all options can have a role to play in Integrated
Waste Management (see Figure 2.4). The model illustrates the interrelationships of the parts of
the system; it does not suggest, for example, that 25% of the collected waste should be treat-
ed by each option. The percentage of waste treated by each of the four options will depend on
the local situation. Each option should be assessed using the most recent data available, but the
overriding objective is to optimise the whole system, rather than its parts, to make it environ-
mentally and economically sustainable and socially acceptable. 
Unlike the hierarchy, this approach does not predict what would be the ‘best’ system. There
is no universal best system. There will be geographic differences in both the composition and
the quantities of waste generated. Similarly there will be geographic differences in the availabil-
ity of some waste management options (such as landﬁll), and in the size of markets for products
derived from waste management (such as recovered materials, compost and energy). The
economic costs of using different treatment methods will reﬂect the existing infrastructure (i.e.

whether the plant already exists or needs to be built). This approach allows comparisons to be
made between different waste management systems for dealing with the solid waste of the
local regions. The best system for any given region will be determined locally. 
In essence what is needed is less waste to deal with in the ﬁrst instance, and then an Inte-
grated Waste Management system to manage the waste that is still produced in an environ-
mentally effective, economically affordable and socially acceptable way. Rather than rely on the
waste hierarchy, the environmental management tool of Life Cycle Inventory (see Chapter 4)
can be used to help reach this objective. 
Integrated Waste Management in countries with developing
economies
The management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is an integral but much neglected aspect of
environmental management in most low and middle income countries. Despite consuming a
signiﬁcant share of Municipal budgets (often between 10 and 50% of operational expendi-
tures), solid waste management services in the towns and cities of most low and middle
income countries are unreliable, provide inadequate coverage, conﬂict with other urban serv-
ices and have adverse effects on public health and the environment (Bartone, 1999).
The IWM approach is as valid in countries with developing economies as it is in countries
with developed economies, but the actual establishment of integrated systems differs consider-
ably. In countries with developing economies the combination of a lack of existing waste man-
agement infrastructure and severely limited resources change the approach that must be taken.
Under these conditions, a relatively simple but effective Integrated Waste Management system
is desirable.
IWM systems for countries with developing economies
The waste management systems that exist in the majority of countries with developing
economies are often characterised by inadequate collection services, little or no treatment and
uncontrolled dumping. The establishment of IWM systems will require the following: 
1. Data collection on waste composition. This is needed for the planning of collection, trans-
port and treatment of MSW. Good data is the foundation of effective IWM systems.
2. Progress from uncontrolled dumping to the use of simple sanitary landﬁlls.
3. Separation of organic waste from MSW, which can then be composted.
4. Formal involvement of scavengers in the collection of recyclable materials.
When available resources and MSW composition are considered, it is apparent that the waste
hierarchy is too rigid to be relevant for waste management in countries with developing
economies. The ﬂexibility of IWM offers a more realistic opportunity to improve waste man-
agement by accounting for local conditions. 
Dumping and landﬁlling
The dumping of MSW into uncontrolled sites is the most common form of waste disposal in
the developing world and is the result of both limited technical and ﬁnancial resources. This
26
Chapter 2: Integrated Waste Management
Concepts and Case Studies

method of ﬁnal disposal is environmentally and socially unacceptable as it does little to protect
the environment or public health. Pollution of surface and groundwater by leachate, migration
of combustible gases (methane), odours and breeding of disease carriers are all common
results. Dumps provide very poor living conditions for scavengers (see Chapter 13, Landﬁll
section) and pose signiﬁcant health risks today and in the future. 
In most situations disposal of waste to landﬁll is the lowest cost option, even in countries with
developed economies where landﬁlls are often highly engineered and include multiple liners on
the bottom of the landﬁll. Moving away from a system based on dumping to one based on san-
itary landﬁlls represents the most ﬁnancially realistic option for developing economies to
improve waste management. Although the resources for highly engineered facilities are unlike-
ly to be available, simple, low cost options are possible. Landﬁlls should be sited away from
water courses and highly populated areas and built on soils with a relatively low permeability
such as clay. Filling should be on a cell by cell basis with, wherever possible, the application of a
cover material (soil or compost) at the end of each working day. Organic waste and recyclable
material should be separated before entering the landﬁll whenever possible and the site should
be fenced or positioned to limit access by trespassers. Implementation of these steps is likely to
reduce or eliminate many of the problems associated with dumping. 
Separation and treatment of organic waste
Separation of organic waste from the MSW stream represents an opportunity to reduce the
quantity of waste entering landﬁlls in developing countries by up to 50% (by weight). Correct
treatment of this waste will also signiﬁcantly reduce the pollution and health problems previ-
ously described by removing the major source of leachate, combustible gases, odours and
food for disease carriers. 
Separation of organic waste can be done at the households prior to collection, at the landﬁll
prior to ﬁnal disposal or a combination of both. Motivation of households to collect organic
waste is required to ensure a high level of efﬁciency. Efﬁcient separation of organic materials by
householders will only be sustained if the source separation system is convenient, hygienic and
beneﬁcial. A comprehensive and simple educational campaign from the municipality or group of
municipalities to the householders, before the householders are required to start collection of
organic waste, is advisable. Educational materials should be easy to understand and use pictures
to explain what to separate. Education must also continue after the launch of the scheme, in an
advisory and supportive manner, through the use of waste advisors and school programmes. 
Separation at the landﬁll will require the organisation of labour/scavengers and must occur
before ﬁnal disposal to avoid separation by scavengers occurring in the landﬁll itself. Once sep-
arated the organic waste can be composted or used to produce biogas. Markets and uses for
the compost will depend on local conditions and needs. In Bombay, India, 300 tonnes of
Municipal Solid Waste is composted to yield 60–70 tonnes of compost per day. The compost
process is a simple ‘windrow’ method (see Chapter 11): the compost is sold to farmers gener-
ating a proﬁt of approximately $10 per tonne (Panjwani, 1998). In other countries, the soil dis-
placed to create the landﬁll may have more value than the compost. In certain parts of
Argentina (e.g. around Buenos Aires) where the soil is of very high quality, the selling of com-
post may not be economically viable. Instead, the compost may be used to cover the landﬁll
and the displaced soil might be sold, which generates more revenue than selling the compost
(Franke, personal communication). 
Integrated Waste Management in Countries with Developing Economies
27
Concepts and Case Studies

Recycling and scavenging
Scavenging occurs at a number of stages within the MSW management stream. ‘High quality’
recyclables such as entire glass containers, plastic bottles, metals, etc. are often collected door-
to-door by individuals or by the waste collectors themselves (Bernache-Perez, 1999). Recy-
clable materials are also very effectively sorted at the kerbside by people searching through
garbage containers and by people scavenging at the landﬁll/dump (Nagpal et al., 1999). It is this
latter form of scavenging that poses the greatest threat to health, represents the poorest living
conditions and as such is most urgently in need of improvement (see Chapter 13, Landﬁll sec-
tion). Nagpal et al. (1999) has suggested that plastics recycling in India would be improved by
the establishment of deposit centers for post-consumer plastic waste. This would help ensure
that higher quantities of plastic waste are deposited by users and salvaged by waste-pickers.
Once deposited, plastic waste can be taken to licensed recycling units, which have the added
beneﬁts that product quality can be monitored and tax evasion avoided.
Scavengers need to be formally involved in the sorting, collecting and recycling of materials.
This has been achieved at low cost in the suburbs of Mexico City by the construction of a sim-
ple material recovery facility where some of the collected waste (approximately 1500 tonnes
per day) is placed on a series of conveyor belts to be sorted by scavengers. Materials recovered
by the sorters are further cleaned and processed for sale. All of the various pieces of the 
equipment in the facility were specially designed so that they could be built and maintained in
Mexico (Diaz, 1994). The construction of a materials recovery facility of this type offers a 
number of beneﬁts including: 
1. improved working conditions for the scavengers who no longer have to sort materials on
the landﬁll itself, 
2. an opportunity for scavengers to increase their income by pooling recyclable material to be
sold in bulk, 
3. an increase in recycling and landﬁll diversion rates, 
4. the opportunity for children to attend school rather than work as scavengers, and 
5. modest accommodation provided for the scavengers and their families at an affordable
rate, which is paid for out of the money they earn for separating recyclable materials (Diaz,
personal communication; Garmendia, personal communication). 
In Brazil, with the help of non-proﬁt organisations and industry, the training and organisation
of scavengers has allowed them to offer a reliable public service as part of the waste manage-
ment system (CEMPRE, 1999).
Formal organisation of scavengers would also allow them to earn extra income by assisting
with the separation of organics, composting operations and covering of waste with soil/compost.
A good example of this is the Madras-based non-governmental organisation EXNORA (see
Chapter 3, Integrated Waste Management case studies for more details). EXNORA has assigned
streets to scavengers who take care of street sweeping, collecting of MSW, sorting of recyclables
and disposing of the restwaste to the nearest municipal transfer sites. The scavengers also collect
organics in some streets separately. They bring the organics to a backyard composting site. Here
the organics are composted using a simple method of containers with holes that allow enough
aeration for the composting process to occur. This simple composting process is possible
because the collected organic fraction contains very little meat or bones due to the mainly veg-
28
Chapter 2: Integrated Waste Management
Concepts and Case Studies

etarian diet eaten in India. Meat and bones do not compost well in a simple backyard 
composting process where optimum composting conditions do not occur (e.g. temperature,
moisture) and therefore no sanitisation of compost can be guaranteed. The compost is used for
gardening in the streets and yards in which the organic waste is collected separately. EXNORA
calls this project the ‘Zero Waste’ project because the remaining waste that requires disposal is
minimised, as both recyclables and organic material have been recovered (Franke, personal
communication).
Incineration
Although the incineration of waste is an essential element of many IWM systems in the devel-
oped world it is expensive to implement and is unlikely to be a realistic option for countries
with developing economies. However, the previously described strategies that can be imple-
mented in such developing regions will serve to lay the foundations for energy recovery from
waste in the future as these economies develop. This is particularly important in the case of
separation of organic, highly putrescible waste from the MSW stream. Organic waste signiﬁ-
cantly increases the moisture content and decreases the caloriﬁc value of MSW. Its removal is
the ﬁrst step towards preparing a waste stream for the possibility of incineration. 
The beneﬁts of IWM to countries with developing economies
Although limited by technical and ﬁnancial resources, countries with developing economies still
have the potential to signiﬁcantly improve waste management. Implementation of certain ele-
ments of IWM as practised in Europe, North America and other developed regions of the
world presents the opportunity to establish waste management systems that are both environ-
mentally, socially and economically desirable. Moving from open dumping to simple sanitary
landﬁlls in conjunction with separation and composting of organic waste is likely to result in sig-
niﬁcant beneﬁts. Pollution of surface and groundwater by leachate, migration of combustible
gases (methane), odours and breeding of disease carriers can be minimised. Living conditions
of scavengers can be improved and health risks reduced. Their formal involvement in the col-
lecting, sorting and recycling of materials can offer these people the potential to supplement
their income and increase recycling rates. A careful analysis of market conditions for recyclable
materials and compost could be conducted to prevent imbalances that could affect their ﬁnal
prices.
As in countries with developed economies, what is needed in countries with developing
economies is less waste to deal with in the ﬁrst instance, and then an Integrated Waste Man-
agement system to manage the waste that is still produced in an environmentally effective, eco-
nomically affordable and socially acceptable way. Again, the tool of Life Cycle Inventory (see
Chapter 4) can be used to help reach this objective. 
Modelling waste management – why model?
Optimising the waste system to reduce environmental burdens or economic costs requires
that these burdens and costs can be predicted. Hence the need to model waste management
systems. Modelling may at ﬁrst glance appear a purely academic exercise, but further investiga-
tion reveals that it has several very practical uses:
Modelling Waste Management – Why Model? 
29
Concepts and Case Studies

1. The process of building a model focuses attention on missing data. Often the real costs, in
either environmental or economic terms, for parts of the waste chain are not widely
known. Once identiﬁed, missing data can either be sought out, or if not in existence, analy-
ses can be carried out to gather the relevant data. 
2. Once completed, the model will deﬁne the status quo of waste management, both by
describing the system, and by calculating the overall economic costs and environmental bur-
dens.
3. Modelling allows ‘what if ...?’ calculations to be made, which can then be used to deﬁne the
points of greatest sensitivity in the system. This will show which changes will have the great-
est effects in reducing costs or environmental burdens.
4. The model can be used to predict environmental burdens and likely economic costs in the
future. Such forecasts will not be 100% accurate, but will give rough estimates valuable for
planning future strategy. These are useful especially in such long-term processes as the
development of markets for secondary materials. Market development is vital to ensure that
higher levels of recycling can be sustained. Modelling the waste system will allow prediction
of the likely amounts of reclaimed material available, which will in turn allow investment in
the necessary equipment to proceed with conﬁdence.
Previous modelling of waste management
Modelling of waste management is not a new idea. Clark (1978) reviewed the use of model-
ling techniques then available to optimise collection methods, predict the most efﬁcient collec-
tion routes and deﬁne the optimal locations for waste management facilities. Such models
concentrated on the detailed mechanics of individual processes within the waste system. Other
models have attempted to take a broader view and have compared alternative waste disposal
strategies from an economic perspective (e.g. Greenberg et al., 1976). 
More recently, detailed models have been developed to model the economics of materials
recovery for recycling, and some of its environmental burdens (Boustead, 1992), as well as
broader models including cost, public acceptance, environmental burdens and ease of opera-
tion and maintenance of waste management alternatives (Sushil, 1990). The model construct-
ed in the following chapters attempts to predict both the overall environmental burdens and
economic cost, since both are crucial, for an Integrated Waste Management system. 
Using Life Cycle Assessment for Integrated Waste Management 
Modelling may be divided into two areas – model structure (which will determine how the
model will work) and data acquisition (for insertion into the model). Recent developments in
each of these two key areas have made this work both possible and timely.
Models
Several models for predicting environmental burdens have been produced within the discipline
of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (see Chapter 4). This is a relatively new branch of applied sci-
ence, which has resulted in the development of a new environmental management tool (see
Chapter 4, Limitations of a Life Cycle Approach). The modelling technique used here is essen-
tially a Life Cycle Inventory of Municipal Solid Waste. 
30
Chapter 2: Integrated Waste Management
Concepts and Case Studies

Data
Even the best models are useless without accurate, relevant and accessible data to enter into
them. Whilst data have been available for many of the technical processes in waste manage-
ment, such as incinerator emissions, it is fair to say that information on the costs and burdens of
collection and sorting systems has not been readily available. In many countries, especially
those with developing economies, source-separated collection and sorting systems only exist
at the planning stage, therefore operational data could not be obtained. Fortunately, through
the efforts of a range of bodies, many different pilot schemes, both on small and large scales,
have been set up, and data are becoming available. For the ﬁrst time it is now possible to model
Integrated Waste Management schemes based on actual data.
The model developed in this book therefore attempts to combine recent developments in
Life Cycle Assessment methodology with the stream of hard data beginning to emerge. This
should allow prediction of the overall environmental burdens and economic costs of different
executions of Integrated Waste Management.

Summary
This chapter highlights the underlying principles of an integrated approach to waste manage-
ment. A summary of the ﬁndings from European case studies (based on the European 
Recovery and Recycling Association (ERRA) research project carried out in 1998), one North
American case study and a case study from India are presented. Each case study includes a
detailed description of the waste management systems in operation. The case studies from
North America and India are included to demonstrate that an integrated approach to waste
management is not just a European phenomenon or an approach only suitable for developed
economies. The principles of IWM each case study has adopted are also identiﬁed. 
The key points learnt from the case studies were:
1. The quantitative data gathered from each of the systems were not comparable (differences).
2. Common driving forces that helped to shape each system could be identiﬁed (similarities).
3. Prescriptive legislation prevents the development of IWM systems, whereas enabling legisla-
tion allows the development of IWM systems.
4. An integrated approach to waste management begins at a local level; the waste hierarchy
has little practical use at a local level. 
5. A trend of waste management systems evolving to become part of a more comprehensive
‘resources management system’ was also identiﬁed.
Introduction
Each case study presented demonstrates at least one (but often several) of the main principles
of an integrated approach to waste management (see Chapter 2). These principles are high-
lighted in italics in each case study where they are considered to be important. Table 3.1 lists
the best examples of the principles of IWM demonstrated by each of the case studies. 
Case study format
The case studies are presented in two different formats. The European case studies and the
case study from North America include a description of waste collection, treatment and 
disposal, additional relevant information and a schematic diagram. The schematic diagrams

amount of material collected, treated and disposed of by the overall system. This is a relatively
simple method of presenting an overview of what are often complicated systems and allows 
for quick comparisons between systems that would otherwise require lengthy descriptions in
the accompanying text. Instead of this, the text describes the existing local infrastructure and
highlights the characteristics of the integrated approach to waste management demonstrated
by each of the case studies. As the waste management system described in the Indian case
study handles only a (relatively) small fraction of the total MSW arisings, a schematic diagram
would provide little useful information, so it is presented as text only.
Case studies 
The ﬁndings of the European case studies and those from North America and India were
analysed and the results are presented below. There is no single simple formula that can be
applied to every waste management system that will make that system integrated. The wide
range of different circumstances speciﬁc to each area’s waste management system means that
a ‘one size ﬁts all’ approach is not appropriate. The variation between geography, demo-
graphics, politics, legislation, existing waste management infrastructure and public opinion 
within countries makes a single solution impossible. This variation within countries clearly
increases signiﬁcantly between countries (see Table 3.2).
As described above, the unique set of circumstances that deﬁne how a speciﬁc waste
management system operates means that the development of an Integrated Waste Manage-
ment system cannot follow a simple set of rules. However, the development of an Integrated
Waste Management system can follow the principles described in Chapter 2. A range of these
principles (depending on circumstance) were identiﬁed as being fundamental to the evolution
of each of the case studies that are described in the following text.
Difﬁculty of comparison
The difference in scale between the programmes was signiﬁcant. The number of inhabitants
served by each programme varied from 190,000 in Brescia to 1,700,000 in Hampshire. This
difference of an order of magnitude was also seen in the total amount of waste managed by the
different programmes, for example between 90,000 tonnes in Prato, and 870,000 tonnes in
Copenhagen (see Table 3.2).
The large differences observed in the ratio ‘kg of waste managed/inhabitant/year’ (390 kg/year
in Pamplona up to 1600 kg/year in Copenhagen) were explained when the deﬁnitions of
Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) from each of the programmes were examined. Deﬁnitions of 
MSW vary across Europe. Some programmes deﬁne MSW as just household and assimilated
(light commercial) waste, while other programmes include industrial waste (either on a volun-
tary or obligatory basis), hazardous waste and construction waste (see Table 3.3).
Major differences in existing infrastructure were expected and observed (see Table 3.4). 
Signiﬁcantly, all of the programmes operated recycling schemes and all of the programmes with
the exception of Pamplona also operated composting facilities. Pamplona is currently consider-
ing the addition of either a composting facility or an anaerobic digestion facility to its waste 
management infrastructure. Energy from Waste (EfW) incinerators linked to district heating

schemes were in place in four of the programmes, treating between 15% and 52% of the
waste stream. In Copenhagen, their state of the art facility is viewed favourably by the Danish
Society for the Conservation of Nature (WMIC, 1995) due to its stringent emissions limits.
Landﬁlls, still necessary for ﬁnal disposal, received between 5% and 90% of all MSW arisings
depending on the programmes’ other operational infrastructure. All of the programmes 
operated landﬁlls with gas collection systems, and most had plans to retroﬁt old landﬁlls with gas
collection systems in acknowledgment of the contribution of methane to global warming. 
Several different methods of paying for MSW management were also observed (see Table
3.5). These differences made comparisons of actual service costs between programmes
impossible. Payment methods included: bin size and frequency of collection; bin size; 
frequency of collection and household type; property value; apartment size; per inhabitant
charge; number of rooms (in an apartment) and waste bag price. 
The difﬁculty in comparing these payment systems was compounded by the very different
accounting and ﬁnancing methodology used by each of the programmes. Variations in allocation
of revenues from recycling and energy sales from Energy from Waste (EfW) plants, subsidies or
grants, certain treatment facilities operated by other municipal departments or private com-
panies, and even certain waste management operations carried out by different departments
within a single local authority further compounded the problems associated with a comparative
analysis.
Common drivers
The following similarities between IWM systems were identiﬁed during the development of the
case studies. These common features (individually or collectively) contribute signiﬁcantly to the
development of an integrated approach to waste management. 
1. Good system management. This is as necessary in waste management as in any other busi-
ness; decision making in both the long and short term must be data based.

2. Vision. It is essential that an individual or a team has a well deﬁned and clear long-term strategy. 
3. Stability facilitates the development of a long-term strategy, and is required both within the
waste management department and within the political framework of the local authority. 
4. Critical mass (economy of scale), is essential for the development of major infrastructure
and to ensure necessary quantities of recycled material or compost are available for viable
systems to be established.
5. Landﬁll space. The availability and cost of landﬁll space plays a major role in the develop-
ment of waste management systems. Low cost (therefore often abundant) landﬁll can
restrict the development of an integrated approach to waste management, while higher
cost (due to scarcity, or taxes) landﬁll can make other waste management options more
economically viable. 
6. Control of all solid waste. Although this is important for economies of scale it is also essen-
tial that an established waste management system does not lose control of waste streams.
This can change an economically viable waste management system into an uneconomical
system by forcing facilities to operate at below their initial design capacity. This increases the
cost per tonne of the whole system. 
7. Legislation, the effects of which can be both positive and negative. Enabling legislation
improves ﬂexibility and promotes an integrated approach to waste management, whereas
prescriptive legislation has a restrictive effect. 
8. Availability of funding, through grants, subsidies, partnerships or co-operative agreements,
are again essential for development of major new infrastructure and upgrading of existing
infrastructure.
9. Public opinion. Public support is essential for collection systems to function and for infra-
structure development to take place. Communication through education campaigns, public
consultation meetings and stakeholder dialogues increases awareness and understanding of
waste management issues.
These features were seen to be common to the development of the Integrated Waste
Management systems studied.

Legislation
Enabling legislation allows for ﬂexibility (and therefore integration) by making clear deﬁnitions of
responsibility between players and by setting goals, e.g. ‘minimum standards’, whereas pre-
scriptive legislation restricts ﬂexibility (and therefore integration) by deﬁning the means by which
speciﬁc goals must be reached. For example, the EC Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive,
which prescribes that a ﬁxed percentage of this packaging material must be recycled, was seen
to inﬂuence the case study programmes in different ways. In some instances it has changed
how systems operate, in others it has not. This has depended essentially on the stage of devel-
opment of the waste management system. 
A system with a well developed infrastructure such as Copenhagen can avoid making
changes to its Integrated Waste Management system as the Packaging and Packaging Waste
Directive targets are already being exceeded. In a city or region that has a developing infra-
structure there is the possibility that, due to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, the
waste management system focuses unduly on the recovery of packaging and therefore less on
a balanced, integrated approach. 
IWM begins at a local level 
All programme managers acknowledged the existence of a waste hierarchy and several different
hierarchies were described, but it was universally agreed that the hierarchy was only a ‘menu’
of possible treatment options and should not be used as a rigid set of rules to be followed 
blindly. It was clear that the programme managers accepted that the waste hierarchy has severe
limitations at the operational level. Firstly it has no scientiﬁc basis, secondly it cannot consider
combinations of treatment technologies and thirdly it does not address cost issues. The waste
hierarchy cannot identify the Best Practical Environmental Option (BPEO) with respect to 
planning waste management systems. Therefore a policy advocating use of the waste 
management hierarchy and BPEO is contradictory because a hierarchical approach and a
BPEO approach are mutually exclusive.
Waste management also needs to be socially acceptable. This can be achieved through a
process of public consultation and information campaigns, a costly and time consuming process
but a necessary one if new waste management systems are to be successful. 
System evolution
From the range of waste management systems documented within this study the variation
between waste management systems can be seen to be vast. An evolutionary trend was
observed, which begins with waste management primarily addressing the issue of public health
and safety. Through an organised system of waste management optimisation this initial
approach is superseded by an integrated approach to waste management, where economic
and environmental concerns are added to the system. Eventually an Integrated Waste Manage-
ment system can itself become part of a resource management system, where all resources
such as water, power, CO2 balance and solid waste are managed within a single optimised sys-
tem. This will eventually enable the development of a Sustainable Waste Management system,
as is demonstrated schematically in Figure 3.1.

Pamplona, Spain, 1996
Key IWM Characteristics: Economy of scale and social acceptability.
An association of 40 municipalities from the district of Pamplona, the Mancomunidad de la
Comarca de Pamplona, was established in 1982 to manage both water and solid waste more
effectively than the previously fragmented institutions that were common in Spain at that time. 
This economy of scale enabled the development of policies and supporting infrastructure,
which would be beyond the ﬁnancial reach of any single municipality (see Figure 3.2) and the
separate collection of recyclables began in 1992 due solely to social and political pressure. Land-
ﬁll was (and still is) very inexpensive in Pamplona, as in the rest of Spain, so no real economic
incentive for recycling exists.

Several technologies for the biological treatment of organic waste are currently being assessed
by the Mancomunidad (municipality).
Collection
A bring system operates in Pamplona, which requires the residents to source separate recycla-
ble materials from their restwaste and take these two fractions to kerbside collection points.
Blue bins are used for co-mingled paper, plastic, metal and glass, while green bins are for rest-
waste. These bins are emptied six times a week by a contract waste collection company. Con-
tainers for glass collection only are also placed at the kerbside collection points. 
Treatment 
The co-mingled recyclable material is sent to a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) where it is
sorted manually. The contamination rate of 60% is high, but a continued campaign of public
information about the system is expected to reduce this ﬁgure over time. The glass collected
from the containers is sent directly to reprocessors.

Landﬁll
The collected solid waste and the residue from the MRF is sent to the Pamplona landﬁll. This
landﬁll has a solid rock base (of very low permeability) that facilitates leachate collection. All col-
lected leachate it treated on site. Landﬁll gas is collected and used to produce electricity, which
provides power for the MRF. Surplus electricity is sold to the local grid. This revenue from land-
ﬁll gas will help to keep the cost of landﬁll down. 
Additional information
Solid waste collection and transport costs account for 67% of the total municipal waste man-
agement budget. Waste processing accounts for 20%, while landﬁll accounts for only 13% of
the budget due to the very low cost of landﬁll in the region. 
Municipal Solid Waste management in the Pamplona region is still in the process of developing.
Original programme changes were politically motivated and part of a larger evolution of the entire
municipality. The programme is one of the ﬁrst of its kind in Spain and enjoys strong local support.
Prato, Italy, 1997
Key IWM Characteristics: Control of all waste arisings.
The Azienda Speciale Municipalizzata per l’Igine Urbana (ASMIU) is responsible for the provi-
sion of waste management services for the commune of Prato and is actively seeking to win
other waste management contracts from surrounding communes. ASMIU is also playing a key role
in ongoing efforts to establish a regionally based waste management system (see Figure 3.3).

near Pisa) has a high gate fee and when this is added to the national and regional landﬁll taxes,
materials recycling and composting become ﬁnancially viable options.

Collection
A bring system for separate collection was established in Prato in 1992. The initial system 
comprised collection points with blue (1100 litre) containers for paper, plastic, metals, and 
glass and black (1200 litre) containers for restwaste. This scheme worked well but high 
contamination rates and liquid-soaked paper were common. In 1995 the original scheme was
expanded but this time the materials requested for collection in the mixed material containers
were changed and the openings in the collection containers were designed to be of a similar
shape to that of the targeted materials. This resulted in paper and cardboard being collected in
yellow (1100 litre) containers with wide but narrow openings and plastic, glass and metal being 
collected in blue containers with appropriately sized round openings. The total amount 
of material collected has remained constant while the contamination rate has decreased 
signiﬁcantly. 
Treatment 
ASMIU manages the treatment of all solid waste arisings from Prato, but they do not have con-
trol over the management of ﬁnal disposal at the Pisa landﬁll. ASMIU operate one waste trans-
fer station where the majority of restwaste is brought to be baled for transport to the landﬁll.
Two MRFs operate within the Prato area. One is owned by ASMIU and sorts the material
collected by the original separate collection scheme. A small fraction of the residue from this
plant is sold as Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) to a local industrial incinerator (not owned by
ASMIU). The second MRF is privately owned and sorts the material from the second (expand-
ed and improved) separate collection scheme.
Organic material is delivered to a privately owned composting facility where high-quality pot-
ting compost, which has a stable market, is produced. The composting gate fee is less expensive
than landﬁll disposal. ASMIU are considering buying the composting facility in the future.
Landﬁll
The residue from the MRFs and all of the restwaste is transported to the Pisa landﬁll. In addition
to the gate fee there is a national tax, which is a ﬁxed rate and a regional non-linear regressive
tax rate, which means that the tax decreases as the diversion rate increases. As Prato is able to
divert more than 8% of its MSW from the landﬁll, the municipality receives a 20% discount on
the regional tax. This discount will increase as it is able to divert more material from landﬁll. 
Additional information
The double tax and discount based on diversion makes both composting and materials recycling
very attractive options for the municipality. Economically, it makes good sense to recycle in
Prato, at least until the cost of recycling exceeds the landﬁll tax discount that is currently
available.

Brescia, Italy, 1996
Key IWM Characteristics: Stability, public acceptability and economy of scale.
The municipally owned Azienda Servizi Municipalizzati (ASM) has managed waste services in
Brescia commune since 1904. This established service has provided a stable platform for the
development of a long-term planning perspective. Paper recycling began in 1974 and since then
communication with the public has been ongoing. The current waste management system
with its high environmental standards has wide public support.
An improvement in economy of scale was achieved by the addition of commercial waste to
the household waste already managed by ASM in 1994 (see Figure 3.4). This has been further
enhanced by the addition of the new Energy from Waste (EfW) incinerator to the existing infra-
structure and the subsequent expansion of ASM’s waste management services to the regions sur-
rounding Brescia. ASM also manage electricity provision, district heating (both of which will
beneﬁt from the addition of the EfW incinerator) water supply and sewage treatment. This has
resulted in not just an integrated approach to waste management but an integrated approach to
the provision of all of these essential services.

A 266 000 tonne per annum Energy from Waste (EfW) incinerator came on-line in 1998. The
gate fee is less than the current cost of disposal to landﬁll. The municipality has secured long
term disposal contracts with surrounding communities to ensure adequate availability of feed-
stock material. The province of Brescia has 1,040,000 inhabitants living in 206 communities
and of the MSW generated in the whole province, 387,000 tonnes of material were sent to
landﬁll in 1995. There is the opportunity for the operation of the EfW incinerator to signiﬁcant-
ly reduce this ﬁgure. The emission standards adopted for this state-of-the-art facility are more
stringent than current European or Italian emission standards, therefore public acceptance of
the facility has been high.

Collection
All waste collection and recyclable material collection in Brescia has been developed around kerb-
side ‘environmental points’. These areas contain both restwaste and recycling containers (either
2400 litre bins or 2–3 m3 containers). Restwaste is collected by automatic side-loading vehicles for
the 2400 litre kerbside containers 6 days a week. In the old centre of Brescia, smaller vehicles are
used as the streets are too narrow to accommodate a side loader. Household organic 
material collection (kitchen and garden waste) takes place three times per week from brown 2400
litre bins, in a pilot area that covers 50,000 inhabitants. This programme was expanded in 1998 to
cover a total of 110,000 residents. Collected materials are either transported to a transfer station
out of town at ASM headquarters or directly to the landﬁll site, which is 25 km from Brescia. 
Treatment 
ASM manages the treatment of all waste arising in the city of Brescia. There is one transfer 
station, at ASM headquarters, where recyclable material/waste is collected for transportation to
materials reprocessors/landﬁll. There are no MRF facilities required to carry out central sorting
due to the separate collection scheme operated by ASM in the Brescia commune. However,
plastics and glass/metal streams are sent to privately operated sorting facilities. Additionally, a
private facility sorts and recovers all materials that were placed in the ‘miscellaneous’ bins at the
recycling centres. Most of the materials recycling occurs by transportation of the collected
materials directly to the reprocessors. This makes the contamination rate difﬁcult to assess.
Organic materials were delivered to one of two privately owned central composting plants, but
in 1997 ASM opened its own composting plant, which accepts all organic wastes collected. 
In 1998 a new 266,000 tonne/year thermal treatment plant opened in Brescia. The new facility
produces 200 GWh of electricity per year and the equivalent of 350 GWh of heat per year. This is
enough energy and heat to supply 25% of all energy used in Brescia. The emission standards that
have been adopted for the plant are more stringent than European, Italian and regional limits (see
Table 3.6).

Because of these stringent standards adopted, and due to ASM’s favourable reputation with
the local citizens, public resistance to the project was minimal, although an extensive commu-
nication campaign explaining the need for the facility was run from 1991 to 1995. This positive
public attitude is a fundamental cornerstone for waste management in the Brescia region.
The project also beneﬁts from favourable electricity prices for the ﬁrst 8 years of operation.
The subsidised price for non-fossil fuel projects is about three to four times the national aver-
age price of energy. The cost per tonne of the thermal treatment is estimated to be lower than
the cost of disposal to landﬁll. ASM is in the process of securing longer term disposal contracts
from surrounding communes to ensure an adequate ﬂow of material. 
Landﬁll
All ﬁnal restwaste was deposited in the sanitary landﬁll in 1996. This landﬁll site, which was
opened in 1989, is located about 25 km from Brescia in Calcinato (which had a 1,400,000
tonne capacity) and closed in March 1998. From April 1998, all landﬁlled materials are deposit-
ed in the new Montichiari landﬁll. Currently all leachate is collected and treated (there are also
several monitoring wells to check for landﬁll liner leakage) and a system to collect landﬁll gas is
installed and operating. Four new generators have been installed and the gas is being used to
generate electricity, with any excess gas being ﬂared. 
Additional information
Complete operational ﬂexibility of the Integrated Waste Management system in Brescia is now
possible as the EfW incinerator is on-line. Waste material within the system can be directed via
different treatments as economic or environmental conditions change.
ASM have expanded the horizons of Brescia’s waste management system by expanding to
manage MSW arisings from the whole province rather than just Brescia commune. This has
enabled (both ﬁnancially and with respect to the total amount of MSW available for treatment)
the development of a truly integrated system, which over a period of time will be able to be 
further optimised with regard to both economics and the environment. 
Hampshire, England, 1996/97
Key IWM Characteristics: Economy of scale, ﬂexibility and public acceptability.
In the late 1980s Hampshire’s landﬁll sites were rapidly ﬁlling up and the ﬁve incinerators (with-
out energy recovery) in the county were reaching the end of their working lives. The incinera-
tors ceased operation in 1996 as they did not meet new European standards on emissions. A
private waste management company, Hampshire Waste Services Ltd (HWS) was selected as
the contractor for the provision of disposal services for the County of Hampshire. They put
forward a detailed proposal utilising a number of treatment facilities that would provide a long-
term service for the treatment of waste in the county (see Figure 3.5).
Close co-operation between the 13 local collection authorities and the county disposal
authority in Hampshire and HWS has resulted in the development and implementation of 
Project Integra, the Integrated Waste Management strategy for Hampshire County. Public con-
sultation has been extensive (see Petts, 1995), and the views of the public have been reﬂected
in the strategy that evolved over a period of years.

This case study was carried out during a transitional period in the development of Hampshire’s
Integrated Waste Management strategy. The ﬁgure presented for incineration refers to the
throughput of the last of ﬁve old incinerators, which were closed during the necessary changes
to the waste management infrastructure.
Collection
Waste collection practices are still being optimised by each of the 13 collection authorities; the
numbers of households with some form of kerbside collection of recyclable material are 
increasing on a monthly basis. Each collection authority has implemented the type of collection
system that best meets the local circumstances and ﬁnancial constraints. As a result of this 
ﬂexibility, there is a range of different kerbside collection schemes in place in the county.
One of the fundamental features of Project Integra is waste delivery points. HWS is required to
provide waste delivery points throughout the county. Each of the 10 waste delivery points accepts
a range of wastes, according to local demand, such as recyclables, compostables, residual waste,
etc. They provide a ‘One Stop Shop’ for municipal waste deliveries. In practice, the waste 
delivery points are either landﬁll sites or transfer stations with the facilities to handle a range 
of wastes. They are crucial to this Integrated Waste Management approach because they provide
a strong interface between waste collection and waste disposal and rationalise transport 
networks.
Treatment
Waste recovery is currently based on recycling and composting: three interim MRFs 
and three composting facilities are currently operational. Planning permission for three 
Energy from Waste (EfW) incinerators has been submitted and an anaerobic digestion facility 
is under consideration. These facilities will provide the ﬂexibility necessary to optimise the
treatment and disposal of Hampshire’s waste with respect to economic and environmental
concerns.

Concepts and Case Studies

Landﬁll
Five landﬁlls currently operate within Hampshire but they only have sufﬁcient capacity to serv-
ice Project Integra for about 10 years. Within this period the three county EfW incinerators are
expected to be fully operational, signiﬁcantly reducing the amount of material requiring ﬁnal dis-
posal and thus further extending the lifespan of the landﬁlls. It is also expected that during this
period recycling rates and composting rates will increase across Hampshire, further alleviating
this problem. Unfortunately, however successful these efforts are at prolonging the lifespan of
the ﬁve landﬁlls, new landﬁll space will still be required in Hampshire. 
Additional information
The integrated approach that has been adopted by Hampshire has ensured that as the infra-
structure develops the amount of waste requiring ﬁnal disposal is further reduced and more time
becomes available to select the best sites (based on economic, environmental and social con-
siderations) and for the construction of new facilities.
Helsinki, Finland, 1997
Key IWM Characteristics: Economy of scale and control of all waste arisings.
The Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council (YTV) was formed by the amalgamation of three
municipalities in 1983/4 to manage waste treatment and disposal for the Helsinki metropolitan
area (see Figure 3.6). YTV’s main activity is landﬁlling as they own the Ämmässuo landﬁll, which
serves the whole of this area. They control household and commercial waste collection by
awarding contracts for speciﬁc locations to private waste collection companies. YTV’s functions
also include regional transport, air-quality monitoring and land use planning. Helsinki metropol-
itan area took part in ‘The Urban CO2 Reduction Project’ and afterwards committed itself to
develop a long-term action plan towards sustainability.

than ﬁve apartments must only separate paper from their waste stream. This system allows the
collection of the easily accessible majority of source-separated paper, cardboard and biowaste
but avoids trying to collect the remaining small amounts of this material, as this has been found
to be uneconomic. Finland as a whole has a well functioning deposit system for reﬁllable glass
bottles. Approximately 80% of all glass bottles used are reﬁlled.
Collection
The total cost of waste transport and treatment is covered by consumer fees paid by household-
ers; the fee depends on the type of household and amount of waste generated. YTV has plans to
introduce selective fees to favour those who sort waste in households to encourage recycling.
YTV arranges waste transport for 80% of the population. The rest, central urban areas and
major institutions, deal directly with private waste hauliers. Waste transport is based on compet-
itive bidding among private companies. Uniform planning and competitive bidding for collection
contracts has resulted in a reduction in transport costs by one-third over a 10-year period. 
Building residents are obliged to participate in on-site source separation as follows: ﬁve
apartments or more must collect paper; 10 apartments or more must collect paper and
biowaste; while in larger apartment blocks where production of materials is greater than 50 kg
per week, paper, cardboard and biowaste must be collected.
YTV is also responsible for the collection, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste from
households and many of the small and medium-sized enterprises in its operating area. 
Treatment 
As recyclables are collected separately no sorting facilities are necessary; however, some addi-
tional sorting of the collected paper and glass does occur prior to reprocessing. This is carried
out by private contractors.
The collected organic material is transported to a central facility where it is composted using
a closed process, which allows closer temperature, moisture and aeration control than the
conventional windrow technique (see Chapter 11).
YTV has organised ﬁve ﬁxed, single operator scrap metal collection points in the metropoli-
tan area. In spring and autumn scrap metal collection vehicles operate in the YTV area collect-
ing scrap metal from over 400 sites in the metropolitan region. The largest scrap metal items
are also collected for reuse from mixed waste loads at the Ämmässuo landﬁll.
The metropolitan region’s waste management regulations include an obligation to construc-
tion sites to make separate collections of construction and demolition waste that is suitable for
reuse: untreated construction lumber waste, scrap metal and collectable cardboard waste.
These regulations only apply if a construction site produces over 50 kg of material weekly. This
has resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the amount of construction waste being sent to landﬁll.
Landﬁll
As YTV effectively controls the issue of collection contracts and the acceptance of material for
ﬁnal disposal, they have complete control over the quality and amount of material entering 
the Ämmässuo landﬁll. The site is currently expected to be operational until 2030. Leachate 
is collected and treated off site and all of the site’s landﬁll gas will be collected and used for 
electricity generation by 2002, even though the separation and composting of organic material
is expected to increase during this period.

Concepts and Case Studies

Additional information
As YTV is a non-proﬁt organisation its aim is not to maximise income by accepting large
amounts of waste material at their landﬁll site but to focus on developing systems to effectively
recover and recycle appropriate materials. In Helsinki it is clear that private recycling (in this case
paper) becomes more economically viable as the cost of ﬁnal disposal increases. 
Lahn-Dill-Kreis, Germany, 1996
Key IWM Characteristics: Control of all waste arisings (except packaging) and long-term
planning.
The county of Lahn-Dill-Kreis (LDK) manages almost all of the collection, and transport of
household and some assimilated industrial waste and the treatment and disposal of most 
solid waste occurring within the county. LDK manages the collection, treatment and disposal of
all waste arisings, except for packaging waste, which is managed by the DSD programme (see
Figure 3.7).

A breakdown of the 42% MSW recycled in Lahn-Dill-Kreis is as follows: 8.3% Paper, 2.1%
Glass, 1.4% Packaging, 9.9% Construction and demolition waste and 19.8% Soil reclamation. 
The German Packaging Ordinance came into effect on 12 June 1991. This law makes man-
ufacturers responsible for their product’s packaging ‘from the cradle to the grave’. Manufactur-
ers and retailers could be exempted from their obligation to accept returned packaging if they
joined a privately organised system for the collection and recycling of packaging waste. To reach
the recycling targets speciﬁed by the German Packaging Ordinance, which are signiﬁcantly high-
er than those speciﬁed by European Union Legislation, a national packaging recovery scheme
was established by Duales System Deutschland (DSD). Now DSD collects packaging material
(in a yellow bag) throughout Germany as a separate stream and recycles this packaging materi-
al as a separate stream.
Collection
Household waste is collected door to door every 2 weeks. All residents receive a grey bin for
household restwaste, a brown bio-bin; a blue bin for mixed paper (this collection system is

ﬁnanced 25% by Duales System Deutschland – DSD, the so-called Green Dot system) and a
yellow bag for packaging materials (funded entirely by DSD). This type of collection is charac-
teristic of the DSD system throughout Germany. Colour-separated glass is collected in con-
tainers at kerbside collection points (this collection is also ﬁnanced by DSD and run under the
auspices of the county system).
Treatment 
Private, DSD-run central sorting exists for the yellow bag materials as well as the paper collect-
ed. Materials are sorted into paper, composite containers, mixed plastics, plastic ﬁlm and alu-
minium and ferrous fractions. There is approximately 25% residue from the sorting process.
The sorting plant for paper separates the paper into mixed, cardboard, carton, printed and
newspaper fractions. Materials recycling is managed under the auspices of DSD. 
All collected bio-waste is taken to one of the three composting sites in LDK, located at the
LDK landﬁlls in Asslar, Oberseheld and Beilstein. The composting takes place in containers (rot-
boxes), and after the initial biodegradation, windrows are created outside for ﬁnal maturation.
The entire process takes between 2 and 4 months. Material sales are managed by a private
ﬁrm, with some compost bagged and some sold directly for agricultural use. The composting
process is rigorously controlled, and the produced compost is of very high quality.
No Energy from Waste incinerator currently exists within LDK County.
Landﬁll
In 1996, all household waste collected in the grey restwaste bins was sent to landﬁll. The land-
ﬁll is controlled, with gas and leachate collection, leachate transfer and treatment. About 500
kWh of electricity is produced from two gas engines utilising the landﬁll gas. Construction waste
is also recycled at the landﬁll, with a large processing machine arriving every 6 weeks to crush
the concrete and brick material down to gravel-size pieces. This material is then sold. 
Additional information – how to move towards Integrated Waste
Management
This system, which initially may appear to be integrated, is not, because of the parallel waste
management system that exists for packaging materials. Therefore, the system is operating at
sub-optimal efﬁciency at both an economic and an environmental level. This is highlighted by
the average price for recycled plastic, which was 2500 Deutschmarks (1278 euros, 1325 US
dollars) per tonne in Germany (EP&WL, 1999) compared with the price for virgin plastic,
which was 1400–1800 Deutschmarks (715–920 euros, 765–985 US dollars) at the time of
writing. Collection and recycling of packaging materials is carried out by a separate waste man-
agement system rather than being integrated into and treated as part of a single solid waste
stream. This has resulted in the duplication of collection rounds and even in the duplication of
Materials Recovery Facilities (one for packaging and one for other recyclable material). This par-
allel packaging collection system has been shown to be very expensive (Staudt, 1997), but even
if costs are driven down, it is unlikely that they will ever be as low as would be possible if a fully
Integrated Waste Management system was implemented. Although the current waste manage-
ment system has seen the volume of materials recycled steadily increase over the past 5 years,
a steady increase in the amount of material being recycled annually was the trend in Germany
before the Packaging Ordinance came into force.
Lahn-Dill-Kreis, Germany, 1996

Concepts and Case Studies

A waste stream analysis of the grey (restwaste) bins by LDK revealed that the DSD pro-
gramme is only moderately effective at collecting of packaging materials. LDK discovered that
the restwaste contained a high proportion of non-recovered DSD materials and had an organ-
ic waste content of approximately 40%. With a ban on organic materials entering landﬁlls in the
year 2005 (in German legislation) and no desire to build an Energy from Waste incinerator in
the region, the county waste managers collaborated with the University of Kassel to develop a
more environmentally and economically feasible solution for future waste management in LDK.
The system that has been developed seeks to stabilise, through a composting process, the
rest waste, and then remove metals, batteries and inert materials (such as sand and gravel,
which would be used as a construction material). The resulting product (the Dry Stabilate) has
a caloriﬁc value similar to high-grade brown coal or low-grade black coal and can be used
directly as a fuel in industrial processes. When burned this product yields less ash than conven-
tional coal incineration. The expectation is that this stabilised product will replace coal imports
and reduce overall greenhouse emissions, as the original waste material will not be landﬁlled
and will be valorised, replacing coal.
The composting and recovery process is operational and the stabilised fuel is currently being
baled and stored while emissions tests are being carried out. Plans are being developed for the
construction of an incinerator to burn the Dry Stabilate and recover both heat and power (see
Chapter 11, Biological treatment).
Changes in the 1996 collection system are envisioned by the LDK management to comple-
ment their new waste management system. In this new system, the yellow sack of the DSD
system will be eliminated. Households will still have grey bins, which will now include plastic
and metal packaging material and metals, and bio-bins for organic waste. Glass containers will
still accept glass, with the addition of another container for large plastic bottles. Blue bins will
only accept high-quality paper, and a blue bag will accept packaging paper and composite pack-
aging materials (which are currently placed in the yellow sack).
As indicated above, the existing waste management system in LDK is not fully integrated as
the parallel collection and treatment of packaging material occurs. The proposed new waste
management system is integrated as packaging material is included in a single solid waste
stream. From this solid waste stream paper, glass and plastic bottles are recycled, the separated
organic fraction is composted and all remaining restwaste will enter the new Dry Stabilisation
process that is linked to EfW incineration. The small percentage of residue remaining (mainly
ash) will be landﬁlled. This integrated system is expected to reduce both the cost and the envi-
ronmental burden of waste management in Lahn-Dill County in the long term.
The anticipated alteration of the waste management approach in LDK has led to a legal dis-
pute between the LDK Local Authorities and the Dual System company. At the time of writing
the ﬁnal outcome of the related court case is still to be decided. A preliminary injunction rules
that LDK must not be a shareholder in a waste management company competing with DSD.
The legal reasoning behind this decision touches on fundamental aspects of the German Pack-
aging Ordinance. An analysis might suggest that the text of the German Ordinance currently in
force could possibly hinder the development of creative and innovative approaches towards
Sustainable Waste Management.

Vienna, Austria, 1996
Key IWM Characteristics: Control of all waste arisings (except packaging), public accept-
ability and continual technology improvements.
Waste collection, street sweeping, recycling, composting and disposal of the municipal waste
arising within Vienna municipality are all operated by Magistratsabteilung 48 (MA48); this depart-
ment is directly controlled by the City Council of Vienna. Energy from Waste (EfW) incineration
(district heating and electricity generation) is managed by another company (Fernwärme Wien),
and the slag is returned to MA48 for disposal (see Figure 3.8). 
The ﬁrst comprehensive waste strategy including separate collection in Vienna was intro-
duced in 1985, but separate collection of recyclable material (mainly glass) has been ongoing
since the late 1970s.

On February 5th 1993, Austrian industry founded Altstoff Recycling Austria AG (ARA) for 
the implementation of the country’s Packaging Ordinance. The company’s brief was to 
organise a nation-wide system for the collection and recovery or recycling of packaging waste.
Unlike DSD, ARA is responsible for sales packaging as well as for secondary and transport 
packaging.
Since the ﬁrst recycling programme for paper was established in 1974, communication with
the public has been regular and extensive. The current waste management system enjoys 
wide public support. After a brief and unsuccessful trial with a ‘dirty MRF’ in the early 1970s,
Magistratsabteilung 48 now believes that the separate collection of recyclables is key to ensur-
ing a good quality product.
Collection
Household waste and paper and cardboard collection in Vienna takes place door to door. 
Collection of clear glass, coloured glass, metals, plastics and composite cartons takes place 
from kerbside collection points. Biowaste bins are located throughout the city at the kerbside

collection points. In the town outskirts, biowaste bins are also located in gardens of one or two
family houses with sufﬁcient space. Restwaste is collected, on average, once or twice per week
from individual households and delivered to one of the two EfW incinerators.
Treatment 
In Vienna the materials that are separately collected are transported directly to reprocessors,
with the exception of plastics which, are sorted by resin type. 
There is one transfer station, where recyclable materials and waste are collected for trans-
port to materials reprocessors or landﬁll. The station acts not only as a transfer station but also
as a sorting and processing plant. Organic material is ‘prepared’, sorted and homogenised and
mixed with additional material to improve its structure. The output of the transfer station is
transported to the composting plant, to recycling ﬁrms, to incinerators and to the landﬁll. 
The ‘pre-compost’ is transported to the Lobau composting plant. This plant is equipped with
leachate collection and the resulting leachate is recirculated through windrows (see Chapter 11).
The entire process takes about 3–4 months. 
The composting process undergoes rigorous quality controls every 3–4 weeks and process-
es are monitored for pH change, water loss, nitrate, nitrite and total nitrogen. Additionally
heavy metal content is regularly sampled. All ﬁnal compost is tested by an outside laboratory
and must meet Austrian Standards S2200 and S2203. Each batch is recorded with its relevant
data. The resulting compost is then transported to the Schafﬂerhof composting plant where it is
screened and marketed. It is then spread on the farmland of Vienna, distributed free of charge
at the recycling centres and given to gardeners. 
The majority of restwaste is taken to one of the two EfW incinerators (which are managed by a
separate department) – Flötzersteig (in the west, 200,000 tonnes/year) and Spittelau (in the cen-
tre, 250,000 tonnes/year) – operating in the Vienna Region. Along with household waste, sewage
sludge is also treated. The Spittelau facility provides both electricity and district heating, while
Flötzersteig only supplies district heating. Although both incinerators were built in the 1970s, both
have been upgraded and are equipped with air ﬁlters and de-NOx devices (see Chapter 12). The
slag from the incineration process is taken back by MA48 and after metal is removed, slag and ash
are mixed with concrete and used in the construction of the landﬁll site infrastructure.
Landﬁll
The Rautenweg landﬁll is the only landﬁll in Vienna, located to the north-east of the city in an
old gravel pit. All restwaste is sent directly to this landﬁll. Landﬁll gas is collected, and since
1994, electricity has been generated from 12 gas engines, supplying 42,000 MWh in 1996. All
electricity generated is supplied to the Vienna grid.
Additional information
For all packaging materials collected, the municipality receives a refund from ARA. In 1996,
39% of all paper collected qualiﬁed for a refund, along with 100% of glass, 65% of all metals,
and 100% of plastics. In 1996, this refund to MA48 amounted to 11% of the organisation’s 
total revenue. Again, as in the Lahn-Dill-Kreis case study, the inefﬁciencies created due to the 
existence of a parallel collection, transport and recovery scheme for packaging ensure that the
waste management system as a whole is operating at sub-optimum levels both environmentally
and economically. 
Vienna, Austria, 1996

Concepts and Case Studies

In Vienna the separate collection of recyclables is an integral part of the management sce-
nario, although questions on system cost are being raised (Brunner, 1998). Vienna’s waste
management strategy currently requires more capacity for either EfW incineration or landﬁll as
waste generation is increasing. This extra capacity is unlikely to become available through the
building of a third incinerator due to the current political climate. A possible solution may be to
attempt to increase composting and recycling levels to compensate for the extra waste being
generated. As Vienna is so incinerator dependent, innovative developments with respect to the
incineration of selected waste fractions offer possible solutions. 
Malmö Region, Sweden, 1996
IWM Key Characteristics: Economy of scale, control of all waste arisings and continuous
technology improvements.
In the Malmö Region, household and industrial waste collection has remained a responsibility of
each of the nine municipalities (either through private companies or municipally owned ones),
Waste treatment and disposal are managed by SYSAV, a public/private company that was set up by
the municipalities. Waste treatment and disposal is managed using an integrated approach that
includes composting, recycling, EfW incineration and landﬁll. SYSAV has served to centralise and
co-ordinate waste treatment and disposal for the whole region (see Figure 3.9).
Since the establishment of SYSAV and the construction of the ﬁrst incineration plant in Malmö
in 1974, continuous facility improvements coupled with more stringent pollution control limits have
allowed incineration to play a signiﬁcant role in the management of solid waste in the region.

Solid waste is managed within the guidelines of the 1990 Regional Waste Management Plan
and the following ‘Eco-cycling plan’. The principle of eco-cycling is stated as ‘that which is
removed from nature shall, in an endurable way, be used, recovered, recycled or disposed of
in such a way as to occasion the least possible exploitation of resources and without causing
damage to the environment’ (SYSAV, 1996). Within this concept is the acceptance of market
forces. A market for recovered materials is understood to be essential for the collection of any
material. If no viable market exists, no recycling occurs.

Currently Producer Responsibility legislation, which requires the separate collection of pack-
aging materials, a future ban on landﬁlling combustible material (2002) and landﬁlling organic 
material (2005) is threatening to undermine the efﬁciently operating Integrated Waste Manage-
ment system of the Malmö Region. 
Collection
Restwaste is collected by each municipality separately. Due to the demographic variation and as
each of the nine municipalities is responsible for their own solid waste collection, different types
of collection systems exist in each municipality. Six of the municipalities use private companies
for waste collection, while three rely on municipally run departments. 
Treatment 
All treatment of solid waste arising in the region, both municipal and industrial is managed by
SYSAV. Recycling is managed either through municipal activities, Producer Responsibility initia-
tives or one of SYSAV’s nine recycling centres. No central sorting of recovered materials exists
as it is believed that working conditions in Materials Recovery Facilities are unacceptable. Two
transfer stations, one in Trelleborg and one in Lund, serve to help optimise transport of house-
hold waste to the Malmö EfW incinerator. 
Two source-separated composting sites are currently being operated by SYSAV, one at the
Trelleborg landﬁll and the other at the Malmö landﬁll. Organic materials are deposited in
unused landﬁll cells and ‘mattress’ composted. This Danish system deposits organic materials in
layers and turns them regularly. The total process takes about 3 years from start to ﬁnish. The
advantages of this type of system are multiple: no new site need be constructed, leachate col-
lection is already established, the location is central, and costs are low. As only garden waste is
accepted for composting, the compost produced in the Malmö Region has qualiﬁed for KRAV
eco-production status, and is of very good quality. Compost is sold at the recycling centres, for
soil improvement or for use on golf courses.
The EfW incinerator at the Malmö site has the capacity to accept about 220,000 tonnes per
annum and in 1996 treated 209,000 tonnes, of which about 59% was household restwaste.
Fly ash is deposited in a special cell at the landﬁll. Slag is further sorted, and metals are removed.
The remaining slag is graded and sold as aggregate. The aggregate can be sold; since over the
last decade extensive tests have been performed on the environmental performance of the
aggregate and it has been found to have very low leaching properties. 
In addition to the aggregate, the EfW incinerator also provides heat to the district heating
scheme, supplying some 20–25% of Burlöv and Malmö’s needs (543,000 MWh sold in 1996).
Both dry scrubbing and fabric ﬁlters are used in the ﬂue gas cleaning. 
Landﬁll
The area has two landﬁlls, one near Malmö and the other near Trelleborg. As most of the
household restwaste passes through the incinerator ﬁrst, only 6% of household restwaste was
directly landﬁlled. Of the household restwaste that is landﬁlled, much of it is deposited in bio-
cells, where special landﬁll gas collection and energy generation takes place. Additionally, all
leachate collected is ﬁltered on site, and several drainage ponds using reed bed ﬁlters are being
tested. The Malmö landﬁll is built out into the sea. If the landﬁll leaked, sea water would ﬂow in,
rather than leachate ﬂowing out.

Chapter 3: The Development of Integrated Waste Management Systems
Concepts and Case Studies

Additional information
Future developments include the possible construction of a new EfW incinerator with heat
recovery and electricity generation. If planning permission is approved then this facility would
accept wastes from neighbouring regions. This may counter some of the effects of the parallel
system for packaging materials and the inevitable erosion of available waste arisings. An 
anaerobic digestion plant is also planned, which will accept organic material from food proces-
sors and agricultural wastes.
The existing Integrated Waste Management system in Malmö is the result of a continual
development process. The combination of effective management and control of all waste arisings
have allowed the creation of an effective Integrated Waste Management system. This integrat-
ed system is now threatened by the establishment of a parallel system for the collection and
treatment of packaging waste, which will result in the duplication in some of the operations that
are already being carried out effectively. The environmental and economic beneﬁts of such par-
allel systems have yet to be proven, and in Malmö’s case it is difﬁcult to see where any such
beneﬁts will occur.

Abfuhrwesen Zürich (AWZ) is the municipal department of the City of Zürich, which operates 
the regional Integrated Waste Management system. AWZ manages the collection, recycling,
composting, incineration and disposal of the municipal waste arising within the city of Zürich and
the surrounding 54 communes (see Figure 3.10).

The ﬁrst incineration plant was built in Zürich in 1904, and since then, continual facility
improvements coupled with increased pollution controls have meant that incineration (at a rel-
atively high ﬁxed cost) has played a central role in the MSW management in Zürich. 
In 1993 AWZ instituted a polluter pays scheme, known as the Züri-Sack. The extra income
raised from these fees was supposed to help offset higher waste management costs, affecting the
people who produce the waste directly. The introduction of the Züri-Sack has seen an increase in

recycling activities and composting, and a reduction of approximately 30% in the amount 
of waste available in the restwaste stream. Zuri-Sack charges are ﬁxed at the original 1993 
price.
Collection
All household restwaste must be in a Züri-sack and is placed either in front of the building, or in
special waste collection containers. This is collected, on average, twice per week from house-
holds and delivered to one of the two Energy from Waste (EfW) incinerators. Due to the
decrease in the amount of waste collected over the past 5 years, waste will be collected on a
weekly basis. This change will take place gradually over the years 1997–1998. A network of 
community composting centres exists and collection of organic material can also be arranged
with AWZ. 
Glass is collected in clear, green and brown fractions from 164 streetside collection points,
which are serviced once every week or once every 2 weeks. Whole wine and champagne
bottles are collected in separate containers. Bundled paper is collected from households and
ofﬁces once per month. Cardboard collection takes place every 2 months from households
and ofﬁces. Composite packaging and laminated paper are not included. Tin cans, metal foils,
wires, cables, beverage cans, pipes and tops of jars are among the metal items targeted for 
the metal container collection. Additionally, special pick-up of bulky metal items can be
arranged.
Treatment
As the two EfW incinerators are relatively near the city centre, there are no transfer stations.
No central sorting of recovered materials exists. The majority of materials recycling occurs by
direct transport of the collected materials to reprocessors. This makes the quality of the col-
lected material difﬁcult to assess, but a very impressive purity rate of 98% for glass has been
measured.
At a central composting facility all organic materials are shredded and composted in 
open windrows (see Chapter 11). They are turned regularly and heavy metal concentrations
are measured six times a year. The compost produced is of a high quality, but no market devel-
opment has occurred and compost is given away free to farmers (AWZ pays the farmers to
cover haulage costs).
Two EfW plants, Josefstrasse (two incineration lines – one rebuilt in 1975, the other built in
1996) and Hagenholz (two incineration lines – built in 1968, refurbished in 1989, 1993) oper-
ate in Zürich city. Household restwaste, assimilated waste and some hospital waste are incin-
erated. Both facilities provide electricity and district heating. Both have been continually upgraded
and rebuilt, with extensive emission control technology being added in the early 1990s. As the
composition of waste entering the incinerator has changed, the caloriﬁc value has also steadily
risen. Current estimates set the ﬁgure at about 12 MJ/kg. As the facilities were not built for such
high energy inputs, certain difﬁculties have been experienced and additional facility maintenance
has been required. 
Pre-1997, the incinerator slag was used for road construction, however, a recent ordinance
now forbids this. Currently, all slag and ﬁlter dust are taken to special landﬁlls outside of the Zürich
area. It is estimated that the slag contains approximately 9% metal, and although no metal 
separation currently takes place, it is possible that it will be added in the future.
Zürich, Switzerland, 1997 
69
Concepts and Case Studies

Landﬁll
Only slag from the incineration plant is landﬁlled. The ash is exported to Germany for disposal
in hazardous waste landﬁlls. The slag is deposited in one of three controlled landﬁlls (one in St
Gallen, and two in Bern). All are special reactive landﬁlls with leachate collection and treatment.
As none accepts any biodegradable material, no methane is generated from these facilities.
Additional information
AWZ in Zürich can be regarded as a victim of its own success. AWZ and city politicians have
successfully educated the public in how to manage their solid waste effectively. However,
decreasing tonnages entering the incinerators, exacerbated by an economic recession, have
meant that only 50% of the available capacity is used. Logically, the per-tonne-costs of the
incinerators (already operating with high ﬁxed costs) have further increased. 
Other factors also contribute to this situation of escalating costs. From 1997, industries and
businesses within Zürich city were no longer obliged to use AWZ’s collection or treatment
services. This liberalisation of the market has meant that waste arisings in Zürich need not be
treated or disposed of in Zürich (several of the regions surrounding Zürich have incineration
facilities with signiﬁcantly lower gate fees). Additionally, as of 1999, the 54 surrounding com-
munities in the Zürich canton will no longer be forced to use the AWZ facilities.
Despite the fact that AWZ has operated an effective Integrated Waste Management system
and has developed initiatives that have resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the amount of rest-
waste generated by the general public (corresponding to an increase in both recycling and
composting) the entire system is under severe pressure. 
The loss of control of all waste arisings will result in a further loss of material and the efﬁcien-
cy of the IWM system, which is already operating sub optimally, will drop further still. AWZ
incinerator costs will continue to rise to compensate for the lack of available feedstock. In an
attempt to break this vicious circle (that has been imposed upon them by a combination of their
own successful waste minimisation scheme and political forces beyond their control), AWZ are
proposing a series of actions. Investigation into the possible incineration of 10,000 tonnes of
sewage sludge are underway. The price of the Zuri-Sacks was increased in August 1998 (inter-
estingly this may result in a further reduction in the amount of restwaste that is available), and
the frequency of collection may be decreased to once per week to reduce collection costs.
AWZ will also actively try to win back industrial clients by adopting a more ﬂexible approach to
contracts and offer a more transparent pricing structure.
AWZ accepts that it is essential for them to become more competitive compared to private
waste contractors (see O’Brien, 1998) and surrounding regions’ waste management opera-
tions to secure adequate waste arisings to operate their Integrated Waste Management system
under optimum conditions. This rapid management response to a very serious crisis should
result in this IWM system evolving once more to add economic sustainability to a system that has
already focused on environmental effectiveness and social acceptability.

IWM Key Characteristics: Economy of scale, stability, control of all waste arisings, continu-

The source separation of recyclable material, incineration of ‘clean’ residue, utilisation of
incinerator ash and recycling of construction waste results in the recovery of approximately
97% of all waste arisings in Copenhagen (see Figure 3.11). Copenhagen’s Municipal Solid
Waste stream includes construction and demolition waste, which is 48% of all waste arisings
(90% of the construction and demolition waste is recyclable). If this material is subtracted from
the waste management system, to allow a comparison with the other European case studies a
slightly different, but by no means less impressive, picture of Copenhagen’s integrated system
can be seen. The total amount of material recycled falls to 40%, which is still very high com-
pared to the ﬁgures from other systems, composting increases to 4%, incineration increases
dramatically to 53% and the total amount of material landﬁlled is 3%. The ﬁgures given below
include construction and demolition waste in the ﬁgure for total MSW generated.

Copenhagen operates a truly Integrated Waste Management system. All waste streams are
source separated (no materials recycling facilities are required). Recyclable material is delivered
directly to reprocessors. Organic material is composted. Non-recyclable material is incinerated
with energy recovery (supplying the district heating scheme) and the resulting ash contains
little or no hazardous compounds and is used as a raw material in road building. All construc-
tion and demolition waste is recycled as several different grades of aggregates. Less than 4% of
the total waste arisings in the Copenhagen area are disposed of to landﬁll. 
Collection
In the municipality of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg householders are obliged by law to source
separate their waste. Organic waste and residual restwaste are collected by the public/private 
company Kjøbenhavns Grundejeres Renholdelsesselskab (R’98), while all other recyclable
material, such as glass, paper and magazines, are taken to neighbourhood kerbside collection
containers. These kerbside collection areas also have hazardous waste collection containers. 
All recyclable (wood, metal, plastic, etc.) and non-recyclable materials are also accepted at 
large district recycling stations. Commercial and industrial waste (which must also be source
separated) is collected by private waste transport companies.

Treatment 
All source-separated material is delivered directly to reprocessors. The collected organic material
is composted; no organic material enters the landﬁll. All household restwaste, commercial rest-
waste and industrial restwaste is burnt in EfW incinerators. This restwaste material contains
extremely low levels of heavy metals and other hazardous compounds, therefore the ash from
the incinerators is considered inert enough to be used as a building material. Both of Copen-
hagen’s EfW incinerators are connected to the district heating scheme.
Construction waste is recycled at a single large facility close to the centre of Copenhagen.
The majority of the construction waste is recycled as aggregate for road building and is sold at
15% of the price of virgin aggregate. 
Landﬁll
A sanitary landﬁll, opened in 1989 and at the time of writing having a remaining capacity of
2,000,000 m3 (an estimated lifespan of 8 years) is available for ﬁnal disposal of inert non-
recyclable material. 
The overall result of this well-observed and well-enforced source separation of recyclable
material, incineration of ‘clean’ residue, utilisation of incinerator ash and recycling of construc-
tion waste is that approximately 96% of all waste arisings in Copenhagen are recycled or
recovered (i.e. incinerated with energy recovery). Only 35,147 tonnes of inert non-recyclable
material were sent to landﬁll in Copenhagen in 1996. 
Additional information
This is yet another example of an efﬁciently operating Integrated Waste Management system.
Again this system has developed over a long period of time. R’98 was initially granted the monop-
oly on waste collection in 1964. Several waste management problems such as a lack of landﬁll
space and groundwater pollution (both 1983–85) have driven the development of the integrated
system forwards, as solutions were required within short time-scales. 
The continual improvement of the EfW incinerators’ gas cleaning technology has ensured 
that these incinerators are viewed as a source of clean renewable energy by the people of
Copenhagen (WMIC, 1995), and the district heating scheme results in a major reduction in
Copenhagen’s CO2 balance, and may further help in the public acceptance of the EfW 
incinerators. Good source separation of household waste enables the ash remaining from the
incineration of this waste to be used as a raw material in road building.
Public support for the waste management system in Copenhagen has allowed the develop-
ment of an integrated system that can recover very high percentages of all waste arisings
(96%). To achieve this ﬁgure it is essential that the recycling of construction waste take place as
this signiﬁcantly reduces the amount of material requiring ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll.
The public/private waste management company, R’98, has used its control on material
entering the landﬁll to encourage recycling, and the well-informed people of Copenhagen sep-
arate recyclable materials with high efﬁciency.
Enabling legislation exists in Copenhagen that provides a framework within which an 
integrated approach to waste management can operate. For example this legislation allows for
the prosecution of individuals and companies who do not separate their waste as well as 
collection companies that accept unsorted waste material, thus ensuring the smooth operation
of the collection and recycling operations.

Seattle, USA, 1998
Key IWM Characteristics: Control of all waste arisings and public support.
In 1987 waste management in Seattle faced a crisis: the city’s last two landﬁlls had closed and
waste was being sent 32 km south-east of Seattle to the Cedar Hills Regional Landﬁll in King
County. This resulted in an increase in the cost of waste management to Seattle’s public of 82%.
The waste management contract with King County required Seattle to ﬁnd an alternative dispos-
al site by 1993 or be locked into the existing contract for the next 40 years. The City initially
considered waste incineration as a solution to this problem but the public were totally opposed
to this approach. The City therefore decided that the only acceptable approach was to maximise
the amount of material that could be diverted from ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll by recycling and com-
posting. Waste minimisation was encouraged and recycling was promoted by the provision of
kerbside collection of recyclable material and garden waste. A variable rate pricing system was
developed based on the volume of garbage (restwaste) bins required by each household.
Up until 1997, the Seattle Engineering Department Solid Waste Utility (SWU) was responsi-
ble for all solid waste planning and management. In January 1997, SWU became Seattle Public
Utilities (SPU), which now provides stormwater, water, drainage and wastewater services as
well as solid waste services (see Figure 3.12).

In 1989, the document On the Road to Recovery: Seattle’s Integrated Solid Waste Management
Plan was published and this outlined how Seattle would achieve recycling or composting 
of 60% of all wastes by 1998. In 1998, the document On the Path to Sustainability was
published: this is Seattle’s new solid waste management plan and it includes environmental,
economic and social considerations within its stated goals, policies and programmes.
Collection
State law (RCW 35.21, 1962) gives Seattle express authority to control all waste collection and
recycling through exclusive contracts. Residential waste collection (restwaste, garden waste and
recyclables) and Commercial waste collection (restwaste and recyclables) are currently con-
tracted out to private companies.
Two different kerbside collection systems for recyclables operate in Seattle. The North 
system requires source separation into ‘three stackable containers’ and collection is weekly.
The South system is a co-mingled collection and occurs on a monthly basis: all recyclables

except glass are put into a 120 litre green bin, and glass is placed into a basket that ‘nests’ inside
the co-mingled bin to prevent broken glass from contaminating the other recyclables. The 
frequency of garden waste collection depends on the time of year; more collections are 
made during Autumn (for leaves) and Spring (for grass cuttings). In 1988 the City adopted an
ordinance requiring the separation of garden waste from restwaste.
SPU owns and operates two of the four transfer stations (known as Recycling and Disposal
stations) in Seattle. These facilities accept delivered restwaste (a fee applies) recyclables (no fee)
and garden waste (small fee applies). Some 333,400 vehicles used the two facilities in 1997.
Two privately owned transfer stations accept commercial restwaste and sorted construction
and demolition waste.
All restwaste picked up by the collection vehicles is delivered to the transfer stations and this
material plus all of the delivered restwaste is compacted (approximately 25 tonnes) into 12
metre sealed shipping containers. The containers are delivered by truck to a railway station in
the City, where they are loaded onto railcars for onward transportation to Oregon. 
Treatment 
Collected garden waste is delivered to a privately owned composting facility (Cedar Grove)
where nutrient-rich compost is produced. The majority of this compost is sold in bulk as a 
fertiliser/soil improver and is purchased by landscapers and homeowners. Cedar Grove also
bag (two cubic foot bags) some of the compost and this is sold at grocery stores, hardware
stores and other retail outlets. 
Two private facilities sort and process the recyclable materials collected in Seattle. At the
time of writing, both of the kerbside recycling contractors sort and sell the materials they col-
lect. New recycling contracts started in April 2000, when all of the collected recyclable materi-
als went to a single private facility in south Seattle, which will be responsible for both sorting and
selling the material. Currently the majority of the recycled materials are processed within
North America. Only 25% of mixed paper and newspaper is exported to Asia, as well as 40%
of HDPE and 50% of PET. All of the cardboard, glass and metal collected in Seattle is recycled
within North America.
Landﬁll
SPU has a contract with Washington Waste Systems (WWS) for rail haulage and disposal of the
restwaste from Seattle. The contract runs until 2028, with the possibility of termination in
either 2001 or 2014 if SPU chooses. WWS is responsible for transporting the waste containers
by rail from Seattle to 10 miles south of Arlington, Oregon, to a siding at the Columbia Ridge
Landﬁll, where they are unloaded and hauled by truck a short distance to the working face of
the landﬁll, a total journey of well over 260 km. Each waste train is made up of approximately
100 waste containers and leaves Seattle three times a week.
The Columbia Ridge Landﬁll and Recycling Centre is located on a 800 hectare site in Gilliam
County, Oregon. The actual disposal cells (of which there are 20) of the landﬁll occupy 260
hectares. The area offers a good degree of natural environmental protection. It is 
geologically stable, receives less than 23 centimetres of rain per year and the groundwater is
150 metres below the bottom of the landﬁll protected by naturally occurring, low-permeability
soils. The landﬁll includes a composite liner system and collection systems to control both
leachate and gas. In the event of a leak, an extensive monitoring system of gas monitoring

probes, and vadose zone (the unsaturated zone between the water table and the surface of
the ground) monitoring will allow early detection and repair. As one cell is being ﬁlled, the next
is being excavated and when each cell is full, it is capped with 1.2 metres of clay and topsoil and
planted for grazing. The site has been operational since 1990 and is permitted and regulated by
the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. In order to use the landﬁll, SPU has to sat-
isfy strict recycling requirements established by Oregon law.
Additional information
The schematic diagram presented in Figure 3.12 shows the material ﬂow of the basic waste
management system in Seattle and shows some details of the amount of material collected,
treated and disposed of by the overall system. Contamination rates of the material collected for
recycling and composting are not available, therefore the amount of residue from these
processes cannot be calculated. As sorting, processing and composting are carried out by pri-
vate companies, the waste they produce is included in the commercial waste streams, there-
fore the ﬁnal amounts of material being sent to landﬁll are correct.
Seattle’s waste management operations are paid for by a self-supporting solid waste fund
that receives no subsidies. The revenue from the variable rate system pays for all collection,
landﬁll, as well as closure costs of Seattle’s old landﬁlls together with litter and grafﬁti clean up.
All residents within the City of Seattle are required by law to have waste containers and pay for
the collection service. The costs of different containers are presented in Table 3.7.
In 1998 the Solid Waste Fund expenses were $82.1 million. This is broken down as follows:
• Garbage, yard waste and recycling collection – 31%
• Transfer station, hauling and disposal – 29%
• Household hazardous waste – 1%
• Litter control – 3%
• General administrative – 7%
• Customer billing and collection – 5%
• Taxes – 14%
• Depreciation – 6%
• Interest expense and amortisation – 4%
Public support for the existing waste management system is high: 90% of the people inter-
viewed in a city-wide residential survey said that they were very satisﬁed with the system.

Case study analysis – conclusions
1. The variation between each of the case study programmes was seen to be extensive but
common ‘Drivers’, such as closure of incinerators and lack of landﬁll space (often a crisis
forces a change) were identiﬁed. 
2. Contrary to the belief that considers environmental issues ahead of social and economic
issues, there was common agreement amongst the majority of the waste managers from
the case study programmes that in reality their priority order for sustainable waste manage-
ment has generally been: 
2.1 economic viability
2.2 social pressure
2.3 environmental beneﬁts
Environmental beneﬁts cannot be engineered into the development of a waste manage-
ment system unless that system is economically viable and socially acceptable, hence all
three areas must be addressed simultaneously. 
3. An integrated approach to waste management is being adopted at a local level throughout
Europe.
4. Enabling legislation can have a positive impact on the development of effective waste man-
agement systems whereas prescriptive legislation can have a negative inﬂuence on both
existing and developing waste management systems. 
5. The waste hierarchy was only considered to be useful as a list of possible treatment
options.
6. More ﬂexibility and data-based decisions are necessary at the level of waste management
operations.
7. There is also evidence for system evolution, from waste management practices, to Inte-
grated Waste Management, to resources management and on towards sustainability. 
What the case studies show is that although waste management systems are complex, the
adoption of an integrated approach can be characterised by a series of clear steps that lead to
the implementation of the general principles of IWM as described in Chapter 2. These steps do
not occur in a rigid order, but as would be expected in these diverse systems, they occur as and
when they become necessary for the further development (or evolution) of the system.

Madras, India, 1999 – a case study from a country with a developing
economy
The previous case studies all relate to countries with developed economies. In these scenarios
the majority of residents can afford to pay taxes or fees, which in turn pay for the maintenance
and development of waste management services. In countries with developing economies,
those who can afford to pay taxes are often in the minority. The proportion of tax revenue allo-
cated to waste management, although high (Bartone, 1999), is often insufﬁcient to fund either
effective collection or disposal due to the poor existing municipal waste management infra-
structure and the huge number of people the system must serve (see Chapter 2, Integrated
Waste Management in countries with developing economies). 
A partial solution to India’s increasing waste management problems has been developed by
a community group in Madras that helps local people collect, compost and recycle a signiﬁcant
fraction of the waste generated in their neighbourhood. Although the system does require res-
idents to contribute a separate (small) waste management fee, this is clearly considered accept-
able with respect to the signiﬁcant improvement that they see in their immediate environment.
This is an example of a small-scale, community-based Integrated Waste Management system.
Introduction
In India the problems of collection, transport, treatment and disposal of Municipal Solid Wastes
(MSW) are straining both the ﬁnancial resources of the local authorities and their physical capa-
bilities. The lack of adequate resources, both ﬁnancial and human often, leads to the problem
of waste management being neglected; few of the waste management laws are actually
enforced and there is an acute lack of suitable waste disposal sites. 
The population of the four metropolises of India (Bombay, Delhi, Madras and Calcutta) 
produce 0.5 kg/person/day of waste. Approximately 60% of the dry recyclable material in MSW in
India is recycled by scavengers (known as rag pickers), thus little real economic advantage exists for
the municipal authorities to attempt to recover further materials or energy from the MSW. The
Indian life style results in the waste containing a large organic fraction and therefore its moisture
content is as high as 50% by weight. (Due to the Indian diet, this organic material is virtually meat
free, making it an ideal material to compost.) This organic fraction is not recovered by the rag pick-
ers. Consequently, a large fraction of the total MSW generated accumulates on the side of the
streets, where it is dumped indiscriminately by residents and small commercial operations. 
The city of Madras (174 km2) is the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu located on the south-
eastern coast of India on the Bay of Bengal, which had a population of 5,900,000 in 1995, and
a growth rate of 2.34% per annum. The population density is approximately 22,000 per km2
with 39% of the population living in slums. Currently, 68% of the MSW in Madras is of resi-
dential origin, 14% is generated from commercial establishments, schools and institutions gen-
erate 12% of the MSW arisings, while industry accounts for just 2%; the remainder comes
from hospitals and clinics (which is also disposed of with the MSW). The cost of MSW man-
agement in Madras is between US$40 and 45 per tonne.
Residents’ associations in the city of Madras met with local authorities to voice their concern
over the lack of an effective waste management system in the area. In the absence of any 
sustained effort or resources being provided by the local authority, the lead was taken by a
non-governmental organisation, EXNORA, which utilised scavengers and the unemployed to

manage wastes without requiring funding from the local authorities. Since 1989 over 5000
dirty streets of Madras in South India have undergone total transformation as residents manage
their own solid wastes by employing rag pickers to clean streets and collect wastes from
homes. EXNORA has succeeded in motivating residents to improve their own environment,
and has gained national and international recognition as the concept expands to other Indian
cities. The group was featured in the 100 best practices selected globally by the UN Council for
Human Settlements (Habitat).
The development of EXNORA
In September 1988 a bank ofﬁcer in Madras, concerned about the build-up of municipal waste
in the streets, concluded that the solution involved the participation of the local people who
generated the waste. This led to the development of an organisation that planned to formulate
and practice EXcellent, NOvel and RAdical ideas to solve this waste management problem.
EXNORA was ﬁrst introduced in the Adyar locality of Madras in October 1988. The residents
took collective responsibility to ensure that the waste generated in their homes was collected
and transported to identiﬁed dump-sites by a local rag picker now employed as a ‘street beautiﬁer’.
The scheme is funded by small subscriptions (US$3.00 per year) from the residents them-
selves.
EXNORA organises local neighbourhoods typically consisting of 80–150 households, each
of which is called a ‘Civic EXNORA’. They employ a ‘street beautiﬁer’, who is provided with a
uniform and a tricycle cart and training. Each ‘street beautiﬁer’ collects waste from every
household in their neighbourhood. Currently this waste is not separated, but home sorting is
planned in the future by starting a public education programme. The collected waste is sorted
into a biodegradable fraction and a recyclable fraction. The ‘street beautiﬁer’ sells the recyclable
fraction; this revenue is in addition to a basic salary of approximately US$25–40 per month,
which is collected from the residents. The organic fraction and any residue from the recyclable
fraction is taken to the local municipal waste collection point. The ‘street beautiﬁer’ must also
sweep the streets in his area. Before and after photographs show remarkable results.

Table 3.8 Cost of operations of Civic EXNORA

The system is based entirely on public participation through neighbourhood committees.
The role of the EXNORA Central ofﬁce is basically to initiate and catalyse the process, and pro-
vide the practical expertise. Initially, residents had to be persuaded to address the issue. Now
that their success is well known, neighbourhoods ask for assistance to start their own Civic
EXNORA. Depending on the community, EXNORA either pays the initial start-up costs of
approximately US$250, or asks the neighbourhood to provide it. A breakdown of the costs of
a typical EXNORA is presented in Table 3.8. A major advantage of the EXNORA approach is
the low capital and operational costs required to manage MSW. This is primarily because of the
simplicity of the scheme and the efﬁciency of the small-scale units that are strongly supported
by the residents of each area (as they experience the improvement in their immediate envi-
ronment).
EXNORAs are in the process of scaling up activities to larger communities. This involves
organising ‘street beautiﬁers’, rag pickers and local unemployed young people to form a micro-
enterprise (waste collection, sorting and composting) with the support of the community. 
Each micro-enterprise produces and markets compost made from the organic fraction of the
waste from approximately 4000 families. 
The scale of EXNORA’s success 
Since the ﬁrst EXNORA project began in 1988, the concept has spread rapidly throughout
India. There are now approximately 5500 schemes in operation serving some 2,750,000 
people. These ﬁgures are based upon the assumption that the average number of people in a
typical Indian household is ﬁve and 100 households make up a typical Civic EXNORA 
unit.

Box 3.1 Waste collected in Madras by EXNORA.
Loading capacity per tricycle: 100–150 kg, 2 × trips per day = 200–300 kg/day.
Total waste collection by EXNORA in Madras: 3000 units × 250 kg 
= 750 tons per day.
Total waste generated in Madras is 2600 tonnes/day, therefore approximately 29%
of the MSW is collected by EXNORAs:
• 39% of this collected material is organic and therefore can be composted,
• 4.5% of paper, and 
• 4.5% of rags, as well as 
• 3.5% of a mixture of plastic, glass, rubber, wood, leather, etc. can also be recycled.
This results in EXNORA diverting 386 tonnes (or 51.5%) of collected waste from
ﬁnal disposal.
EXNORA currently diverts almost 15% of the total waste arising in Madras from
ﬁnal disposal.

There were over 3000 Civic EXNORAs in Madras and neighbouring Kancheepuram 
and Tiruvallur districts in 1998. They collect approximately 30% of the total waste generated 
in Madras (about 2600 tons per day, excluding 500 tons of construction debris generated 
per day). Previously, the collected waste was managed by the municipality, which simply trans-
ported all of the material to the city’s dumps. Civic EXNORAs now support home composting
and ‘zero waste’ (to the municipality) with initiatives in 30 localities. Residents are being
encouraged to separate their waste at source into organic and recyclable fractions. Systems
such as these are to be introduced in all Civic EXNORAs as the next development in the 
residents’ waste management skills. 
The waste generated in Madras is largely (60%) biodegradable and with a signiﬁcant inert
fraction (27%), together accounting for about 90% of the material. The waste has a high
organic content (39%) coupled with high moisture levels (28%), and a carbon:nitrogen ratio of
31; thus it is suitable for biological treatment. The major sources of the waste that is generated
in Madras are the residential areas, contributing about 60% of the total waste stream. With the
help of EXNORA approximately 29% of the total Madras waste stream is collected and 15% is
diverted from ﬁnal disposal (see Box 3.1 for the calculation). 
Future plans for EXNORA 
The work of EXNORA is to continue, as outlined in Table 3.9. 
Conclusions
Stakeholder participation has been shown to be essential in Madras to support an integrated
approach to waste management, which includes an innovative but appropriate (low technology)
collection system (the employment of a scavenger), materials recycling and composting. The
EXNORA scheme has been successfully reapplied in and around Madras resulting in 29% of total
MSW arisings being collected, 11% of total MSW arisings being composted and 3.6% being recy-
cled. A further 8% of the collected material (the inert fraction) has been identiﬁed as suitable for use
as a substrate material for road building; this option is currently under investigation by EXNORA.
Optimisation of Integrated Waste Management systems
The principles of an integrated approach to solid waste management demonstrated in the case
studies can be seen to enable an increase in the levels of recycling and energy recovery. This
results in a decrease in the amount of material requiring ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll. In the past,
achievements such as these would be enough to satisfy most waste managers. But now, with
environmental issues such as ‘Global Warming’, ‘Eutrophication’ and ‘Acid rain’ receiving con-
siderable media attention, waste managers need more data on the environmental burdens
associated with each stage of the waste management system, from collection to ﬁnal disposal,
to help support their decisions with respect to each of these environmental concerns. 
The tool of Life Cycle Inventory, described in the next chapter, can be applied to Integrated
Solid Waste Management systems. It can provide waste managers with the data they require to
make informed decisions relating to their obligations to their customers (those people whose
waste they manage) to their environment at a local level, and to the environment at a global
level.

Summary
The technique of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is introduced. It is a tool that takes into account
all of the operations involved in providing a product or service. It consists of four stages: Goal 
Deﬁnition and Scope, Inventory Analysis, Impact Assessment and Interpretation, of which the
ﬁrst two are well developed and the latter two have been developed more recently. In view of
this, the analysis of solid waste management will be limited to a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) (com-
prising Goal Deﬁnition and Scope and Inventory Analysis stages). The analysis will not involve a
detailed Life Cycle Impact Assessment or Life Cycle Interpretation, although the following text
does describe these phases of LCA for completeness. Other assessments for economics, safety,
and site-speciﬁc environmental impact, although not part of an LCA, are equally important but
separate parts of an overall assessment of waste management systems.
What is Life Cycle Assessment?
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an environmental management tool increasingly used to under-
stand and compare how a product or service is provided ‘from cradle to grave’. The technique
examines every stage of the Life Cycle, from raw materials acquisition, through manufacture,
distribution, use, possible reuse/recycling and then ﬁnal disposal. In addition, every operation
or unit process within a stage is included. For each operation within a stage, the inputs (raw
materials, resources and energy) and outputs (emissions to air, water and solid waste) are
calculated. These inputs and outputs are then aggregated over the Life Cycle. The environ-
mental issues associated with these inputs and outputs are then evaluated in the Life Cycle
Impact Assessment. This provides a general overview of the product system and other assess-
ment tools can then be combined with this information to evaluate the product or service over
the entire Life Cycle. Conducting LCAs for alternative products or services thus allows for
improved understanding and comparisons to be made. An LCA will not necessarily guarantee
that one can choose which option is ‘environmentally superior’ or better than another, but it
will allow the trade-offs associated with each option to be assessed.
An explanation of these terms and their important differences is given in Table 4.1. 
Deﬁnition: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a compilation and evaluation of the inputs, out-
puts and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its Life Cycle.

Life Cycle Assessment requirements have also been included in legislation. The European
Community (EC) Ecolabelling Regulation (1992) requires that the whole Life Cycle be considered
when setting labelling criteria. Provision for Life Cycle Assessment is also included in the EC Pack-
aging and Packaging Waste Directive (1994), which states that ‘Life Cycle Assessments should be
completed as soon as possible to justify a clear hierarchy between reusable, recyclable and recov-
erable packaging.’ Practically, this will have to be carried out on a case-by-case basis. As it is devel-
oped further, it is likely that Life Cycle Assessment will ﬁnd many additional applications. 
Beneﬁts of the Life Cycle Approach
Life Cycle Assessment is an inclusive tool. The Life Cycle Inventory phase is essentially an
accounting process or mass balance for a system. All necessary inputs and emissions in many
stages and operations of the Life Cycle are considered to be within the system boundaries. This

and wastes of a product or service system, over the
whole Life Cycle ‘from cradle to grave’, i.e. from raw
material mining to ﬁnal disposal. Currently consid-
ered to consist of four stages: Goal Deﬁnition, Inven-
tory Analysis, Life Cycle Impact Assessment and
Life Cycle Interpretation.
Goal Deﬁnition and Scope Stage at which the functional unit for comparison is
deﬁned (normally per equivalent use), as well as the
study purpose, system boundaries, Life Cycle stages,
unit processes and scope of the assessment.

Life Cycle Interpretation

and indicators of the system Life Cycle. This stage is
the least well accepted or deﬁned.

includes not only direct inputs and emissions for production, distribution, use and disposal, but
also indirect inputs and emissions, such as from the initial production of the energy used. It is
essential that all of the processes are included in the boundaries to conduct a fair and transpar-
ent analysis. The reader should recognise that the analysis aggregates over time, i.e. all inputs
and emissions over the whole Life Cycle, are included regardless of when they occur, and
aggregates over space, i.e. all of the sites are included, regardless of where they are located. If
real environmental improvements are to be made, it is important to use LCA so that any 
system changes do not cause greater environmental deteriorations at another time or another
location in the Life Cycle. 
LCA offers the prospect of mapping the energy and material ﬂows as well as the resources,
solid wastes, and emissions of the total system, i.e. it provides a system ‘map’ that sets the 
stage for a holistic approach. Comparing such system maps for different options, whether 
for different products or waste management systems, allows the identiﬁcation of areas where
environmental improvement can be made.
Concern over the environment is sometimes expressed in terms of individual issues, such as
acidiﬁcation. Concentrating on one issue alone, however, ignores and may even worsen the
system with respect to other environmental issues. The power of LCA is that it expands the
debate on environmental concerns beyond a single issue, and attempts to address a broad
range of environmental issues. By using a quantitative methodology, at least for the inventory
inputs and outputs, it also gives an objective basis for decision making. The system map 
also allows other environmental information and assessment tools to be incorporated to be
used in conjunction with LCA. This helps to take some of the emotional element out of 
environmental debates. 
Limitations of the Life Cycle Approach
The seemingly all encompassing nature of LCA has proved very attractive. It may appear to
new users that it is a single tool that can accomplish ‘everything’ with regard to environmental
assessment. Many people have viewed LCA as being able to give a comprehensive, overall
assessment of a product, service or package. As a result, there have been ill-advised efforts to
use LCA as the only measurement tool when developing product labelling systems and during
policy making.
Unfortunately, there is a dilemma at the heart of LCA. As LCA employs an overall system
balance and functional unit to aggregate resource use, solid waste and emissions over time and
space, it is not able to assess the actual environmental effects of the product, package or 
service system. The International Standards Organisation (ISO) Life Cycle Impact Assessment
document (ISO/FDIS, 1999) speciﬁcally cautions that LCA does not predict actual impacts or
assess safety, risks, or whether thresholds are exceeded. The actual environmental effects 
of emissions and wastes will depend on when, where and how they are released into the 
environment, and other assessment tools and information must be utilised. 
For example, an aggregated emission, if released in one event from a point source such as a
reﬁnery, will have a very different environmental effect than releasing it continuously over years
from many diffuse sources. In addition to this, the inventory will allocate the inputs and outputs
of a reﬁnery to many products, i.e. different product systems. Recalling that LCA deals with
Limitations of the Life Cycle Approach

Concepts and Case Studies

only the inputs to a single system, only a small percentage of the total activity will be considered
for a single product. This problem is generally acknowledged, and the term ‘indicator’ is now used
to show that LCA does not predict actual environmental effects (ISO, 1999b; Owens, 1999).
The dilemma, therefore, is that LCA is the only tool that attempts to include the whole Life
Cycle, and all environmental issues associated with a product, package or service system, and
the only one that relates this to the functional unit, yet it cannot predict the actual environmen-
tal effects that are likely to occur. Other tools, such as risk assessment, are able to predict the
actual effects likely to occur, but they do not cover all environmental issues in the Life Cycle,
neither do they link the effects to the functional unit. 
Clearly no single tool can do everything – a combination of tools with complementary
strengths is needed for overall environmental management. Figure 4.1 presents a generic 
environmental management framework and shows the position of LCA with respect to other
environmental tools.
International Standards Organisation (ISO) – The ISO 14040 series
Based on the work carried out by the Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry
(SETAC), the ISO has further developed, and has managed to reach agreement among its
global membership on a series of standards: the ISO 14040 series on Life Cycle Assessment
(see Figure 4.2).

Within the 14040 series ISO is trying to establish a ﬂexible framework under which LCAs
can be carried out in a technically credible and practical manner. The ISO 14040 series is
intended as a non-prescriptive guide. There is no single method or end use for conducting LCA
studies, so organisations should have the ﬂexibility to implement LCA practically, based upon
the speciﬁc application and the requirements of the user. There are some mandatory steps
within the methodology that must be completed in order for the end results to be described as
‘ﬁt for use’. 
Structure of a Life Cycle Assessment
As a result of intensive recent efforts to deﬁne LCA structure and harmonise the various 
methods used, LCA is now considered to consist of the following four distinct phases (ISO,
1997) (see Figure 4.3 and 4.4).

Goal and scope deﬁnition
Deﬁning the Goal of the study
The Goal Deﬁnition component states the reason for performing a speciﬁc study, deﬁnes the
options that will be compared and the intended use of the results. The intended use of the
LCA will inﬂuence the type of study carried out and the type of data required. This stage also
involves identifying the system boundaries (technical, geographical and time) and the procedures
for handling the data. Rules and assumptions must be documented, especially with respect to
allocation rules for co-products and open-loop recycling and aggregation. This is fundamental
to any LCA investigation as LCA is not a precise science. Every stage will involve the need for
choices and value judgements. All of the judgements that need to be taken while carrying out
an LCA should be made in the light of the purpose of the study. A clearly deﬁned goal will 
partly address the need for transparency and will help ensure the end result is ﬁt for use. 
Transparency is essential throughout all stages of the Life Cycle procedure; this allows data
tracking and calculation veriﬁcation to be carried out if necessary. A complete and transparent
record of a study is compiled in a ﬁnal study report.
The Goal of an LCA study shall unambiguously state the intended application, the reasons
for carrying out the study and the intended audience – ISO 14041.

Deﬁning the Scope of the study
The Scope of a study basically outlines the parameters within which the study will be carried
out. These need to be compatible with the Goals of the study. In deﬁning the Scope of an LCA
study, ISO 14040 requires that the following are clearly described: the functions of the product
system(s); the functional unit; the product system to be studied; the product system boundaries;
allocation procedures; the types of indicators and the methodology of Life Cycle Impact Assess-
ment and subsequent Life Cycle Interpretation to be used; data requirements; assumptions;
limitations; the initial data quality requirements; the type of critical review (if any) and the type
and format of the report required for the study. As LCA is an iterative process and therefore as
more is learnt about the system being studied, it is likely that amendments to the scope will have
to be made. 
Product System
Product Systems are subdivided into unit processes.
The Product System is the series of interconnected operations that occur during the Life
Cycle of a product or the delivery of a deﬁned service. The system itself lies within a System
Boundary.
Functional unit
The functional unit is the basis on which the products or services will be compared. The
importance of deﬁning the most appropriate Functional Unit cannot be over-emphasised. 
The functional unit is the cornerstone of an LCA study, providing the reference point to 
which both inputs and outputs are related and allowing clear comparison of LCA results. 
The stages and unit processes connected to the functional unit are known as the Product 
System.
The Scope of an LCA study shall clearly specify the functions of the system being studied. 
A functional unit is a measure of the performance of the functional outputs of the Product
System – ISO 14040.
Each unit process encompasses the activities of a single operation or a group of operations.
Unit processes are linked to one another, by ﬂows of intermediate products and/or waste
for treatment and to other Product Systems by product ﬂows – ISO 14041. 
A Product System is a collection of operations connected by ﬂows of intermediate products,
which perform one or more deﬁned functions. The system should be deﬁned in sufﬁcient
detail and clarity to allow another practitioner to duplicate the Life Cycle Inventory Analysis
– ISO 14041.
The Scope should be sufﬁciently well deﬁned to ensure that the breadth, the depth and the
details of the study are compatible and sufﬁcient to address the stated Goal – ISO 14040.
Structure of a Life Cycle Assessment
91
Concepts and Case Studies

The functional unit is often expressed in terms of amount of product (e.g. per kg or litre), but
should be related to the function served by a product or service, i.e. per equivalent use, for
example, the packaging used to deliver a given volume of milk. As all of the inputs and outputs
are calculated per functional unit, any alteration in the size of the functional unit, e.g. to allow
for higher performance of one of the products compared, will have a major effect on the out-
come of the assessment. It is essential that various performance attributes of each system be
considered and incorporated into the functional unit, otherwise any comparison will not be
made on a fair and equivalent basis.
System Boundaries 
The System Boundaries, i.e. what stages, operations, and inputs and outputs are included
within the assessment, and what is omitted, need to be deﬁned. Again, these boundary deci-
sions on inclusion and omission must be balanced between different systems for any compari-
son to be fair and equivalent. 
The inclusion involves deﬁning exactly where the boundaries or ‘cradle and grave’ of the Life
Cycle lie. Should the mining of the raw materials be included in the ‘cradle’? Similarly should the
‘grave’ include the emissions from used materials after they have been buried in the ground,
i.e. landﬁlled? 
The Scope must also determine how much detail will be included at each stage of the Life
Cycle. Should the unit operations of making the factory and equipment that make the product
also be included? In this instance, previous studies have shown that such ‘second level’ inputs,
when divided among the number of units that the factory produces, are insigniﬁcant, so can be
omitted from most analyses. There is also the question of which inputs and outputs to include in
the inventory, and this is typically determined by the environmental issues that a study wishes to
address. Thus, Life Cycle Inventory and Life Cycle Impact Assessment must be co-ordinated in
the study goal and scope planning.
It should be stressed that a Life Cycle Assessment can be done on any system, whatever the
boundaries deﬁned. There are no right or wrong boundaries to choose, but some are more
appropriate to the deﬁned goal than others. If meaningful comparisons are to be made of prod-
ucts or services, then the same or equivalent boundaries must be used in each system in the
study.
In any Life Cycle Assessment, deﬁning the Functional Unit and the boundaries of the system
being assessed are both important steps. Reporting the Functional Unit and the boundaries
used needs to be clear and detailed with any omissions stated and justiﬁed. This is as important
as giving the actual results.
The System Boundary deﬁnes the unit processes that will be included in the system to be
modelled. Ideally, the Product System should be modelled in such a manner that inputs and
outputs at its boundary are elementary ﬂows – ISO 14041. 
Note: Elementary ﬂow: (1) material or energy entering the system being studied, which
has been drawn from the environment without previous human transformation; (2) material
or energy leaving the system being studied, which is discarded into the environment without
subsequent human transformation.

Chapter 4: Life Cycle Assessment
Concepts and Case Studies

Life Cycle Inventory Analysis (LCI)
This stage consists of accounting for all of the material and energy inputs and outputs over the
whole Life Cycle of the product or service. The operational steps are presented in Figure 4.5.
The procedure entails describing the Life Cycle as a series of steps, and then calculating the
inputs and outputs for each of these steps (see Figure 4.6). This amounts to constructing a
materials and energy balance for each step in the Life Cycle. The analysis of all inputs and out-
puts for each stage in the Life Cycle can then be combined to give the overall Life Cycle Inven-
tory.
The methodology for the inventory stage is now accepted and well-used. The large amount
of data generated makes decision making challenging. There is a need to ﬁnd methods of aggre-
gating data but this is full of dangers (see page 95, paragraph 3 of the section on Sensitivity and
uncertainty analysis). Given the numerous possible choices, it is unlikely that allocation will be
standardised. As with functional unit and boundary decisions, the allocation choices must be
equivalent in their effect on different systems for a fair comparison to be made.
Notwithstanding these limitations, an LCI provides enormous knowledge about and insights
into the operations of a given system, which can provide the basis for applying and integrating
other environmental information and assessment tools into a system comparison. 
A Life Cycle Inventory Analysis is concerned with the data collection and calculation proce-
dures necessary to complete the inventory – ISO 14041.

Data quality requirements
There are two main categories of data used:
1. Speciﬁc data, for production, distribution and waste management.
2. Generic data, for energy production, raw material extraction and transportation.
Data quality requirements should address: time-related, geographical and technology issues;
the precision, completeness and representativeness of the data; the consistency and repro-
ducibility of the methods used throughout the LCA; the sources of the data and their repre-
sentativeness, and the uncertainty of the information.
There is an increasing amount of generic data becoming available on basic and commonly
used processes and products. The Society for the Promotion of Life Cycle Development
(SPOLD) has prepared a directory of these sources of LCI data (SPOLD, 1995). However,
there can often be difﬁculties in understanding the underlying assumptions and areas of applica-
bility of these data. For this reason, SPOLD has developed a common electronic ﬁle format for
LCI data. This provides a format, common to all processes, in which existing LCI data can be
made available and additional data collected. The SPOLD format for LCI data allows different
databases and software to communicate in a common LCI ‘language’. Several database owners
and software producers have already announced that they will use the SPOLD format in their
applications. More information and a copy of the SPOLD ﬁle format are available for down-
loading from the Internet at www.spold.org.
Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis
According to ISO 14043, LCIs should also undergo sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. The
data and results should not be used without understanding their quality and limitations. These
processes also reﬂect the fact that LCI involves data uncertainties and value judgements.

Sensitivity analysis can help to identify whether any of the assumptions made, for example,
about missing data, have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the ﬁnal outcome of the LCI, and if so which
assumptions have the greatest inﬂuence. It can therefore provide information about the robust-
ness of the LCI results, and about where there is the greatest need for more, or more 
precise data to improve the inventory. Ideally sensitivity analysis should be carried out on every
parameter within the LCI study, but in practice this is often limited to a selected number of
parameters. Particularly important parameters for sensitivity analysis are those that are being
omitted either on purpose, because of simpliﬁcation steps, or accidentally because of lack of
data (SETAC, 1997). 
Uncertainty analysis is also essential. Generic emission data may involve a wide range in the
level of emissions from one or more unit operations or these numbers may have changed
since the emissions were measured. This injects a degree of uncertainty into almost every
number within the inventory that must be considered. As the objective is to make compar-
isons, it is essential the decision makers understand when apparent differences are real or
uncertain. One of the systematic methods for performing sensitivity analysis, developed by
Heijungs (1996), uses conﬁdence limits for all input parameters and identiﬁes those parameters
for which the margins of uncertainty have large inﬂuences on the ﬁnal result. Subsequently, the
margins of uncertainty for these parameters can be improved. 
Transparency
As LCA is subjective, the rationale behind all stages of the study should be clear. This will give
context and meaning to the analysis. A transparent approach is essential in helping ‘users’
understand the approach used and any assumptions made. 
Critical review
Guidelines for critical or peer review are included in ISO 14040. An LCI study is likely to 
affect interested parties who have been external to the study, such as consumers, non-govern-
ment organisations, local authorities and industry. The opinions of stakeholders need to be
taken into account and a critical review is where this is possible. A critical review ensures that
the methods used to carry out the LCI are scientiﬁcally and technically valid, and that the data
used is appropriate and reasonable in relation to the goal of the study. There are three possible
forms of critical review.
1. Internal expert review. This type of review should be carried out by an LCI expert within the
same organisation who is independent from the study, but has a good knowledge of the sys-
tem being investigated. Internal expert review should be used when minor changes have
been made to a design or initial comparisons are being made between a variety of options
using generic data, e.g. proprietary LCI software. 
2. External expert review. External expert reviews are again carried out by a proﬁcient 
LCI practitioner, but this time they should be independent from the study and the organisa-
tion carrying out the LCI work. This often means using an LCI practitioner from a relevant 
industry body or an LCI consultant company. Going external with LCI data can sometimes
require the use of conﬁdentiality agreements to protect proprietary information. External
reviews of LCI studies should be carried out if the results of the study are going to be 
used as part of a major decision, i.e. a product launch or a major upgrade or process 
change.

Concepts and Case Studies

3. Review by a panel of interested parties. Some LCI studies involve product, package or
process changes that can have a perceived impact on people or organisations outside of the
company commissioning the LCI study. LCI studies are a good tool for communicating envi-
ronmental burden information in this type of circumstance; because they take the
‘cradle-to-grave’ approach they include the manufacturing facilities and the waste disposal
phase of the products Life Cycle. 
In situations like this, an external review panel with representatives from these interested
parties should be set up. An external, independent expert is selected by the original study
commissioner to act as chairperson of the review panel. Based on the goal, scope and budget
available the chairperson selects other independent, qualiﬁed reviewers. This panel should
include other interested parties affected by the conclusions drawn from the LCI study, such
as government agencies, non-government groups and possibly competitors. The panel will
produce a statement and report on the comments and recommendations made during the
review process. This should be included in the ﬁnal LCI study report.
Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)
The LCIA phase of an LCA study provides a system-wide perspective of environmental and
resource issues for product or service systems. To achieve this, LCIA assigns LCI results to 
speciﬁc, selected impact categories (an impact category is used to group certain LCI results that
are associated with a particular environmental issue). For each impact category, appropriate
indicators are selected and a characterisation model is used to calculate indicator results. The
collection of indicator results – the LCIA proﬁle – provides an environmental context for the
emissions and resource use associated with the product or service system. 
LCIA is composed of several mandatory elements that convert LCI results to indicator
results. There are also optional elements for normalisation, grouping or weighting of the 
indicator results and data quality analysis techniques. The framework presented in Figure 4.7
includes both the mandatory and optional elements of LCIA.
It is now generally accepted that the most meaningful aggregation of LCI results in an impact
category will conform to a scientiﬁcally based environmental mechanism (SETAC, 1992). Thus
all releases that combine together in a chemical mechanism to deplete ozone will be modelled
and aggregated together.
It should be recognised that some impact categories may not be scientiﬁcally based, but may
involve aggregation among independent mechanisms that cannot be scientiﬁcally combined
(Owens, 1998). This information can still be useful in pointing to particular issues for further
evaluation and analysis, but will be less objective than if they were based on an environmental
mechanism. An example is given in Figure 4.9 between a global warming indicator and a toxic-
ity indicator that combines different effects. However, ISO requires that indicators be scientiﬁ-
cally and technically valid for claims or comparative assertions.
The LCIA phase aims to examine the product system from an environmental perspective
using category indicators, derived from the LCI results. The LCIA phase also provides 
information for the interpretation phase – ISO 14042.
96
Chapter 4: Life Cycle Assessment
Concepts and Case Studies

Each indicator should be assessed for environmental relevance as shown in Figure 4.8. Most
current impact category models simply aggregate the emissions released and, as noted, do not
analyse the actual environmental impact. As the time and space of releases are involved in envi-
ronmental impacts, many current indicators lack environmental relevance. However, more
complex and environmentally relevant models and indicators are being developed. ISO 14042
sets out a series of criteria on which users may judge the environmental relevance of different
models and indicators, and requires environmental relevance for making claims or comparative
assertions.
The result of the impact assessment will be the contribution of the Life Cycle to the selected
environmental issues. Figure 4.8 presents a schematic diagram that outlines the procedure for
converting LCI results to category indicator results.

Table 4.2 Examples of issues, categories and indicators 

Classiﬁcation
The classiﬁcation stage requires the identiﬁcation of inventory data relevant to each speciﬁc
impact category and assignment of the appropriate LCI results to each category. Data may
belong to more than one category, e.g. NOx has a global warming and an acidifying effect.
Selection of impact categories
Table 4.2 presents the type of impact categories that are commonly examined. The categories
should be selected based on the goals and scope of the LCA study.
Characterisation
The characterisation or modelling stage requires calculations to be made to evaluate the rela-
tive signiﬁcance of each contributor to the overall impact of the system or operation being stud-
ied, by converting these to a common indicator. For example, in the case of global warming the
most common indicator used is Global Warming Potential (GWP) in CO2 equivalents. Basical-
ly, there are two steps in the calculation. Each greenhouse gas is ﬁrst converted into carbon
dioxide equivalents based on a particular characterisation factor. The individual carbon dioxide
equivalents are then added into a total indicator. 
Normalisation
If this is undertaken, it involves relating the characterised data to a broader data set or situation,
for example, relating SOx emissions to a country’s total SOx emissions. Normalisation can
provide insights but should be treated with caution as results can differ signiﬁcantly if different
data sets are used. Normalisation is often omitted from LCA studies.
Weighting
Weighting is the process of converting indicator results of different impact categories into scores
by using numerical factors based on values. Weighting may include aggregation of the weighted
results into an overall score. This is the most subjective stage of an LCA and is based on value
judgements and is not scientiﬁc. ISO 14042 cautions that different individuals or organisations
may have different preferences or values. Therefore, different parties are likely to reach different
weighting results based on the same indicator results. Figure 4.9 shows a schematic represen-
tation of the decreasing objectivity across an LCA.
Whilst there are signiﬁcantly fewer impact categories than inventory categories, there are still
many environmental issues to be considered. Comparing one Life Cycle option with another
will not normally show which is ‘environmentally superior’ (except in the case where one has
a lower impact in all categories), but will demonstrate the trade-offs between the two options.
For the foreseeable future, decision making on the basis of the impact assessment results
should be done by open public debate as part of the democratic process. Any scheme that
weights or aggregates the impact categories to a single score may appear to make decision
making easier. However, in the process, the assumptions and priorities upon which the decision
will be based are obscured and only the values or opinions of one group are used. Thus, broad
The aim of characterisation is to provide a basis for the aggregation of inventory results into
an indicator for each category. Each impact category requires a speciﬁc model to convert the
inventory results into the indicator – ISO 14042.

acceptance of the outcome of the decision is uncertain. That verdict will only be passed when
the results become evident to those affected.
ISO 14042 states that ‘weighting across impact categories shall not be used for comparative
assertions disclosed to the public’. ISO 14042 also makes it clear that impact assessment is
designed to ‘support better decision making’. Life Cycle Impact Assessment does not replace
the decision-making process.
Life Cycle Interpretation
The interpretation stage of the LCA process is closely linked to the iterative nature of the
processes of scope deﬁnition, inventory analysis and impact assessment. Interpretation involves
a review of all of the stages in the LCA process and a check that all assumptions are consistent.
Data quality should be checked and a sensitivity analysis performed to establish the signiﬁcance
of data uncertainty on the results of the study. This may result in revisiting and revising certain
areas of the study. Links between LCA and any other environmental management tools are
necessary to highlight the strengths and limits of the LCA in relation to its goal and scope deﬁ-
nition phase. This procedure, including transparent reporting, is necessary, as these results can
be used as a basis for conclusions, recommendations and decision making in accordance with
the goal and scope deﬁnition phase.
Life Cycle Interpretation is a systematic technique to identify, qualify, check, and evaluate
information from the results of the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis and/or LCIA of a 
product system, and present them in order to meet the requirements of the application as
described in the goal and scope of the study – ISO 14043.

There are three elements in the Life Cycle Interpretation phase of an LCA (see Figure 4.10). 
1. Identify the signiﬁcant issues based on the LCI and LCIA phases of the LCA.
2. Evaluate the signiﬁcant issues based upon completeness, sensitivity and consistency checks.
3. Draw conclusions, make recommendations and report the signiﬁcant issues.
Identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant issues
The objective of this element is to structure the results from the LCI or LCIA phases in such a
way that it is possible to determine the signiﬁcant issues. This should include any implications of
the particular method used and any assumptions made. Allocation rules, cut-off decisions,
choice of indicators and characterisation methods must all be addressed.
The determination of the signiﬁcant issues of a product system may be simple or complex.
ISO standard 14043 does not provide guidance on why an issue may or may not be relevant
in a study, or why an issue may or may not be signiﬁcant for a product system.
Evaluation
The results of the evaluation should be presented in such a way as to allow the reader a
clear and understandable view of the outcome of the study. To achieve this, a completeness
check (to ensure all relevant information for interpretation is available and complete), a sensitiv-
ity check (to assess the reliability of the results by assessing the uncertainty of the signiﬁcant
issues affecting the conclusion) and a consistency check (to determine whether the assump-
tions, methods and data are consistent with the goal and scope) should be carried out. 
The objectives of the evaluation element are to establish and enhance the conﬁdence in and
the reliability of the result of the study – ISO 14043.

Preliminary conclusions must be checked to ensure that they are consistent with the goal

ommendations should be based on the ﬁnal conclusions of the study and the ﬁnal report shall
present a complete, unbiased and transparent account of the whole study. 
Life Cycle Inventory of solid waste
A Life Cycle Inventory (and assessment) may be used with other environmental information
and assessment tools to improve the environmental performance of a product or service.
Given that the product will be used and disposed of in a ﬁxed disposal system (i.e. relative 
levels of recycling/incineration/landﬁll) it is possible to determine how changes in the product
will alter the various aspects of the environmental performance of the system, e.g. changes in
energy consumption and emissions on a Life Cycle basis. However, it is possible to conduct
‘Life Cycle (Inventory) in reverse’ (White et al., 1993), by keeping the product constant and
changing the disposal conditions to see how this affects the overall environmental impact. 
This is essentially what is involved in a Life Cycle Inventory of solid waste. Assuming that 
the composition of waste produced is ﬁxed, and details of its composition are known, at least
for household waste, it is possible to determine how the use of different options for waste
management affect the environmental performance of waste disposal. This technique will be
used throughout this book, and the general format of an LCI for waste will be explored in the
next chapter.
Drawing conclusions from a study should be done interactively with the other elements in
the Life Cycle interpretation phase – ISO 14043.

Summary
The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) technique described in Chapter 4 is applied to waste manage-
ment. The possible uses for an LCI of different waste management options are discussed. The
functional unit for the comparison is deﬁned, as are the system boundaries. This includes deﬁn-
ing the ‘cradle’ and ‘grave’ for waste. The general structure of waste management systems,
which forms the basis of the LCI model, is mapped out, and the computer model developed
to conduct the LCI is introduced.
Integrated Waste Management and Life Cycle Inventory
The objective of Integrated Waste Management (IWM) is to deal with society’s waste in a way
that is environmentally and economically sustainable and socially acceptable (Chapter 2). To
assess such sustainability, tools that can predict the environmental burdens and likely overall cost
of any system are needed. Life Cycle assessment is an environmental management tool that
allows prediction of the environmental burdens associated with a product or service over the
whole Life Cycle, from ‘cradle to grave’. This technique can be applied to waste management 
to assess environmental sustainability. At the same time, a parallel economic assessment can
determine the economic sustainability of waste management systems – a criterion crucial to
their continued operation.
As described in Chapter 4, a Life Cycle Assessment consists of four stages: Goal and Scope
deﬁnition, Life Cycle Inventory, Life Cycle Impact Assessment and Life Cycle Interpretation
(Table 4.1). Currently the Goal and Scope deﬁnition and Life Cycle Inventory stages (which
together comprise a Life Cycle Inventory study) are routinely carried out in a variety of applica-
tions; Life Cycle Impact Assessment and Life Cycle Interpretation still require value judgements
and therefore present signiﬁcant challenges. This book and the associated computer model are
based on a Life Cycle Inventory of solid waste, although the model also aggregates LCI data for
carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen dioxide based on their Global Warming Potential, using
the weighting proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC, 1996) over
a 100-year time span (see Table 4.2 and Figure 4.9). This chapter addresses the concept and
practicalities of using Life Cycle Assessment to compare waste management systems.
Deﬁnition. The goal of a Life Cycle Inventory for solid waste is to be able to, as accurately
as possible, predict the environmental burdens of an Integrated Waste Management system.

The Life Cycle technique has been used to compare speciﬁc options for waste management
(e.g. Kirkpatrick, 1992; Denison, 1996; Finnveden and Ekvall, 1997) and has now also been
used to assess complete IWM systems (Wilson, 1997, 1998; Thurgood, 1998). In spite of
these and other similar studies it remains necessary for reasons of transparency to ﬁrst address
such basic questions as where is the ‘cradle’ of waste, and where is its ‘grave’?
A Life Cycle Inventory of waste
Goal deﬁnition
Here three major questions are addressed: 
1. What is the purpose of the study? 
2. What will be compared,  i.e. what is the functional unit for comparison? 
3. What are the boundaries of the system (see Table 5.1)?
This last question deﬁnes what will be included in the study and what will be omitted, and spec-
iﬁes the ‘length’ and ‘breadth’ of the study.

Table 5.1 A Life Cycle Inventory of waste: Goal deﬁnition

What are the purposes of the LCI?
1. To predict the environmental performance of an IWM system. Because speciﬁc data for all
parts of the Life Cycle are not available, generic (typically averaged) data will be frequently
used, and the result of the inventory will not be 100% accurate. However, it will provide a
‘ﬁrst cut’ and will provide rough comparisons between different system options.
The objective of predicting environmental performance of waste management systems
can be met in two ways. Detailed LCI studies can be run for several individual waste 
management systems, and general conclusions extrapolated from the results. The alterna-
tive is to construct a generic, ﬂexible tool that can be applied to any waste management 
system to assess the overall environmental performance. Constructing a model that is 
ﬂexible enough to describe all possible waste management scenarios is a very challenging
task, but is the option attempted in this book. A general model such as this will rely on gener-
ic data, so will not give such accurate results as speciﬁc studies, which describe particular
waste management systems. However, the ﬂexibility to apply the same model to a range of
waste management systems, both existing or planned, is considered to be more useful than
a very accurate model of a single waste management system.
2. To demonstrate the interactions that occur within waste management. As it attempts 
to model the whole waste system, a Life Cycle model will show how different parts of the
system are inter-connected and will help improve understanding of the system’s behaviour.
3. To clarify the objectives of the waste management system. It has been argued above that the
objective of waste management is environmental and economic sustainability, i.e. 
minimising the environmental burdens for an acceptable cost. Because it speciﬁcally 
calculates both the cost and individual environmental burdens (i.e. emissions due to energy
consumption, emissions to air, emissions to water, landﬁll requirements, etc.) it focuses
attention on which parameters need to be maximised or minimised. It is important that
potential users understand that the tool of Life Cycle Assessment will not in itself decide this,
but it will provide the data on which these societal/political decisions can be based.
4. To allow for ‘What if... ?’ calculations. The use of a computer model for the LCI allows the
user to compare a number of hypothetical waste management systems, their environmental
burdens and economic costs.
5. To provide data on waste management methods, which can be used in LCI studies of indi-
vidual products and packages.
6. To provide an economic assessment of the IWM system using the same system boundaries
as the LCI, ensuring that the two data sets may be analysed in parallel. 
Deﬁning the functional unit 
The functional unit is the unit of comparison in a Life Cycle Inventory. Historically LCI studies
have been related to products, such as washing machines (DoE/DTI, 1991) or detergents
(Stalmans, 1992), or packages (White et al., 1993; Kuta et al., 1995; Smith and White, 1999).
The functional unit in such cases relates to the product/package made, and the comparisons
are made on the basis of per amount or per equivalent use of the product. The functional 
unit is therefore expressed in terms of the system’s output (see Figure 5.1). Such studies 
are usually run to see how changes to the product will affect their overall environmental 
burdens.
A Life Cycle Inventory of Waste 
105
Concepts and Case Studies

The function of a waste management system, in contrast, is not to produce anything, but 
to deal with the waste of a given area. Therefore, the functional unit in an LCI of waste is 
the waste of the geographical area under study. In this study this functional unit is reﬁned 
further into the household and similar commercial waste of the speciﬁed geographical area.
This is a key difference in approach: in a product LCI the functional unit is deﬁned by the 
output (product) of the system; in an LCI of waste the functional unit is deﬁned in terms of the
system’s input, i.e. the waste.
106
Chapter 5: A Life Cycle Inventory of Solid Waste
Concepts and Case Studies
Figure 5.1 Key differences between LCI studies for products and an LCI
study of waste.
1. Functional unit
In a product LCI the functional unit is deﬁned in terms of the system’s output, i.e. the prod-
uct, for example, per kg of product made, or per number of laundry loads washed.
In the LCI of waste the functional unit is deﬁned in terms of the system’s input, i.e. the
waste.The functional unit would be the management of the waste of one household or the
total waste of a deﬁned geographical region in a given time (e.g. 1 year).
2. Boundaries – deﬁnition of cradle and grave
Product LCI studies consider the whole Life Cycle of one particular product, from raw
material extraction, through manufacture, distribution and use, to ﬁnal disposal. The last
part of the Life Cycle will be spent as waste in a waste management system (Figure 5.2).
This book considers the Life Cycle of waste, from the moment it becomes waste by losing
value, to the moment it regains value or leaves the waste management system as an
emission.
A Product LCI considers the whole Life Cycle of a single product; an LCI of waste
includes part of the Life Cycles of all products.
Using ‘What if ... ?’ scenarios
Product LCIs are normally used to determine the environmental effect of changes to the
product. This LCI of waste can be used to determine the environmental effect of changes
to the waste management system.
PRODUCT
SOLID WASTE

Using this LCI method, different systems for dealing with the solid waste of a given area can
be compared. The geographical area under study, and the waste produced by this area are
deﬁned by the user, and the LCI model will calculate the environmental burdens and overall
cost of different options chosen for dealing with this waste. The waste input from any given
area will be constant, and the LCI can be used to assess the overall performance, both envi-
ronmental and economic, of different waste management systems.
The environmental burdens and costs for the whole system can be broken down further,
however. For economic costs, it is useful to have the cost attributed per household, since rev-
enue is usually collected in this way for domestic solid waste. Alternatively, costs can be attrib-
uted per tonne of waste collected, which is especially relevant to commercial/industrial waste
where charges are levied in this way. As well as overall system costs and environmental bur-
dens, costs and environmental burdens per tonne and per household will also be calculated,
but neither alone is satisfactory.
A ﬁgure that is often quoted in reports of recycling schemes is the cost per tonne of recov-
ered or recycled material (usually high!). This will not be used as the functional unit in this
assessment, since it is not the function of an Integrated Waste Management scheme to produce
recycled material. The objective is to deal with waste in an environmentally and economically
sustainable way; recovering and recycling materials is a means to this end but not the end in
itself.
System boundaries
Where is the cradle of waste and where is the grave?
All Life Cycles run from cradle to grave. When considering the Life Cycle of products, invento-
ries usually go back to the source of the raw materials, by mining for example, to deﬁne the
product’s ‘cradle’. The ‘grave’ is the ﬁnal disposal of the product, often back into the earth as
landﬁll. Whilst it shares the same grave as individual products, the Life Cycle of ‘waste’ does not
share the same cradle (see Figure 5.2). Waste only becomes waste at the point at which it is
thrown away, i.e. ceases to have any value to the owner. Thus the ‘cradle’ of waste, in house-
holds at least, is usually the dustbin. This is another key difference between an LCI for a prod-
uct and an LCI for waste. Every product spends part of its Life Cycle as waste, or conversely a
Life Cycle study of waste includes part (but only part) of the Life Cycle of every product or
package.
Clearly there are overlaps between the two approaches, since the LCI for a product
includes the time the particular product spends in the waste management system, and the LCI
for waste includes the waste management stages of all products and packages. However, there
are fundamental differences, since the two applications have different functional units and
therefore different uses (and potential users). A product LCI can be used to optimise a speciﬁc
product Life Cycle, normally within a given infrastructure system (energy generation system,
transport system, solid waste management system, etc.). A solid waste LCI, in contrast, aims to
optimise the infrastructure system for managing a given amount and composition of waste.
Hence product LCIs are of use to those who can control product design and manufacture; solid
waste LCIs are of use to those who plan or manage solid waste management systems. They rep-
resent two different tools for two different user groups. It is important that this distinction is appre-
ciated, since different questions relating to product and waste management will require the choice
of the appropriate tool. For example, a solid waste LCI (the horizontal approach in Figure 5.2)
A Life Cycle Inventory of Waste 
107
Concepts and Case Studies

attempts to assess the environmental burdens of the waste, once produced. Since it takes the
solid waste as a given (the zero burden approach; see deﬁnition below), this method cannot be
used to assess how waste prevention can best be achieved, since this occurs prior to the cre-
ation of waste.

Figure 5.2 The Life Cycle of a product (a), the Life Cycle of waste (b), and a
practical approach to environmental optimisation (c). The LCI for solid waste
considers part of the Life Cycle of all products and packages. Designers and
manufacturers optimise performance of products and packages (vertical
analysis), whilst waste managers, municipalities and policy makers optimise
Integrated Waste Management systems (horizontal analysis).

LCI can look at the consequences on a waste management system of changes in waste compo-
sition, which may arise through waste prevention measures, but cannot identify how and where
waste prevention should occur. Since each product system will be different, the opportunities for
waste prevention must be identiﬁed on a product by product basis, through the use of product
LCIs (the vertical approach). Therefore, comparisons of product systems, such as reusable versus
one-way packaging systems, need to be done using a product LCI, on a product by product basis.
In contrast, comparisons between treating a given waste by recycling, composting, incineration or
landﬁlling, and how to achieve the optimal combination of such options in an IWM system, can be
achieved using a solid waste LCI (horizontal approach).
The cradle
Household and similar commercial waste can be either collected or delivered (e.g. to bottle
banks) in a variety of ways, so for a practical boundary, the ‘cradle’ of such waste in this study is
taken as the point at which it leaves the household or commercial property. 
Prior to this stage, individual items in the waste stream will be affected by source reduction,
waste minimisation and other processes for environmental improvement. Whilst these are
valuable contributions, they occur during product manufacture, distribution or use and are thus
upstream of waste management. As a result they will not be included here. Other waste treat-
ment methods can also be used to reduce the amount of solid waste within households, prior
to collection. Home composting of organic material is a good example of this. Such treatment
methods will similarly not be considered within the boundaries of this LCI, since they occur 
on-site, and prior to the materials leaving the household.
The grave
The ‘grave’ of the waste Life Cycle is its ﬁnal disposal back into the environment. Incineration
and landﬁlling are often described as ‘ﬁnal disposal’ options, but neither represents the true end
of the Life Cycle for the materials involved. Incineration produces ash, for example, which then
needs disposal, often by landﬁlling. Similarly, landﬁlls are not the ﬁnal resting place for some of
the materials contained, since they can in turn release gas emissions and leachate. It has been
suggested that landﬁlls should not be considered as environmental burdens that should be
measured, but as waste management processes, which in turn produce gas and water emis-
sions with measurable burdens (Finnveden, 1992, 1995). 
The ‘grave’ or end of the waste Life Cycle used here, is considered to be when the waste
becomes inert landﬁll material, or is converted into air or water emissions. Alternatively, the
waste can regain some value (as compost, secondary material or fuel) and thus ceases to be
waste. ‘Value’ normally implies positive economic value. 
Deﬁnition: The zero burden approach takes the waste to be managed by the system as a given. No
credit or burden is allocated to the caloriﬁc value or chemical composition of the waste entering the sys-
tem. None of the burdens associated with the previous use of the products or materials, prior to them
becoming waste, are included either.
A strict thermodynamic mass and energy balance approach would require all inputs and outputs to the
system to be equal. However, this is not useful for waste management purposes. What are required are
the net energy and emissions burdens associated with managing the waste in question.
For example, the caloriﬁc content of plastic waste is considered as neither a credit nor a debit to the system,
although incineration of plastic will result in the production of energy, which will be considered as a net output.
Similarly the carbon content of waste paper is taken as a given, but burdens associated with incineration, land-
ﬁlling or recycling paper plus possible avoided burdens of displacing virgin paper are included in the output.
A Life Cycle Inventory of Waste 
109
Concepts and Case Studies

Deﬁning the exact point at which waste acquires value and ceases to be waste has important
practical consequences, as well as being essential in this analysis. Different regulations generally
apply to handling and transporting raw materials rather than waste, and different emission 
levels are allowed when burning fuels rather than burning waste. Thus a clear deﬁnition of
exactly when waste becomes a secondary raw material or a fuel is essential.
One area where difﬁculties arise is the recovery of materials for recycling. Once materials are
collected and sorted, they regain value as a secondary raw material. This value equates to posi-
tive economic value in many cases, when sorted materials are sold from materials collection
banks or from Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs). Consequently, this point has been chosen as
the boundary of the waste management system for such materials. In some schemes, however,
where collected material supply greatly exceeds recycling capacity, the collected material may
still have a negative economic value at this point. Such material would not then regain value until
after it had been converted into recycled resin pellets. For example, choice of this point as the
boundary would mean including the whole recycling industry within the waste management sys-
tem. Since many recycling processes, e.g. for steel, aluminium, paper, etc., are integrated within
the virgin material industries, this would necessitate taking most of industry into the waste man-
agement system, which would make system modelling unwieldy, if not impossible. 
Since all industries are interrelated, deﬁning hard and fast boundaries is not easy, but some
boundaries must be chosen. For this study, recovered materials are considered to leave the
waste management system when they leave the MRF or are collected from materials banks.
They then enter the plastics/paper/metal/glass industry system. These reclaimed materials will
eventually replace other virgin materials in the manufacture of new products. In many cases this
will lead to environmental improvements via energy savings, and reduced raw material con-
sumption. These potential savings (or costs) are not included within the boundaries of this LCI
study, but are addressed and calculated in Chapter 14, Materials Recycling (and in the model)
so that their signiﬁcance can be assessed. 
The general system boundaries for an Integrated Waste Management system are shown
schematically in Figure 5.3. Along with the waste itself, there are energy and other raw material
inputs (e.g. petrol, diesel) to the system. The outputs from the system are useful products in

the form of reclaimed materials and compost, emissions to air and to water and inert landﬁll
material. Energy will also be produced in Energy from Waste options (which also includes use
of recovered landﬁll gas); combining this with the energy inputs to the system gives a net value
for energy consumption/generation. The exact boundaries at which materials and energy enter
or leave the waste management system studied here are deﬁned in Table 5.2.
For the energy inputs into the systems as fuels (e.g. petrol, diesel, gas or as electricity), in 
addition to the actual energy content delivered, energy will have been expended in drilling,
mining, and during production. These processes would also have generated emissions to air
and water, and solid waste. Consequently these environmental burdens associated with ener-
gy production will also be included whenever energy is consumed within this Life Cycle 
Inventory. Effectively, the energy production industries are included within the system bound-
aries of this LCI study (although they are not depicted in Figures 5.5–5.7).
It is assumed that any energy recovered by the waste management system is 
converted into electrical power. Subtracting the amount of electrical energy produced from
that consumed gives the net amount of electrical energy consumed by the waste management
system.

Table 5.2 Boundary deﬁnitions for the LCI of waste

The system boundaries for the parallel economic assessment are shown in Figure 5.4. Eco-
nomic inputs to a waste management system include costs for collection, sorting, various forms
of treatment, transport and for ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll. Revenues produced by the system
come from sale of reclaimed materials, compost and energy. Subtracting the revenues from the
costs will give the net cost of operating the system.
As discussed above, reclaimed materials will displace virgin materials, so if the reclaimed
materials are produced for less than virgin materials, further economic savings occur. As with
the corresponding environmental savings, these cost savings are not included within the
boundaries of the basic LCI system deﬁned in Figure 5.4, but they are calculated in Chapter 14
so that their signiﬁcance can be assessed.
What level of detail? 
What level of detail should be included in the study? Should the burdens of manufacturing the
trucks that carry the waste be included in the overall assessment? What about the burdens of
constructing incinerators?
In most Life Cycle Inventories to date, such ‘second level’ burdens are considered to be
insigniﬁcant, when spread over the Life Cycle of the equipment or facility, and so are normally
omitted. This practice will be followed in this study for the environmental burdens of waste
management. Second level burdens have been estimated to be up to 10% of the total envi-
ronmental burden of waste management (Chem Systems, 1997; Schwing, 1999), although, in
future studies these second level burdens are likely to become more signiﬁcant as emission
standards become more stringent. As standards are raised, facilities require more or new infra-
structure to house more sophisticated equipment. Second level burdens are generally of
increasing interest with respect to LCA/LCI studies and the amount of research in this area is
increasing (see, for example, Frischknecht et al., 1995, 1996).
The approach described above cannot be justiﬁed, however, when considering the 
economic costs of waste management. The capital cost of installing plant and vehicles is clearly
signiﬁcant in comparison to running costs, since it must be ﬁnanced and overheads must be

ment will be addressed, including purchase of capital equipment, depreciated over a suitable
time span. These full and inclusive costs must be entered into the model under the heading of
‘Processing costs/tonne’.
The Inventory stage
The Inventory stage looks at all of the inputs and outputs in the Life Cycle of waste. The ﬁrst
step, however, is to deﬁne the Life Cycle. Since the objective of the LCI is to be able to
describe the majority of waste management systems, existing or planned, all possible processes
and technically feasible combinations of processes need to be possible. The main stages, and
their interconnections in the Life Cycle of solid waste are shown schematically in Figure 5.5,

all materials and energy entering and leaving each process. By linking up all processes within
each stage and then all stages in the Life Cycle, it is possible to deﬁne the overall waste man-
agement system. This is shown in Figure 5.7 and Table 5.3, which also deﬁnes the boundaries

Figure 5.7 System boundaries and inputs/outputs for the Life Cycle 
Inventory of solid waste.

A Life Cycle Inventory for solid waste management consists of two main steps. Firstly, the
waste management system to be considered must be described. This involves choosing between
the different possible waste treatment options. A large amount of variable data are needed to
show how the waste is treated in any given system, and what route materials take through the
system, e.g. how much of the household waste is separated at the kerbside, how many fractions
it is sorted into, whether organic material is composted separately or left with the residue, what
proportion is incinerated as opposed to directly landﬁlled and so on. Answers to these questions
must be chosen by the user, and can be altered to carry out ‘What if ... ?’ calculations. 
Secondly, the inputs and outputs of the chosen processes must be calculated, using ﬁxed data
for each process. Such ﬁxed data are dependent on the performance of the equipment and tech-
nologies involved and are expressed relative to the amount of material treated. For example, the
energy generation and emissions per tonne of waste incinerated in an Energy from Waste facility. 
Fixed data are generally lacking for most routine manufacturing processes, let alone for waste
management. The lack of quality data is a serious problem in any LCI of waste, and was probably
one of the main reasons why this approach has take such a long time to be both accepted and
now developed. Suitable data sources are now becoming available, have been identiﬁed, and will
be used in this book.

Table 5.3 Life Cycle Inventory of waste: Inventory stage

There is one area in which current ﬁxed data sources are generally still scarce, however: the
allocation of burdens to the different fractions of the waste stream. Data are available for most
waste management treatment processes, such as composting or incineration, in terms of inputs
and outputs per tonne of waste treated, but solid waste varies not only in quantity, but also in
composition.
In an Integrated Waste Management system, different materials within the waste stream are
separated and treated in different ways. Thus the residual waste that enters a mixed waste
treatment method, e.g. incinerator or landﬁll, will vary in composition depending on what has
been removed for other treatment methods. Without data allocating the inputs and outputs to
the particular fractions of waste, it is not possible to reliably predict the inputs and outputs of
any mixed waste treatment methods. Where process inputs and outputs can be allocated to
individual materials in this LCI this will be applied, otherwise average data for mixed waste
streams will be used.
The important distinction between generic and speciﬁc data should also be borne in mind.
Generic data are generally averages, and although useful for giving an approximate measure of
the environmental burdens associated with a system, can never be more speciﬁc than that. To
assess the actual burdens of a given system requires measurement of all the processes in 
that actual system. Clearly this is costly both in terms of money and time; Life Cycle Inventories
collecting and using speciﬁc data have taken several years to complete. Most of the data used in
this LCA model for waste will be generic data, as this is often the best available. In the model,
the user can overwrite any of the generic data provided with updated or system-speciﬁc data
as it becomes available. 
Results of the Life Cycle Inventory model: system inputs and outputs
Net energy consumption
All energy inputs to the system and the energy produced during certain treatment processes
must be considered. The inherent energy of the waste is not included since it is common to all
possible options for dealing with the same amount of waste. The energy delivered by fuels and 
electricity is included, plus the indirect energy consumption during fuel and electricity 
production (also known as Primary Energy).
Air and water emissions 
Since there are a large number of different emissions from many single processes, let alone
complete waste management systems, it is necessary to deﬁne which emissions will be 
considered. Not surprisingly, previous studies have varied in the parameters that they have 
considered. The list of emissions to air and water considered most important by the authors,
and thus included in this LCI study, are given in Table 5.4. This list of emissions is used for each
of the processes included within the waste system boundaries, but since a range of data
sources is used, not all data sets contain all the required information, nor use the same param-
eters. Therefore it has sometimes been necessary to convert data from other sources into the
parameters required.

117
Concepts and Case Studies

Landﬁll volume 
Since landﬁlls ﬁll up rather than get too heavy, volume rather than weight is the key measure.
This volume needs to reﬂect the level of compaction that occurs naturally in the landﬁll. 
Recovered materials and compost
Recovered materials and compost are products, and therefore outputs of the system. It is
important to predict the types and amounts of materials that are likely to be produced by any
system, as both reprocessing capacity and markets will be needed.
Other statistics
Although descriptors of the system rather than inputs or outputs, it is useful to use the data
from the model to generate certain statistics since Government targets are usually set in these
terms:

Table 5.4 Emission categories used in the LCI of solid waste

• Material recovery rate. The percentage of the waste stream recovered as usable 
secondary materials.
• Overall material recovery rate. This would include both ‘dry recyclables’ and 
compost.
• Landﬁll diversion rate. The percentage of the waste stream that is diverted away from
final disposal in a landﬁll. This is not the same as the material recycling rate, as diverted material
may be released as emissions, e.g. during compost production.
Fuel and electricity consumption in the Life Cycle of solid waste
Wherever fuels or electricity are used within the waste management system, there will be
environmental burdens not only due to their actual use, but also due to the mining, drilling
transport and production of the fuels and electricity. By using generic data throughout the Life
Cycle Inventory, every time that fuel or electricity are consumed, the relevant consumption of
thermal energy (including ‘pre-combustion’ energy consumption), emissions to air and water
and production of solid waste are added to the overall Inventory totals. 
Electricity consumption 
The overall thermal energy consumption, emissions and solid waste generated by electricity
production will vary according to the method used, and its efﬁciency. Ideally, the energy mix for
the electricity grid of the country under study should be used to give the most accurate results
(see Table 5.5). Although the model provides data on country-speciﬁc mixtures of electricity
generation grids (Table 5.5) and their efﬁciencies, the initial default values (which can be
changed by the user) are based on the UCPTE (Union for the Connection, Production and
Transport of Electricity) 1994 model. 
Clearly, the environmental burdens of generating 1 kWh of electricity from fossil fuels will dif-
fer markedly from hydro-electric generation of the same amount. The burdens associated with
consuming 1 kWh of electricity from different fuel sources are presented in Table 5.6.

Fuel and Electricity Consumption in the Life Cycle of Solid Waste 
119
Concepts and Case Studies

The amount of electrical power generated by Energy from Waste methods within the waste
management system is subtracted from the electrical energy used, to give the overall net elec-
trical energy consumption. This amount is then used to calculate the thermal energy consump-
tion, emissions and solid waste that are due to electricity generation, using a displaced energy
grid, the default setting of which also uses the UCPTE (1994) data, unless this has been
changed by the user. If the amount of electrical energy recovered from waste should exceed
the amount consumed by the system, there will be a net export of electrical energy from the
waste management system, and a net saving of the emissions and solid waste that would have
been associated with the production of this amount of electricity using the conventional gener-
ation methods.

The delivered energy contents of petrol and diesel are 34.35 and 38.14 MJ/litre, respectively
(BUWAL, 1998). Additional energy has been expended, however, to drill, transport and
process the crude oil to produce these fuels. Similarly, air and water emissions and solid waste
will have been generated. For example, the energy efﬁciency of the diesel production industry
in Europe is estimated as 76% (BUWAL, 1998). Thus to supply 1 MJ of energy as diesel
requires a gross energy input of 1.32 MJ. Such ‘pre-combustion’ burdens of petrol and diesel
production are included in the data presented in Table 5.7 (litres are used as the unit since this
is how fuel consumption is totalled over the Life Cycle). The use of petrol and diesel will gen-
erate further emissions to air. The actual amounts generated, per litre of fuel used, will vary
according the vehicle or machine involved. Since most of the petrol and diesel consumption in
the waste management system will be by private cars and heavy goods vehicles, respectively,
data for these vehicles are used as the basis for calculating the emissions per litre as fuel used.
(Note: by calculating emissions in this way, the fuel consumption of different vehicle types will
be accounted for, since this approach determines the total amount of fuel consumed.) Air emission
data for fuel usage are included in Table 5.7 so the data represents the total burdens due to fuel
production and use. 
Natural gas consumption
Data for production and use of natural gas are also presented in Table 5.7. Although the 
energy content of natural gas will vary along with its composition, the data are presented per
cubic metre. 
The economic assessment
The parallel economic assessment of the overall costs of the waste management system also
requires both variable and ﬁxed data. The variable data will be the same as for the environ-
mental LCI, but details for the cost of each process in the Life Cycle are required. These also
need to be entered by the user, since generic data on costs are of little use. Costs for waste
management processes are extremely variable, both between and even within countries, and
reﬂect availability of local facilities, salaries and land prices (see Chapter 4). In the following
chapters examples of average costs for a range of countries are given, but local cost estimates
are needed for any reliability in the result. For consistency, all costs in this book will be quoted
in euros and US dollars, using the exchange rates current at the time of writing (September
1999). These conversion rates are given at the end of the book in Appendix 1.
The methods used for costing waste management processes vary. Collection costs for
domestic waste depend on the number of households visited, and so are often calculated per
household per year (IGD, 1992). Collection costs for commercial and industrial waste, and
processing costs for waste treatment and disposal relate to the amount of waste handled, so
are calculated per tonne. As the aim of this model is to compare the costs of the complete
waste management system, the cost will be calculated as the overall cost per year. For comparison
with other literature, this can be broken down into cost per household per year and cost per
tonne of throughput per year.

The main differences between IWM-1 and IWM-2 Life Cycle Inventory
models
The ﬁrst version of the Life Cycle Inventory model for Integrated Waste Management – IWM-1
– was published in 1995. Since then the model has been used by waste managers and plan-
ners, consultants, academics and students. IWM-2 was developed to improve certain aspects
of the original model and to include more recent global (rather than solely European) data.
Many of the improvements to the new model were based on feedback from actual users. Such
dialogue is very valuable during the planning stages of any development programme. Table 5.8
summarises the main differences between IWM-1 and IWM-2.

US Environmental Protection Agency Life Cycle model for waste
management
The US Environmental Protection Agency is currently working to apply recent Life Cycle Assess-
ment methods to develop tools for evaluating Integrated Waste Management. The research
began in August 1994 and is expected to be completed in 2001. The outputs from this research
will include (1) a database of Life Cycle Inventory data on the various solid waste components (i.e.
glass, metals, plastic, and paper) and the different waste management activities (i.e. transportation,
recycling/composting, landﬁlling, and combustion); (2) a decision support tool for applying Life
Cycle Assessment tools on a site-speciﬁc basis to evaluate different Integrated Waste Manage-
ment strategies; and (3) case studies of several state and local governments applying the decision
support tool. The stakeholders group for the research includes state and local governments, trade
associations, industry, academia, and environmental interest groups. This research will develop
data and information for a variety of technologies and multimedia pollutant data.
The goal of the project is to develop information and tools that enable users to evaluate the
cost and environmental trade-offs associated with different integrated solid waste management
strategies. These are intended for use in determining the baseline conditions for a particular
solid waste management system strategy or operation.
The decision support tool being developed through this research integrates default data
from the database, system materials ﬂow equations, LCI and cost methodologies, and an 
optimisation routine in a user-friendly interface. This tool is being designed to allow MSW 
planners to enter their site-speciﬁc data (or rely on the default data) to compare alternative
MSW management strategies for their community’s waste quantity and composition and other
constraints. The ﬁnal beta version of the tool was completed in December 1999. To test the
LCI and cost methodologies and the overall decision support tool, a number of community
case studies are being carried out. At the time of writing, initial case studies are underway with
communities in Ohio and Iowa and these are designed to test the methodologies developed
for individual operations. Future case studies will test the prototype decision support tool. 
The ultimate products of this research will include a database and decision support tool 
that will enable users to perform an LCI and cost analyses based on locality-speciﬁc data 
on MSW generation and management. The decision support tool will be supported by the
database, which will contain data on LCI parameters for individual solid waste management unit
operations.
The UK Environment Agency model
The UK Environment Agency has been undertaking a long-term research programme the aim
of which is not only to provide a basis for making more sound and more sustainable decisions
in waste management, but also to put the ability to do this in the hands of waste managers. To
do this they have set out to produce a software package that can be used to aid decision makers
in both the waste management industry and the regulatory and local authorities. Although the
ability to trace data is important in LCA, it is doubly so when it is used to aid decisions in waste

Concepts and Case Studies

management, where conﬁdence needs to be built in both the method and the results. What
the Environment Agency has tried to do is to develop a basis for making strategic decisions on
the way in which particular wastes should be dealt with, in order to develop a truly sustainable
strategy for the management of waste. To achieve this, the Environment Agency has developed
software (WISARD), which can be used by waste managers, in the widest sense of the word,
to examine different strategies for dealing with municipal waste, produce a realistic comparison
of different options and assess the results in terms of their overall costs and beneﬁts.
The Agency envisage the tool being used at three levels: 
1. For strategic waste planning to develop overall strategies for waste at the regional and 
county level.
2. To improve waste management systems by waste collection authorities, for example, 
examining where the main burdens from particular systems arise and looking at what
improvements they might achieve.
3. At the facility level by the manager of say, a landﬁll site, to examine where changes would
impact most signiﬁcantly on the environment. 
Ultimately, the quality of the decisions made will depend on the relevance and quality of the
data used. Obtaining the amount of detailed data required to use Life Cycle Assessment has
been no easy task. However, before WISARD is used to make real decisions, the Agency must
ensure the data are sufﬁciently sound and identify any further gaps that need to be ﬁlled. To this
end, the Agency will work closely with a number of local authorities in the UK using WISARD
to ensure the results help provide environmentally sound solutions to real problems.
CSR/EPIC model
Two Canadian industry associations, CSR: Corporations Supporting Recycling (CSR) and the
Environment and Plastics Industry Council (EPIC), whose mandates are to assist municipalities
to develop Sustainable Waste Management systems, commissioned the development of a
model that could be used by municipal waste managers to quantify the Life Cycle environmen-
tal effects of waste management processes. The project is being carried out under the direction
of a steering committee of industry, municipal government and federal government represen-
tatives. The City of London in Ontario was a co-participant in the development of the model.
The City was used as the ‘test case’ for the model’s initial development and as the ﬁrst case
study for the model. The objective of the project is to provide Canadian municipalities with a
tool that will provide municipalities with information on the environmental performance of the
various elements of their existing or proposed waste management systems. It is envisaged that
this information will, in conjunction with economic, social and political considerations, provide
input into decisions on the selection of system elements for Integrated Waste Management 
systems.
The relationship between a Life Cycle Inventory for waste and
product or packaging Life Cycle Inventories
This chapter has emphasised the clear difference between the Life Cycle of a product (or pack-
age) and the Life Cycle of solid waste (see Figure 5.2). Similarly, LCI studies of solid waste sys-
tems and LCIs of products or packages fulﬁl different functions. An LCI of solid waste aims to
126
Chapter 5: A Life Cycle Inventory of Solid Waste
Concepts and Case Studies

optimise the waste treatment system for a given input of waste. This will be of use to waste
managers, whether in national or local governments or in private waste management compa-
nies. It will not, however, predict whether one form of a product or package is better or worse
for the environment than another. A product or package only spends a part of its Life Cycle in
the waste management system, and its compatibility with waste management processes may
be offset by environmental burdens in raw material sourcing, manufacture, distribution or use.
Any comparison should be on a cradle-to-grave basis for the product or package Life Cycle, i.e.
a product-speciﬁc LCI. Similarly, this model is not designed to answer questions such as
whether one-way packaging or returnable packaging is preferable from an environmental point
of view. An example often used is the comparison between returnable bottles and single-use
cartons for milk packaging. This comparison needs to look at the packaging LCIs for the two
options, including the initial manufacture of the bottles and cartons, use, and subsequent reﬁll-
ing, recycling or disposal processes as appropriate.
Product LCIs and Waste LCIs are complementary – the waste LCI can be used to optimise
the overall waste management system for all waste materials; product-speciﬁc LCIs can 
optimise the individual items that end up within the waste stream. Although there is an area of
overlap in the processes, the two different objectives are distinct.

Summary
The following chapter demonstrates some of the practical applications of LCI for waste man-
agement systems. Each case study shows how the results of the LCI can provide data that can
be used as part of the decision-making process, either for future improvements to the system
or for validation of previous changes to the system. The range of different applications of the
LCI model shows the suitability of the Life Cycle approach to the analysis of waste manage-
ment systems and the geographical spread of the case studies indicates that the approach is
now being accepted on a more global basis.
Introduction
The following case studies provide details of some of the possible applications of LCI to the
ﬁeld of waste management. A summary of the case studies is presented in Table 6.1. In each
case, the results of the LCI modelling procedure did not provide a deﬁnitive answer. System A
is rarely better than system B for all parameters, but the procedure provides data upon which
decisions can be made. In certain cases (for example, the retrospective LCI from Canada) the
procedure can provide data that supports decisions made in the past.
Caracas, Venezuela – LCI scenarios for the recovery of recyclable
material
A preliminary exercise to investigate the beneﬁts of adopting an integrated approach to waste
management in Caracas was carried out by the Asociación para la Defensa del Ambiente y la
Naturaleza (ADAN), a Venezuelan non-governmental organisation charged with promoting
Integrated Waste Management and the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración
(IESA), a Venezuelan graduate business school. It was decided that LCI was an appropriate tool
for evaluating the environmental and economic advantages and disadvantages associated with
waste management.
LCI tool 
The LCI tool used to model the current waste management system in Caracas and the addi-
tion of a possible materials recycling scenario was IWM-1 developed by White et al. (1995).

Table 6.1 LCI case study summary

Baseline scenario 
The baseline scenario was as follows:
• four people per home (the average for Caracas)
• collection three times a week from every home
• 100 km total distance for waste transfer to landﬁll (with liner, no gas collection)
• transport and landﬁlling costs of $5 per tonne
• no recovery of recyclable material
• no recovery or treatment of landﬁll leachate or gas. 
Recycling scenario 
The scenario compared against the baseline scenario was the same as above, but included the
recovery and sale of recyclable materials by scavengers on the streets and at the landﬁlls:
• glass: 35% of all glass in the waste stream at 0.07 $/kg
• aluminium: 80% of all aluminium in the waste stream at 0.70 $/kg
• paper: 13% of all paper in the waste stream at 0.07 $/kg
• plastic ﬁlm: 5% of all the plastic ﬁlm in the waste stream at 0.07 $/kg.
Comparison
The IWM-1 model was used to assess the environmental and economic burdens of including
materials recycling as part of a new waste management strategy for the city. Using the energetic
values for Europe that were contained in the software, but using the composition of domestic
solid waste as was measured for Caracas, two scenarios were developed. The results are sum-
marised in Table 6.2.

Conclusions
The results presented in Table 6.2 show that there would be signiﬁcant ﬁnancial savings and con-
siderable environmental advantages associated with the formal establishment of a multi-materi-
als recycling programme in Caracus. The environmental beneﬁts include an 8% reduction in the
amount of material requiring ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll, reductions in the emission to air of methane
and a saving in the emission to air of carbon monoxide and a saving in the emissions to water of
both Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD).
The results of this preliminary study allowed ADAN and IESA to conclude that ‘Life Cycle
Inventory represents a valuable tool for environmental management. The tool allows optimisa-
tion in the use of natural resources and energy, and the minimisation of waste generation, dis-
charges and emissions from processes, products or services. It does clarify the factors to be
weighted in the evaluation of the environmental performance of a product, process or service.
LCI should be used jointly with other environmental management tools, such as risk analysis,
cost-beneﬁt analysis, and toxicity tests. This will provide the means to make decisions relating
to waste management that reduce the environmental burden most relevant to that region,
while including both economic and sustainability considerations’ (Cardinale, 1998).
From this statement it is clear that ADAN and IESA, while recognising the potential beneﬁts
of the application of LCI to waste management, also recognise the limitations of the tool and
the possibility that misuse could lead to an erosion of credibility in the tool itself.

Pamplona, Spain – LCI scenarios for separate collection of organic
material
The Mancomunidad de la Comarca de Pamplona (Association of Municipalities of the Pamplona
District) is committed to the efﬁcient management of Municipal Solid Waste, to involve the local
population, to promote state-of-the-art management techniques and to protect the environ-
ment. A multi-materials recycling scheme has been set up in Pamplona in order to address
these issues. With the possibility of organic material being banned from landﬁll by the impend-
ing EU Landﬁll Directive and the fact that the people of Pamplona want to divert more materi-
al from ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll, the Mancomunidad evaluated the possible advantages of
selective collection and composting of the organic fraction of the waste stream.
LCI tool
The LCI tool used to model the different scenarios possible when adding the selective collec-
tion of organic material for composting to the waste management infrastructure that existed in
Pamplona was IWM-1 by White et al. (1995).
Baseline scenario
The baseline scenario was the existing waste management strategy operating in Pamplona and
this was used as the reference against which all new scenarios were measured. In Pamplona a

close to home bring system operates for recyclables (paper, plastic, metal and glass) and for
restwaste. The recyclable material is sent to a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF). The residue
from the MRF and the restwaste are sent to landﬁll with gas collection and energy recovery. 
Pamplona scenarios
The scenarios modelled for Pamplona are presented in Figure 6.1 and were selected to allow
the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of adding the following treatment options to
the existing waste management infrastructure: 
• composting of the organic fraction 
• composting plus an extra kerbside collection round 
• composting of the organic and paper fractions 
• composting of the organic and paper fractions plus an extra kerbside collection round.
In addition to the scenarios described above a worst case scenario was also considered. All
waste arisings being sent to landﬁll without any treatment is the worst case waste management
scenario for most developed countries. This scenario is often modelled in order to provide
perspective, with respect to the environmental burdens associated with waste management
and also to ensure that none of the subsequently run scenarios have signiﬁcantly worse bur-
dens. Modelling this scenario is also often a useful ﬁrst step in the data-gathering process.
Results
Increased recycling results in more of the municipal waste stream being diverted from landﬁll
than the existing waste management system in Pamplona. Even more material is diverted by a
combination of recycling and composting. Obviously, the more material that is recycled and
composted, the less waste remains for ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll. This is demonstrated in Figure
6.1, with the worst case scenario representing all waste arisings in Pamplona being disposed of
to landﬁll.
A comparison of the net energy use of each of the six scenarios revealed that if the beneﬁts
of recycling are not included in the model, then the collection of landﬁll gas from the anaerobic
breakdown of organic material, and the subsequent generation of electricity plays a major role
in the energy balance of the whole waste management system in Pamplona.
The worst case scenario where all MSW (including paper and organic material) is disposed
of to landﬁll produces 62,000 GJ of electricity from landﬁll gas, while the baseline scenario only
produces 35,000 GJ of electricity as the paper fraction is recycled leaving less biodegradable
material in the landﬁll. 
The scenarios that model composting of organic material and composting of organic material
with an extra kerbside collection use 9000 and 21,000 GJ of energy, respectively. This is
because of (1) the energy required to operate the composting process; (2) the organic material
not being disposed of to landﬁll, therefore in the LCI model producing no biogas; and (3) the
extra collection requiring more fuel for the collection vehicles. 
The scenario where the organic material is composted with paper shows an increase in the
amount of energy required by the overall system to 12,000 GJ, because now more material is
being composted (more energy is required to run the process) and there is no biodegradable
material being sent to landﬁll, so in the LCI model no biogas, therefore no electricity, is generated.

The scenario modelling the composting of organic material and paper with an extra collec-
tion logically uses the most energy, approximately 26,000 GJ.
When the beneﬁts associated with recycling, principally the replacement of virgin materials
by recycled materials, are included in the model the net energy use of each of the scenarios
changes radically. The worst case scenario remains the same as there is no recycling, but the
existing waste management scenario now produces almost 130,000 GJ as the energy saved by
replacing virgin material with recycled material is signiﬁcant. The net energy balance of the
remaining scenarios all result in the production of energy, due to the energy savings associated
with recycling. The energy produced by adding composting to the existing waste management
system reduces the amount of energy produced (for the same reasons as in the paragraph
above) to 82,000 GJ; the addition of an extra collection reduces this further to 70,000 GJ. The
energy produced by adding composting of organic material and paper to the existing waste
management system reduces the amount of energy produced (again for the same reasons as in
the paragraph above) to 36,000 GJ; the addition of an extra collection reduces this further to
24,000 GJ. 
The relative change in the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of the greenhouse gases 
(CO2, CH4 and NOx) produced by each of the waste management scenarios modelled was
also calculated. Using the existing waste management scenario as zero, sending all MSW for
disposal to landﬁll would result in an approximate 10% increase in GWP for the whole system.
The scenarios that remove organic material from landﬁll (preventing the production of
methane, a potent greenhouse gas) by composting result in a decrease in GWP of almost
38%, while the addition of paper to the composting process further decreases the GWP of the
whole waste management system by approximately 45%.
Conclusions
The LCI tool was successfully used to model the addition of another treatment technology to
the existing waste management system in Pamplona. It revealed that adding a composting facil-
ity would result in the net use of more energy by the whole waste management system than is
used by the current waste management system, which is based on materials recycling and land-
ﬁll. However, the LCI results also indicated that adding composting to the existing waste man-
agement system would result in a signiﬁcant reduction in the GWP of the overall system. The
LCI tool did not indicate which was the ‘best’ or ‘correct’ waste management scenario; that 
decision must be based on local conditions and local environmental and economic priorities.

Gloucestershire county, UK – LCI scenarios for composting, recycling
and incineration
In Gloucestershire in 1998 the majority of wastes were disposed of to landﬁll. There were 35
landﬁll sites throughout the county. Gloucestershire produced 1.5 million tonnes of waste
material per year. Almost half of this was construction and demolition waste, while only 15%
was household waste. 
Development of waste management scenarios for Gloucestershire 
The potential advantages and disadvantages of alternative waste management scenarios in
Gloucestershire were compared by ﬁrst developing an LCI model of the existing waste 
management operations in the county. A number of alternative waste management scenarios
were then developed using the same waste management data relating to the types and 
quantities of wastes managed within the system area, but modifying the waste management
processes required for each scenario. An outline of the baseline scenario and each of the 
alternative scenarios is presented below and in Figure 6.2.
Baseline and alternative scenarios
The baseline scenario was the existing waste management system in Gloucestershire:
• landﬁll: 92% of total waste inputs (household and commercial/industrial) sent directly to
landﬁll and 81% of household waste stream sent directly to landﬁll
• recycling rates (as percentage of household waste stream) 5% through household waste
recycling centres, 5% through collection banks and 9% through kerbside collection
• sorting in materials recovery facility of 4.5% of total waste input to system
• composting 18% of organic material in household waste stream.
Scenario 1: Composting of all organic waste, restwaste to landﬁll, utilisation of landﬁll gas.
Scenario 2: Recycling of all recoverable materials through kerbside sort systems, restwaste to
landﬁll.
Scenario 3: Incineration (without energy recovery) of 50% of total solid waste, restwaste
(and residues from the incinerator) to landﬁll.
Scenario 4: Centralised Material Recovery Facility (MRF), no separate collection of recy-
clables, Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) facility, restwaste and all residues to landﬁll.
Scenario 5:; Separate collection of recyclables, centralised MRF for unsorted waste, RDF
facility, restwaste and all residues to landﬁll.
Results
The results of the LCIs for each of the ﬁve alternative waste management scenarios were com-
pared with the results from the baseline scenario. The major differences between the scenar-
ios were related to the production of CO2, CH4 and net energy (see Table 6.3).
Scenario 1 (composting) and 2 (recycling) were most similar to the baseline scenario as they
did not include incineration. These two scenarios resulted in small reductions in CO2 emissions
but larger reductions in CH4 emissions of 54% and 29%, respectively. In scenario 1 this was
caused by the diversion of most of the organic material from the landﬁll to composting, where

breakdown is aerobic (producing CO2) rather than anaerobic (producing CH4) and also the
utilisation of landﬁll gas from that fraction of the organic material that was not collected and was 
disposed of to landﬁll. The smaller decrease in CH4 emissions in scenario 2 was due to 
the recycling of paper, which was therefore not landﬁlled and did not get broken down 
anaerobically. 
The differences between the energy consumption of the different waste management sce-
narios varied considerably. The baseline scenario provided a net saving of 165,000 GJ due 
to the energy credited to this scenario for materials collected and sent for recycling, i.e. the 
difference between the amount of energy used to produce virgin material and the amount of
energy required to produce recycled material. The utilisation of landﬁll gas resulted in a threefold
energy saving for scenario 1, whereas the large increase in recycling in scenario 2 resulted in an
energy saving nine times greater than that of the baseline scenario. 
In scenarios 3 (incineration without energy recovery), 4 (central sorting + RDF) and 5 
(separate collection + RDF) the addition of an incineration stage resulted in very different 
levels of air emissions and energy consumption. Scenario 3 modelled the incineration of 50%
of the waste stream without energy recovery while scenarios 4 and 5 both modelled a 30%
diversion of the waste stream to a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF), the residue from which
was converted to RDF, which was incinerated with energy recovery. The most signiﬁcant
changes relating to these scenarios were the emissions of CO2 and CH4. All three scenarios
resulted in a large increase in CO2, three to four times greater than the baseline scenario. CO2
emissions were highest for scenario 3, as a higher percentage of waste was incinerated. Only a
small difference in CO2 emissions between scenarios 4 and 5 was calculated due to differences
in the collection and sorting processes. In scenario 5, separate collection of recyclables using
collection containers achieved an increased materials recovery rate. This resulted in a diversion
of some of the organic fraction (paper) from incineration and energy recovery, lowering CO2
emissions. This diversion of materials resulted in a lower net energy savings for scenario 5 as
less material was available for energy recovery. Scenarios 4 and 5 also resulted in lower CH4
emissions than in the other scenarios, representing a 300% decrease in comparison with the

management system with the ﬁve alternative waste management scenarios

baseline scenario. This was due to energy recovered from the organic fraction of waste and
results in lower emissions of CH4 from landﬁll. 
In terms of net energy consumption, scenario 4 (central sorting plus RDF) resulted in the sav-
ing of 4.32 million GJ per year through both recycling savings and energy generation. These
energy savings were more than 20 times greater than savings achieved by the baseline scenario. 
Overall, scenarios 4 (central sorting + RDF) and 5 (separate collection plus RDF) resulted 
in the lowest quantity of waste going to landﬁll, achieved a 50–51% diversion rate compared
with only 6% for the baseline scenario, and a 21–22% recovery rate for materials. This
recovery rate was only matched by scenario 2, which included 100% recycling and kerbside
sorting of MSW.
Conclusions 1
The main differences in environmental burdens between the scenarios are due to the differ-
ence between the recovery of materials and the recovery of energy from the incineration
process. Different collection and sorting of waste (the comparison between scenarios 4 and 5)
has a relatively minor inﬂuence on the environmental burdens of the whole system.
The environmental burdens caused by CH4 and CO2 emissions change dramatically
between the different scenarios. The generation of CH4 decreases as recycling increases and
decreases further when the organic fraction is diverted from landﬁll to either composting or
incineration with energy recovery. The generation of CO2 also decreases as recycling increas-
es and again decreases further when the organic fraction is diverted from landﬁll to composting.
The generation of CO2 increases when incineration is added as the carbon content of the
incinerator feedstock is converted to CO2 during the incineration process. As CH4 has a Glob-
al Warming Potential 21 times greater than CO2, waste management options that would result
in a lowering of CH4 emissions may be regarded favourably. The advantage of incineration in
scenarios 4 and 5 is that electricity is generated resulting in much greater net savings of energy.
Energy savings are higher in scenarios 4 and 5, where incineration utilises the organic fraction of
the waste directly to generate electricity, compared with scenario 1, which utilises landﬁll gas.
Scenarios 4 and 5 result in the lowest levels of CH4 emissions and the highest levels of 
energy saving; their main drawback is the higher levels of CO2 emissions. The least favourable
scenario would appear to be scenario 3, incineration without energy recovery, as this has a 
net energy consumption, high levels of CO2 emissions and signiﬁcant emissions of CH4.
Scenarios 1 and 2 have low levels of CO2 emissions, but much higher emissions of CH4
and lower energy savings than scenarios 4 and 5. In terms of meeting UK national targets for
reductions in gases with Global Warming Potential, scenarios 4 and 5 appear most suitable.
This conclusion is based on the assumption that state of the art air pollution control is carried
out.
Application
This LCI study was commissioned by a waste management company, which was planning to
tender for a contract to provide waste management services within Gloucestershire county.
Before the results of the LCI were presented to representatives from the County, the waste
management company was taken over by a larger company and the change in management
resulted in an end to their interest in waste management in Gloucestershire. 
Gloucester County, UK – LCI Scenarios 
139
Concepts and Case Studies

Further studies
A second LCI study on waste management has been carried out in Gloucestershire to develop
recycling plans for each of the six Local Authorities (LAs) within Gloucestershire county, that ﬁt with-
in the 1997 county waste disposal strategy. The study again used the IWM-1 model to develop four
waste management scenarios for the six LAs. The results of the LCI model were used to fulﬁl the
environmental assessment requirement for the Draft Recycling Plan submitted to the Department
of the Environment Transport and Region, by the LAs. One of the aims of this study was to 
examine how the results of the LCI were used by each of the six LAs within Gloucestershire.
Gloucestershire’s county waste management strategy for the period 1997–2025 (Glouces-
tershire County Council, 1997) presents the aims of the County Council rather than 
laying down speciﬁc requirements for the future. The aim is to implement sustainable waste
management within the county through applying the concept of best practicable environmen-
tal option. This includes adopting the government targets of 40% MSW recovery by 2005,
reducing the proportion of controlled waste going to landﬁll by 60%, providing accessible 
recycling facilities for 80% of households by 2000, recycling or composting 25% of household
waste by 2000 and home composting to be carried out in 40% of domestic properties with a
garden by 2000. 
The county strategy requires increased recycling and composting. These are demanding tar-
gets given the current low levels of recycling and composting in the district councils. In the
county waste management strategy, the difﬁculties in reaching high recycling levels are recog-
nised and so the strategy includes the possibility of constructing a new 200,000 tonne/year
Energy from Waste (EfW) plant. The LAs are responsible for delivering realistic strategies and
so developed three waste management scenarios, which they believed had the potential to 
deliver the aims listed above. Life Cycle Assessment was proposed as a suitable tool to 
examine the potential environmental burdens of each scenario. Three new scenarios were 
modelled for each of the six LAs:
Baseline scenario: the existing waste management system as of February 1999
Scenario 1. 25% Recycling 
Scenario 2. 25% Recycling + 8% home composting
Scenario 3. 25% Recycling + Centralised EfW incinerator.
The model showed a similar pattern of environmental burdens for each of the six LAs under
scenarios 1,2 and 3 despite the differences between districts with respect to waste composi-
tion, waste quantities, distance from landﬁll sites and collection methods. 
Use of LCI results by local authorities
The report detailing results from the LCI model was submitted to each LA as it became avail-
able. Three months later key personnel from the waste management section of each LA
(either the Waste Manager or the Recycling Ofﬁcer) were interviewed to determine the extent
of utilisation of the LCI information in developing actual local recycling strategies. The key 
problems in using the data from the LCI studies were seen to be:
1. a difﬁculty in understanding the model itself
2. a failure to appreciate the units in which numerical data were expressed (e.g.: kWh, MJ, GJ)
140
Chapter 6: LCI Case Studies
Concepts and Case Studies

3. a lack of understanding of the effects of different emissions on the local environment
4. a lack of understanding of the difference between local and global emissions
5. a limited understanding of the signiﬁcance of emissions.
Conclusions 2
This LCI study showed in all six districts, that Global Warming Potential (GWP) declines as 
recycling increases from the baseline to the 25% target. The majority of this reduction is due to
‘recycling savings’, the reduction in emissions and energy consumption by using recycled mate-
rials rather than virgin materials. The highest GWP was generated by the baseline scenario.
The lowest GWP varied with centralised incineration having the lowest GWP in Gloucester,
and the home composting scenario the lowest in the other ﬁve districts. These differences
were due to variations in waste composition and transport distance to a centralised incinerator.
In terms of SOx emissions, incineration appeared the least favourable option from a local per-
spective even though global savings may be achieved. The most favourable energy balance
utilised incineration and the least favourable utilised home composting. As the organic fraction
is removed for recycling and/or composting, methane and thus energy generation from landﬁlls
declines.
The local authority must therefore balance changes in emissions and energy generation
locally, with reduced emissions and energy consumption from recycling that may occur else-
where. They are being asked not just to consider the local environment but global environ-
mental effects in making decisions about waste management. This is a complex task made
more difﬁcult by having to factor in the ﬁnancial implications of all options at the local level.
Two main constraints on actual utilisation of the data from this LCI study were recognised.
First was the application of the model itself. The results of the LCI were not published in time
to play a part in development of recycling plans, and most importantly were not communicat-
ed in a way that made the results easy to understand. Second was the policy making process
itself. Both political and ﬁnancial aspects were felt by most to be the priority in decision making.
At the local level waste management is political and limited by a lack of ﬁnancial resources.
There is clearly a role for LCI information in raising awareness about the environmental effects
of proposed waste management options, but attention must be paid to the transparency and
credibility of the LCI model if direct utilisation of the results is the aim.

Barcelona Metropolitan Area – LCI for long-term Integrated Waste
Management strategy planning 
The metropolitan area of Barcelona is made up of 33 municipalities with a population of
approximately 2.9 million people. The city of Barcelona accounts for 54% of the 1.29 million
tonnes of MSW generated in this metropolitan area. Of the total amount of MSW collected in
Barcelona, 3% is recycled, 27% is incinerated and the remainder is landﬁlled. The legal obliga-
tions that are established within the Catalan regulations for waste management authorities in
the metropolitan area include: the collection of waste; and the establishment of recovery and
recycling centres; the valorisation (incineration with energy recovery) and recycling of the
organic and inorganic fractions of waste and its ﬁnal disposal.
The EC Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (EC94/62) had a signiﬁcant impact on the
waste management system in Barcelona, as it resulted in the separate collection of packaging
material and the establishment of materials recycling, biological treatment and valorisation
(incineration) targets for the year 2001. The Catalan regulations also require separation of the
organic fraction of waste.
Collection and disposal 
A bring system operated in Barcelona in 1996. Householders were encouraged to separate
their waste into glass, paper and cardboard, and light containers (deﬁned as mixtures of plastic,
beverage cartons, aluminium foils and cans). The remaining material was collected as rest-
waste, at kerbside collection points. The separated material was sent to a small recycling and
recovery centre. The residue from the recovery and recycling centre, plus approximately 25%
of the collected household restwaste was incinerated with energy recovery. The remaining
restwaste was sent to landﬁll. A small composting facility (with a capacity of 30,000 tonnes per
year) was operational but the actual amount of material treated at the site was very small.
Objectives of the new waste management system
The Catalan Metropolitan authority (EMA) has been appointed as the sole authority in charge of
the treatment and disposal of MSW for the whole metropolitan area. The new waste management
system aims to ‘increase the reutilisation, recycling and valorisation of waste in order to reduce its
environmental burdens’. The disposal of waste in landﬁlls will be limited to the waste fractions that
cannot be treated by the methods listed above. This approach is expected to reduce the quantities
of waste requiring ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll. It is anticipated that the new waste management system
will result in the creation of new jobs in activities related directly or indirectly to the overall waste
management strategy. This social beneﬁt is of major importance to all of the municipalities involved. 
Use of an LCI tool to help develop the new Integrated Waste
Management system
With the above objectives in mind, EMA used IWM-1 (White et al., 1995) to model different
Integrated Waste Management scenarios for the metropolitan area of Barcelona. The existing
waste management system was modelled, to act as a baseline (see Figure 6.3) against which all
other scenarios could be compared. The scenarios that were modelled focused mainly on the
development of the collection system to increase the amount of recyclable material collected
and the treatment of the organic fraction of the waste stream.

By modelling many different scenarios, each of which was a realistic progression from the
baseline scenario, EMA was able to develop an Integrated Waste Management strategy 
that would meet their objectives. As the new strategy evolved from the existing waste 
management operation and was designed by taking a holistic approach it is inherently compat-
ible with the speciﬁc circumstances of the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Therefore this 
strategy has been developed taking environmental, economic and social considerations into
account.
The new Integrated Waste Management system
The new waste management system based upon the results of the LCI tool will improve the
existing infrastructure and the collection system through a series of major investments and 
public information strategies. A campaign amongst the people of the metropolitan area to 
promote waste minimisation and reduction is planned. EMA is aware that the long-term suc-
cess of the programme will depend on public participation. The system was developed to be
completed in four stages (see Figure 6.4).

Conclusions
The application of a life cycle approach to the development of a long-term waste strategy for
the metropolitan area of Barcelona has been successful and this exercise has resulted in the
adoption of a clear and achievable plan, which will dramatically alter the management of solid
waste in the area by 2006. Starting with the existing waste management scenario for
Barcelona, many different scenarios were modelled and the environmental and ﬁnancial
aspects of each scenario were compared and analysed. These results were then used to mod-
ify new scenarios to allow the eventual development of a long-term strategy based upon a
four-step plan. The four ﬁnal scenarios enable ﬁnancially viable infrastructure development to
proceed in parallel with the optimisation of environmental performance at a local level. 
This is a good example of a waste management authority using LCI as a tool to provide it
with both environmental and economic data. LCI data can be used to improve the decision-
making process by making it more data based and therefore more reliable and enable the
development of a comprehensive long-term Integrated Waste Management strategy. The data
from successive iterations enabled the users to build appropriate and realistic scenarios, which
could take into account the requirements of both the legislator and the decision maker. Con-
siderable time and effort is necessary to develop the model scenarios and communicate the
results of the model. This investment will result in a waste management strategy built upon the
solid foundations of data-based decisions. This approach can deliver more sustainable waste
management systems.

London, Ontario, Canada – LCI for assessment of different materials
recycling options 
Two Canadian industry groups, Corporations Supporting Recycling (CSR) and the Environment
and Plastics Industry Council (EPIC) have co-sponsored the development of an LCI model that
municipalities can use to evaluate the environmental and economic effects of proposed
changes to their Integrated Waste Management system, strategies and practices. This holistic
system approach takes into account the upstream and downstream effects of waste manage-
ment decisions. It is based on the best data currently available and the consideration of select-
ed environmental burdens, and has a municipal focus.
The model has been designed with signiﬁcant municipal input from the co-participant in the
project, the City of London, Ontario. London’s participation has provided an excellent case
study wherein data inputs, analysis, interpretation and results have been provided by municipal
staff and communicated to municipal stakeholders. The ‘Beta version’ of the model was com-
pleted in September 1998. The Peer review was completed in April 1999. Its release began
soon after and municipal training workshops have been held across Canada. The model’s
developers, Envirosphere and Procter & Redfern Ltd, have carried this work out under the
direction of a steering committee for the project consisting of representatives from EPIC, CSR,
City of London, Environment Canada, Resource Integration Systems and Procter & Gamble.
The development and testing of the model began in this southwestern Ontario municipality
(population 340,000 in 1998) in late 1996. The ﬁrst test of the model began with a bench-
marking process, using both the environmental and economic modules of the tool. Waste
management data gathered in 1995 and 1996 were analysed by the model and the environ-
mental and economic burdens predicted by the model were compared against actual operat-
ing data. The model was shown to provide an accurate proﬁle of the City of London’s waste
management system and it described in detail the environmental beneﬁts associated with the
changes made to the system between 1995 and 1996. 
In December 1997, London Municipal Council approved the long-term waste strategy
known as the Continuous Improvement System for waste management; a dynamic framework
that recognises Integrated Waste Management as an important environmental service in the
community, which contributes to the protection of human health and the environment by
effectively allocating operating and capital budgets and employment resources. One key aspect
of the Continuous Improvement System is measuring environmental performance of the total
MSW management system. Environmental parameters are calculated by the computer model
developed as described above.
The City, faced with a renewal of its kerbside recycling programme contract in 1999, which
was going to have increased costs as a major decision factor, provided the second major test of
the model’s capability. The LCI model was used to evaluate the differences in the potential
environmental burdens of collecting and recycling four different groups of materials, as shown
in Table 6.4.
The LCI model was used to calculate the effect of changes to the recycling programme in 
terms of changes in emissions of various pollutants within the City’s waste management system
and net changes in life cycle emissions, which could potentially occur globally (in London and
outside), if materials recovered from the City’s waste stream were used to replace the pro-
duction of virgin materials.

Concepts and Case Studies

In order to calculate net changes in ‘potential’ life cycle emissions due to recycling, the model
relies on data available in the public domain on the life cycle emissions associated with the pro-
duction of various materials (paper, aluminium, glass, steel, plastic). The users of the model
recognise that while a number of government and industry agencies are in the process of
developing reliable life cycle data for the different materials, the data that are currently available
are old and in some cases incomplete. The users then correctly warn the decision makers that
‘at this stage therefore these data should be used only as a very rough indication of potential
burdens of recycling programmes on emissions from virgin material production systems’.
The potential environmental burdens identiﬁed by the model are expressed in terms of every-
day equivalents such as the emissions from the production of electric power for the average
Canadian home, or emissions from the average passenger car. This is a helpful method to help
decision makers quantify the scale of the potential burdens being described by the data from the
model. The signiﬁcance of these potential burdens has been further evaluated based upon:
1. How the magnitude of the change compared with the variability of the emission data used in
the model. The model uses emissions data from processes including the extraction of fuels
and raw materials, the production of materials and energy and from the management of
solid waste. Emissions from each of these processes are highly site speciﬁc and therefore

variable, and depend upon factors such as the technology used, the source and nature of
raw materials, climatic conditions, etc. The data used in the model generally represent
‘industry averages’. Changes that were judged to be smaller than the estimated variability in
the data were therefore reported as not signiﬁcant. 
2. How the magnitude of the change compared with emissions from other sources within the
community. According to Statistics Canada census data, the City of London had a population
of 325,650 in 1996. Between 1991 and 1996, London’s population grew at an average rate
of 0.9% per year, or 2900 per year. Based on an average household of 2.5 persons, this
converts to an increase of over 1100 homes per year. Similarly, based on the number of 
passenger car registrations per capita reported for Canada by Statistics Canada, there 
are approximately 150,000 cars in the City of London and the annual population growth
represents an increase of approximately 1300 passenger cars per year. Changes that 
are small relative to these natural ‘growth’ numbers were therefore considered to be
insigniﬁcant.
3. How the magnitude of the change compared with annual emissions of those pollutants from
all sources in Ontario and/or Canada.
Results from the LCI model
Under scenario 1, the effect of limiting the grades of paper collected to old newspapers, mag-
azines and telephone directories, and limiting the plastics collected to PET was examined. This
has the effect of reducing the quantity of recyclables collected from 16,410 tonnes to 14,125
tonnes, a reduction of approximately 2285 tonnes a year or 14%. This option meets the min-
imum recycling requirements mandated by the province.
In scenario 2, the effect of collecting only selected materials was examined. In addition to
limiting the grades of paper collected, glass is also removed from the recycling programme.
This has the effect of reducing the quantity of recyclables collected further to 11,850 tonnes a
reduction of approximately 28%.
In scenario 3 the amount of paper collected was maximised. In this scenario, all grades of
paper are collected. In addition, all other materials remain unchanged, except for the removal
of mixed plastics from the recycling programme. The total quantity of recyclables collected
under this scenario would be only marginally (2.5%) lower than the existing system. 
In evaluating the effects of reducing the quantity of materials collected for recycling, it was
assumed that the materials excluded from the recycling programme were sent to an Energy
from Waste (EfW) facility. The changes in energy and emissions that occur as a result of each of
these changes within the waste management system and over the entire Life Cycle of the
materials are described.
Energy
Because the City of London sends a portion of its MSW to an EfW facility, the waste manage-
ment system is a net producer of energy. The energy that is produced and captured as usable
steam from the combustion of waste is more than is consumed by all waste management
processes (collection, sorting, processing and landﬁlling). 
In scenario 1 (Minimum Requirements), the amount of energy (diesel, natural gas and elec-
tricity) consumed by the recycling programme (for collecting and sorting recyclables) is reduced
by approximately 19%. In addition to this, the incineration of paper and plastics sent to the EfW
London, Ontario, Canada – LCI for Assessment of Recycling Options 
149
Concepts and Case Studies

facility generates energy. These changes improve the energy balance of the system by the
equivalent of the amount of electric power required by approximately 800 homes for a year.
Reducing the quantity of recyclables collected, however, increases the net energy consumption
(over the whole Life Cycle) because the production of virgin paper and plastics requires more
energy than the production of recycled paper and plastics. Global consumption increases by
the equivalent of approximately 1200 homes. Thus, the overall net effect is an increase in ener-
gy consumption equivalent to power for 400 homes.
In scenario 2 (Selected Materials), the energy used for recycling is reduced by a further
6.5%. However, the addition of glass to the MSW stream going to the EfW facility (as glass is
not recycled in this scenario) reduces the amount of energy generated by that facility (relative
to scenario 1) by almost 30%. As a result, the energy balance improves by the equivalent of
only 600 homes (less than the improvement in scenario 1). Net energy consumption (over the
whole Life Cycle) increases by the equivalent of power required for 600 homes.
Scenario 3 (Maximum Paper Recycling) represents a very small reduction in the quantity of
material recycled. Recycling energy savings are therefore small and only 350 additional tonnes
of material are sent for energy recovery. Energy savings within the waste management system
are therefore correspondingly small (equivalent to the power required for 200 homes). The
net increase in energy consumption (over the whole Life Cycle) is also relatively small, the
equivalent of power for 300 homes. By comparison, if there was no recycling programme in
place, and all the materials that are currently recycled were landﬁlled, then energy consumption
within the system would fall by the equivalent of the power required for 300 homes. The net
increase in energy consumption (over the whole Life Cycle) would be much larger, at the 
equivalent of power for 7900 homes.
Global Warming Potential (GWP)
Reducing the amount of paper and plastics collected by the recycling programme in Scenarios
1, 2 and 3 reduces the GWP associated with the collection and sorting of these materials and
increases emissions associated with combusting these materials in the EfW facility. Reducing the
quantity of material collected for recycling therefore has little effect (ranging from the equivalent
of 0 to 100 cars) on GWP within the waste management system.
The IWM model indicates that net emissions of GWP gases (over the whole Life Cycle)
could potentially increase by the equivalent of emissions of between 200 and 1000 cars/year as
a result of reduced replacement of virgin materials by recycled materials. 
The users noted that ‘in addition to the general data quality concerns associated with the
estimation of burdens of replaced virgin material mentioned above, the data used for paper in
the IWM model have two shortcomings’:
1. The credit for replacing virgin paper is calculated on the basis of data for only two grades of
paper, old newsprint (ONP) and old corrugated containers (OCC).
2. The greenhouse gases that are taken up by trees grown for the production of virgin paper
are not taken into account by the data. It is likely therefore that it overstates the GWP asso-
ciated with the production of virgin paper and consequently the potential savings that may
result from replacing virgin paper with recycled paper.
As a consequence of these shortcomings, the results of the model with respect to the Life
Cycle burden of recycling paper on GWP are considered unsuitable for use in decision making
150

at the present time. As better data becomes available, it will be incorporated into the model,
thereby increasing the level of conﬁdence with which such analysis can be undertaken. 
This detailed level of explanation of the results from an LCI model for waste management is
essential for the purpose of transparency for other expert users and to ensure that decision
makers understand the limitations of the results from such a model. Clear and comprehensive
reporting of the results from an LCI model allows decision makers to have conﬁdence in the
data upon which they are basing their decisions.
The reported results of this application of the LCI model also included data on: 
1. acid gases (nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chloride) 
2. smog precursors (nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter) 
3. heavy metals (lead, cadmium and mercury) and trace organic (dioxins) emission to both air
and water
4. total restwaste.
Conclusions
The results from the IWM model showed that in general, there was little difference in the
emissions from the overall waste management system, between the four different recycling
scenarios. The results indicated that within the waste management system, emissions of
approximately half the pollutants decrease slightly, while emissions of the other half show a
small increase, relative to the existing system.
Larger differences were found when net emissions (over the whole Life Cycle) were con-
sidered. This takes into account potential savings in emissions that may occur outside the waste
management system as a result of recycling. However, these differences are generally small
when considered in relation to the variability of the data available for this type of analysis and
the magnitude of emissions of these pollutants from other sources.
However, the comparison of the existing recycling system with the hypothetical ‘no recy-
cling’ scenario demonstrates that the environmental beneﬁts associated with recycling are sig-
niﬁcant. Increases in net emissions of all pollutants (over the whole Life Cycle) are indicated
where there is no recycling.
Based on these results from the LCI model, The City of London Standing Committees and
Council have approved an expanded recycling system based on public acceptability and envi-
ronmental beneﬁts despite the higher cost to the municipality. The use of the LCI model (with-
in a decision making framework) ensured that elected ofﬁcials made their decisions based upon
both environmental and economic data.

This case study describes the preliminary results of a research project that is ongoing at the
time of writing. 
Background
The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA’s) Ofﬁce of Research and Development,
is working with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and its partners to develop a computer-
based Decision Support Tool (DST) designed to evaluate the cost and environmental perform-
ance of integrated MSW management systems. By adopting MSW management strategies that
improve the integration and efﬁciency of MSW management operations, local governments
can help reduce the release of greenhouse gases, conserve energy and other natural resources
and reduce burdens to air and water quality or ecosystems.
In addition to the DST, this research is producing a stand-alone database, which enables
users to search for data speciﬁc to a waste management unit operation, structure, piece of
equipment, or Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) parameter (air emission, waterborne efﬂuent, solid
waste). The information and tools developed through this effort will enable the evaluation of
the trade-offs among environmental burdens, energy, and costs for different integrated waste
strategies for MSW management including collection, separation, transportation, material
recovery facilities, remanufacturing, composting, incineration, and landﬁlling.
Decision Support Tool
The Decision Support Tool (DST) is a tool designed to aid in evaluating the cost and environ-
mental burdens of Integrated Waste Management strategies. It enables users to simulate exist-
ing MSW management strategies and conduct scenario analyses of new strategies to optimise
the cost or environmental performance of the system. The tool is designed to be used in con-
junction with community-speciﬁc data on waste generation and composition, recycling or
diversion programmes and facility (e.g. landﬁll) design and operation. 
The processes that can be modelled using the tool include multiple alternatives for waste
collection, transfer stations, Materials Recovery Facilities, mixed municipal and garden waste
composting, incineration, Refuse-Derived Fuel incineration, and disposal in a MSW landﬁll or a
hazardous waste landﬁll. Existing facilities and equipment can be incorporated as constraints to
ensure that previous capital expenditures are not negated. A screen shot of summary-level
results from the tool is shown in Figure 6.5.
In addition to viewing summary-level results, users can click down to obtain more detail
about each waste management operation selected. Data on all environmental burdens are
available on a total or process level basis. This information can be used to help evaluate the
trade-offs between different strategies and evaluate environmental performance. In addition,
the full costs associated with the Integrated Waste Management system are also provided for
the whole strategy or on a process level basis.
Local governments and solid waste planners can use the tool, for example, to evaluate the
effects of changes in the existing MSW management on cost; to identify least-cost ways to man-
age recycling and waste diversion; and to evaluate options for reducing GWP, priority pollu-
tants, and environmental burdens to water. The tool will also be valuable to other user groups,
including environmental and solid waste consultants, industry, Life Cycle practitioners, and 
152

environmental advocacy organisations. The tool may be used in evaluating policies and pro-
grammes for reducing total costs and environmental burdens in responding to the following
example issues:
1. changes in waste diversion or recycling goals
2. changes in market value for recovered materials 
3. quantifying potential beneﬁts associated with recycling and 
4. identifying strategies for optimising energy recovery from MSW.
Through ongoing case studies, the potential applications of the tool will be evaluated to help
clearly understand the potential uses and limitations of the tool and information. The Decision
Support Tool (DST) contains general cost parameters, and therefore is not a community-
speciﬁc model and is not intended for setting prices for any speciﬁc waste management service.
The cost results provided by the tool represent indicative engineering costs, which accrue to
the public entity (i.e. local government). A more detailed cash ﬂow analysis substituting local
parameters would be needed to determine the appropriate prices for services and materials.
The tool is also not designed to conduct Life Cycle comparisons of any speciﬁc products or

solutions for Sustainable Waste Management.
Testing the Decision Support Tool in local communities
A prototype of the DST is being tested in a number of case studies with state and local govern-
ments. At the time of writing, case studies are ongoing with Lucas County, Ohio; the Great
River Regional Waste Authority, Iowa; Anderson County, South Carolina; the State of Wiscon-
sin; the Integrated Waste Services Association, and the US Navy. Issues being analysed with the
DST for these different groups and studies are as follows:
• Lucas County, Ohio is developing a 15-year plan for their solid waste management system.
They believe that their waste operations are not cost effective and ignore pollution and Life
Cycle implications. The analyses and results of this case study are helping in the develop-
ment of integrated, cost-effective, and environmentally preferable plans and targeting
opportunities for increasing recycling rates, reducing costs, and improving environmental
performance.
• The Great River Regional Waste Authority in Iowa is exploring the efﬁciency of integrated 
collection systems versus multiple collection options. Their goals are to evaluate effects of recon-
ﬁguring service areas and applying existing systems to them, and in addition to develop a waste
management plan for a 50% recycling scenario, which is to be presented to the State authority.
• Anderson County, South Carolina is evaluating the cost and environmental implications of
implementing a residential kerbside recycling programme for the more densely populated
areas of the county as well as setting up a garden waste composting programme. The results
of this study will assist the County in determining the most cost-effective strategies for imple-
menting the programmes while simultaneously considering environmental performance.
• The State of Georgia used the tool to analyse the effects of banning the collection of garden
waste on air emissions within Gwinnett County. Current NOx emissions attributable to 
garden waste collection were estimated to be 105 tons per year and the elimination of a
garden waste ban would result in an 11% decrease in NOx. The number of collection
trucks needed for collecting garden waste with MSW increases from 171 trucks (with 
no garden waste collected with MSW) to 201 trucks. Discussions are underway to 
conduct additional case studies in Georgia to assist with evaluating regional solutions to 
Integrated Waste Management. 
• The State of Wisconsin is investigating the environmental beneﬁts of State-wide recycling
programmes. The DST is being used to analyse how changes in levels of State-mandated
recycling goals can potentially affect environmental burdens. The results of this study will
assist the State in deciding which solid waste strategies should be used in the future to meet
environmental improvement goals.
• The Integrated Waste Services Association is interested in analysing the effects that advances
in MSW management technologies have on GWP gas emissions. The DST is being used to
investigate GWP gas emissions from various technologies including landﬁll gas recovery,
Energy from Waste incineration and recycling.
• The US Navy has requested a case study for the Paciﬁc Northwest. There is major interest
in reducing costs, increasing recycling rates, and ensuring that environmental goals are being
met. In addition, due to the closure of small local landﬁlls and the need to transport waste by
154

Concepts and Case Studies

rail to a larger regional landﬁll, the Navy is interested in the consequent change in 
environmental burdens, energy and economics. The Navy is also investigating options 
that would include waste from nearby communities to develop more cost-effective and
environmentally preferable solutions leading to a more regional approach for integrated
waste management. The Navy is also considering additional case studies in San Diego and
the Paciﬁc Rim.
These case studies are providing cost and environmental information about alternative 
waste management strategies, which will assist in the development of management plans and
policies. The case studies are also enabling the research team to reﬁne the methods and data
used in the DST as well as the user interface tool. The details of the State of Wisconsin case
study are described below. However, the ﬁndings are preliminary and are not considered ﬁnal. 
Once comments are received from the State of Wisconsin, and the tool with its associated data
have received ﬁnal clearance, the full ﬁndings from these US case studies be released. 
Additional case studies are planned and these will reﬂect the issues of urban and rural settings
throughout the United States to ensure that the DST is ﬂexible enough to address the wide
range of variation among local communities.
Wisconsin case study methodology and results
The purpose of the State of Wisconsin case study was to estimate the environmental effects of
recycling and waste management in Wisconsin. In this study, the full Life Cycle beneﬁts (or 
burdens) of additional recycling being carried out in Wisconsin in 2000 as compared to 1995
were quantiﬁed. A Life Cycle approach was taken to estimate the emissions to air and water,
solid waste arisings, and the energy consumed for managing Wisconsin’s waste in 1995 
and 2000. This approach includes waste collection, processing, treatment, disposal and
remanufacturing of recyclables. 
Waste composition, generation, and recycling data
A case study methodology document was prepared that described the data sources and
assumptions made in entering the waste composition, generation, and recycling data for the
state of Wisconsin for the years 1995 and 2000. Waste generation data estimated for year
2000 was used for both 1995 and 2000, but the recycling rates are different for the 2 years.
Thus, year 1995 and 2000 levels of recycling were applied to waste generation data for model
year 2000.
Collection, recycling, and disposal options for residential, multi-family, and com-
mercial waste
In establishing a baseline model for the entire State of Wisconsin, a general waste management
strategy was deﬁned and used as the basis for calculating results. This included: 
• collection of presorted recyclables and remaining (residual) mixed waste
• processing of recyclables in a presorted Materials Recovery Facility
• disposal of restwaste in a landﬁll
• composting of garden waste in a garden waste composting facility. Note that in addition to
garden waste sent to the compost facility, garden waste is also composted in residential
backyards.

Concepts and Case Studies

Key assumptions employed 
When applying the DST to the real-world waste management practices of Wisconsin, some
assumptions were required to ‘ﬁt’ the real-world practices into the modelling environment of
the tool. For example, a community may manage a waste material that is not included in the
model (e.g. pallets, household hazardous waste) and thus assumptions must be made on how
best to handle such materials outside the model. The key assumptions employed in the Wis-
consin case study are as follows: 
• Some materials that were actually recycled are assumed to be non-recyclable because the
DST does not contain remanufacturing data for those items, e.g. batteries, tyres, etc. These
items were excluded for purposes of the case study and represent approximately 5% of the
waste generated. 
• The LCI for composting 290,000 tonnes of garden waste composted in residential back-
yards was added to the LCI of garden waste, which was collected and treated at a com-
posting facility for each year modelled.

Table 6.6 Summary of preliminary results predicting the Life Cycle bene-
ﬁts resulting from increased recycling in the State of Wisconsin from 1995
to 2000. Notes: negative ﬁgures represent Net increases in LCI parameters
for year 2000 over 1995. These data are totals for the entire waste 
management system including collection, recycling, treatment, disposal,
and remanufacturing

1. The recycling levels for 2000 were higher than those estimated for 1995 for all waste 
components. The net emissions include environmental burdens associated with collection,
processing, treatment, disposal, and remanufacturing of waste and recyclables in Wisconsin.
2. For several air emission parameters, the net numbers are negative. The negative number
indicates that there was a net increase in emissions for those LCI parameters.
3. The results show that recycling at year 2000 levels results in lower LCI parameter values for
some parameters, and higher values for others.
4. The higher net values of LCI parameters in 2000 can be explained by the increased quanti-
ties of waste generated, collected, recycled, and disposed of in 2000 over 1995 levels. For
example, in year 2000 there was a 4% increase in the quantity of waste landﬁlled over
1995 levels. There was a corresponding 11% increase in net methane releases for year
2000. This increase in methane emissions can be partly explained by the higher quantity of
waste landﬁlled (that generates methane during decomposition) in year 2000.
5. Emissions and energy use in the remanufacturing of recyclables recovered from waste
dominate emissions and energy use in the waste collection, processing, treatment, and dis-
posal stages of waste management.

The Environment Agency of England and Wales used case studies to help develop its LCA 
software, WISARD, which it produced jointly with the Scottish Environmental Protection
Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service. The main objectives of
the programme (which started in October 1994) were:
1. To get decisions on waste management put on a sound, scientiﬁc basis
2. To provide waste managers with the basis to arrive at sound decisions using the same
means.
The purpose of the case studies were threefold:
1. To prove whether the tool could be used by local authorities
2. To improve further the usability of the tool
3. To provide a source of data and experience that others could call upon when carrying out
their own studies.

All local authorities in England and Wales (some 400 counties, districts and unitaries) were
asked whether they were willing to carry out a case study in their area. Authorities were 
asked to commit a suitable member of staff for a 3-week period during the 6 weeks allowed for
the case study. They were also told they would have to supply data on waste 
vehicle movements and weights of different types of MSW produced. One hundred local
authorities volunteered to take part in the case studies. Fifteen authorities were selected, taking
into account the need to include different types of authority (waste collection, waste disposal
and waste planning authorities), different areas of the country and different demographic 
situations. One member of staff from each authority was given 2 days’ standard training on the
software and asked to prepare a report covering:
• the area studied and its setting
• details of population and its distribution
• the present system
• any constraints on the waste management system
• the purpose of use
• details of data sources
• changes made and new systems
• results and assumptions.
Summary data from 11 of the studies are presented in Tables 6.7 and 6.8. All the case stud-
ies are available as a joint research report published under the Environment Agency’s research
programme.
From Tables 6.7 and 6.8, it can be seen that a wide range of different waste management
scenarios were modelled as part of the overall case study procedure. A key element of this
work was to determine how useful the model was to local authority staff with respect to inves-

tigating different waste management treatment and disposal options at a local level. Similarly,
another important point was whether the users could interpret the (very comprehensive)
results of the model and whether the users could practically apply these results to the develop-
ment of a future local waste management strategy. 
Interpretation of the data from WISARD
In the reports each local authority modelled their existing waste management scenario and
compared it with one or more alternative waste management scenarios, some of them requir-
ing relatively small operational or infrastructure changes, others requiring more signiﬁcant
changes. Each report described the output from WISARD and documented the interpretation
of this data by the local authorities. It was clear from the reports that the users had not only
understood the principles of LCA for waste management but they had also understood that the
model does not decide which is the best or most suitable waste management system. That
decision must be made by the user based on their interpretation of the results from the model
within their local or regional context.

Table 6.8 The existing and proposed waste management scenarios 
modelled by WISARD 

The local authorities’ reaction to the case study exercise was documented in the conclusions
of their reports to the Environment Agency. Some of the comments that highlight the depth of
understanding reached in a relatively short period of time by the local authority staff working on
this project are summarised below. 
Brighton & Hove Council
‘Before drawing ﬁrm conclusions about the environmental performance of the different scenarios,
the meaning of these apparent effects, their magnitude and underlying reasons, would need
further investigation.’
Carmarthenshire County Council 
‘In conclusion the overall assessment of the results favour Dinefwr 2000 (the proposed sce-
nario) as the preferred waste management option. The scenario for Dinefwr 2000 could be
further explored to reduce the burdens attributable to logistics by changing the frequency of
the organic waste collection from a weekly collection to a fortnightly collection or by investigat-
ing the potential to change the traditional collection vehicle to one that has the capability of col-
lecting the paper and organic waste fractions in a separate compartment.’
Nottingham City Council
‘The study undertaken was to compare the authority’s current waste disposal system, which
includes incineration, landﬁll and recycling, with another system encompassing only incineration
and recycling. The second model (system 1), was chosen because the authority recognises that
with the ever increasing landﬁll tax, the present system, sending 49% of the authority’s waste
to landﬁll, will be an unattractive future option. There is an EfW incinerator in the authority,
which currently operates with two lines, but has the capacity for a third line if there is a long-
term future. Therefore, it may be a viable option for the authority to send the majority of its
waste to the incinerator and reduce the dependence on the landﬁll option from the authority’s
waste management strategy.’
Dorset County Council 
‘From the analysis of four major environmental burdens, it can be concluded that the proposed
scenario appears to be a preferable waste management system to the current system in 
environmental terms.’
Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council
‘On examination of all the data, it is clear that Gateshead 2000 (the proposed scenario) presents
savings in environmental burdens when comparing it to our current practice. Whether these sav-
ings are statistically signiﬁcant is unclear at present. As economic implications have not yet been
considered, we are unable to state whether Gateshead 2000 would be the best practicable envi-
ronmental option. This tool, however, has gone some way towards providing very useful informa-
tion that should be taken into consideration when developing our waste management strategy.’
Pendle Borough Council (Lancashire)
‘This Life Cycle Assessment indicates that there are environmental advantages in the develop-
ment of PostREAP (the proposed scenario) as a collection and treatment system for the area of
the study. However it will be necessary to combine this assessment with other methods of
appraisal to help select the most appropriate system.’

Chapter 6: LCI Case Studies
Concepts and Case Studies

Powys County Council
‘Composting a limited quantity of only 2000 tonnes has beneﬁcial effects over landﬁll as
methane emissions are reduced. The remaining ﬂows tend to be marginally affected, but the
increased use of transport has a tendency to increase pollutant burdens for those linked to
transport, such as acid gas emissions and consumption of energy. This has implications for the
future design of the municipal composting schemes in Powys beyond the initial 2000 tonnes
scale-up from the pilot project. In future, the collection and handling systems must be designed
to minimise the transport distance and maximise loads to reduce consumption of fossil fuels
and their associated adverse emissions.
Incineration appears to have a favourable impact, principally in the pollutant ﬂows linked to
avoided burdens from energy generation. Powys’ waste generation is too small and spread out
to justify the capital investment to build a facility in the County. However, should a facility be
built in the neighbouring South Wales Valleys, diversion from landﬁll to such a plant would have
a beneﬁcial impact on some of the pollutant ﬂows.
The magnitude of the differences between the three scenarios for most ﬂows is not large. In
addition, there is no single option that has clear beneﬁts over the others. Future judgements
about what options are best for Powys would have to be made with a set of clear priorities
identifying what ﬂows are most important locally, regionally, nationally and internationally. For all
three scenarios, the current recycling route has a substantially positive effect against most ﬂows,
particularly in avoided burdens linked to primary materials and avoided energy use. If recycling
were to be stopped and materials diverted to landﬁll, there would be a far greater adverse
effect upon the environment. Although it is planned to signiﬁcantly boost recycling to 25% by
2003/04, this scenario has not been tested in the model but will be examined in follow-up
work. This is expected to show a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effect.’
Shropshire County Council
‘The clearest indication given by the output from this case study exercise is of a slight improve-
ment in environmental performance between the baseline and scenario 1, with a more 
dramatic improvement between scenarios 1 and 2. This is most clearly demonstrated for total
primary energy consumption, coal use and fossil CO2 emissions. Clearly, the changes in these
ﬂows derive from the avoided use of resources and energy associated with greater recycling
and the replacement of landﬁll with an Energy from Waste facility as the main disposal route.
There is a minor reduction in methane emissions between the baseline and scenario 1, which
derives from increased recycling and a resultant decrease in landﬁlling. The scale of reduction is
much greater between scenario 1 and scenario 2, due to the replacement of landﬁll by an
Energy from Waste facility as the main disposal route.’
Surrey County Council
‘In comparing the results from the scenarios, scenario 2 (the proposed scenario) is thought to be
the more favoured waste disposal option for Surrey County Council on an environmental basis.
Scenario 2 reduces the amount of emissions to air and water, saves on natural resources and
saves on most forms of energy. From the impact assessment scenario 2 was shown to have 
less of an impact on the environment than scenario 1. The main difference between the two 
scenarios was the introduction of an EfW incinerator to take approximately 60% of the county’s
waste. This seems to result in a system which is far more beneﬁcial to the environment.’

Conclusions
The case study exercise was successful in demonstrating that WISARD can help waste 
managers to make data-based decisions with respect to planning and optimising waste 
management systems. The 2-day training course in conjunction with support from Environment
Agency personnel enabled local authority staff to model their existing waste management sys-
tems and compare these systems with a number of alternative strategies. The problems of
interpretation of the data and results that were seen in the Gloucestershire case study were
avoided because of this good working relationship between the Environment Agency and 
the local authority. As local authority staff become more familiar with the model, detailed inter-
pretation of output data will play a more signiﬁcant role in the development of future waste
management strategies.

Where to from here?
The earliest LCI models for IWM were no more than a ﬁrst attempt to apply the technique to
this ﬁeld. If LCI results are going to be used as the basis for discussion between the many and
varied stakeholders in waste management decisions, the tool needs to be credible. The
methodology and assumptions must be transparent, and the basic data relevant and reliable.
Achieving endorsement from the UK Environment Agency and the US Environmental Protec-
tion Agency may help in some way to establish the credibility of models. The real proof of the
pudding is in the eating. It is through the experiences of waste planners and managers with the
tool of LCI that its full value will be understood, and the best ways to include it in the decision-
making process determined. Case studies have started to be published – some are referenced
above – but clearly more are needed. The tool is clearly appropriate for use in countries with
developed or developing economies, at a local level. The case studies described above use a
number of different LCI models, and once again each LCI model demonstrates that the sus-
tainable management of MSW depends on both local circumstances and priorities. To facilitate
the acceptance and application of such LCI models more case studies and practical experience
is required. Together with user-friendly, credible, reliable and ﬂexible models, this will help fully
explore the potential of this environmental management tool in conjunction with the concept
of Integrated Waste Management to develop more sustainable waste management systems.

Introduction
This book began by deﬁning sustainable development as ‘meeting the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’ (WCED,
1987). The depletion of the planet’s non-renewable resources, although still an issue, is no
longer an immediate concern (Beckerman, 1995; UNDP, 1998; UNDESA, 1999). The two
most critical issues now facing some regions on the planet are the ability of sinks to handle
emissions and waste and the degradation of renewables (such as soil, groundwater, ﬁsh stocks,
forestry and biodiversity) (UNDP, 1998). 
Waste management is closely linked to the whole debate and can signiﬁcantly reduce or
increase the overall burdens placed on the environment (both in terms of emissions and
resource use) depending on how the system has been designed and operated. Sustainable
development requires that we produce more value from goods and services, with less envi-
ronmental burdens and depletion of resources. When applied to waste management, sustain-
ability requires the production of more value from recovered materials and energy, with the
consumption of less energy, less resources and the production of less emissions to air, water
and land (Box 7.1). 
The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) technique gives us a way to quantify the ‘more’ and the ‘less’
– to predict the amounts of materials that will be recovered, the amount of energy consumed
and the likely emissions that will be released. This book has constructed a Life Cycle Inventory
(LCI) for Municipal Solid Waste, starting with a deﬁnition of the objectives of the LCI and the
system boundaries (Chapter 4), then deﬁning the quantity and composition of the waste that is
being managed (Chapter 8) and continuing until each stage in the Life Cycle of waste has been
described and discussed. For each of the processes from wastebin to ‘grave’, i.e. from waste
pre-sorting in the home, through collection and waste treatment, to ﬁnal disposal, the environ-
mental inputs and outputs have been quantiﬁed, and generic values have been suggested
where appropriate. When all of these individual modules are assembled together, it is possible
to calculate the overall environmental burden of the whole waste management system. 
Environmental sustainability is not the only issue, however. Waste management systems also
need to be affordable if they are going to be economically sustainable. Consequently the facili-
ty to carry out a simple economic assessment has been built into the model; this can 
be carried out in parallel with the LCI to calculate the overall economic costs of waste 
management systems.

From Life Cycle Inventory results to sustainability
The results produced by the LCI of Municipal Solid Waste represent a considerable, and 
perhaps daunting, amount of information, but then the waste management systems that 
these results describe are themselves complex. The results quantify the input and outputs of an
IWM system (see Box 7.1), namely the amounts of waste, energy and money entering the sys-
tem, together with the amounts of useful products (recovered materials, compost and energy), 
emissions to air and water, and ﬁnal residual waste to be landﬁlled. Environmental sustainability
involves producing more useful products, but less emissions and ﬁnal residual waste to be 
landﬁlled, with less energy and less resources consumed in the process. Economic sustainability
is achieved by keeping the amount of money needed to operate the system to a level that is
acceptable to all stakeholders.
The progress so far
Since the ﬁrst edition of this book was published in 1995, the methodology of LCI has been
accepted by the scientiﬁc community and guidelines for its use have been agreed by the Inter-
national Standards Organisation and published as the ISO series 14040-14043. The interest in,
and development of, Life Cycle tools for waste management by Government Environmental
Agencies and the addition of requirements to carry out LCI modelling of future waste manage-
ment strategies in a growing number of strategic waste management legislation documents
indicates that the concept has come of age. This is despite the fact that the details of how best
to model some of the individual waste management processes are still being reﬁned.
Life Cycle models of waste management systems are now being used to predict the envi-
ronmental performance of IWM systems, speciﬁcally with respect to emissions (on a local and
a global level) and ﬁnal waste arisings. As more speciﬁc data for each part of the Life Cycle are
becoming available, the amount of generic data needed is decreasing, therefore the results of
inventories are becoming more accurate. This improvement in data quality is allowing LCI
models to help optimise existing waste management systems and carry out comparisons
between different waste management options. LCI models are also being used to demonstrate
the interactions that occur within waste management systems. As they represent the whole
system, a Life Cycle model shows how different parts of each system are inter-connected and
therefore improves our understanding of the behaviour of the system.
Using a computer model for the LCI allows the user to compare a number of hypothetical
waste management systems, their environmental burdens and economic costs. These ‘What 
if ... ?’ calculations are now providing revealing information about interactions within Integrated
Waste Management systems. 
The Life Cycle approach has encouraged wider debate with respect to the appropriateness
of a hierarchy of waste treatment options. It has also helped move the discussion on from the
relative merits of individual technologies such as recycling and incineration where it has been
concentrated for some time. The beneﬁts of an integrated approach to waste management
have been recognised and the tool of LCI/LCA has been identiﬁed as the most appropriate
method of appraisal.
The Progress So Far 
167
Concepts and Case Studies

The results from LCI tools have been used as part of a communication programme at local
and regional government levels. LCI results have also been used to educate the public with
respect to the environmental burdens associated with different waste management options and
the differences between the effects of waste management at local and global level. Clear com-
munication of results is an important aspect of Life Cycle work, as the large amount of data that
are generated can easily lead to confusion and the loss of audience interest. The authors advise
that only summaries of results (the key data) should be presented to non-expert audiences but
that full details of the results should be available in hard copy format for reference where 
necessary. 
Future directions
The application of Life Cycle Assessment in general, and Life Cycle Inventory in particular, is still
a relatively new approach to waste management. It offers the possibility of taking an overall
view of the waste management system, and allows measurement of progress towards the goal
of sustainable development. 
The overall value of the LCI model developed in this book will become clear as it is applied
to different solid waste management systems. Whilst improvements to this and the other avail-
able LCI models can and will be made, they represent workable tools, which can be used both
to compare future Integrated Waste Management options and optimise existing systems. As
with all Life Cycle studies, it is likely that when the models are applied, they will come up with
a few surprises and offer some interesting new insights. 
There are undoubtedly improvements to be made. The authors anticipate that this will not
be the ﬁnal form of this model. It is hoped that experts in individual waste treatment processes
will continue to contribute their knowledge to improve each of the modules of this and the
other models. An inevitable, and valuable, consequence of developing this second version of
the model has been the reduction in the number of gaps in the data. As more appropriate data
are forthcoming, they can be incorporated in the model. There is also a need for continued
input from LCA experts. Currently there is still much debate about the methodology for Impact
Analysis, and it is to be hoped that scientiﬁcally based, transparent and generally accepted
methods will be available sooner rather than later. When this happens, a more complete
Impact Assessment can be added on to the Life Cycle Inventory described here. 
The best way to develop the ﬁeld of LCI for waste management will be by using the existing
models. We hope that waste managers, regulators, legislators and waste producers will ﬁnd the
approach both stimulating and helpful. Their experience and feedback will further improve this
and the other Life Cycle Inventory tools, thus providing a powerful methodology to assess the
environmental and economic sustainability of Integrated Solid Waste Management systems.

Summary
This chapter provides information on the quantity and composition of solid waste likely to be
generated in a given area. The lack of comprehensive and standardised data collection is one of
the limiting factors in this process, and in the development of effective solid waste management
tion of solid waste in general, and of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in particular, for Europe,
North America, South America and Asia. These data are limited; they are incomplete and are
based on different deﬁnitions of waste categories. Deﬁnitions are given for the type of waste
that will be dealt with in this book, namely MSW consisting of household (collected and deliv-
ered), commercial and institutional waste. The limitations of present classiﬁcation schemes are
discussed and new developments in waste analysis outlined. 
Introduction
The deﬁnitions of waste presented above show that due to the very heterogeneous nature of
waste it is difﬁcult to deﬁne other than in general terms. The simple deﬁnition of Municipal Solid
Waste is both accurate and vague. It is accurate because each municipal waste stream is made
up of the waste arisings collected by that municipality. It is vague as the waste arisings collected
by municipalities vary within countries and vary considerably between countries. This is

Deﬁnition: Waste. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) deﬁnes waste in general terms as: ‘unavoidable materials for which there is cur-
required’.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) deﬁnes waste as: ‘objects which
the owner does not want, need or use any longer, which require treatment and/or disposal’.
The European Community broadly deﬁnes waste (Directive 75/442/EEC on Waste) as:
‘any substance or object which the holder disposes of or is required to dispose of pursuant to
the provisions of the national law in force’. This was later amended (Directive 91/156/EEC)
to: ‘any substance or object in the categories set out in Annex 1 which the holder discards or
intends or is required to discard’. Annex 1, entitled ‘categories of waste’, lists a series of differ-
ent types of waste. The broad deﬁnition of waste is reinforced by the ﬁnal category: ‘any
materials, substances or products which are not contained in the above categories’. 
in general. This chapter presents the data currently available on the generation and composi-

described in Chapter 3, The Development of Integrated Waste Management Systems: Case
Studies and their Analysis. 
The functional unit of the LCI study of solid waste was deﬁned in Chapter 5 as the manage-
ment of the amount of household and similar solid waste generated in the speciﬁed geograph-
ical area. The ﬁrst requirement, therefore, is to determine both the amount and composition
of the solid waste generated in the region being studied. Ideally this should be data speciﬁc to
this region, collected from local solid waste analyses, but in most cases despite increasing inter-
est in this area, such information is not available. Assessment of solid waste generation rates
and composition must consequently be based on generic data, presented in the form of coun-
try speciﬁc averages. This information suffers from being at best an overall average, at worst an
estimate, but poor data is still better than no data at all.
Accurate deﬁnition of the major components of the solid waste stream is essential in an LCI
study of solid waste, as the solid waste itself is the majority of material inputs into the system.
Whatever enters the system in or with the solid waste, whether contaminants or energy, has
to leave the system somewhere. Thus most of the total emissions from the system reﬂect the
composition of the incoming solid waste. This underlines the need to reduce the amount of
solid waste produced in the ﬁrst place, and the need to eliminate any potentially harmful mate-
rials from the waste. 
Alterations to the waste management system can change how the waste materials leave the
system (e.g. in compost or as air emissions), or whether energy is harnessed for use or dissi-
pated, but will not change the total amount of waste materials or energy that arise from the
solid waste, since this is ﬁxed. The LCI for solid waste described in this book considers the
major components of solid waste to be: paper, plastic (both rigid and ﬁlm), glass, metal (ferrous
and non-ferrous), organic, textiles and the term ‘other’, to describe the normally small amount
of remaining material not covered by the previously named categories.
Solid waste generation
A complete overview of data on the amounts of solid waste generated globally is difﬁcult to obtain.
This is because much of the data is simply not available and also due to the variety and quality of
the available data sources. Different sources in each country use different deﬁnitions of total solid
waste, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), commercial waste (sometimes included in MSW, some-
times not) and industrial waste. Solid waste data are often presented in different formats depend-
ing on the objectives of the reporter, further obscuring the true ﬁgures. Data are often reported as
one or even several of the following: Total waste arisings, Total household waste, Total municipal
waste, Total residual waste, Total collected waste, Total landﬁlled waste and other permutations,
which depend on local circumstances. The main data sources available are the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Environment Agency (EEA),
countries’ own Environmental Agencies and statistical organisations, e.g. Eurostat.
The total amount of waste (excluding agricultural waste) generated in European Union (EU)
countries in 1995 was estimated to be 1.3 billion tonnes, while the total amount of MSW gen-
erated in Europe was estimated to be 0.21 billion tonnes tonnes (EEA, 1998). Figures 8.1 and
8.2 present data on the waste arisings (including agricultural waste) from a range of OECD
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.

Figure 8.2 OECD countries with total waste arisings less than 1billion tonnes per year. Source: OECD (1997).

Canada and the USA are not included in Figure 8.2 as their total solid waste arisings are far
greater than 1 billion tonnes per year. Canada generates over 1 billion tonnes of mining and
quarrying waste per year and the USA generates over 7 billion tonnes of manufacturing waste
per year (OECD, 1997).
Although Figures 8.1 and 8.2 represent a recent data set, it remains incomplete. Further-
more, the ﬁgures in many cases represent only estimates of the amounts of waste generated.
National Governments have openly stated that many ﬁgures quoted for waste generation are
based on estimates (e.g. UK DoE, 1990).
Historically, solid waste arisings have been measured in tonnages, on disposal, rather than
when and where they are generated. Thus where wastes are produced and dealt with at source,

Solid waste category
Description
Agricultural
Waste arising from agricultural practices, especially
livestock production. Often either used (applied to
land) or treated in situ.
Mining and quarrying
Mainly inert mineral wastes, from coal mining and
mineral extraction industries.
Dredging spoils
Organic and mineral wastes from dredging operations.
Construction and 
Building waste, mainly inert mineral or wood
demolition
wastes.
Industrial
Solid waste from industrial processes. Sometimes will
include energy production industries.
Energy production
Solid waste from the energy production industries,
including ﬂy ash from coal burning.
Sewage sludge
Organic solid waste, disposed of by burning, dumping
at sea (soon to cease in the EU), application to land or
composting. May result from industrial or domestic
waste water treatment.
Hazardous/
Solid waste, which can contain substances that 
Special waste
are dangerous to life, is termed ‘Special waste’ 
in UK, or ‘Hazardous waste’ in EU directives.
Commercial
Solid waste from ofﬁces, shops, restaurants, etc. often
included in MSW.
Municipal Solid Waste 
Deﬁned as the solid waste collected and 
(MSW)
controlled by the local authority or municipality and
typically consists of household waste, commercial
waste and institutional waste.
Table 8.1 Categories of solid waste

as with many agricultural wastes, they are not measured or included in statistics. Also, since waste
disposal has not been high on the political agenda in many countries in the past, efforts to 
maintain up-to-date national statistics on waste disposal, let alone waste generation, have been
limited.
Waste classiﬁcation has traditionally been by source rather than by composition. Because of
the different administrative methods used in the countries of Europe and other countries
around the world, no universal classiﬁcation has been adopted. The category ‘Municipal Solid
Waste’ typiﬁes the confusion (Carra and Cossu, 1990; ERRA, 1998). In some countries ﬁgures
are collected for household waste only (the MSW ﬁgure for the UK in Figure 8.2 refers only to
household waste), whereas other countries include waste derived from commercial and even
light industry. Similarly, ﬁgures for solid waste generated during energy production may be
quoted separately, or alternatively included under the umbrella of industrial wastes. Clearly
‘Solid Waste’ is a very diverse category; it has been said that every consignment 
of waste is unique. Although classiﬁcation of waste types is difﬁcult, the lack of consistent 
categories renders comparisons across countries problematic. The most commonly used 
categories are listed in Table 8.1.
As previously discussed, the lack of reliable statistics for solid waste generation has resulted in
wide variability in reported ﬁgures. Examples of this variability are shown in Table 8.2 below,
which presents different data reported for solid waste generation over a similar time period.
Most of this variability can be accounted for by differences in the estimates for agricultural and
mining wastes generated. Both may be treated at source, so their generation is hard to assess.
Table 8.2 shows how different sources in different countries can arrive at very different esti-
mates of total MSW arisings. 
Two key factors contribute to this lack of reliable data: the absence of systematic data collec-
tion and the lack of a standard classiﬁcation for waste.

Table 8.2 Examples of the differences in data provided by different sources

Discussion about waste management is also hampered by uncertainty over data sources.
Lack of reliable data has resulted in the proliferation of reports which, while quoting data, do
not reveal their sources. In this book, data that can be traced back to their original source will
be used wherever possible. 
The lack of consistent deﬁnitions and reliable statistics on a national scale does not prevent
the development of local or regional Integrated Waste Management schemes, since these
require accurate local rather than national data. Most regional authorities will have weighbridge
data on the amount of selected wastes that are produced. They will often have to rely on
national averages for the composition of the waste as waste analyses are expensive and labour-
intensive to conduct.
Solid wastes dealt with in this study
Although the term is widely used in waste management, MSW is not a naturally deﬁned cate-
gory. It has been deﬁned above simply as the waste controlled and collected by the local
authority or municipality. Consequently, there is no uniformity in material composition, merely
in how it has been collected, or more precisely, by whom. MSW is potentially the most diverse
category of waste, as it consists of waste from different sources, each of which is heteroge-
neous. For the purposes of this book, MSW sources are deﬁned as:
• Household waste – generated by individual households. This includes all solid wastes
originating on the property, including garden waste. It may also be termed domestic waste.
This is further subdivided into:
• Collected household waste – household waste collected from the property by the 
waste collection service. Essentially this is the combined contents of the wastebin/bin
bag/Blue box. 
• Delivered household waste – household waste delivered to a collection point by
the householder. This may include bulky waste items (e.g. cookers, refrigerators) and
garden waste (in some areas), plus recyclable materials deposited in bring systems (e.g.
bottle banks, waste paper collections). This category of waste would not be included in
analyses of wastebin contents, and may be overlooked in some statistics.
• Commercial waste – waste generated by commercial properties, such as shops, 
restaurants and ofﬁces, which is collected together with household waste.
• Institutional waste – waste generated in schools, leisure facilities, hospitals (excluding 
clinical waste), etc. This is often included within the commercial waste category.
Quantities of MSW generated
MSW represents a small but signiﬁcant proportion of total solid waste arisings, accounting 
for about 7% of total solid waste production in Europe (Figures 8.1 and 8.2) and 3% in North
America. When broken down by country, it can be seen that there are regional differences in the
amounts generated per person (Figures 8.3–8.6). Making allowances for the possible differences
between countries in what is included within MSW, Norway and The Netherlands appear to

have the highest per capita generation of MSW in Europe. All Western European countries have
lower generation rates than both Canada and the USA. Eastern European countries have on
average lower generation rates than Western European countries. Developing Asian countries
have lower generation rates than Eastern European countries, while the developed Asian coun-
tries have generation rates similar to that of Western European countries, except for Hong Kong,
which has the highest per capita waste generation rate in the world. This is likely to be related to
its rapidly growing economy and high population density.
Composition of MSW
Data on the generation of MSW are difﬁcult to interpret because of the different deﬁnitions 
used for MSW. National data that breaks down MSW according to the source of the material, 
that is into collected household waste, delivered household waste, commercial waste and insti-
tutional waste are equally hard to obtain. Collected household wastes are normally the best
docu-mented, with poorer data available for delivered household and commercial wastes (see 
Table 8.3).
Complete and up-to-date ﬁgures on this split into MSW sources are essential when planning
an Integrated Waste Management system, since the source of the MSW will determine the col-
lection strategy necessary. Such data may be available in a geographical area, though not con-
solidated into a national ﬁgure. 
Composition of MSW – by materials
Knowledge of the material composition of MSW is essential for effective management and dis-
posal. The composition of MSW by weight, compiled from various sources for a range of
countries is given in Tables 8.4–8.7.

The data are not directly comparable, since most of the ﬁgures relate to MSW, while some relate
speciﬁcally to household waste, which is only one part of MSW in most countries. 
Some of the data also refer to a combination of domestic and commercial waste arisings. There are
clear differences in the composition of collected household waste, delivered household waste and
commercial waste (see Figures 8. 7 and 8.8) so it is important to specify precisely the type of waste
analysed for any data quoted. As with the above data for amounts generated, household waste (and
in particular collected household waste) is the best documented part of MSW in terms of materials
composition. Data for the commercial fraction of MSW are harder to obtain and vary from area to
area. Commercial waste often forms a signiﬁcant part of MSW, however (see Table 8.3) and can
have an important role to play in improving the economics of recovery and recycling operations
(IGD, 1992). There is therefore also a need to understand the amount and material composition of
this portion of MSW within the context of an Integrated Waste Management system.

Carra and Cossu (1990); Christensen (1990).

Despite these differences in the way data have been compiled, some trends in MSW com-
position can be seen from Tables 8.4–8.7. The two major fractions in all countries are
paper/board and food/garden waste. Plastics, glass and metals occur at much lower levels.
There is, however, evidence of geographical variability. Southern European countries (e.g.
Spain, Portugal, Italy) and the developing countries generally have a higher level of food/garden
waste than northern countries (e.g. Finland, Denmark, France, UK, USA and Canada) where
consumption of pre-processed and packaged food is high, whereas paper and board show the
opposite trend (Figure 8.9). The food/garden waste fraction of the waste stream in Asian coun-
tries tends to be even higher than that of the Southern European countries as virtually all of the
food consumed in this region is fresh and unprocessed. The preparation of meals therefore
generates signiﬁcant quantities of organic waste. The ‘Other’ fraction of the waste stream can
be seen to be relatively high in Eastern Europe and Asia. In these cases a signiﬁcant amount of
this fraction is often ash/dust from solid fuel cooking or heating.
Patterns are less easy to detect in the proportion of plastics, glass and metals in MSW,
although there are interesting individual points, such as the high proportion of plastic waste in

contrast, in the developing countries low levels of plastic waste occur in Bangladesh, Mayanmar
(Burma) and Vietnam; low levels of glass in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Vietnam, and low levels of
metals in China, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
Composition of MSW – by chemical analysis
A third valid way to classify MSW is into its constituent chemical elements. Since the solid waste
represents the largest input into the overall solid waste system, the composition of the waste
will determine the majority of the emissions from the overall system. If the chemical composi-
tion of the incoming waste, and of individual fractions, is known, some of the emissions from
waste treatment processes can be predicted (see Figure 8.10). 
This is particularly true for inorganic trace contaminants such as heavy metals (see Table 8.8),
which generally pass unchanged through the waste management process. Consequently, the
total amount released will reﬂect the total input in the waste. Knowing how the heavy metals
enter the waste stream allows efforts to be made either to reduce the levels of these contam-
inants, or to ensure that they are effectively handled.
Two other useful characteristics of waste fractions are their carbon content (which allows
calculation of emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, etc.), and their water content (which
varies markedly between different waste fractions and will affect their caloriﬁc value). 
Variability in MSW generation
When planning an MSW management system for any given region, it is important to have 
relevant and recent data for that region, since waste generation will vary geographically, 
both between and within countries. The composition of commercial waste will clearly vary
according to the nature of local commerce. Also, both the amount and composition of house-
hold waste will vary with population density and housing standards. Rural areas, for example,
are likely to have a greater amount of vegetable, fruit and garden waste than inner city areas
(see Table 8.9). 
Differences have also been measured between areas depending on the type of domestic
heating installed. In former East Germany, for example, areas with domestic open ﬁres burning
brown coal produced up to 190 kg of waste per person per year, whereas areas with central

heating produced up to 260 kg/person/year (Bund, 1992). Differences in waste composition
also occurred, as might be expected, with less paper waste in houses with open ﬁres, but more
ﬁne material, i.e. ash (Table 8.10). 
Even within a given area, there will also be seasonal effects. The composition and amount of
household waste generated will vary especially over holiday periods, and the amount of garden
waste included will clearly vary with the seasons. Thus, while the ﬁgures quoted here will give
a guide to both amounts and composition, they will not always reﬂect local conditions, nor a
particular time of the year.

Effects of source reduction 
The amount and composition of solid waste generated by a region will also be affected by any
attempts to promote source reduction. A form of source reduction that is on the increase is 
the promotion of home composting. A variety of home composting units are commercially
available that are capable of dealing with both garden and kitchen wastes, and some municipal-
ities have offered these to residents in an effort to reduce the amount of such wastes that need
collection and treatment. The Adur Home Composting Scheme (Adur District, West Sussex,
UK) for example, has a district-wide participation rate of 22% (ERRA, 1994). An initial survey
suggested that around 13% of household waste (by volume) could be diverted from the nor-
mal collection system in this way. A similar home composting trial in Luton, UK where 40% of
residents accepted a free composter, showed that the trial area actually produced 11% more
waste during the trial period of 8 months than before the trial started (Wright, 1998). An analy-
sis of the trial areas waste during this period may have enabled the identiﬁcation of the extra
waste being generated. It is likely that the organic fraction being diverted into the composter
was partially replaced by non-biodegradable garden waste (soil and rubble) and the tendency
for people to ﬁll whatever size of bins they are given. 
Since the LCI boundary used in this study is the waste leaving the householder’s property,
home composting is not considered within the waste management system modelled. 
However, it is an effective means of source reduction, and can reduce the amount of 
waste requiring treatment. 
MSW classiﬁcation – the need for standardisation
It is clear from the previous pages that to approach waste management even on just a Euro-
pean scale would require considerable standardisation of terminology. Whilst waste manage-
ment practices will continue to vary from country to country, it is important that lessons from
one area can be disseminated widely and implemented elsewhere. A clear and common
understanding of what is included under the categories household waste (collected and deliv-
ered), commercial waste and MSW is required. 
Standardisation of waste material categories is similarly essential, but more detailed classiﬁca-
tions are also required. The most effective method of dealing with any particular waste item will
depend on what it is made of, so detailed knowledge of the composition of waste is a prereq-
uisite for effective waste management. Whilst the classiﬁcation scheme used in Tables 8.4–8.7
gives useful general trends, there is insufﬁcient detail for waste management purposes. Plastics,
for example, may exist as thin ﬁlms, rigid bottles or as a multitude of other objects. Knowing
that they are made of plastic may give a guide to their suitability for Energy from Waste
schemes, but further knowledge of their form is necessary to determine their suitability for
material recycling. To ﬁll this need, more detailed waste classiﬁcation schemes have been
devised. In the UK, Warren Spring Laboratory have analysed household waste using a 33-cat-
egory classiﬁcation (see Table 8.11). 
Analysis of this kind gives a much more detailed picture of what items are in waste, but it still
does not deﬁne the composition of all items (for example, plastic resin type is not speciﬁed). To
meet this requirement the European Recovery and Recycling Association (ERRA) has proposed

dard, information ﬂow on waste composition will be signiﬁcantly improved. A simpliﬁed version

MSW analysis methods
An integrated approach to waste management clearly requires better waste statistics in the
future. Use of a more detailed and standardised classiﬁcation scheme is only part of the solu-
tion. Standardised and appropriate sampling and analysis techniques are also required. 
Methods for household waste analysis have been developed from techniques originally used
to sample mineral cores (e.g. Poll, 1991). Such methods suffer from two major limitations.
Firstly, MSW is much more heterogeneous in particle size than mineral samples, so different
techniques need to be applied in the taking of samples. Secondly, many sampling procedures
require the use of specialised equipment. The need for widespread sampling at many waste
collection and treatment facilities precludes the routine use of such equipment; simple but
robust sampling techniques are required. In line with this, ERRA proposed a simpliﬁed waste
analysis procedure (ERRA, 1993), which gives guidelines on both the techniques to be used,
and the number of samples required for statistical analysis. 
Sampling methods have been applied mainly to collected household waste rather than the
more bulky and heterogeneous delivered household waste. There is little evidence of system-
atic sampling and analysis of commercial waste, although this tends to be more homogeneous
than household waste.
Information on waste composition also comes from various collection and recovery
schemes (bottle banks, kerbside collection schemes, Material Recovery Facilities). These are
valuable sources of data, but here again there are problems in the interpretation of data due to
lack of standardisation in the terminology. The terms capture rate, recovery rate and recycling
rate can vary widely in their intended meaning. To overcome this, ERRA has also published
proposed deﬁnitions of such ‘programme ratios’ (ERRA, 1992b) to clarify the confusion existing
in many reports.

Summary
This chapter emphasises the importance of the collection operation in Integrated Waste 
Management. It looks at the processes of home sorting and waste collection, from the creation
of waste up to its delivery at a central sorting or treatment site. The characteristics and effec-
tiveness of different collection methods are discussed, including both collection of separated
fractions and the collection of co-mingled materials. The limitations of the common division
into ‘bring’ and ‘kerbside’ schemes when comparing systems are emphasised, as is the need for
effective communication between waste collectors and waste generators. 
Introduction
There are good reasons why collection lies at the very centre of an Integrated Waste Manage-
ment system (see Figure 2.4). The way that waste materials are collected and sorted deter-
mines which waste management options can subsequently be used, and in particular whether
methods such as materials recycling, biological treatment or thermal treatment are feasible with
respect to economic and environmental sustainability. The collection method signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
ences the quality of recovered materials, compost or energy that can be produced; this in turn
determines whether markets can be found. The importance of markets for recovered materi-
als cannot be over-emphasised: in the absence of suitable markets, useful products cannot be
produced. Therefore, either the collection method deﬁnes the subsequent treatment options,
or taking the reverse case, the existing or potential markets will deﬁne how materials should be
collected and sorted if they are to be recovered. In any event, there must be a match between
market need and the materials collected and sorted.
Waste collection is also the contact point between the waste generators (in this case 
households and commercial establishments) and the waste management system, and this 
relationship needs to be carefully managed to ensure an effective system. The householder–
waste collector link needs to be a customer–supplier relationship (in the Total Quality sense
(Oakland, 1989)). The householder needs to have his/her solid waste collected with a mini-
mum of inconvenience, whilst the collector needs to receive the waste in a form compatible
with planned treatment methods. There is clearly a balance to be struck between these 
competing needs; waste management systems that fail to achieve balance in this relationship
are unlikely to succeed.

Collection operations are rarely independent of sorting operations, since the type of collec-
tion will determine the amount of subsequent sorting needed, and some collection methods
themselves involve a level of sorting (e.g. ‘Blue Box’ recovery schemes). This chapter focuses
on the collection process, including any household, kerbside or bank sorting i.e. pre-sorting,
but leaves centralised sorting until Chapter 10.
Home sorting
From the householder’s viewpoint, co-mingled collection of all solid waste together probably
represents the most convenient method, in terms of both time and space requirements. This
collection method will limit, however, the subsequent options for treatment. Most treatment
methods will require some form of separation of the waste into different fractions at source, i.e.
in the home, prior to collection. At its simplest this might involve removing recyclable materi-
als, e.g. glass bottles for delivery to a bottle bank; more extensive sorting involves the separa-
tion of household waste into several different material streams. The degree of home sorting
achieved in any scheme will be a function of both the ability and, especially, the motivation of
householders.
Sorting ability
Several schemes and pilot tests have demonstrated that, given clear guidance, householders
are able to accurately sort their solid waste into different categories. A study carried out in
Leeds, UK, for example, showed that householders could sort their waste into six different cat-
egories with a 96.5% success rate (Forrest et al., 1990). A US study showed a similar result
(Beyea et al., 1992). Clear instructions to the householder are essential for success, to which
end many schemes run extensive communications programmes and publish frequent newslet-
ters.
Sorting motivation
The above sorting experiment in Leeds showed that accurate sorting of household waste is
possible, but participants in the trial were volunteers, and therefore likely to be highly motivat-
ed. Is it realistic to expect that the majority of householders will be similarly motivated? Whilst
the degree of sorting in the Leeds study may be excessive, participation rates in other schemes
with more limited sorting demands suggests that householders can be motivated. 
Participation rates are very difﬁcult to measure, since what people claim that they do, and
what they actually do, are not the same. ERRA deﬁne the participation rate by the number of
waste generators putting out their recyclable materials at least once in a 4-week period (ERRA,
1992b). A range of ERRA schemes report participation rates in voluntary home sorting and col-
lection schemes between 60 and 90% (ERRA, 1993c); in one scheme (Adur, UK) the rate was
measured and found to be 75% (Papworth, 1993). Similar high levels of voluntary participation
are reported from North America; Blue Box schemes in Ontario had measured participation
rates of 85–91% in 1992 (Quinte, 1993) and 80–90% in 1995 (RIS, 1996). 
Where consumer research has been carried out to seek the views of householders the most
frequent comments voiced were that recycling was seen as a good idea, and that it ‘helps the
environment’ (IGD, 1992; RIS, 1996).

Participation rates for voluntary schemes will depend also on the economics. If householders
have to pay for an additional recylables container participation rates will be lower; if households
are offered a cost reduction for having less non-recoverable material in their restwaste bin, par-
ticipation rates are likely to be higher. In some schemes such as Lemsterland in The Nether-
lands, participation is not voluntary, no alternative waste collection is provided. Separation of
certain fractions of the waste at source is required by law in some countries (e.g. separation 
of organic material in The Netherlands). In such cases participation rates are likely to be higher
still.
Overall recovery rates for waste materials depend not only on the number of households
participating, however, but also on the householder’s sorting efﬁciency. The actual amount of
any material recovered from household waste by home sorting can be calculated by:
Amount of material in household waste stream × participation rate × separation efﬁciency
(ERRA, 1993b).
Even if participation is compulsory, motivation is still required to ensure a high level of sort-
ing efﬁciency, see Table 9.1.

Table 9.1 Inﬂuences on material recovery

Motivation, and hence both participation rates and separation efﬁciency, will be inﬂuenced by
factors such as the level of convenience or inconvenience to the householder. Schemes with
extensive home sorting may require too much time or too much space to store the separate
waste streams before collection. Research in North America has shown that co-mingled col-
lection schemes actually increase ﬁnal diversion rates (Skumatz et al., 1998). The frequency of
collection may inﬂuence participation rates, but less frequent collection of recyclables has been
shown not to signiﬁcantly lower the ﬁnal diversion rate of kerbside recycling schemes (Skumatz
et al., 1998). Reliability of collection has been seen to be closely linked to participation rate, a
reduction in participation rate from 68% to 37% in one area of a kerbside collection pro-
gramme in Shefﬁeld, UK was related to an unreliable collection service (ERRA, 1996). Any loss
in comfort level, for example if odour becomes a problem when organic material is not collect-
ed regularly, will lower motivation levels. Housing type also has an effect: data from The
Netherlands suggest that occupants of high-rise buildings are less likely to participate in source
separation programmes than those in suburban areas (see Table 9.2). This may reﬂect a lack of
storage space, but is also likely to be due to lack of social peer pressure in such buildings, as it is
not possible for neighbours to see who is participating i.e. who is environmentally responsible.
Data from Canada (Table 9.8) shows that even after intensive communication campaigns the
amounts of recyclables collected from multi-family high-rise buildings remain signiﬁcantly lower
than that collected from single-family housing in urban, suburban or rural areas.
Levels of environmental awareness vary geographically across Europe and North America,
but overall, there appears to be a willingness on the part of householders to participate in some
type of home sorting. Assessing the prevailing level of motivation in any particular area and
matching the collection scheme to this will achieve the best level of home sorting obtainable
from a given area.
Bring versus kerbside collection systems
Collection methods are often divided into ‘bring’ and ‘kerbside’ collection schemes. ERRA
(1993b) deﬁned bring collection systems as those where ‘householders are required to take
recyclable materials to one of a number of (communal) collection points’. In kerbside collection

schemes, the ‘householder places recoverables in a container/bag which they position, on a
speciﬁc day, outside their property for collection’. Note that collection need not be, literally,
from the kerbside, the key distinguishing point being that in bring systems, the householders
transport the materials from their home, whereas in kerbside collection they are collected 
from the home. In reality however, bring and kerbside are just the two ends of a spectrum of
collection methods (Figure 9.1). The extreme form of bring system is the central collection site,
variously called a Civic Amenity site (UK), Déchétterie (France), or Recyclinghof (Germany), to
which householders transport materials such as bulky items and garden waste. Such sites 
often also have collection containers for recyclable materials such as glass bottles and cans.
Next in the spectrum of bring systems come materials banks at low density (i.e. a high number
of connected inhabitants), often situated locally at supermarkets. As the density of bring 
material containers increases, they become ‘close-to-home’ drop off containers (ERRA,
1993b), to which householders can walk rather than drive. This applies particularly to high-rise
housing, where residents of apartment blocks usually take their waste (and recyclables) to large
communal containers positioned outside the apartment blocks or at the side of the street. This
is essentially a waste container in the street, outside, rather than inside, the property. The only
difference between this ‘bring’ system and a kerbside collection from individual properties is
that the containers are communal, rather than for individual households. 
The term ‘bring system’ clearly includes a range of different schemes. Kerbside collection is
more narrowly deﬁned, but collection can also be of separated fractions or of co-mingled waste.
As a result, blanket comparisons of ‘bring’ versus ‘kerbside’ approaches must be made with cau-
tion. Table 9.3 lists some of the common attributes of these categories. It can be seen that some
attributes, particularly contamination, depend more on whether the material is collected

separated or mixed, than on whether a ‘bring’ or ‘kerbside’ approach is used. Collection sys-
tems will therefore be discussed in the following section according to the materials collected,
rather than whether bring or kerbside systems are involved. 
Household waste has traditionally been collected mixed, but where household sorting has
occurred, the different waste streams are collected separately, whether by the same or different
collection vehicles. The categories collected separately vary by geography: in Germany, for exam-
ple, the Duales System Deutchland (DSD) collects packaging material as a separate stream, where-
as in Japan householders separate out combustible material for separate collection. In Europe and
North America, separate collections are most commonly used for dry recyclables (paper, metal,
glass, plastic), biowaste (kitchen and garden waste, with or without paper) and in some countries,
household hazardous waste (batteries, paint, etc.). A collection for remaining residual waste (known
as restwaste) is also needed. Garden waste and bulky waste may be handled as separate streams,
or alternatively included within the biowaste and restwaste streams, respectively.

Table 9.3 Attributes of ‘bring’ and ‘kerbside’ collection systems

Collection systems 
Dry recyclable materials
This category employs the greatest range of collection methods, from central or low density
materials banks, to kerbside collection of recyclable materials in specially designed trucks.
Single (mono) material banks
Materials banks (‘drop-off’) that collect a single material per container, represent one of the best
known forms of materials collection, mainly due to the success of ‘bottle banks’ for glass. High
levels of glass collection have been achieved using this method, though there is considerable
variation between countries (Table 9.4). A similar pattern of increasing collection rates can be
seen for paper and cardboard, which are often considered as a single material type (Table 9.5).
Other industries (steel and aluminium) have tried to match these successes.
The success of materials banks at low density (high number of connected inhabitants) for
materials recovery is hard to assess. At the country level, the recovery rate can be calculated by
dividing the total amount of material recovered by the national consumption of that material. At
the local level, in contrast, it is not clear what area a bring container covers, and, therefore, the
base amount of material from which the collected material has been recovered. Committed
recyclers, for example, may travel some distance to a bring container, so importing waste from
outside the area considered to be covered by the bring scheme. The best estimates of success
rates will come from relatively isolated communities, which have a saturation density of bring
containers, and the data is best expressed in terms of amounts collected per person, or per
household, rather than percentage recovery rates, since the latter depends on what ﬁgure is
used for the base amount of waste.
In a bring system, the amount collected will depend on the density of banks or containers,
since this will determine how far individuals will have to transport their recyclables to the bank,
and thus their motivation. Differences in bank density probably account for a large amount of the
geographical variation in glass recovery rates in Table 9.4. Lemsterland has one bank of three
containers for every 500 inhabitants; the density for The Netherlands as a whole is around one
bank per 750 inhabitants (Cooper, 1998). Increasing bank density will increase the amount col-
lected, but with diminishing returns, i.e. the extra amount collected will decrease with every
extra bank collected. At a certain point, the additional economic cost and environmental bur-
dens of emptying and servicing banks will outweigh the environmental gains from the collection
of material, though at present there is insufﬁcient evidence to identify this optimal bank density.
A more immediate problem with increasing bank density is ﬁnding suitable sites. At high densi-
ties, small containers on street corners may be suitable, and inhabitants should be able to walk to
these with their recyclable materials. At lower densities with necessarily longer transport dis-
tances, car transport is likely to be used. These banks need to be placed in strategic sites that are
already regularly visited (petrol stations, supermarkets, etc.) so that speciﬁc car journeys to bank
sites are not necessary. Unfortunately, consumer behaviour in using bring systems is another area
in which reliable data are lacking, though of prime importance. Given that the energy saving pos-
sible from the process of recycling glass (transport not included) is approximately 3.5 MJ/kg
(BUWAL, 1998, see Chapter 14), and the fuel consumption of a car is approximately 2.7 MJ per
kilometre (ETSU, 1996), the need to minimise speciﬁc car journeys to materials collection banks
is clear.

Mixed recyclables banks 
Communal ‘bring’ systems have also been used for collection of mixed (co-mingled) recy-
clables from high-rise housing areas, which present special collection problems. This repre-
sents the highest density of bring containers, with the density equalling that of the regular refuse
containers. The dry recyclables collection schemes set up in some such areas have tried to
match the normal refuse collection, with large wheeled bins  (up to 1100 litre) located next to
the refuse containers. 
Kerbside collection
A range of collection methods have been used to collect recyclable material, varying in the
degree of sorting involved, and including boxes, bags and wheeled bins. In its simplest 
form, recyclables are separated by the household and stored together in a bag, box 
or wheeled bin ready for collection. As with the collection of mixed recyclables from 
streetside containers, collection can use existing collection vehicles, in some cases even with
compaction. Co-mingled collection of recyclables, whether from communal kerbside contain-
ers or household bags or bins requires extensive subsequent sorting at a Materials Recovery
Facility (MRF).
The collection method involving the highest level of sorting is probably the ‘Blue Box’ 
system, that has been imported into Europe from North America. Blue Box schemes support-
ed by the European Recovery and Recycling Association (ERRA) have been operating in the 
UK since 1989 (for a review see Birtley, 1996). Householders sort out the targeted materials
and store them in the box, which is put out at the kerbside for collection in a specially adapted
vehicle. At the kerbside the box contents can be sorted by the vehicle operator into several 
different compartments on the vehicle, and the empty box left at the kerbside. Since this is a
positive sort, any unwanted materials can be left in the box and subsequently returned to the
restwaste collection by the householder. This practice further educates the householder as to
what materials are accepted by the recycling programme and should encourage good sorting
efﬁciencies. The material collected in this way has already been sorted, and therefore limited
further sorting is required at a central MRF.
Communication campaigns (using mass-media approaches) have been shown to be impor-
tant in maintaining high levels of participation and low levels of contamination (the set-out of
non-requested material) in kerbside recycling schemes. Such campaigns are necessary to
enable people to participate correctly in all recycling schemes, as illustrated in Table 9.6. Unfor-
tunately, it is common for only a fraction (1–3%) of the total MSW management budget to be
directed towards public communication programmes (Homes, 1996).

Amount of material collected
Reliable data on the performance of single material bank systems across Europe is not widely
available. Lemsterland (NL), using igloo containers, collected 54 kg of glass per household per
year, whilst in Germany, banks at a density of one per 800–1000 individuals reported collecting
18–25 kg of glass and 50–60 kg of paper per person (ORCA, 1992). Glass collection in
Bapaume, France, (a rural area) has been reported as 42 kg per person per year; this was
measured as 80% of all glass in the municipal waste stream (Schauner, 1997). Plastics banks in
Hamburg were reported to collect 0.5–1.5 kg per person per year in 1986 (i.e. prior to the
establishment of the DSD system (Härdtle et al., 1986).

Amounts of recyclables collected in material banks and kerbside collection schemes in the
UK, Canada and Germany are given in Tables 9.7–9.9. 
The total amounts of material collected by a Blue Box scheme in four different areas of
Ontario, Canada are presented in Table 9.8. The ﬁgures show signiﬁcant variation in the
amounts of material set out for collection, depending on housing type.
Contamination levels
The contamination level can be deﬁned as the percentage of non-targeted material that is col-
lected by a given method. This non-targeted material may be: 
1. the wrong material type for that part of the system, e.g. paper in a glass bank
2. the right material but in the wrong form, e.g. plastic ﬁlm in a plastic bottle bank
3. dirty material, e.g. containers with contents still inside
4. non-recyclable material.
The contents of a single-material bank may be bulked and sorted, but normally the collected
material is shipped direct to the processors, and thus effectively leaves the waste management
system as deﬁned in this book. Any contaminants in the bring containers will also, therefore,
leave the waste management system, though they may re-enter it when they are screened out
at a material reprocessing facility. Levels of contamination will vary with the material collected.
In the case of glass for example, it is necessary in many cases to collect this colour-separated to
achieve the highest market prices (particularly in the case of clear glass), so any failure to 
separate clear, brown and green glass where this is requested will constitute contamination.
Additional contamination is likely to come in the form of organics (original container contents),
ceramics and plastics (labels, closures) and metals (caps). Typical levels of contamination in
recovered glass cullet that reaches the reprocessors (mainly via glass bank collection schemes)
is around 5–6% (Ogilvie, 1992). In the case of paper and plastic collection, where it is likely that
only certain types of the material (e.g. newspapers only) are required, contamination may arise
from the public depositing materials not requested. Since the containers are left unattended in
the open, there is also the possibility of contamination by people using the containers to dis-
pose of litter or other waste. As with other collection schemes, clear instructions from the col-
lectors, and a reasonable level of motivation from the public are paramount.

Levels of contamination in mixed material banks and kerbside collection schemes for dry
recyclables show a clear pattern (Figure 9.2). Kerbside box schemes generally have the lowest
contamination levels (5–8%). The open nature of the box allows inspection of the contents
and in some cases a kerbside sort. Any unwanted materials can thus be left in the box, so 
do not enter the recyclables stream. Kerbside inspection and sorting is not possible where co-
mingled recyclables are collected in a bin or bag. Such schemes generally have a higher 
contamination level (27–32%), due to the inclusion of non-targeted materials. The highest
contamination levels (35–56%) have been recorded from co-mingled material banks (i.e. bring
system). These are communal bins; lack of ‘bin ownership’ and perhaps some contamination
from litter probably explain why contamination is higher than in collection of mixed recyclables
from kerbside bins serving individual households.
The composition of the contaminants in the packaging collection bins in the Barcelona
scheme is shown in Table 9.10. The wide range of possible contaminating materials is clearly
shown, underlining the need for effective communication with householders as to what 
materials are required in which container. 
Biowaste and garden waste
Garden waste, if not dealt with at source (e.g. home composting), can be managed by a bring
system at a central collection site. If kept separate, this material can be used as the feedstock for

composting plants, to produce so called ‘greenwaste’ or ‘yardwaste compost’. Alternatively, it
may be collected along with other biowaste, or restwaste, via a kerbside collection.
For biowaste, there are two main collection methods available: kerbside or close-to-home
collection. There has been a strong trend recently in Europe towards the separate collection of
the organic fraction of waste for biological treatment. This trend has been particularly strong in
German-speaking countries, The Netherlands and in some parts of Scandinavia, where
schemes have been in operation since the late 1970s and early 1980s (ORCA, 1991b). In The
Netherlands, for example, legislation has already been passed that requires municipalities to
introduce source-separated collection of biowaste. In the Flemish region of Belgium, com-
postable material is banned from entering landﬁlls or incinerators, and municipalities imple-
mented separate collection of this material by 1996 (OVAM, 1991). In Germany, by 1996,
some 104 communities, servicing 10.9 million people, used ‘Biotonne’ containers for the col-
lection of source-separated biowaste (Würz, 1999), and by 1997 Germany had 520 plants
processing 6 million tonnes of source-separated biowaste (ENDS, 1997). This large increase in
composting of source-separated biowaste was due to a combination of heavy investment in
composting plants and the effect of the introduction of separate collection systems in 1988 (see
Figure 9.3). The pattern of a large increase in compost plant capacity developing after the intro-
duction of separate collection systems for biowaste was also seen to occur in The Netherlands,
between the years 1993 and 1995 (Koopmans, 1997). 
Biowaste deﬁnition
Whilst there has been a clear trend towards the separate collection of biowaste, there has
been less agreement as to what should be included in the biowaste deﬁnition. Narrow deﬁni-
tions include only vegetable, fruit and garden waste (VFG). Collection of garden waste only can
occur, but this is usually done through a central bring system (e.g. at a civic amenity site in the
UK); collection schemes usually involve at least some household organic waste. At the broader
end of the spectrum the biowaste deﬁnition can encompass the VFG material, plus part or all of
the non-recyclable paper fraction. A range of biowaste deﬁnitions used in different schemes is
presented in Table 9.11.

A survey of collection schemes in Germany showed that 40% involved kitchen and garden
waste only, 55% collected kitchen and garden waste, plus soiled paper (e.g. tissues, etc.); the
remaining 5% utilised kitchen and garden waste plus the entire paper fraction (Fricke and 
Vogtmann, 1992). The collection of non-recyclable paper along with the organic fraction as
biowaste for biological treatment has many advantages, including providing structure to the
biowaste, without which the wet biowaste tends to become anaerobic and produce offensive
odours. Including paper in the biowaste also reduces seepage water from the bin, seasonal
variability in the amounts of biowaste collected, production of leachate during composting 
and improves the ﬁnal compost quality (see below). It will also ensure that a larger proportion
of the waste is diverted from ﬁnal disposal (assuming that this dirty paper fraction would 
not otherwise be treated by materials recycling or burning as fuel), provided that the inclusion
of paper does not adversely affect the quality of the ﬁnal compost produced. During 
1998, almost 200,000 tonnes of non-recyclable paper were composted in the USA. 
This included 50,000 tonnes from industrial, commercial and institutional sources, 75,000
tonnes from municipal waste and 73,000 tonnes from garden waste bags (Warmer Bulletin,
1999a).
The advantages of including non-recyclable paper in the deﬁnition of biowaste 
Advantages for collection
1. Reduction of seepage water during storage and transport. Biowaste without paper has a
high moisture content, especially in inner city areas where garden waste is sparse. In the
German inner city of Soln, for example, the biowaste had a total solids content of only 23%
(Doh, 1990). The high water content leads to leakage during storage, collection and trans-

2. Reduction of malodours. Odours are linked to the high moisture content of biowaste. The
biowaste is highly putrescible, and with the high water content will rapidly become anaero-
bic especially in summer months, producing offensive odours. Addition of the paper fraction
will absorb this moisture and so reduce odour generation.

3. Reduction in seasonal variability in amounts collected. Where only kitchen and garden
waste are collected, large seasonal variation will occur in the amount collected. In Germany,
about three times more biowaste is collected in the spring and autumn compared to the
winter (Selle et al., 1988). The quality also varies, being limited to very moist kitchen waste
in winter, but including drier garden waste at other times. Inclusion of paper reduces the
variability in both quantity and quality of biowaste collected (De Wilde et al., 1996).
Advantages for biological treatment (composting)
1. Reduced production of leachate. Biowaste including 20% or more paper can be compost-
ed in windrows without production of leachate (Fricke, 1990; see Chapter 12).
2. Reduced requirement for bulking agents. Biowaste without paper, i.e. with a high moisture
content, requires bulking agents to absorb water and ensure free circulation of air. Other-
wise, anaerobic conditions will occur. Some composting processes require up to 250 kg of
wood chips to be added to every tonne of biowaste (Haskoning, 1991).
3. Improved carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. Addition of non-recyclable paper corrects the C/N
ratio from about 15–20 for biowaste, to 25 or more, which is optimal for biodegradation.
Less ammonia is produced (De Wilde et al., 1996). At the lower C/N ratio the composting
process is slowed down (see Chapter 12), and more odours such as ammonia are released
(Jespersen, 1991).
4. Increased organic content of ﬁnal compost. Biowaste compost in Germany has an organic
content of around 26% of total solids (Selle et al., 1988), whereas in some countries a min-
imum of 30–40% may be required (ORCA, 1991b). Adding paper to the biowaste can
increase the organic content to this level (De Wilde et al., 1996).
5. Reduced salt level of ﬁnal compost. High salt levels (above 2 g of NaCl/litre) found in
biowaste composts can limit their potential usage. Due to a dilution effect, adding paper will
reduce the salt concentration below this critical level (Fricke, 1990).
Overall advantage
Increased diversion rate. Cities focusing on food waste alone in their biowaste will collect only
15–25% of their waste in this fraction. A broader deﬁnition of biowaste to include non-
recyclable paper, paper products and some garden waste can result in the biological treatment
of 40–50% of household solid waste (ORCA, 1991b). A 13-month study of collection and
composting wastepaper with the organic fraction of household waste in a semi-urban area
North of Antwerp, Belgium resulted in a diversion from landﬁll of 46% (De Wilde et al., 1996).
The system operating in Bapaume, France diverts 40% of total household solid waste from
ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll (Schauner, 1997).
Possible disadvantages of including non-recyclable paper in the deﬁnition of
biowaste
Disadvantages for collection 
1. Increased contamination level. A wider biowaste deﬁnition could cause confusion in house-
holds as to what materials are required. This should be overcome by a well-organised and
frequent education and communications programme.
2. Subsequent compost quality: heavy metal levels from inks and other contaminants. The
general heavy metal content of non-recyclable paper and paper products is low, but inks
used in magazines and wrapping paper often use metallic pigments (Rousseaux, 1988),
which will contribute to the heavy metal content of the ﬁnished compost.

Amounts of biowaste collected
The actual amount of biowaste collected in any separate collection scheme will clearly depend
on the amount of organic waste generated (i.e. the potential maximum amount) and the deﬁ-
nition of biowaste applied. Organic waste generation rates vary both between urban and rural
areas (Table 9.12) and seasonally. Given this variability, however, a German Government
Report (1993) suggests that on average, separate collection of biowaste is likely to recover 90
kg of organic material, per person, per year; an average ﬁgure of 80 kg per person per year has
been reported for The Netherlands (Koopmans, 1997).
The wider the deﬁnition of biowaste used, however, the greater the amount of biowaste
likely to be collected. The range of amounts collected for different biowaste deﬁnitions and col-
lection areas in Germany are presented in Table 9.13. Similar overall recovery rates have been
achieved in source-separated collection schemes for organics in the USA. In a scheme run by
the Audubon Society in Fairﬁeld and Greenwich, Connecticut, an average of 6.4 kg of organics
and soiled paper waste was collected per household per week (equivalent to 333 kg/house-
hold/year) (Beyea et al., 1992). Given the higher household waste generation rate for the USA
(in this project 1110 kg/household/year), this meant that biowaste collection was able to divert
30% of the total household waste from landﬁll.
Contamination levels
As with other separate collection systems, contamination of the biowaste with unrequested
materials will occur. The evidence suggests, however, that the contamination level is low (Table
9.13). In Germany and France (biowaste and waste paper), contamination levels are around
5% (Selle et al., 1988; Fricke, 1990; Schauner 1997), consisting mainly of plastic. Less has been
reported elsewhere. Results from The Netherlands show that the sum of glass, metal and plas-
tic contaminants account for less than 1% of the biowaste (Kreuzberg and Reijenga, 1989), and
a similar level has also been reported for the Diepenbeek scheme in Belgium (Rutten, 1991).

Much of the contamination will consist of refuse bags, used to collect the waste and transport it
to the refuse container.
Like the overall amounts collected, the levels of contamination also vary between city and
rural areas and with biowaste deﬁnition. Reports from rural areas of Germany suggest contam-
ination levels of between 2 and 3% while contamination in inner city areas can rise to 7–10%
(ANS, 1999), apparently due to lack of household motivation and effective peer pressure in
high-rise accommodation. Similarly, with a broader deﬁnition for the biowaste, there is scope

for more confusion as to what should be included, leading to an increased level of nuisance
materials (Table 9.13). It should be possible to counter this trend, however, by clear instruc-
tions and an active communications programme to householders.
Along with such ‘nuisance materials’, biowaste will also be contaminated with heavy metals.
This is of particular importance if the biowaste is to be processed into marketable compost,
since heavy metal levels may determine whether the resulting compost is of acceptable quality
(Chapter 12). Typical heavy metal levels for German biowaste and recommended maximum
levels are given in Table 9.14.
Collection methods
Biowaste is generally collected in bins or bags. Bins, either split into compartments or not, have
the advantage that they do not add to the level of plastic contamination that must be removed
at the biological treatment plant (unlike bags), but they may need washing out, especially in hot
weather. A possible disadvantage of using bins, especially large wheeled bins, is that house-
holders are tempted to add their garden waste too, rather than composting it at home. This
can result in an increase in the waste entering the system (Selle et al., 1988; Wright, 1998).
Another method has been to use paper bags, with a moisture barrier, which are biodegradable
in the subsequent composting process. The Audubon scheme in Connecticut cited above suc-
cessfully used such ‘wet bags’ (Beyea et al., 1992), and trials have also been run using bags
made from biodegradable polymers in other parts of the USA (Goldstein, 1993). The main
reasons given in Denmark and Sweden for the adoption of paper bags for household waste
collection are weight and odour reduction (Rand, 1997). The bag enables the contents to
breath, allowing evaporation as the composting process begins. The likelihood of the contents
of a paper bag becoming anaerobic are much less than that if plastic bins or bags are used. The
onset of anaerobic digestion, which is common in wheeled bins and plastic bags, leads to strong
odours, condensation and the production of a noxious black liquor. 
A survey of biowaste collection schemes in Germany reports that most schemes (81%) use
120- or 240-litre wheeled bins, with 2% using 35-litre bins and 9% multi-chambered bins.
Only 7% used bags, evenly split between paper and plastic (Fricke and Vogtmann, 1992).
Collection of biowaste can also require specially modiﬁed vehicles, involving rotating drums,
pneumatic presses or multi-chambered bodies. One of the major problems is the leachate
leaking from the trucks, so in many cases they need to be specially sealed to prevent this. 
Alternatively, collection of some paper with the biowaste can reduce leachate production, as
previously discussed.
Packaging waste
Packaging waste has become the focus of strategic legislation, i.e. rules or guidelines on the
waste management options that can be used to treat at least part of the municipal waste
stream. This is diverting attention from treating the whole municipal waste stream in the most
economically and environmentally sustainable manner. The European Union (EU) Directive on
Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC) adopted in December 1994 requires that Member
States (MS) recover between 50% and 65% of packaging waste arisings. Recovery shall mean
recycling, energy recovery and biological treatment. A minimum of 25% and a maximum of
45% of total packaging waste must be recycled. Within each material type (paper, plastic,
metal, and glass) a minimum of 15% recycling is required (see Figure 9.4). At the time of writ-
Collection Systems 
213

ing, the Packaging Directive is under revision. 
The twin objectives of the Directive were ‘to harmonise national measures concerning the
management of packaging and packaging waste in order, on the one hand, to prevent any
impact thereof on the environment of all Member States as well as of third countries or
to reduce such impact, thus providing a high level of environmental protection, and on the other
hand, to ensure the functioning of the internal market and to avoid obstacles 
to trade and distortion and restriction of competition within the Community’. In brief,
to minimise the environmental impact of packaging waste on EU countries and to avoid the
creation of trade barriers between EU countries. 
Unfortunately this source-orientated (packaging) end-of-life (waste) legislation has resulted in
segregated waste management systems (one system for MSW and another for packaging)
within countries and restrictive fee structures (different packaging materials within segregated
waste management systems are charged at different rates) between countries. 
An analysis of European packaging recovery systems (PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 1999) 
concluded that:
1. exact data on the amount of waste, packaging waste and recycling are hard to get and
ambiguous
2. data on the amount of waste, packaging waste and recycling are not comparable
3. costs of packaging waste management systems vary from country to country and have a dif-
ferent scope
4. the beneﬁts of the Directive on packaging waste management are not clear.
Practical experience is now showing that mandated packaging recovery systems lead to 
segregated waste management systems with their associated high costs and environmental
burdens.
Status of implementation
Theoretically the Member States (MS) of the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) were
obliged to implement this Directive nationally by June 1996. In Summer 1999 this national
implementation can be considered as having been completed in all countries except for

Greece. However, the nationally adopted regulations and the resulting recovery schemes vary
widely with regard to timings and approaches taken. As a consequence there is no coherent
approach towards managing packaging waste throughout the EU. However, the directive has
added momentum to recovery efforts. The total amount of recovered packaging waste in
1997 is estimated to be at minimum 15.5 million tonnes.
The recovery schemes for used packaging differ with regard to funding and coverage of
ongoing costs. They reﬂect the national legislation, which ranges from applying a policy of
Shared Responsibility (of all members of the distribution chain, including consumers and Local
Authorities alike) to the application of an Extended Producer Responsibility policy. 
An example of Extended Producer Responsibility is the German approach that in practice
requires the marketer (packer/ﬁller) to organise and fully ﬁnance the recovery of all used pack-
aging arising at the household level. Shared Responsibility can be seen as represented by the
approach taken in The Netherlands and also by the approach chosen in the UK. In The Nether-
lands, industry is committed to recover/recycle those materials that either have been separately
collected or that have been separated from the waste stream by the local authorities. In The
Netherlands the system works essentially without extra charges or fees. It is anchored in a set of
negotiated covenants concluded between industry and Government. The UK is so far the only
Member State of the European Union applying an essentially market-driven approach (a market
for emission rights) with tradable so-called Packaging Recovery Notes (PRN).
The recovery schemes for used packaging differ in maturity of their operation. The national
schemes in Austria (ARA), Germany (DSD and several smaller ones) and the covenant negoti-
ated approach in The Netherlands have long since reached national coverage. Hence it would
make sense to research cost aspects and environmental beneﬁts of these schemes in order to
close data gaps and to start building a data base for future improvement measures. The
schemes in Belgium (Fost Plus), France (Eco-Emballages and several smaller ones) and Sweden
(REPA) have been operational for several years and are continuously increasing coverage. The
schemes in the remaining countries have become operational more recently or are being set
up during 1999. It is because of this staggered maturity (Figure 9.5) that only limited data on
recovery achievements and operating costs are available.

Figure 9.5 EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive: mandated 
implementation time.

Directive it appears that short implementation times for setting up recovery schemes for used
packaging with national coverage must be considered a cost driver (Draeger, 1997).
Inconsistencies between packaging recovery schemes
Recovery fees (per kg of material) charged by different schemes cover a very broad range and
do not even follow an identical pattern (Figure 9.6). 
Different executions for a 1.5 kg detergent pack further illustrate this inconsistency 
(Figure 9.7). The laminate bag is cheapest in Sweden and most expensive in Austria, whereas
the most expensive execution in Germany is a plastic bag.
The absolute recovery fees for plastic bottles demonstrate the wide range that can occur for
the same package in different countries (see Figure 9.8). The French scheme operates with fees
that are lower by a factor of 30–40 than those of the German and the Austrian schemes,
whereas the Danish scheme and the one in The Netherlands operate without any additional
fee.

Costs of different recovery schemes
Although cost data are not directly comparable, they can serve as indicators. If a recovery scheme
in one country requires three or four times as much in percent of the GNP than a recovery
scheme in another country (Figure 9.9), this may be interpreted as a competitive disadvantage
and suggests that such a scheme is not economically sustainable. It does at least indicate that more
research on cost aspects of packaging and packaging waste recovery systems is needed.
A PriceWaterhouseCoopers study (1999) states the compliance costs for the EU in 1997 to
be at least 5.3 billion euros with a tendency to increase. This appears to be a signiﬁcant cost for
questionable environmental beneﬁts, especially in the light of traditional recycling activities (e.g.
OECD, 1997), which had been implemented already prior to any legislation in the ﬁeld and
which typically generated net revenue. The Danish approach and the one taken in The
Netherlands are both essentially Integrated Waste Management systems where little or no 
specialised packaging recovery occurs.

Results of used packaging recovery schemes
The wide variety of approaches chosen in the EU Member States and the widely varying cost
indicators suggest that further research is needed to identify best practice in this ﬁeld. Howev-
er, legislation that requires source-orientated collection, sorting and recovery or disposal of
products, results in a tendency to develop separate, parallel or segregated waste management
systems. Evidence coming from countries implementing mandated take-back systems for used
packaging have shown this to be the case. Segregated waste systems lose the beneﬁts of
economies of scale, and synergies between different treatment options enjoyed by integrated
systems, so tend to be less efﬁcient, both economically and environmentally (Figure 9.10). A
number of independent reviews of the DSD system in Germany are available (e.g. Staudt,
1997; Axt, 1998; Raymond Communications Inc., 1998; Schmitt-Tegge, 1998; Schroll, 1998;
Scarlett, 1999; Staudt and Schroll, 1999) and they all support these conclusions. Moreover, the
multiplication of parallel systems can confuse the householder and result in reduced sorting efﬁ-
ciency of certain materials (see Chapter 12, Contamination identiﬁed by wastestream analysis
in Lahn-Dill Kreis).
Hazardous materials in household waste – the exception that
proves the rule
Household waste contains hazardous materials such as used motor oil, pesticides and solvent
and paint residues in used cans and bottles. Contaminants such as heavy metals also occur;
they are found in small quantities in a range of household waste items but are mainly con-
centrated into a few items such as used batteries, discarded light bulbs and tubes and mercury
thermometers (see Chapter 8). Normally such materials are included in the residual or rest-
waste collection, but their presence can limit the options available for treating this waste stream.

Figure 9.10 Schematic representation of how segregated systems lead to
inefﬁciencies.

For example, if mixed MSW composting is to be carried out, the operator must be aware that
high heavy metals levels (from batteries, etc.) may prevent the resulting compost being sold as
it would be likely to exceed the legally permissible heavy metal limits. Similarly, the presence of
organic contaminants such as persistent pesticides could result in ground water contamination
if the mixed waste were landﬁlled.
One solution is to separate out the hazardous materials at source, and deal with them 
separately. In the Flanders region of Belgium, 2 million households have been supplied with a
‘KVA box’ (Klein Gevaarlyk Afval – small, dangerous waste) for small hazardous waste items
(ORCA, 1992). As the amount of hazardous waste generated will be small (around 5–10
kg/household/year), this material can be collected separately on an infrequent basis. Alterna-
tively, they can be taken to a central collection site (i.e. a bring system). In Germany, for exam-
ple, there is typically a small container for such waste at each multi-material collection point.
Clearly there can be advantages to separate collection, so long as the extra collection/bring
system can be integrated into the normal collection system, and provided that there are effec-
tive ways of dealing with the hazardous waste once collected. Kerbside collection in various US
cities, for example, has collected 7–18% of the available batteries (Warmer Bulletin, 1993a).
Many current schemes collect small batteries, which have been sorted out of the waste by
householders, but do not have access to appropriate recycling or disposal technology to deal
with them, so are forced to stockpile them. Under existing legislation, at least in the UK, once
these elements of waste are concentrated in this way, they are classiﬁed as a special waste,
which limits the ways they can be stored, handled and treated. 
Bulky waste
This solid waste can make a signiﬁcant contribution, but is generally not included in estimates of
household waste generation (see Chapter 8). In the UK, for example, bulky waste plus garden
waste probably represents around 30% (by weight) of household waste generation (Atkinson
and New, 1993a). Bulky wastes can either be delivered to a central collection site (i.e. a bring
system) or picked up from households using a separate and infrequent collection. Once deliv-
ered to a central site, some bulky objects such as furniture or appliances can be recovered
intact for re-use. Other bulky wastes can be recovered for metal recycling (appliances) and the
residue, if sorted appropriately, can be either incinerated or landﬁlled. There is also the possi-
bility of recovering other materials (e.g. CFCs from refrigerators).
Restwaste
In most traditional systems, this category would contain all of the household waste, collected in a
completely mixed state. Some restwaste can be handled in a bring system in city centre or high-
rise areas, such as in the Sagrada Familia area of Barcelona, where large (2200 litre) streetside
restwaste containers are used (ERRA, 1994b). This system is common in southern Europe, since
it allows daily removal of restwaste. In most areas of northern Europe, however, collection from
each property or kerbside is the norm. Where bring or kerbside collection schemes have been
introduced for dry recyclables, biowaste and/or hazardous household waste, both the amount
and composition of restwaste will be altered. Whatever methods are used for separate collection
of parts of the waste stream, however, there will always be residual waste for collection.
Although the amount collected may be reduced in weight there may be little saving in either
environmental or economic terms compared to the traditional collection of mixed waste. This

is because the same number of properties has to be visited, and so the same distances need to
be driven. The decreased amount collected per household can lead to longer collection
rounds before the collection vehicle needs to be emptied. Such efﬁciency improvements may
lead to some cost saving: a report in the UK suggested marginal savings of around £9 
(5.4 Euro) per tonne in restwaste collection (about 25% of current costs) when recyclables 
are collected in a separate round (DOE/DTI, 1992). An alternative is to reduce the 
frequency of collection, for example to every other week where current collections are week-
ly. This may not be possible, however, in regions where the frequency of waste collection is
ﬁxed by legislation, or where odour problems from the restwaste make regular collections
necessary.
Variable rate pricing systems (pay-as-you-throw)
In communities with variable-rate programmes (also known as pay-as-you-throw or unit pric-
ing), residents are charged for the collection of MSW based on the amount they throw away.
This creates a direct economic incentive to recycle more and to generate less waste. Tradition-
ally, residents pay for solid waste collection through property taxes or a ﬁxed fee, regardless of
how much or how little waste they generate. Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) breaks with tradition
by treating waste services just like electricity, gas, and other utilities. Households pay a variable
rate depending on the amount of service they use. Most communities with PAYT charge resi-
dents a fee for each bag or bin of waste they generate. In a small number of communities, res-
idents are charged based on the weight of their waste. Either way, these programmes are
simple and fair. The less individuals throw away, the less they pay. 
The US Environmental Protection Agency supports this approach to solid waste manage-
ment because it encompasses the three interrelated components that are key to sustainable
solid waste management systems: 
1. Environmental sustainability. Communities with these systems in place have reported signif-
icant increases in recycling and reductions in waste generation, primarily due to the waste
reduction incentive created by PAYT. Less waste and more recycling mean that fewer natu-
ral resources need to be extracted. 
2. Economic sustainability. PAYT is an effective tool for communities struggling to cope with
increasing MSW management costs. Well-designed systems generate the revenues com-
munities need to meet their solid waste costs, including the costs of recycling and compost-
ing. Residents also beneﬁt because within certain limits, they have the opportunity to take
control of their waste bills. 
3. Social equity. One of the most important advantages of a variable-rate programme may be
its inherent fairness. When the cost of waste management is hidden in taxes or charged at a
ﬂat rate, people who recycle and prevent waste subsidise their neighbours’ wastefulness.
Under PAYT, residents pay only for what they throw away.
The following case studies from America describe some of the advantages and disadvantages of
operating a pay-as-you-throw system. For a short summary of Canadian pay-as-you-throw
case studies see Warmer Bulletin (1997a) (see also Chapter 3, Zurich).

Chapter 9: Waste Collection
Elements of IWM

Case study: San Jose, California, USA
Population: 850,000. Community: urban. Program type: four-sort. Program start: July 1993. 
Why pay-as-you-throw? San Jose is the eleventh largest city in the USA; its residents are
among the most educated and afﬂuent in the country and represent a diverse community, with
the two largest minority groups being Latino (27%) and Asian (14%). Before July 1993, San
Jose provided an unlimited weekly waste collection service at a ﬂat monthly rate of $12.50 per
household. Residents set out an average of three 120-litre waste bins per week. The city fully
implemented its Recycle Plus (RP) residential Integrated Waste Management programme for
186,000 single-family dwellings on 1 July, 1993. This programme was designed to permit 
the city to reach its California Integrated Waste Management Act goal of 50% waste reduction
by 2000. The new RP programme resulted from over 3 years of planning, which included
extensive research on all major policy changes. This programme included a fully automated
waste collection system, an aggressive PAYT rate structure, a four-sort recycling system, and 
a contractor payment mechanism, which provided ﬁnancial incentives that encouraged 
contractors to promote recycling. 
Educating the public. The public was involved in the design of the RP programme
through a questionnaire mailed to all 186,000 households, community meetings throughout
the city, pilot projects in 17 neighbourhoods for collection of garden waste and mixed papers,
and the use of a public review committee to select the ﬁrms that would be given 6-year collec-
tion contracts for the collection of waste and recyclables and for recyclables processing. A com-
prehensive public outreach campaign aimed at single-family households explained the new
variable rates being introduced, the new categories of recyclables being added to the services
provided, and the beneﬁts of participating. All materials were produced in three languages
(English, Spanish, and Vietnamese). The campaign was guided by the information received dur-
ing a series of focus groups in the three languages, baseline and follow-up telephone surveys,
and shopping mall intercept surveys. More than 250 community meetings were held in 1993,
and a block leader programme and school education programme were organised. 
Pricing strategy. Residents were offered 120-, 240-, 360- or 480-litre bins with an
‘aggressive’ unit-pricing structure. This structure provided a slight price break for each addition-
al 120 litres of capacity at the 240- and 360-litre level, which the council considered important
to help residents make the transition from ﬂat rate to unit pricing. The council had to ensure
that they had sufﬁcient quantities of wheeled-waste bins in the sizes the residents would
request. A return-reply card was sent to all single-family households in January 1993 with the
estimated charges; this informed residents that no reply would result in delivery of the default
120-litre bin. Staff were able to work out a compromise with the city council, which included
offering one of the most comprehensive low-income rate assistance programmes for waste 
service in the state. Criteria were based solely on household size and income and permitted
eligible residents to receive a 30% discount on their bill. About 3400 households currently 
participate in this programme. 
Managing the programme costs. The challenge faced by the programme is to both
continue and expand its multiple recycling efforts to meet diversion goals, while reducing costs
to close the projected $5 million cost-to-revenue gap in 5 years. The city already has reduced
costs by over $4 million annually through contract renegotiations that resulted in extending the
term of the RP and garden waste collection contracts from June 1999 to June 2002.

Success: Waste reduction and increased recycling. Staff did not anticipate how
quickly residents would change their recycling participation to accommodate the 120-litre size
bin, especially since prior to RP the average set-out was three waste bins. Since RP implemen-
tation, an average of 87% of residents have requested the 120-litre bin size. The difference
between the ‘before and after’ waste set-out volume could readily be found in the quantity of
recyclables collected in the new RP programme. The volume of recyclables and garden waste
being collected more than doubled the levels recorded prior to RP. Most importantly, residents
reported wide satisfaction with the programme and its results (80% in 1993 to 90% in 1996;
ﬁgures are based on a random sample telephone survey).

Case study : Fort Collins, Colorado, USA
Population: 100,000. Community: urban. Program type: variable. Program start: January 1996. 
Why pay-as-you-throw? Fort Collins is located on the Front Range of the Rocky Moun-
tains in Colorado. The population has passed the 100,000 mark, but the community still takes
pride in a small-town image, and residents are determined to manage growth well. 
The city sponsored a recycling drop-off site for nearly 10 years, but without a municipal
waste collection service, increased participation depended on hauliers efforts. A 1991 ordi-
nance required hauliers to provide curbside recycling, but because they included this service at
an additional cost, most customers were unwilling to pay for the service. Construction of a
county recycling centre in 1992 also had little effect on residents’ recycling levels. The city
council adopted goals in 1994 to reduce the total waste stream by 20% by the year 2000,
despite the city’s growth, and to reduce landﬁlled waste by 20%. A speciﬁc target was set for
increasing participation in curbside recycling by 80–90%. Reaching these goals was challenging,
as six private hauliers work in Fort Collins, ranging from corporate operators to locally run fam-
ily operations that have been in business for 40 years.
Disappointed in a slow rate of progress for recycling, the city council adopted two ordi-
nances in May 1995 that apply to single-family and duplex residences. The ﬁrst ordinance called
for hauliers to ‘bundle’ costs for recycling and provide curbside recycling to customers upon
request at no extra charge. It became effective on 12 March, 1995. The second ordinance
called for volume-based rates to be charged for solid waste starting in January 1996. 
Lessons learned
1. Start planning for implementation of the rate structure change at least 6 months in advance.
The local waste authority did not start working with the hauliers (waste transport) until Sep-
tember to implement the system in January. Then, after meeting together several times, the
city agreed to amend the ordinance to respond to hauliers’ concerns about charging strictly
by volume, but this process was time-consuming and difﬁcult. 
2. Make sure to publicise the changes to remind the public and their elected ofﬁcials about
what will occur in the next 2–3 months. Use news articles, advertisements, and hauliers’
billings.
3. Do not underestimate the difﬁculty people will have understanding how new waste collec-
tion rates work, and plan for the extra work it creates for staff. Be prepared for it to take 3,
6, or even 9 months for people to realise that they can save money by generating less waste
with a PAYT system. 
222
Chapter 9: Waste Collection
Elements of IWM

4. Expect private waste hauliers to take the opportunity to increase collection rates at the same
time the volume-based rates take effect. The public assumed the increase in collection rates
was a result of the ordinance. 
5. Ensure the transition between billing systems is smooth, as programme overlap results in
both hauliers and city staff getting phone calls from angry, confused people who receive two
different bills. However, the city was careful to reimburse customers for bins/bags of waste
that they did not generate, as the most important feature of the system is to reward people
with cost savings. 
Success: increased recycling participation. As of July 1996, recycling increased to 79%
participation in single-family and duplex households, up from 53.5% the previous year. Now
the residents of Fort Collins are more conscious of reducing their waste stream, they have
demanded opportunities to recycle new materials, including cardboard, ofﬁce paper, and com-
postable items. The bundling ordinance and PAYT system have signiﬁcantly increased house-
holds’ recycling efforts. Now that the system has been operating for 6 months the city council
is already looking ahead to the feasibility of dividing up Fort Collins into waste collection zones. 
The local waste management authority is anticipating that autumn’s leaf-raking and bagging
will add to peoples’ waste bills and that they are going to demand that the city do something
about it. Fort Collins remains conﬁdent that it made the right choice by adopting their pay-as-
you-throw ordinance.

Integrated collection schemes
Collection is at the centre of an Integrated Waste Management system. An integrated approach
is the key to an effective collection system. The pre-sorting and collection stage needs to 
collect all of the waste, separated into suitable streams for subsequent treatment methods. To
be efﬁcient in both economic and environmental terms, it must do this with the minimal use of
transport, including both collection trucks and householders’ private cars.
An integrated collection system could include any combination of bring systems (materials
banks, close-to-home drop-off centres, central collection sites for garden/bulky waste) and/or
kerbside collections (for recyclables, biowaste and/or restwaste). The key is that all methods
form part of one system with the objective of collecting all the waste materials in suitable
streams for subsequent treatment or disposal with minimum environmental and economic
burdens.
Key lessons on the importance of an integrated collection have come from a variety of collec-
tion schemes. Collection of dry recyclables in Blue Box schemes (e.g. Adur, Shefﬁeld, UK;
Ontario, Canada) in many ways represents an additional, rather than integrated collection system.
A second truck often travels the same route as the residual waste collection vehicle, collecting a
dry recyclables fraction. This additional truck is likely to result in increased collection costs as well
as increased environmental impacts due to the vehicle’s emissions. In most cases, an improve-
ment would be to collect both the recyclables and the restwaste on the same visit. This has been
introduced in Worthing (a neighbouring district to Adur, UK) using a specially designed truck 
Integrated Collection Schemes 
223

that has two compartments for recyclables, plus a normal compaction compartment for the
restwaste. This allows both recyclables and restwaste to be collected on a single visit to each
household. An alternative, which has been developed in the USA (Omaha, Nebraska) is to col-
lect co-mingled recyclables in blue bags, which are loaded along with the bagged rest waste into
the same vehicle compartment, for separation at a sorting facility (Biocycle, 1992). This form of
‘co-collection’ has not been developed to any extent in Europe, however.
With more than three waste fractions, it is difﬁcult to collect all fractions efﬁciently on a single
visit, so an alternating collection schedule is often employed. Lemsterland in The Netherlands
for example, collects four different waste streams – mixed paper, mixed dry recyclables
(excluding glass), organics and restwaste. The materials are stored in two separate wheeled
bins, each with interior partitions (giving four compartments) and then collected by split-com-
partment vehicles on an alternating basis. Leeds (UK) similarly collects three different waste
fractions, with one split-compartment truck and one normal compactor truck visiting properties
in alternate weeks. A range of collection methods and schedules are used for waste collection
in Germany (Table 9.15).
Alternating collections can be effective in collecting several separate fractions of household
waste, without increasing the overall number of visits to each property, so long as it does not
affect the comfort level of the participants. Biowaste collection is one area where this comfort
level is likely to be compromised, since it is necessary to retain frequent collection to prevent
severe odour nuisance during summer or year round in warmer climates. This factor needs to
be considered in the design of effective collection systems. In The Netherlands, for example,
source separation of biowaste is mandatory and biowaste collection is often in alternate weeks
as a result. During hot weather, households are instructed to put their organic waste into the
residual waste, rather than into the biobin, if this is the next bin due for collection. This results
in a loss of organic material from the biowaste stream (hence less compost produced), and a
corresponding increase in the organic material going to landﬁll or incineration (hence a
decreased diversion rate). Alternation of biowaste and restwaste collection is also the most fre-
quently used method in Germany (Table 9.15). There are ways round this problem, however.
Including paper and paper products in the biowaste deﬁnition can result in less odour nuisance
from the bin as described above, or alternatively the schedule can be devised so that biowaste
collection is kept at the previous frequency (e.g. weekly) whilst the dry recyclable and the rest-
waste collections are alternated.
There is a general conﬂict between the needs of sorting and the ease of collection. Treat-
ment methods generally, and materials recycling in particular, require effective separation of the

waste into several streams. To reduce any cross contamination, especially by organic material,
it is best to separate materials as early as possible in the waste management system, i.e. at
source. The number of categories for home sorting is limited, however, by householder ability
and motivation, available storage space and the ability to collect many different waste streams
without increasing the number of collection visits to the property. To keep the total number of
fractions to a manageable level, fractions that can easily be separated by subsequent sorting
(e.g. steel cans, aluminium cans and plastics) should be collected mixed.
The net result of the above conﬂicts is that there is no one best collection system for all
areas. The best and most integrated system for any area will depend on the way the waste
needs to be collected for the local treatment and disposal methods, the composition of the
waste, the type of housing and population density, and the motivation of the residents. Bring
and kerbside collection systems can both be appropriate, for different materials or fractions,
within an integrated collection system. This is clearly demonstrated in Table 9.16, which 
summarises a number of different collection systems in operation in the USA. These collection
systems have been carefully designed to provide an efﬁcient and acceptable collection service
at the local level. Multi-material kerbside collection and biowaste collection either as part of a
kerbside system, a bring system (drop-off) or a combination of both can be seen to result in sig-
niﬁcant diversion from ﬁnal disposal. With respect to the economics of such successful recycling
schemes, a study by the North Carolina Division of Pollution Prevention and Environmental
Assistance in 1997 concluded that ‘the cost-effectiveness of a recycling programme (compared
to solid waste collection and disposal) correlates with local recycling rates; i.e. local govern-
ments that achieve high recycling rates are more likely to operate recycling programs that are
less expensive per ton than solid waste collection and disposal’ (DPPEA, 1997).

Summary
This chapter deals with two distinct types of central sorting: sorting of mixed recyclables at a
Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and the sorting of mixed waste to produce Refuse-Derived
Fuel (RDF). The stages of each sorting process are described, as are the waste inputs and the
outputs in terms of both products and residues. Available data are presented on the typical
energy consumption of the two sorting operations. Economic data, both processing costs and
revenues from the sale of recovered materials, are also included where possible. 
Introduction
Sorting is an important part of any waste’s Life Cycle. Solid waste is almost always mixed, and
household wastes are amongst the most heterogeneous in terms of material composition.
Separation of the different materials in waste, to a greater or lesser extent, is an essential part of
almost all methods of treatment. This sorting can, and does, occur at any point in the Life Cycle
of waste; similarly it can occur any number of times. The earliest sorting will occur in the home,
when, for example, materials are separated from the residual waste stream (Chapter 9), but
the same materials can be sorted further during and/or after collection. Sorting of the input also
represents the ﬁrst stage of many waste treatment processes, such as composting, biogasiﬁca-
tion, and in some cases sorting of the outputs also occurs (e.g. removal of ferrous metal from
incinerator ash residues). Sorting is thus ubiquitous in the Life Cycle of waste, and is covered in
each chapter of this book that deals with a particular waste management process. This chapter
focuses on two particular central sorting operations that are not covered elsewhere – sorting at
a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF), and the sorting of mixed waste to produce Refuse-Derived
Fuel (RDF). 
These two processes are distinct, with different inputs and outputs, so will be described and
discussed separately.
General sorting techniques
This section provides a general review of the most common sorting techniques used in MRFs
and in RDF production.

Manual sorting
The simplest and most widespread separation technique is hand sorting from a raised picking
belt. Manual sorting can occur at the beginning of the process to remove hazardous material
such as gas cylinders and any material that may damage the subsequent mechanical operations
such as heavy wire rope or industrial chain, large blocks of plastic or rubber, large truck tyres
and long or dense rolls of woven material. Manual sorting also takes place after several
mechanical processes have pre-sorted the waste stream to recover items that are best identi-
ﬁed using the human eye. Normally operators remove the materials required from the picking
belt and the remaining unselected materials are discarded as residue. 
Average manual sorting rates for different materials are shown in Table 10.1. The productiv-
ity can be seen to vary widely between different materials handled and highlights the fact that
hand sorting the desired recyclable material is not always the best option. Sometimes it is more
practical to pick the reject material until only the recyclable material remains. From the table it
can be seen that picking paper from a mixture of paper and cardboard results in a sorting rate
of only 12 kg/h. If cardboard were to be picked instead, it could be sorted at 100 kg/h. If the
cardboard represented 10% by weight of ofﬁce waste, then removing it would yield paper at
1000 kg/h. This is a much simpliﬁed example but highlights the importance of designing the
manual sorting system carefully, with respect to the waste input. 
Manual sorting rates are understandably affected by operator tiredness; this in turn depends
on whether the operator is standing or sitting, how far it is to reach the items to be sorted and
how much movement is necessary to deposit recovered items. Hand-sorting operations
should be carried out in daylight. Artiﬁcial lights (especially ﬂuorescent tubes) give off a narrow
spectrum of light and this makes identiﬁcation of materials more difﬁcult. These parameters are
difﬁcult to quantify but must be considered when designing the manual sorting stages of MRFs. 
Manual sorting is clearly labour intensive, but some schemes (e.g. Milton Keynes, UK; Omaha,
Nebraska, USA) use this as an opportunity for job creation, or for training disadvantaged societal
groups. There have been some concerns over health and safety issues surrounding such waste

sorting, and because of this (plus the need to increase efﬁciency), there is a trend towards
increasing the mechanisation of the sorting process, to increase the possible throughput and
sorting efﬁciency.
Mechanical sorting
Bag openers, although not a sorting technology, are often the ﬁrst step in the process where
material (either unsorted waste or mixed recyclables) is delivered to the sorting facility. These
simply tear or cut the collection bags open releasing the contents and allowing them to begin
their journey through the MRF. 
There are three broad categories of mechanical operation:
1. mechanical disassembly, which separates components physically
2. separation by particle properties such as size, shape and mass (this also depends on the 
previous unit operations)
3. separation by material property such as magnetism or colour.
Many of the technologies used in materials recovery are borrowed or adapted from mining
and chemical processing industries. Some of the common unit processes are described 
below.
Screening
Screening is a process of separation by particle size. The most common screen for processing
MSW is the revolving or trommel screen, which is an inclined cylinder with holes in its sides
that is mounted on rollers. The drum rotates at slow speeds (10–15 rpm) using little power.
The material inside the drum tumbles around until it falls through the holes. Reject material
does not pass through the holes while extract material does pass through the holes. This type
of screen is very resistant to clogging, which is why it is more common than inclined or hori-
zontal shaking screens, which are readily blocked by rags and paper. The application of inclined
or horizontal shaking screens is normally limited to cleaner feed materials (Manser and Keeling,
1996).
Air classiﬁcation 
This process is used to separate the light fraction (plastics, paper and aluminium cans) from the
heavy fraction (mostly inorganic material). Light materials are caught in an upward air ﬂow and
carried with the air, while the heavier fraction drops. The light fraction must be separated 
from the air stream and this can be achieved by a cyclone or more simply a box or bag that the
particles drop into, while the air is ﬁltered and vented. In a cyclone the air and solid particles
enter the conical cyclone chamber at a tangent; this sets up a high-speed rotational air move-
ment within the chamber. The solid particles (having a greater mass) move out to the wall of
the chamber, slow down on contact and drop to the bottom under the inﬂuence of gravity.
The clean air exits through a central exhaust pipe (Corbitt, 1989).
Air knife 
An air knife is very similar to an air classiﬁer, except the air is blown horizontally through a ver-
tically dropping feed. The light fraction is carried with the air stream while the heavy fraction
drops through the air stream. This technique often allows for separation into three categories:
General Sorting Techniques 
229
Elements of IWM

light, medium and heavy, depending on the distance the material travels in the air stream. A
system using a number of air knives linked to optical sensors is now being used to sort plastic
bottles into different material types. The air knife is used to blast the bottles off the conveyor
belt into the appropriate collection bunker (Corbitt, 1989).
Sink/ﬂoat separation 
Water (and various other liquids) can be used to remove a heavy fraction from a light fraction as
the heavy material sinks and the light material ﬂoats. The partial sorting of plastics can be achieved
by sink/ﬂotation, as HDPE and PP ﬂoat in water while PET and PVC sink. This simple method is
often used as a last stage of separation after initial grading, shredding and ﬂaking (Stessel, 1996).
Flotation
Flotation is a process that results in selected ﬁne size particles ﬂoating to the surface of a slurry
by means of attached bubbles; the common application is the removal of glass from ceramics
and other contaminants. The key to this process is obviously the selective adhesion of air bub-
bles to the desired material a surface conditioning agent, which preferentially coats glass parti-
cles and makes their surfaces hydrophobic. Aeration causes the glass particles to ﬂoat in the
froth, while the non-glass contaminants sink and are rejected.
A relatively new application of this approach is the separation of different types of plastics. As
most plastics are hydrophobic, their wetting characteristics can be selectively adjusted using
surface conditioning agents. As the wetting characteristics are related to the ease of air bubble
attachment, changing wetting characteristics allows certain plastics to ﬂoat while others 
(even with equal densities) sink. This technique has been shown to be over 98% effective in
commercial operation (Stessel, 1996).
Magnetic separation
The use of the force of a magnetic ﬁeld gradient for the separation of ferrous metals from solid
waste is one of the simplest and most developed material separation process in materials
recovery. For magnetic separation to be effective waste must be processed (screening and
shredding) to free metal from bags or containers and to dislodge attached or trapped non-
metallic contamination, all of which otherwise reduce the efﬁciency of the operation (Stessel,
1996).
Note that the separation of ferrous metals from incinerator residue is often more efﬁcient
than from processed MSW due to the absence of organic contamination. However, oxidation
and alloying of metals and non-metals during the combustion process means that ferrous material
recovered from the incineration process does not meet all industry speciﬁcations. 
Electromagnetic separation 
Eddy current separation uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to separate conductive
non-ferrous metals. By using modulating electromagnetic ﬁelds or the motion of the metal
moving through a number of permanent magnets, eddy currents are generated in conductive
metal particles. These eddy currents interact with the magnetic ﬁeld and cause the metal 
particles to be repelled out of the process stream. Particle size reduction and effective pre-
concentration of materials are necessary for this process to be effective (Vesilind and Rimer,
1989). Electro-magnets, located over the picking belt are used to separate out ferrous material
230
Chapter 10: Central Sorting

in many MRFs (e.g. Dublin, Ireland). Eddy current separators, are also employed in many MRFs
(e.g. Adur, UK). This technique is capable of separately removing both ferrous and aluminium
material from a material stream. This means that both metals and plastic can be collected co-
mingled and the three streams separated mechanically (plastic being the residue stream) at up
to 5 tonnes per hour (Newell Engineering Ltd, 1993).
Electrostatic separation
Charged particles under the inﬂuence of electrostatic forces obey the laws of attraction and
repulsion similar to those of permanent magnets. Electrostatic separators use an electric ﬁeld
generated by electrodes above a stream of particles as they ﬂow onto a grounded metallic
drum. The non-conductors (glass and organics) hold a static charge long enough to be attract-
ed and held to the drum; conductors (metals) loose their charge quickly and are repelled from
the drum and therefore separated (Vesilind and Rimer, 1989).
Feedstock for electrostatic separation require even more pre-processing than feedstock for
electromagnetic separation. Here particle size must be small (<25 mm), the material must be
dry and the level of paper kept to a minimum to avoid interference with the process. Due to
these operating restrictions the actual application of electrostatic separators has been limited
(Corbitt, 1998).
Detect and route systems 
Detect and route systems separate the identiﬁcation of a material from the ﬁnal routing of that
material into two operations. This approach depends on an array of sensors (visible light spec-
trophotometry, ultra violet, infra red and X-ray) acting upon individual objects. Therefore
objects must pass each sensor separately, which is achieved by the conﬁguration of the waste
conveying system. Once the material has been identiﬁed air knives blow each object into the
appropriate material collection bin (Corbitt, 1998). Coloured glass separation is possible using
visible light spectrophotometry (Lewis and Newell, 1992), as is coloured plastic separation,
while clear plastic separation (un-pigmented polymers, clear PET to translucent HDPE) is pos-
sible using near infra-red sensors. Opaque plastics need to be separated using X-ray sensors,
although these are considerably more expensive than the other sensor types described.
Appropriate conﬁgurations of visible light, ultra-violet and near infra-red sensors are able to efﬁ-
ciently sort most plastic streams. 
The separation of plastic resin types is difﬁcult due to the number of resins in common use.
PVC can be separated from other plastic bottles using X-ray ﬂuorescence to detect the chlorine
atoms in PVC; polypropylene can be separated from clear HDPE, and coloured HDPE can be
sorted into different colours by means of colour sensors. Recent technology for plastic sorting
has mostly been focused on near infra-red (NIR) sensors linked to an air knife system. The iden-
tiﬁcation speed of a NIR system often exceeds the speed with which the bottles can be proces-
sed to pass the sensor one at a time (Corbitt, 1998). It is claimed that this technique can operate
at 20 bottles per second, carrying out 1000 spectral scans per second (Rhoe, 1998). NIR sys-
tems cannot reliably identify black plastics due to the infrared radiation being absorbed by the
carbon ﬁller. Fortunately this is not a major problem associated with current plastic bottle waste. 
Together, an automated plastic bottle sorter can be assembled capable of handling up to 2
tonnes per hour (Magnetic Separations Systems Inc., 1995), but such systems are still not
widely installed in MRFs on a global basis.
General Sorting Techniques 
231
Elements of IWM

Roll crushing 
This process is used in material recovery operations to grind brittle materials such as glass and
ﬂatten malleable materials such as metal cans and plastic bottles. This allows for subsequent
separation by screening. Roll crushers were ﬁrst employed for the reclamation of materials
from incinerator residue and more recently are being used to process source separated recy-
clables, mainly glass containers and aluminium and steel cans. Once crushed this mixture can
be sorted using screens and magnets, the material remaining being aluminium cans (Vesilind
and Rimer, 1989).
Shredding
The ﬁrst applications of shredders to MSW were aimed at improving ﬁnal disposal, not facilitat-
ing materials recovery. Shredding breaks material into a homogenous mixture of uniform parti-
cle size. This results in volume reduction as large voids are removed, reduced odour as the
material stays aerobic, and reduced litter problems as small pieces are not caught by the wind.
Shredding MSW reduces the landﬁll volume required as shredded refuse compacts better
within a landﬁll, and the total amount of daily cover (earth or rubble) is reduced, therefore
shredding MSW becomes attractive for landﬁll sites where daily cover must be purchased.
Leachate from shredded refuse is often produced more rapidly and is more concentrated than
leachate from unprocessed MSW. Therefore when landﬁlling shredded waste, leachate collec-
tion and treatment systems are necessary (Vesilind and Rimer, 1989).
Shredded material is easier to handle than unprocessed material and this facilitates the ident-
iﬁcation and extraction of different fractions. Shredded waste also burns more readily, increasing
its value as a fuel. Shredders are more often employed in MRFs that accept unsorted MSW,
rather than facilities that accept co-mingled recyclable materials (Vesilind and Rimer, 1989).
Baling
Although a compression process, not a sorting technology, baling of sorted materials (paper,
metal cans and plastic bottles) and MRF residues is a useful volume reduction technique. A bale
is a predictable product that is easy to handle, an advantage when transporting recycled materials
to reprocessing facilities or transporting residue materials to incinerators or landﬁll. Baled
residues are less prone to methane generation, generally do not support combustion and pro-
duce less concentrated leachate (Corbitt, 1998).
The ﬁnal disposal of baled solid waste (and MRF residues) is an easier materials handling
exercise than uncompressed solid waste. Many operators of baleﬁlls claim that baling results in
a more economical operation overall. Depending upon the original solid waste material, a
baleﬁll may require approximately 10% of the void space necessary to landﬁll the same amount
of material using conventional landﬁll practices (Corbitt, 1998).
Central sorting at a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF)
The aim of MRFs is to separate materials that have enough value to make their recovery
worthwhile. MRFs are relatively inexpensive when compared to most other waste treatment
processes (e.g. incineration) and it is technically feasible to recover almost any fraction of the
waste stream either manually or mechanically. Unfortunately this has often encouraged an
approach where many materials are recycled because they can be recycled, not because it is
232
Chapter 10: Central Sorting
Elements of IWM

environmentally or economically beneﬁcial. There is little beneﬁt to be gained from recycling
materials that have no value. The economic costs and environmental burdens associated with
such practices undermine the sustainability of the whole waste management system as the
advantages of recovering and recycling a valuable material are often negated by the burdens of
recovering and recycling a valueless one. 
MRFs can be designed to accept and process unsorted household waste or co-mingled recy-
clables. The exact processing conﬁguration of each facility depends on the input and the markets
that exist for each recovered material. Thus, as emphasised in the previous chapter, there is a need
to start by considering the end markets along with the waste stream composition, and then to
design collection and sorting systems together to produce the materials that these markets require.
Not surprisingly, therefore, there is no standard MRF operation. While some collection
schemes deliver unsorted waste to a MRF, others deliver all recyclables to the MRF in a mixed
state, and other schemes will have already separated some recyclable materials out by this stage. 
Blue box schemes, such as Adur and Shefﬁeld (UK), usually involve a kerbside sort that sep-
arates out paper and glass (colour separated). Although such materials may need to be bulked
up before sale and onward transport, no further sorting is necessary. Where materials such as
glass are collected via glass banks, there may be no need to process it at a MRF at all, since it
can be transported on to the materials processors directly. 
Thus MRFs may process unsorted MSW, all dry recyclable materials, or just a restricted
range of recyclable materials. Since the number of different fractions that can be collected sep-
arately is limited by practical considerations (Chapter 9), it is likely that at least some recyclables,
in particular plastics, aluminium cans and steel cans, will be collected in a co-mingled fraction,
for subsequent central sorting. The mechanical unit operations employed by a MRF will there-
fore depend on the process input and the desired ﬁnal outputs.
Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) design
MRF design depends on process input (based upon the collection system), the desired process
output (based upon the available material markets), the degree of mechanisation, the recovery
efﬁciency of both manual and mechanical sorting processes and the economic viability of the
whole process.
The material recovery efﬁciencies of several of the common separation techniques
described above are presented in Table 10.2 and schematic diagrams of a simple MRF and an
automated MRF are also presented in Figures 10.1 and 10.2.

Advances in MRF technology 
Single-stream processing of dry recyclables
Single-stream processing of co-mingled recyclables commonly requires a high level of manual
sorting (see Box 10.1). As this is relatively costly in developed countries, few MRFs operate in
such a way. Recently MRFs in California and Ohio have begun to use mechanical processes to
separate a single ﬂow of materials into paper, mixed glass, metal containers and glass containers
(Egosi and Weinberg, 1998). The system still requires manual pre-sorting of large items (main-
ly cardboard) and non-recyclable items (mainly plastic ﬁlm). In each facility the cost savings out-
weigh the additional processing costs of both labour and equipment. 
The beneﬁts of this single-stream processing are easy sorting instructions for residents,
which results in increased diversion rates and no special collection trucks being required; rear-
loading single-pass garbage and recycling trucks achieve more pick ups per hour.
The disadvantages of the system are that it collects both more recyclable and more 
non-recyclable material, due to incorrect sorting, resulting in an increase in the cost of residue
disposal. This problem can be somewhat mitigated by more frequent education campaigns.
Integrated waste processing
Some MRFs are now being designed not only to separate waste materials but also to produce
and market raw materials ready for manufacturing processes. A 600,000 tonne/year facility in
Crisp County, Georgia, USA, has been designed to produce separated green and clear PET,
natural and mixed HDPE, ferrous and non-ferrous metal, newsprint, corrugated board, glass
and compost (Fickes, 1998). All of these materials, with the exception of the metals will be
ready for use by reprocessors (materials) and farmers or gardeners (compost).

Box 10.1 Europe’s largest co-mingled recyclables MRF.

The system operates two lines and begins with two bag openers, each able to open 65
tonnes of bags per hour. These feed two large trommel screens at the beginning of the separa-
tion process. Two low speed shredders are used to reduce the material to a size that ensures
optimum operation of the plastics separator, which uses optical sensors and X-ray emitters to
distinguish both coloured material and different polymer types and send speciﬁc materials to
one of ﬁve processing lines. Each processing line feeds its material into a grinder that produces
plastic ﬂake, which is washed in ﬂoat/sink tanks to remove labels and adhesive. The ﬂakes are
further separated by polymer type in the ﬂoat/sink tanks based on the material’s speciﬁc gravi-
ty. After drying, the clean ﬂake plastic can be used as a raw material and is considerably more
valuable than unprocessed recovered plastics. 
The facility also operates an aggregate-separating system that removes rocks, stones, broken
glass, coins, batteries and material <6 mm in diameter. This material is added to the rest of the
process residues stream, which is baled and sent to an on-site baleﬁll. Leftover organic material
and unrecoverable paper ﬂow into a mixing drum before being added to the source separated
organic material for composting. Essentially, the majority of the end markets for each material
produced by the MRF have been addressed by the design of the facility.
Sorting of mixed waste for Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF)
Solid waste has been used to produce steam and electricity since around the beginning of the
1900s. The caloriﬁc value of most solid wastes is between one-quarter and one-half that of
coal. The exact caloriﬁc value of most solid wastes is a function of the carbon content of the
material. The ash content is generally low, between 20–40%. The amount of moisture in solid
waste is highly variable and can be signiﬁcantly changed due to processing, handling and storage
(Manser and Keeling, 1996).
A wide range of MSW compositions can be burned without auxiliary fuel. However, since
water and non-combustible material do not contribute to the caloriﬁc value of the waste, pro-
cessing waste to minimise their moisture content and reduce their ash content can signiﬁcantly
enhance fuel quality and improves combustion efﬁciency. 
Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) is produced by mechanically separating the combustible fraction
from the non-combustible fraction of solid waste. The combustible fraction is then shredded,
and may also be pelletised. RDF production thus forms part of a thermal treatment system,
which aims to valorise part of the waste stream by recovering its energy content. The second
stage, RDF combustion, can either occur on the same site, or the RDF can be transported for
combustion elsewhere. In this book, production and combustion of RDF, even if they occur on
the same site, will be treated separately. Since RDF production is a central sorting process, it
will be discussed in this chapter. RDF combustion will be considered alongside other thermal
treatment processes in Chapter 12. 
A further reason for considering RDF sorting separately from thermal treatment is that the
process need not only produce solid fuel; it can also produce an organic fraction, which can
form the feedstock for biological treatment. As a result, in some cases, the RDF sorting process
occurs in combination with a biological treatment process (e.g. at Novaro in Italy (ETSU,
1993)). Again, although the RDF sort may occur on the same site as biological treatment, it is
considered here as a separate process.

There are two basic RDF processes, each producing a distinctive product, known as densi-
ﬁed RDF (dRDF) and coarse RDF (cRDF) (also referred to as ﬂuff or ﬂoc), respectively.
dRDF is produced as pellets, often similar in size and shape to wine corks. Prior to pelletising
it is dried, so is relatively stable and can be transported, handled and stored like other solid
fuels. It can either be burned alone, or co-ﬁred with coal or other solid fuels.

dRDF requires considerable processing, including drying and pelletising, and so has a rela-
tively high processing energy requirement. As a result there has recently been interest in the
alternative coarse RDF (cRDF). This comes in the form of a coarsely shredded product, that
has been compared in appearance to ‘the ﬂuff from a vacuum cleaner’ (Warmer Bulletin,
1993b). cRDF requires less processing, but as it has not been dried, cannot be stored for long
periods. It is suitable for immediate use in on-site combustion for power generation and/or
local heating. Depending on the level of processing, it can be suitable for combustion on con-
ventional grates or in ﬂuidised bed systems (ETSU, 1992); for more information on these com-
bustion technologies see Chapter 12.
Status of RDF 
The early development of RDF technology occurred mainly in the UK and to some extent in
Italy, with plants built from the mid-1970s onward. Many of the early plants have since closed
down, however, often due to difﬁculty ﬁnding markets for the dRDF fuel product. Lack of off-
site markets has also led to the development of cRDF technology for on-site power genera-
tion. The current extent of RDF processing in Europe and elsewhere is shown in Table 10.3.
A simple rule for RDF systems is that rigorous waste processing results in a high-quality ﬁnal
fuel. This has been well proven by the Robbins Resource Recovery Facility Illinois, USA (APC,
1998). This facility receives 1600 tonnes of MSW per day from surrounding communities,
which is processed to separate out aluminium, ferrous material, glass and compostable material.
This recyclable material (25% of the incoming MSW) is sold to local recycling companies. The
remaining material (75%) is shredded to form cRDF and burned in two circulating ﬂuidised bed
boilers to produce electricity (Studley and Moyer, 1997). The combination of efﬁcient waste

processing (Figure 10.3), high efﬁciency combustion boilers and state-of-the-art air pollution
control devices has resulted in the facility achieving high material recovery rates, superior energy
recovery efﬁciencies and low ash generation (APC, 1998). 
RDF sorting processes
Details of the processing line in different RDF plants vary, but the basic dRDF process can be
broken down into ﬁve distinct stages (ETSU, 1993). As shown in Figure 10.4, the production of
cRDF is a simpler process (see also Figure 10.3), which omits either one or two of these
stages.
Waste reception and storage 
Mixed waste is delivered by the collection vehicles and tipped into a hopper or onto a tipping
ﬂoor, where any unwanted ‘rogue’ items (e.g. car engines, logs, etc.) can be removed. This ini-
tial short-term storage stage acts as a buffer to provide the RDF production process with a
steady feedstock level.
Waste liberation and screening 
These processes free the waste from any refuse bags or containers, and provide the main
fuel/non-fuel sort. Bag opening can involve the use of ﬂail mills, shredders, spikes or ripping
devices, though experience has shown that non-shredding devices have the advantage of not
shredding or mixing the waste excessively, which can make separation more difﬁcult. 
Screening often involves a drum or rotary screen, which performs three functions. It com-
pletes the bag-emptying process, it removes the undersize (ﬁnes) fractions, and it separates the
oversize (>500 mm) material from the fuel fraction. The ﬁnes fraction contains the high mois-
ture content organic/putrescible material, as well as ash, dust and broken glass. The oversize
fraction consists mainly of large pieces of paper, board and plastic ﬁlm, and is usually landﬁlled
along with other residues.

The remaining fraction produced by this stage can be used as a crude cRDF, (cRDF type A,
ETSU, 1992) though it will still contain metals and other non-combustible materials.
Fuel reﬁning 
Fuel reﬁning involves size reduction, classiﬁcation and magnetic separation. Size reduction using
a shredder or hammer mill aids the separation into light and dense fractions. The density sepa-
ration (classiﬁcation) stage is necessary to separate the heavy fraction (metals, dense plastics)
from the combustible light fraction (paper, plastic ﬁlm), which will go on to form the dRDF
product. Two main methods can be used to achieve this: air classiﬁcation and ballistic separa-
tion, which rely on the behaviour of the object in an air stream and their ‘bouncing behaviour’,
respectively. Magnetic separation can then be performed on the heavy fraction to remove both
ferrous metal and in some plants also aluminium (by eddy current separation). 
The light fraction, together with the remains of the magnetically sorted heavy fraction, can
be used as a more reﬁned form of cRDF (cRDF Type B; ETSU, 1992). 
Fuel preparation 
This stage represents the main difference between the cRDF and the dRDF processes. It
involves the conversion of the fuel rich fraction (ﬂoc) into a dry, dense pellet form by re-shredding,
drying, and then pelletising. Secondary shredding is needed to reduce the particle size of the
fuel fraction to the size needed for the pelletising operation, and drying reduces the moisture
content from about 30% to around 12%. Low moisture levels are needed for good storage
and combustion characteristics. The dryers used are basic pneumatic conveying systems that
operate on hot combustion gas from natural gas burners. 
Once the combustible fraction is dry, organic and inert residues can easily be screened out,
reducing the ash content of the product. Most of the chlorine, heavy metals and silicates in the
product is contained within this inert residue. After this stage dRDF can be produced with a
ﬁnal ash content of 10% by weight and chlorine levels of 0.5%. In the absence of inert con-
taminants such as silicate, the caloriﬁc value of the material increases signiﬁcantly. 
dRDF can either take the form of pellets or briquettes, though most plants use a pellet mill
to densify the product. Pellet mills are very energy intensive, consuming over 35 kWh per
tonne of fuel produced, so the fuel needs to be cooled prior to storage, to remove the heat
produced on compression. Pellet mills are also prone to damage from dense contaminants left
in the fuel fraction, so that a further magnetic extraction stage and a ballistic separator are often
used to remove both ferrous metal and other dense materials prior to the ﬁnal pelletising stage.
Fuel storage and quality control 
Once dried and in pellet form, dRDF can be stored before use; cRDF, in contrast, needs to be
burned soon after production.

Summary
Biological treatment can be used to treat both the organic and non-recyclable paper fractions of
solid waste. Biological treatment can be separated into two distinct processes – aerobic and
anaerobic treatment – and therefore two main treatment types exist: composting (aerobic) 
and biogasiﬁcation (anaerobic). Either can be used as a pre-treatment to reduce the volume
and stabilise material for disposal in landﬁlls or as a way to produce valuable products, such as
compost and (from biogasiﬁcation) biogas plus compost, from the waste stream. The inputs
and outputs of each process are discussed, using available data. Further development of bio-
logical treatment depends on the further development of markets, and agreed standards, for
the compost products.
Introduction
Biological treatment involves using naturally occurring micro-organisms to decompose the
biodegradable components of waste. Aerobic organisms require molecular oxygen to use as 
an external electron acceptor in respiratory metabolism; this results in rapid growth rates 
and high cell yields. Anaerobic metabolism occurs in the absence of oxygen and does not
involve an external electron acceptor. This fermentative metabolism is a less effective energy-
producing process than aerobic respiration and therefore results in lower growth rates and cell
yields.
If left to go to completion, biological processes result in the production of gases (mainly car-
bon dioxide and water vapour from aerobic processes and carbon dioxide and methane from
anaerobic processes) plus a mineralised residue. Normally the process is interrupted when the
residue still contains organic material, though in a more stable form, comprising a compost-like
material.
The garden compost heap is the simplest form of biological treatment. With some care and
regular turning (aeration), this can transform vegetable scraps and garden refuse into a rich and
useful garden compost. Compost heaps that are not turned regularly become anaerobic in the
middle of the heap and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This negates any beneﬁt
that composting has on the overall waste management system. Garden compost heaps can be
a valuable method for treating part of the household waste at source, but are limited to 
more rural and suburban areas where space and gardens are plentiful. The alternative 
method to treat organic waste not composted at source (in particular from urban areas),
involves centralised biological treatment plants.

Almost any organic material can be treated biologically. It is particularly suitable for many
industrial wastes from such sources as breweries, fruit and vegetable producers and proces-
sors, slaughter-houses and meat processors, dairy producers and processors, paper mills,
sugar mills, and leather, wool and textile producers (Bundesamtes für Energiewirtschaft, 1991).
At the local community level, it is widely used to treat sewage sludges and organic wastes from
parks and gardens.
Household waste is also rich in organic material, consisting of kitchen and garden waste.
According to geography, this accounts for between 25% and 60% of MSW by weight (Chapter
8), with levels of organics particularly high in southern Europe and most developing countries.
If one adds to this the non-recyclable paper fraction, which is also of organic origin and suitable
for biological treatment, some 50–85% of MSW can be treated by such methods. Compost-
ing of biowaste and the non-recyclable paper fraction has been shown to have no negative
effect on paper recycling schemes, the composting process or compost quality (Boelens et al.,
1996). It has also been shown to have the potential to reduce the UK’s total methane emis-
sions by up to 3%, if all biowaste and non-recyclable paper fractions of MSW were to be
source separated and composted (Hindle and McDougall, 1997). 
The suitability of biological treatment for wet organic material contrasts markedly with other
treatment methods, such as incineration and landﬁlling, where the high water content and
putrescible nature of such material can cause problems, by reducing overall caloriﬁc value and
increasing the production of leachate and landﬁll gas. This potential of biological treatment is
being exploited in some countries, but almost ignored in others.

Numerous variants of biological treatment exist, differing according to the feedstock used
(Table 11.1) and the process employed. Feedstocks range from highly mixed wastes, e.g.
MSW, which require extensive treatment to remove the non-organic fractions prior to, or
occasionally after, biological processing, to the separately collected and more narrowly deﬁned
Biowaste, VFG (Vegetable, Fruit and Garden) and green wastes.
Although there are many different types of biological treatment facilities available, there are
two basic processes: aerobic and anaerobic treatment. In aerobic treatment, usually known as
composting, organic material decomposes in the presence of oxygen to produce mainly car-
bon dioxide, water and compost. Considerable energy is released during the process, which is
most often lost to the surroundings. Anaerobic processes are variously described as anaerobic
fermentation, anaerobic digestion or biogasiﬁcation. Throughout this chapter the term biogasi-
ﬁcation will be used. As the name implies this produces biogas, a useful product consisting
mainly of methane and carbon dioxide, plus an organic residue which can be stabilised to pro-
duce compost, but differs somewhat from aerobically produced composts.
Biological treatment objectives
Both composting and biogasiﬁcation can fulﬁl several functions, and it is necessary to identify the
key objective(s) required of the process. They can either be considered as pre-treatments for
ultimate disposal of a stabilised material (normally in a landﬁll) or as a treatment method.
Pre-treatment for disposal
Volume reduction
Breakdown into methane and/or carbon dioxide and water can result in the decomposition of
up to 75% of the organic material on a dry weight basis (Bundesamtes für Energiewirtschaft,
1991). From wet biowaste to compost the weight loss is approximately 50%. As organics and
paper represent the two largest fractions of the household waste stream this is a signiﬁcant
reduction. Additionally there is considerable loss of water, either by evaporation (in compost-
ing) or by pressing of the residue (biogasiﬁcation). The moisture content of the organic fraction
of household waste is between 60–70% (De Baere, 1999), whilst for compost made from
biowaste it is around 30–40% (Fricke and Vogtmann, 1992) and for material from biogasiﬁca-
tion 25–45% (Six and De Baere, 1988; De Baere, 1993). The breakdown and moisture loss
together result in a marked volume reduction in material for further treatment and disposal.
Removal of water will also reduce the formation of leachate if the residues are subsequently
landﬁlled.
Stabilisation
As a result of the decomposition processes that occur during biological treatment, the output
materials are more stable than the original organic inputs, and thus more suitable for ﬁnal dis-
posal in a landﬁll. The cumulative oxygen demand of the organic material, a measure of biolog-
ical activity and thus inversely related to stability, can decrease by a factor of six during biological
treatment (Table 11.2). Similarly, the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, which gives a measure of the
maturity of a compost (high C/N ratio indicates fresh organic material, low C/N ratio indicates
mature, stable material), falls markedly during biological treatment processes.

Sterilisation
Both composting and biogasiﬁcation are effective in destroying the majority of pathogens pres-
ent in the feedstock. Composting is a strongly exothermic process, and temperatures of
60–65oC are built up and maintained in composting piles or vessels over an extended period
of time, sufﬁcient to ensure the destruction of most pathogens and seeds (Table 11.3). Biogasi-
ﬁcation processes are only mildly exothermic, but may be operated at temperatures of 55oC
(thermophilic process) by the addition of heat. The combination of this temperature and anaer-
obic conditions is sufﬁcient to destroy most pathogens (Table 11.2), though if lower process
temperatures are used (mesophilic process), further heat treatment during the ﬁnal aerobic sta-
bilisation stage may be required to produce sanitary residues.
Valorisation
In contrast to the above, the main objective of most biological treatment is to produce useful
products (biogas/energy, compost) from organic waste, i.e. to valorise part of the waste
stream. An extensive range of organic materials have been studied with respect to their
methane-forming potential under anaerobic conditions (Gunaseelan, 1997). 
Biogas production
Biogasiﬁcation produces a ﬂammable gas with a caloriﬁc value of around 6–8 kWh (21.6–28.8
MJ) per cubic metre (German Government report, 1993), which can be sold as gas, or burned
on-site in gas-engine generators to produce electricity. Some of the biogas will be burned to
provide process heating on site, and some electricity will be consumed, but there can be a net
export of either gas or electrical power from the plant. There will normally be a market for this
product, at least for the electricity. As the gas can be stored between production and use for
power generation, electricity export into the national grid can be timed to coincide with peak
consumption times, and thus highest energy prices. This economic advantage is increased fur-
ther in countries where additional premium prices are paid for electricity generated from non-
fossil fuel sources (e.g. under the UK Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) scheme).
Compost production
Both composting and biogasiﬁcation produce a partly stabilised organic material that may be
used as a compost, soil-improver, fertiliser, ﬁller, ﬁlter material or for decontaminating polluted
soils (Ernst, 1990). Alternatively the material can be considered as a residue and landﬁlled. The
only point that determines whether the material is a useful product, and hence of value, or a
residue to be disposed of at a cost, is the presence of a market. 
Markets for compost differ widely across Europe. In southern Europe, the lack of organic
matter in the soil creates a large need for additional organic material. There is therefore a
strong market for compost made from any feedstock, provided that the compost is safe for
use, even though the level of contamination may be high. The same compost, if produced in
Holland or Germany, however, would be considered only for landﬁll cover material or as a
residue for disposal. As it would not meet the relevant quality guide-lines, there would be no
market for such a product, though markets do exist for higher quality composts. Since the main
determinants of compost quality are the composition of the feedstock (Fricke and Vogtmann,
1992) and the process used, production of compost for sale in such countries may require the
use of restricted feedstocks involving separate collection (biowaste, either with or without

paper; VFG; green waste), or the use of more sophisticated processing techniques. There is a
grey area, however, around the distinction between product and residue, as in many cases,
waste-derived compost is freely distributed. 
The need to deﬁne the objective of any biological treatment process bears repeating. If the
aim is to produce a quality compost for sale, then a restricted input (e.g. VFG, or biowaste) is
preferable, and the necessary source-separated collection schemes must be put in place. If,
however, the objective is to maximise diversion from landﬁll, while still producing a quality
compost, the biowaste deﬁnition can be widened to include paper as well as organic materials
so long as there is a market for the resulting compost. If the objective is to pre-treat waste prior
to ﬁnal disposal, then treating a mixed waste stream will be effective. In biogasiﬁcation, where
there are two possible products, biogas and compost, it is also necessary to decide which
should be optimised. 
Overview of biological treatment
Use of biological treatment for dealing with MSW varies considerably across Europe (see Figure
11.1). It is extensively used in Southern European countries, e.g. Spain, Portugal, France and
Italy, which correlates with the generally high organic content of municipal wastes from these
areas (Chapter 8). The feedstocks used for biological treatment also varies geographically:
Southern Europe generally treats MSW, whilst countries such as Germany, Austria, The
Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg treat more narrowly deﬁned feedstocks, which are
separately collected (Table 11.4).

By far the most common biological treatment process world-wide is composting. Often
large numbers of small plants exist in countries that exploit this treatment method. Switzerland
alone has over 140 plants with a capacity of over 100 tonnes/year, of which 40 plants have
capacities of over 1000 tonnes/year, and 15 plants over 4000 t/year (Schleiss, 1990). In the
USA there are more than 262 operational composting facilities and a further 55 are either at
pilot scale or at the permitting, design, construction or planning stages (Goldstein and Block,
1997). There are 14 composting facilities in the USA, processing either MSW or a combination
of MSW and other organic material (Glenn, 1997; see Table 11.5 below); a further 26 facilities
are at the permitting, design, construction or planning stages. 
Anaerobic treatment is a more limited application, although the number of operational full-
scale facilities world-wide is increasing rapidly. A list of the biogasiﬁcation facilities treating MSW,
either as source-separated material or mixed waste is shown in Table 11.6.

Biological treatment processes
A classiﬁcation of the types of biological treatment processes is presented in Figure 11.2. Each
consists of a pre-treatment stage followed by a biological decomposition process.
Table 11.7 below compares the land usage of composting and biogas processing. Whilst
there is likely to be an effect of plant capacity on land usage (larger plants will have proportion-
ately less free space at any time than smaller plants), it can be seen that generally composting is
a more space-intensive process than biogasiﬁcation. This is because biogas plants are built ver-
tically, whilst composting plants are built horizontally. Also, in composting, a greater percentage
of the input is produced as compost, which requires maturing, and so occupies space for some
time.
Pre-treatment
Pre-treatment has two basic functions: the separation of the organic material from other frac-
tions in the feedstock, and the preparation of this organic material for the subsequent biological
processing. Clearly, the amount of pre-treatment will depend on the nature of feedstock – the
more narrowly deﬁned the incoming material, the less separation will be required, although
pre-treatment for size reduction, homogenisation and moisture control will still be needed.
Where the plant input is mixed waste, such as MSW, the non-organic material (plastic, glass,
metal, etc.) needs to be removed at this stage (unless the overall objective is pre-treatment
prior to landﬁll). In some plants, part of this material can be recovered for use as secondary
materials. In the Duisburg–Huckingen composting plant in Germany, for example, incoming
mixed waste is passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals, and then along conveyor
belts where glass bottles, non-ferrous metals and plastic items are hand-picked and recovered
(Ernst, 1990; Figure 11.3). 
Recently there has been an increased level of criticism aimed at mixed waste composting,
supported by experience from Germany, France and the UK where large quantities of low-

quality compost containing high levels of heavy metals were produced (ENDS, 1997). A report
by the consultancy DHV of The Netherlands, for the European Commission, stated that ‘The
preferred method of biological treatment now emerging in Europe is based on source-separated
feedstock’ (DHV, 1997). This view has been supported by representatives of Herhof, a Ger-
man manufacturer of composting plants, who say ‘Only by source-separated collection of the
biowaste fraction can a compost with low contents of heavy metals and other contaminants be
achieved’ (Grüneklee, 1997). In the UK this approach is also now supported by the Govern-
ment, a report for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions states that
‘Uniform and uncontaminated compost is required if markets are to be secured. Only wastes
from source-segregated household collections and civic amenity sites will be suitable’ (DETR,
1997). The future of composting may well rely on the development of collection systems that
require householders to source separate biowaste.

Preparation for the actual composting or biogasiﬁcation usually involves some form of
screening to remove oversize items, size reduction and homogenisation. For biogasiﬁcation it is
normally necessary to produce a pumpable feedstock. Size reduction and mixing are achieved
either by shredding the feedstock in a mill, or by the use of a large rotating drum. Shredding the
feedstock removes the need for a screening stage prior to processing, but means that nuisance
materials are also shredded. This makes them much more difﬁcult to separate from the com-
post in the later reﬁning stage. A drum achieves some degree of size reduction and homogeni-
sation as it rotates, but does not shred nuisance materials. These can then be removed intact
by a screen (which can be incorporated into the rotating drum) prior to the biological process,
so that the later reﬁning stages can be simpliﬁed.
Nuisance materials can therefore be removed either before or after the biological treatment
stage. There is an advantage in removing them as early as possible, since the longer they are in
contact with the organic material, the greater the likelihood of cross-contamination. Additional-
ly, by removing material that would not be degraded, biological treatment processes operate
more efﬁciently.
The amount of nuisance material removed in the pre-treatment stage depends on the waste
used as feedstock. Even where the feedstock arises from source-separated collection of
biowaste, separation of nuisance material during pre-treatment is advisable, especially if the

feedstock comes from urban areas (see Chapter 9). A biogas plant in Brecht, Belgium, for
example, using a feedstock of separately collected VFG plus paper (Table 11.1) discards up to
19% of its input during the pre-treatment stage (De Baere, 1993) (Figure 11.4).
Aerobic processing – composting
Biological treatment can be described as the biological decomposition of organic wastes under
controlled conditions; for composting these conditions need to be aerobic and elevated tem-
peratures are achieved due to the exothermic processes catalysed by microbial enzymes.
Three main groups of micro-organism are involved in the composting process: bacteria, actin-
omycetes and fungi. Initially bacteria and fungi predominate, and their activity causes the tem-
perature to rise to around 70oC in the centre of a pile. At this temperature only thermophilic
(heat-tolerant) bacteria and actinomycetes are active. As the rate of decomposition and hence
temperature subsequently falls, fungi and other heat-sensitive bacteria become active again
(Lopez-Real, 1990). Temperature, therefore, is one of the key factors in composting plants that
needs to be constantly monitored and controlled. Actual operating temperatures within the
composting material are controlled in most cases to maximise both stabilisation (high tempera-
tures inhibit this process) and sterilisation (for which high temperatures are necessary); a com-
promise is often the end result. 
To maintain the high rate of decomposition, oxygen must be constantly available. In the sim-
plest process type, as with a garden compost heap, this is achieved by regular turning of the
composting material in long piles or windrows. The alternative method is forced aeration,
whereby air is forced through a static pile using small vents in the ﬂoor of the composting area.
Air can either be forced out of the vents, or drawn down through the composting pile by
applying a vacuum to the vents. The former method aids dispersion of the heat from the cen-
tre of the pile to the outside, making for a more uniform process. The latter helps in controlling
odours as the air passing through the pile is effectively ﬁltered to reduce many odours before
release. Aeration also helps remove carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds, such as
fatty acids, and buffers the pH of the material. 
Percolation of composting piles by air depends on the structure and water content of the
input material. The water content for aerobic composting needs to be over 40%, otherwise
the rate of decomposition will start to fall, but if it is too high the material will become water-
logged and limit air movement. If the input material is too wet, water-absorbing and bulking
agents such as woody garden waste, wood chips, straw or sawdust can be added to improve
the structure, and increase the air circulation.
Windrow composting is the most common technology used, being least capital intensive.
However, when it is open to the elements, control over moisture content, temperature and
odour emissions is limited. One way round this is to have the entire area enclosed, and the
exhaust air ﬁltered. In The Netherlands, open air composting is generally not allowed for plants
with a capacity exceeding 2000 tonnes/year, but due to the cost of building enclosed facilities,
Fricke and Vogtmann, (1992) recommend this only for plants in excess of 12,000 tonnes/year.
Further control over both composting conditions (moisture and temperature), odours,
bioaerosols and emissions are possible in more advanced technologies, using a variety of
enclosed vessels (boxes and drums) for totally enclosed processing. Open or semi-enclosed
windrows are often still used in these systems, for the maturation stage. Table 11.8 summarises
a number of factors affecting the choice of composting technology.

The duration of the composting process varies with the technology employed, and the maturi-
ty of the compost required. The assessment of compost stability is not easy, as currently there
is incomplete understanding of all the processes involved. There are several methods used: 
1. Carbon-based analysis – compost maturity can be assessed by the carbon/nitrogen
(C/N) ratio of the material, which falls from around 20 in raw organic waste to around 12 in
a mature compost after some 12–14 weeks. This method suffers from a lack of sensitivity
and the results vary depending on the C and N content of the starting material. Application
to soils of immature composts with high residual microbial activity and high C/N ratios can
result in uptake of the nitrogen from the soil by the compost, which will reduce, rather than
enhance the soil fertility. 
2. Enzyme assays – different enzymes change in concentration during the composting
process. Further research is required to develop an accurate measure of stabilisation using
such assay techniques.
3. Respiration measurements – respiratory activity falls as composting proceeds. It has
been proposed that a compost may be considered stable when its oxygen uptake is less
than 40 mg/kg dry matter per hour at 20°C.
4. Phytotoxicity assays – the presence of phytotoxins (organic materials toxic to some
plants) can be assessed using cress seed emergence tests and assays for individual phytotox-
ins such as acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids and phenolic acids. 
5. Humiﬁcation indicators – measurement of humic substances, especially humic acid car-
bon to fulvic acid carbon ratio, may provide an effective measure of stabilisation. Humic acid
content increases as composting progresses.
6. Molecular size determination – molecular sizes rise as humic substances are formed.
This test requires specialised equipment and expert operators.
Before marketing compost, further maturation and reﬁning are often needed. Additional
maturation may be necessary to break down complex phytotoxins, which may still be present
in the compost. Reﬁning involves size classiﬁcation of the compost particles and the removal of
nuisance materials by sieving, ballistic separation or air classiﬁcation, ready for the chosen end

ﬁlm and hard plastic, the limits for some of these inert materials in selected European countries
are presented in Table 11.9. Oversize organic fragments can be recycled into the composting
process, but the rest of the residue will need to be incinerated or landﬁlled. 
Final compost characteristics depend on a combination of the process (mainly temperature
and time) and the composition of the original feedstock. Tables 11.10–11.12 present values for
a number of parameters that can be expected from composting a range of different feedstocks.

Dry-stabilization
A new process, which takes advantage of the composting process is the dry stabilization sys-
tem. Developed in Germany by the Herhof Umwelttechnik engineering company the technol-
ogy is applied to the restwaste fraction of the household waste stream. In Germany due to the
German Packaging Ordinance (Chapter 9) the restwaste stream generally contains low levels
of recoverable material and is often sent directly to landﬁll. The restwaste contains material that
is considered unrecoverable, but still has a signiﬁcant caloriﬁc value. The process begins with
the restwaste being composted in enclosed vessel composters. The heat generated by the
composting process is recovered and then used to dry the restwaste material itself. This not
only makes the material more manageable but further increases its caloriﬁc value. The dry
material is separated into a light (high-energy) fraction and a heavy inert fraction. The inert frac-
tion is passed through magnetic and eddy current separators to recover ferrous and non-ferrous
metals, which are sold. The residual inert material is washed and sold as sand/gravel for road 
construction.
The light fraction (the dry stabilite) has a caloriﬁc value of between 15 and 18 MJ/kg (Warmer
Bulletin, 1998b), which compares favourably with coal, wood and paper (8–16, 10–16 and
13–14 MJ/kg, respectively). When this fraction is incinerated it produces 80% less ash than
conventional fuels. Only 2–3% of ﬂy ash remains at the end of the process. The heavy metal
content of the dry stabilite is also lower than that of MSW and again compares favourably with
coal. Incineration with energy recovery will displace the use of fossil fuels and will therefore
make a positive contribution to reducing fossil fuel CO2 emissions.
The process is currently being used in Asslar in Lahn-Dill, Westerwald Kreis in Rheinland-Pfalz
and in Dresden in Germany. This novel approach, a combination of composting and incineration
with energy recovery, appears to be a major step in signiﬁcantly reducing the environmental bur-
dens of the restwaste fraction of MSW on the whole waste management system. 
Anaerobic processing – biogasiﬁcation
Anaerobic treatment of organic material is basically a two-stage process: large organic polymers
are fermented into short-chain volatile fatty acids. These acids are then converted into
methane and carbon dioxide (Figure 11.5). Both processes occur at the same time, in single-
phase systems. The separation of the acid producing (acidogenic) bacteria from the methane
producing (methanogenic) bacteria results in a two-phase system. The main attraction of
anaerobic treatment is the concurrent waste stabilisation and production of methane gas (an
energy source). The retention time for solid material in an anaerobic process can range from a
few days to several weeks depending on the chemical characteristics of the solid material, the
amount of pre-processing it has undergone and the design (single-stage, two-stage multi-stage,
wet or dry, temperature and pH control) of the biogasiﬁcation system itself. 
Conditions for biogasiﬁcation need to be anaerobic, so a totally enclosed process vessel is
required. Although this necessitates a higher level of technology than some forms of compost-
ing, containment allows greater control over the process itself and also of emissions such as
noxious odours. Greater process control, especially of temperature, allows a reduction in
treatment time when compared to composting. Since a biogas plant is usually vertical, it also
requires less land area than a composting plant (Table 11.7).
Biogasiﬁcation is particularly suitable for wet substrates, such as sludges or food wastes,
which present difﬁculties in composting as their lack of structural material will restrict air circula-

tion. The anaerobic process has been used for some time to digest sewage sludges (Noone,
1990) and organic industrial wastes (BfE, 1991), and this has been extended to fractions of
household solid waste (Coombs, 1990). 
The various biogasiﬁcation processes can be classiﬁed according to the solids content of the
material digested, and the temperature at which the process operates. Dry anaerobic digestion
may be deﬁned as taking place at a total solids concentration of over 25% (De Baere et al.,
1987); below this level of solids the process is described as wet digestion. With regard to 
temperature, processes are either described as mesophilic (operating between 30 and 40oC)
or thermophilic (operating between 50 and 65oC). It has been well established that different
anaerobic micro-organisms have optimum growth rates within these temperature ranges
(Archer and Kirsop, 1990). In contrast to aerobic processing (composting) the biogasiﬁcation
process is only mildly exothermic. Thus heat needs to be supplied to maintain the process tem-
perature, especially for thermophilic processes. The advantage of the higher temperature is
that the reactions will occur at a faster rate, so shorter residence times are needed in the reac-
tor vessel.
‘Wet’ anaerobic digestion
In its simplest form, this process consists of a single stage in a completely mixed mesophilic
digester, operating at a total solids content of around 3–8% (De Baere et al., 1987). To pro-
duce this level of dilution, considerable water has to be added (and heated), and then removed
after the digestion process. This method is routinely used to digest sewage sludge and animal
wastes, but has also been used to treat household waste in Italy and Germany. 
The single-stage wet process can suffer from several practical problems; however, such as
the formation of a hard scum layer in the digester, and difﬁculty in keeping the contents com-
pletely mixed. The major problem with the single-stage process is that the different reactions in
the process cannot be separately optimised. The acidogenic micro-organisms are fast growing
and act to lower the pH of the reaction mixture, whereas the methanogens, which grow more

slowly, have a pH optimum around 7.0. This problem has been solved by the development of
the two-stage process. Hydrolysis and acidiﬁcation are stimulated in the ﬁrst reactor vessel,
kept at a pH of around 6.0. Methanogenesis occurs in the second separate vessel, operated at
a pH of 7.5–8.2. Variations of the two-stage wet (mesophilic) digestion process have been
developed and implemented in Germany. The whole process can be run with a retention time
of 5–8 days (De Baere et al., 1987). 
‘Dry’ anaerobic digestion
Several processes have been developed that digest semi-solid organic wastes (over 25% total
solids) to produce biogas in a single stage, either as a batch process or a continuous process.
The processes can be either mesophilic, or thermophilic, and can use organic material from
mixed wastes such as MSW, or separated biowaste.
The dry fermentation process means that little process water has to be added (or heated),
which favours thermophilic operation. No mixing equipment is necessary and crust formation
is not possible due to the relatively solid nature of the digester contents. This anaerobic process
usually takes from 12–18 days, followed by several days in the post-digestion stage for residue
stabilisation and maturation (De Baere et al., 1987).
Maturation and reﬁning
The residues of both wet and dry biogasiﬁcation processes require extensive maturing under
normal aerobic conditions. This period can be signiﬁcantly reduced by effective aeration. The
maturation process facilitates the release of entrapped methane, elimination of phytotoxins
(substances that are harmful to plant growth, such as volatile organic acids) and reduces the
moisture content to an acceptable level. These residues contain high levels of water; even the
dry process residue contains around 65% water, compared to German maximum recom-
mended water levels for compost of 35% and 45% for bagged and loose compost, respectively
(ORCA, 1992b). Excess water can be removed by ﬁltering or pressing, to produce a cake-like
residue; further drying can be achieved using waste heat from the gas engines if the biogas is
burnt on site to produce electricity (De Baere et al., 1987). Some of the waste water can be
recirculated and used to adjust the water content of the digester input; the rest represents an
aqueous efﬂuent requiring treatment prior to discharge. 
The digested residue, initially anaerobic, will also still contain many volatile organic acids and
reduced organic material. This needs to be matured aerobically to oxidise and stabilise these
compounds, in a process similar to the maturation of aerobic composts, prior to sale as com-
post, or disposal as a residue.
The production of odours is a sensitive issue with regard to the neighbours of a biological
treatment facility. Odour production, measured as the total amount of volatile organics pro-
duced per tonne of biowaste during composting and the ﬁnal aerobic maturation after anaero-
bic digestion, is compared in Table 11.13. 
In composting systems many of the compounds listed in Table 11.13 are volatized as soon as
intensive aeration begins. This can result in odour problems. In anaerobic systems these com-
pounds are effectively broken down by the anaerobic bacteria. After the anaerobic sludge is de-
watered, the pressed cake contains few of these compounds so overall emissions, and
therefore odours, are far less than from aerobic systems.

Compost markets
It is the presence or absence of a viable market that determines whether the composted out-
put from biological treatment represents a valued product or a residue for disposal. Conse-
quently much effort has been put into the deﬁnition and development of markets for
waste-derived composts both in Europe and the USA by the Organic Reclamation and Com-
posting Association (ORCA) and the Solid Waste Composting Council (SWCC), respectively.
Broadly speaking there are three main areas of compost application: agriculture, horticulture
and landscaping.
Within these areas compost can fulﬁl one or more of four basic functions:
1. Soil conditioner or improver – by adding organic matter to the soil, compost will
improve the structure of the soil and replace the organic material lost during sustained
intensive cultivation.
2. Soil fertiliser – the actual value of compost as a fertiliser will depend on its nutrient con-
tent in general and of its nitrate and phosphate content in particular. This is normally much
lower than for inorganic fertilisers, and because these nutrients are bound to the organic
matter, their release is slow and sustained. This is an advantage that is becoming increasing-
ly important in countries such as Denmark, Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany where
strict limitations on nitrate application are being implemented to reduce ammonia emissions
and possible groundwater contamination (ORCA, 1992a).
3. Mulch – compost can be applied to the soil surface to reduce evaporation losses and weed
growth.

4. Peat replacement – the use of peat is facing growing public opposition, being seen as the
exploitation of an irreplaceable natural biotope. In both the UK and Germany some sectors
of the trade have speciﬁed that no peat be used in products for home gardening. Whilst the
use of waste-derived composts instead of peat may be limited in the potted plant industry
due to very strict phytosanitary regulations in Europe, to control the spread of plant 
diseases, there appears to be a market as a peat replacement in the home gardening
and landscaping sectors (ORCA, 1992a). Table 11.14 shows the current situation in the
UK. It is clear that peat utilisation, by local authorities and landscapers, as both a soil
improver and growing medium is decreasing, but peat utilisation as a growing medium by
amateur gardeners (97% of all peat used) has not changed. This is potentially a very large
market available to compost producers if product quality and performance can be guaran-
teed.

As well as fulﬁlling different functions, composts from biological treatments come in different
forms. Many processes produce more than one grade of compost (e.g. coarse and ﬁne) at the
ﬁnal reﬁning stage. The essential marketing step is to match these products to the market
requirements. In some cases, new markets may need to be developed; for example, where
composting plants produce a novel product, such as the very ﬁne textured and uniformly grad-
ed compost produced by the lumbricomposting process. The market potential can be assessed
by considering both current and potential future usage of composts.
Surveys of compost consumption show that in Switzerland, of the 100,000 tonnes of com-
post produced each year, 46% is used in agriculture and vineyards, 30% in horticulture and
tree nurseries, 13% in hobby gardening and 11% in recultivation (Schleiss, 1990). A more
detailed analysis of German usage is given in Table 11.15. 
A report published by the UK Department of the Environment (1997) suggests that there is
a signiﬁcant market in the UK for waste-derived composts and digestates (Table 11.16).

Penetration of new market areas, such as agriculture, will depend on effective marketing of
waste-derived compost as a quality product, i.e. that it is safe and ﬁt for use, and gives clear
beneﬁts compared to competing products at an affordable cost (ORCA, 1992a). Whilst these
are general pre-conditions, there are additional speciﬁc compost quality requirements that will
vary between different compost uses (Table 11.17).
The failure to gain widespread acceptance of waste-derived composts, especially in the agri-
cultural sector has most likely been due to concerns over its safety and quality. Failure of many
early plants to completely separate visual contaminants (e.g. plastic ﬁlm) from the ﬁnal compost
reinforced the idea of waste-based composts as inferior products. The very use of the word
‘waste’ also raises concerns over safety, in particular the possible presence of pathogens,
although these should be effectively destroyed in the biological treatment process. More recent-
ly the level of heavy metals in waste-derived composts has become a concern. The high levels
of some heavy metals in some fractions of household waste (Table 8.8) can result in contamina-
tion of the ﬁnal compost, if biological treatment of mixed wastes is used. What are needed, if
waste-derived composts are to become fully accepted and used more extensively, are: 
1. widely accepted quality standards, which reassure potential users that the compost is both
safe and ﬁt for use, especially with repeated applications 
2. plant growth studies demonstrating a commercial beneﬁt from the application of compost or
compost-based products.

Compost standards
Compost market development would be facilitated by the application of consistent quality stan-
dards across Europe, but present standards vary widely between countries both in approach
and detail. ORCA have published a review of compost standards for 12 European countries
(ORCA, 1992b). Of these, nine countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, The Netherlands and Switzerland) have implemented or proposed standards,
Sweden and the UK are in the process of drafting standards while Spain uses standards relating
to fertilisers. In countries such as Germany these criteria take the form of marketing standards,
whereas in other countries they actually comprise a legally deﬁned standard (Table 11.18). A
more recent set of data describing the limit values for heavy metals in composts in a number of
European countries is presented in Table 11.19. 
The objective of the standards is to protect land from contamination and to ensure that the
composts marketed are ﬁt for use. Since there are many uses for compost, however, different
compost quality criteria need to be applied for each separate application. Several countries,
such as the The Netherlands and Austria, deﬁne several different grades of compost with 
different maximum levels of contaminants for each (Table 11.19). Belgium also 
speciﬁes which grades can be used for different applications such as growing food or fodder
crops.
Most standards relate to the physical and chemical properties of the compost, though there
is normally more emphasis on what should not be in the compost (i.e. contaminants) rather
than what should be in the compost (e.g. nutrients). Heavy metal levels come in for close
scrutiny, but as Tables 11.18 and 11.19 demonstrate, limit levels vary widely between coun-
tries. To a large extent this reﬂects differences in the interpretation of the available scientiﬁc data
on the heavy metal levels that constitute a signiﬁcant health or environmental risk. Another
cause for variability, however, is the use to which the compost may be put. Many of the most
restricted heavy metal limits refer to composts that can be freely applied; some of the more
relaxed standards are supplemented by restrictions on their level or time of use, frequency of
application, application during wet weather, soil type or proximity of water supply plants
(ORCA, 1992b). Measured levels for contaminants such as heavy metals will also depend on
the analytical methods used. Whilst most of the country standards include details of the analyt-
ical methods required, some, such as Switzerland, do not. Clearly this lack of uniformity can
only hinder the development of free markets for compost across Europe. 
Not all standards systems even take the same basic approach. Since the quality of a compost
is largely determined by the feedstock used and the processing method, some standards set
criteria for these rather than the quality of the resulting compost itself. Criteria for some of the
high-quality composts specify that unseparated household waste cannot be used as a feed-
stock. Criteria for compost processing methods are commonly used to determine microbio-
logical safety. Several standards include both the temperature that must be achieved and its
duration for destruction of pathogens during aerobic composting (Table 11.3).
The French compost standard takes yet another approach. Rather than set criteria in terms
of compost/composting conditions considered safe and ﬁt for use, the criteria reﬂect the 
engineering capabilities of existing plants. In this case, some plants should be capable of 
meeting the requirements, but elsewhere the problem of compost not meeting quality criteria
seems widespread.

In the USA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken yet a different approach,
based on a risk assessment of soil to which compost has been added. This approach is related
to the US (and UK) approach towards application of sewage sludge to ﬁelds, and does have a
certain scientiﬁc logic. 
In conclusion, criteria are needed to provide reassurance that marketed composts are ﬁt and
safe for use, but such criteria should be set uniformly across Europe on the basis of good sci-
entiﬁc data, considering all aspects of compost usage. Such standards should deﬁne the quality
and quantity of compost that can be used for different applications, ranging from horticulture
and agriculture to the reclamation of derelict land and erosion control.

Summary
Thermal treatment can be regarded as either a pre-treatment of waste prior to ﬁnal disposal,
or as a means of valorising waste by recovering energy. It includes both the burning of mixed
MSW in municipal incinerators and the burning of selected parts of the waste stream as a fuel.
These different methods reﬂect the different objectives that thermal treatment can address.
This chapter describes the various thermal treatment processes and their application world-
wide.
Introduction
Thermal treatment of solid waste within an Integrated Waste Management system can include
at least three distinct processes, Mass burn, Refuse-Derived Fuel burn and Paper and Plastic
fuel burn. The most well known is mass-burning, or incineration, of mixed Municipal Solid
Waste (MSW) in large incinerator plants, but there are two additional ‘select-burn’ processes
whereby combustible fractions from the solid waste are burned as fuels. These fuels can be
separated from mixed MSW either mechanically to form Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF), or can be
source-separated materials from household collections such as paper and plastic, which have
been recovered but not recycled (Chapter 10). 
These three methods reﬂect the different objectives that thermal treatment can address 
(Table 12.1). The process can be considered as an Energy from Waste (i.e. valorisation) tech-
nique or as a pre-treatment to ﬁnal disposal. Although their objectives may differ, all 
methods of burning solid waste will be dealt with together in this chapter, due to the similarity
of the underlying physical processes and issues involved.
Thermal treatment objectives
Burning of solid waste can fulﬁl up to four distinct objectives.
1. Volume reduction – depending on its composition, incinerating MSW reduces the 
volume of solid waste to be disposed of by, on average, 90%. The weight of solid waste to
be dealt with is reduced by 70–75%. This has both environmental and economic advan-
tages since there is less demand for ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll, as well as reduced costs and
environmental burdens due to transport if a distant landﬁll is used.

2. Stabilisation of waste – incinerator output (ash) is considerably more inert than incinera-
tor input (MSW), mainly due to the oxidation of the organic component of the waste stream.
This leads to reduced landﬁll management problems since the organic fraction is responsible
for landﬁll gas production and the organic compounds present in landﬁll leachate.
3. Recovery of Energy from Waste (EfW) – this represents a valorisation method, rather
than just a pre-treatment of waste prior to disposal. Energy recovered from burning waste is
used to generate steam for use in on-site electricity generation or export to local factories and
district heating schemes. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants increase the efﬁciency of
energy recovery by producing electricity as well as utilising the residual heat. Often viewed as a
‘renewable resource’ (van Santen, 1993), burning solid waste can replace use of fossil fuels for
energy generation. As a large part of the energy content of MSW comes from truly renewable
resources (biomass), there should be a lower overall net carbon dioxide production than from
burning fossil fuels, since carbon dioxide is absorbed in the initial growing phase of the biomass.
4. Sterilisation of waste – whilst this is of primary importance in incineration of clinical
waste, incineration of MSW will also ensure destruction of pathogens prior to ﬁnal disposal
in a landﬁll.
Current state of thermal treatment 
The prevalence of thermal treatment, and the actual approach that it takes, reﬂects the relative
importance attached to the different objectives listed above, and varies from country to coun-
try (Figure 12.1). In 1996 there were approximately 2400 large-scale waste incineration facili-
ties in operation around the world, 150 were under construction and a further 250 facilities
were planned. Globally, around 2800 incineration facilities are predicted to be operational by
the year 2005 (Helmut Kaiser Consultancy, 1996). Countries with an acute shortage of landﬁll
capacity, such as Switzerland, The Netherlands and Japan, incinerate a high proportion of MSW
principally for volume reduction, with some energy recovery. By comparison, countries with
plentiful and currently cheap landﬁlls, such as the UK and Spain, have little MSW incineration
(12% and 4% of MSW, respectively). 
Volume reduction, for both environmental and economic reasons, and sterilisation of waste
have historically been important objectives for incineration. These were the prime reasons for
the MSW incinerators built in the UK, for example, in the 1960s. It is also likely that the future
will see more emphasis on using incineration for stabilising wastes for subsequent landﬁlling.
This will also increase the proportion of MSW incinerated. Due to growing concern over the
production of landﬁll gas and the organic compounds in leachate from landﬁlls receiving
untreated MSW, stabilisation of waste prior to disposal is becoming an important additional
objective in some countries. Landﬁll gas and leachate arise principally from the organic fraction
of MSW, which can be effectively converted to gases and mineralised ash by incineration. 
Concern over emissions from landﬁll sites led Germany to pass the National Technical Direc-
tive for the future management of communal waste (TA Siedlungsabfall, 1993), which states that
only inert materials can be landﬁlled. Inert materials are deﬁned as those that have less than 1%
(for normal community waste landﬁlls) or 5% (for ‘special’ community landﬁlls) weight loss on
incineration. Note that the directive does not make incineration mandatory for material going to
landﬁll, but at present there is no other technology available that can achieve this level of inert-

ness. This may require the building of new incinerators to meet the new legal requirements.
Austria is also considering similar legislation. At the time of writing, recent EC legislation (EC
Landﬁll Directive 1999/31/EC) states that not later than July 2003 Member States will reduce
biodegradable municipal waste going to landﬁll to 75% of the total amount (by weight) of
biodegradable municipal waste produced in 1995 (EC, 1999a). This ﬁgure drops to 50% by
2009 and to 35% by 2016. This legislation is likely to result in an increase in the amount of
material incinerated throughout the EC countries.

Table 12.1 Thermal treatment options

Scandinavian countries have generally exploited incineration of MSW for energy recovery
(e.g. Denmark and Sweden use 56% and 42% of their MSW, respectively, in this way) usually
via district heating schemes (van Santen, 1993). Energy recovery has been taken further in the
development of the Refuse-Derived-Fuel process (RDF). RDF technology has been developed
extensively in the UK and Sweden, though plants have also been set up in France, Germany,
Switzerland and the USA (see Chapter 10 for details of the sorting process). The other process 
discussed in this chapter, the burning of source-separated paper and plastic as an alternative
fuel, has not been fully developed. However, as the amount of paper and plastic collected 
by materials recovery schemes across Europe increases and exceeds reprocessing capacity,
interest in this area is likely to grow.
Mass-burn incineration of MSW
This form of thermal treatment can be divided into several distinct stages: the incineration
process, energy recovery, emission control and treatment of solid residues. 
The incineration process
Municipal Solid Waste incineration processes are dominated by the so-called ‘mass burn’ 
technologies. These systems accept solid waste with little pre-processing treatment other than
the removal of recyclable material and bulky items. A typical mass burn incinerator uses a single
large furnace with an inclined moving or roller grate system. 
A schematic diagram of a generic modern incinerator is shown in Figure 12.2. Mixed waste
for incineration is delivered into a reception hall or tipping bunker, from which it is fed into the
furnace feed hopper, usually by mechanical grab. The reception area can be a source of local

nuisances such as noise, odour and litter, which need to be controlled. The majority of MSW
incinerators have a furnace with a moving grate design, also known as a ‘stoker’ type incinera-
tor. The moving grate keeps the waste moving through the furnace as it burns and deposits the
unburned residue (bottom ash) into a quench tank. Primary air for combustion is pumped
through from under the grate, and secondary air is introduced over the ﬁre to ensure good
combustion in the gas phase. An approximate solid mass ﬂow for waste in a mass-burning 
system is shown in Figure 12.3.
The key factors for high levels of combustion and destruction of organic pollutants in the
incoming waste are temperature (high), residence time (long) and turbulence (high) (Vogg,
1992). The EC Directives on Incineration (1989a, b), for example, requires a residence time
(for the gas in the combustion chamber) of at least 2 seconds at temperatures in excess of
850°C, in the presence of at least 6% oxygen to ensure maximum oxidation of dioxins and
other organic pollutants. Furnace design and operating efﬁciency are the crucial factors that
determine the levels of pollutants in the crude gas entering the ﬂue gas-cleaning system (Table
12.2).
The hot gases then enter the energy recovery boiler, where they cool rapidly. If no energy
is recovered, the ﬂue gases must be cooled using air or water sprays before they enter the gas
cleaning systems.

Some systems have added to the objectives of volume reduction and sterilization the recov-
ery of energy for electricity generation or local heating and/or power combinations. The ener-
gy is recovered from the ﬂue gases using a boiler system to generate hot water or steam. Hot
water may be used for heating and steam for industrial purposes or electricity generation.
Combined Heat and Power plants (CHP) can be ﬁtted into MSW incineration processes. The
different incineration processes are described more fully below.
Grate incinerators 
There are different designs for the grates used in municipal waste incineration. Grate systems
are used to transport the refuse through the furnace and to promote combustion by agitation
and mixing with combustion air. Once the refuse is in the grate, it passes through a drying stage
where the most volatile compounds are burnt. The refuse moves further down the grate and
continues to burn slowly until it gets to a burnout stage before the ash is discharged at the end
of the grate. Ash temperatures are a limitation to the operation of grate systems. If the 
temperature is high enough for the ash to melt and form slag, the slag reduces the air supply as
it blocks up the grates. Overﬁre air is injected above the grates to provide enough air to 
combust the ﬂue gas and the particulate material it contains. Some of the most common grates
systems used in Municipal Solid Waste incineration are:
1. Roller systems: which consist of drums placed to form an inclined surface. The drums
rotate slowly in the direction of the refuse movement. 
2. Reciprocating systems: the grates are placed above each other. Alternated grate sections
slide back and forth while the adjacent sections remain in place. 
3. Reverse reciprocating: the grates move forward and then reverse direction.
4. Continuous: two sections are used in cascade. This process is cheap and reliable, but does
not agitate the waste, and needs large amounts of air, which in turn produces large amounts
of ﬂue gas.
5. Rocking grates: the grates are placed across the width of the furnace. Alternate rows are
rocked to produce an upward-forward motion. This motion agitates and moves the waste
forward through the incinerator. 
Fluidised bed incinerators 
Fluidised beds are simple devices consisting of a vessel lined with heat-resistant material, con-
taining inert granular particles. Gases are blown through the inert particles at a rate high enough
to cause the bed to expand and act as an ideal ﬂuid. Normally bed design restricts combustion
to the immediate area of the bed. This maintains an area above the bed for separating the inert
particles from the rising gases and other components. The hot gases leave the ﬂuidised bed and
enter heat-recovery or gas-cleaning devices. Because of the close contact between combus-
tion gases and the waste being burned, excess air for normal incineration is usually limited to
approximately 40% above the stoichiometric air requirements for combustion of the waste.
Fluidised beds are subject to problems caused by low ash-fusion temperatures and materials
with low melting points. Such materials (i.e. aluminium and glass) have to be removed before
entering the process. These can be avoided by keeping the operating temperature below the
ash-fusion level or by adding chemicals that raise the fusion temperature of the ash (Cheremisi-
noff, 1987). An advantage of this technology is that reagents that capture halogens (chlorides
and ﬂuorides) can be added to the process, reducing the ﬁnal discharge of acid gases. This

process has been developed and implemented particularly in Japan. A comparison of moving-
grate and ﬂuidised-bed incinerators is given in Table 12.3. 
Rotary combustors or rotary kilns
This process consists of a horizontal, cylindrical, shell lined with heat-resistant material that is
mounted on a slight slope, and is the most commonly used design for the incineration of waste.
The rotation of the shell mixes the waste with the combustion air. The range of the combus-
tion temperatures is between 820 and 1650oC. Residence times vary from several seconds to

hours, depending on the waste and its characteristics. Rotary kilns are effective when the size
or nature of the waste prevents the use of other types of incineration equipment. 
Multiple-chamber incinerators
This conﬁguration provides complete burnout of combustion products, which decreases the
concentration of particulate material in the ﬂue gas. The combustion of the solid waste takes
place in a primary chamber and the unburned gaseous products are combusted in a secondary
chamber. The secondary chamber provides the required residence time and supplementary
fuel for the combustion of the gaseous emissions. 
Multiple-hearth furnace 
The diameter and number of hearths employed by this process depend on the waste material,
on the required processing time and the type of thermal processing employed. A normal incin-
eration process usually requires a minimum of six hearths. The waste material enters the fur-
nace by a feed port in the furnace top. Rabble arms and teeth, attached to a vertical shaft,
rotate counter-clockwise to spiral the waste across the hearths and through the furnace. The
waste drops from hearth to hearth through passages located either along the edge of the
hearth or near to the central shaft. Although the rabble arms and teeth all rotate in the same
direction, additional agitation of the waste is obtained by reversing the angles of the rabble-
tooth pattern and the rotational speed of the central shaft. Burners and combustion air ports
are located in the walls of the furnace. Each hearth contains temperature sensors and con-
trollers. The construction materials of the hearths vary in grade to suite waste requirements.
This technology is used mostly for the incineration of sludges.
Pyrolysis or starved air 
This technique is employed when the waste material has a high caloriﬁc content. The waste
has to be organic and able to maintain combustion. Normal incineration requires 40–100%
excess air over the stoichiometric value. Pyrolysis is theoretically a zero-air indirect-heat
process. However, in practical applications it is an air-starved process in which combustion
occurs with air levels less than stoichiometric requirements. If the heat content of the waste is
not high enough to maintain combustion, sub-stoichiometric burning will not succeed. During
pyrolysis waste organic compounds are distilled or vaporised to form combustible gas, by heat-
ing them in an oxygen-free atmosphere. The process is endothermic and requires an external
heat source. Heat for the process can be provided by the partial combustion of the pyrolysis
gas within the furnace and by the combustion of elemental carbon  (Cheremisinoff, 1987). The
unoxidised portion of the combustible gas may be used as fuel in an external combustion
chamber, with the resulting energy recovered by conventional waste-heat-boiler technology.
Carbon levels in the furnace ash are higher for pyrolysis than for normal incineration. Pyrolysis
is generally considered unsuitable for handling large volumes of mixed, untreated MSW at the
time of writing, although Deutsche Babcock Alagen GmbH have been operating a 50,000

Energy can be recovered from the combustion of waste. The heat from the ﬂue gases is used
for heating water or for steam generation. The hot water is then used for other industrial or
space heating applications. The steam can be used for heating or for electricity generation.
Heat recovery can be achieved by two means: by waterwall combustion chambers or by

waste-heat boilers. The heated water turns to steam, which can generate mechanical energy in
a steam turbine, which is then converted into electricity (Figure 12.4).
In Amsterdam, 15% of the city’s electricity is obtained from an EfW plant (EEWC, 1997).
The energy efﬁciency of waste can be compared to that obtained from other fuels. In treated
waste where glass, metal and wet organic materials have been removed the energy potential is
just under half that of coal (EEWC, 1997). The recovery of heat has other beneﬁcial side-
effects. By recovering heat from the ﬂue gases, the ﬂue gas volume is reduced. Therefore, the
required capacity of gas-cleaning equipment is reduced. 
Conventional energy recovery involves passing the hot ﬂue gases through a boiler, whose
walls are lined with boiler tubes. Water circulated through these tubes is turned to steam,
which can be heated further, using a superheater, to increase its temperature and pressure to
make electricity generation more efﬁcient. The thermal efﬁciency of modern boilers is around
80%. If the steam is used to generate electricity, however, the overall energy recovery efﬁcien-
cy (from caloriﬁc content of fuel to electricity generated) is around 20% (RCEP, 1993).
If wet feedstocks are used (e.g. high in food and garden waste), much of the gross caloriﬁc
content of the waste is used up evaporating this moisture. This latent heat contained within the
ﬂue gas is not normally recovered. Recent advances in energy recovery techniques, in particu-
lar the ﬂue gas condensation (FGC) process, however, allow some of this latent heat to be
recovered also, so increasing the overall efﬁciency of energy recovery. An additional beneﬁt of
FGC systems is the relatively high rate of removal of acid gases from the ﬂue gas during the
process, leaving less to be removed by subsequent emission control equipment.
Emission control
The majority of modern MSW incinerators produce less particulate and gaseous pollutants than
their predecessors, which had few environmental controls. With the introduction of tighter con-
trols on air emissions by regulatory bodies world-wide, multi-stage pollution control systems are

becoming more common. Emissions from MSW incinerators are controlled by a combination of
measures that use both the pollution prevention approach and end-of-pipe solutions. 
The operation of the combustion process plays an important role in the formation of some
pollutants. Carbon monoxide, NOx, hydrocarbons and other volatile organic compound emis-
sions can be minimised by optimising the combustion process. This is achieved in Europe by
regulations that state that the furnace temperature must remain above 850oC for 2 seconds in
the presence of at least 6% oxygen. Because the formation of pollutants cannot be prevented
or completely controlled, the use of end-of-pipe equipment is needed. This is the case for
gaseous streams containing dust, acid gases (HCl, SO2, HF), heavy metals and dioxins. The
combustion of MSW can produce trace quantities of dioxins and the industry has pioneered the
use of dry scrubber/ fabric ﬁlter systems, activated carbon ﬁlters and carbon injection for dioxin
control. To control dioxin emissions good combustion practices and proper temperature 
control of the ﬂue gases are essential and can achieve reductions of dioxins to exceedingly low
levels. The main gaseous emissions from the incineration process are described below. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
Carbon dioxide is one of the two main products of the incineration process. The other main
product is water. In low concentrations CO2 has no short-term toxic or irritating effects; it is
abundant in the atmosphere, necessary for plant life and is not considered a pollutant
(Tchobanoglous et al., 1993). Nevertheless, due to the high increase in global concentrations of
CO2, it has been recognised as one of the gases responsible for global warming (IPCC, 1996).
Carbon monoxide (CO) 
Carbon monoxide is formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon due to the lack of 
oxygen to complete the oxidation to CO2. This gas is very toxic; it reacts with haemoglobin in
the blood causing a decrease of available oxygen to the organism. This lack of oxygen produces
headaches, nausea and eventually death. Carbon monoxide in the ﬂue gas is used to monitor
the incomplete combustion of other emissions, such as unburned hydrocarbons and to 
provide information on the combustion performance. 
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) 
Hydrochloric acid results from the high concentration of chlorine-containing materials in 
MSW (some types of plastics like polyvinyl chloride). Chlorine easily dissolves in water to form
HCl. Its presence in the gaseous stream may increase the acidity of local rain and groundwater,
which can damage exposed unprotected metal surfaces, erode buildings and may affect the
mobilisation of heavy metals in soils (Clayton, 1991).
Hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) 
Hydrogen ﬂuoride is more toxic and corrosive than HCl, although its presence in the emissions
from MSW incinerators occurs in much smaller quantities. It is formed due to the presence of
trace amounts of ﬂuorine in the waste. 
Sulphur oxides (SOx) 
The emission of SOx is a direct result of the oxidation of sulphur present in MSW, but other
conditions such as the type of incinerator used and its operating conditions may also inﬂuence
Mass-Burn Incineration of MSW 
283

production although to a lesser degree. Approximately 90% of SOx emissions are as SO2 and
10% are as SO3. In the atmosphere most of the SO2 is transformed into SO3 (Benitez, 1995).
SO2 may lead to the production of H2SO3 and H2SO4 (sulphurous and sulphuric acids, respec-
tively) in the atmosphere increasing the acidity of rain. Its effects on human beings depend on
concentration. At high concentrations, it can produce eye, nose and throat irritation and other
respiratory problems. Particulates that carry SOx on their surface intensify harmful respiratory
effects, as this particulate matter can penetrate deep into the lungs (Benitez, 1995). 
Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
Nitrogen oxides are predominantly formed during the incineration process; however they oxi-
dise to NO2 in the atmosphere. NOx is formed from two main sources: thermal NOx and fuel
NOx. In thermal formation the oxygen and nitrogen in the air react, the free oxygen atoms
produced in the ﬂames by dissociation of O2 or by radical attack, themselves attack the nitro-
gen molecules and begin a chain reaction. Fuel NOx production is formed during reactions
between oxygen and nitrogen in the fuel. These reactions are highly sensitive to temperature,
and are also affected by the degree that the fuel mixes with air (Benitez, 1995). Nitrogen
oxides are important because they participate in several processes in atmospheric 
chemistry. They are precursors of the formation of ozone (O3) and peroxyacetal nitrate (PAN):
photochemical oxidants known as smog and which contribute to acid rain formation. 
Particulates 
Particulates are formed during the combustion process by several mechanisms. The turbulence
in the combustion chambers may carry some ash into the exhaust ﬂow. Other inorganic materials
present in the waste volatise at combustion temperatures. This material condenses down-
stream to form particles or deposits on ash particles. Organic material can also be emitted
through pyrolitic reactions near the fuel bed. This material can also be carried away and con-
densed downstream. The main component of ﬂy ash is chemically inert silica but it may also
contain toxic metals and some toxic organic substances (Benitez, 1995).
Heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr) 
Municipal solid waste contains heavy metals and metallic compounds in the combustible and
incombustible fractions. During the incineration process, metals may vaporise directly or form
oxides and chlorides in the high temperatures in the combustion zone. They condense over
other particles and leave the incineration process in the ﬂue gas (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993).
Dioxins and furans 
Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) have
been detected in the emissions from Municipal Solid Waste incinerators (Olie et al., 1977).
They immediately became a major issue in the debate over the place of incineration within the
municipal waste management strategy. Dioxins can be formed in all combustion processes
where organic carbon, oxygen and chlorine are present, although the processes by which they
are formed during incineration are not completely understood or agreed upon.
Dioxin is the generic name given to a family of over 200 chlorinated organic compounds.
Their molecular structure is very similar; 12 carbon atoms form two benzene rings, which are
connected by two oxygen atoms. They differ from each other by the number of chlorine
284
Chapter 12: Thermal Treatment

atoms and their spatial arrangements. Furans are similar to dioxins, but the difference relies on
the location of the chlorine atoms, which are situated at positions 1–4 and 6–9. There are 75
dioxin isomers and 135 furan isomers and all are collectively named ‘dioxins’. 
The concern over dioxins and furans is due to a number of animal studies that have shown
that for some species they are highly toxic at very low levels of exposure (Tosine, 1983; 
Oakland, 1988). The extrapolation of these animal data to humans, albeit contentious, has
helped these compounds acquire their notoriety. Nevertheless, they have known adverse
health effects on humans such as chloracne, which was clearly documented in the Seveso inci-
dent (Porteous, 1994).
Even though the relationship between dioxins and human cancer at everyday levels of expo-
sure is still under debate and not convincingly demonstrated, research by a group of scientists
from the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) concluded that there is enough evidence to classify one dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) as a
known human carcinogen. This verdict was based on the fact that TCDD has been shown to
exert carcinogenic and other effects in animals by binding to an intracellular complex called the
Ah receptor, which is also found in humans. These scientists believe that the overall cancer risk
is increased by a factor of only 1.4 in a highly exposed worker, a risk comparable to that from
environmental tobacco smoke. Heavy cigarette smoking increases the risk of lung cancer by a
factor of around 20. TCDD exposure seems not to be linked to any particular type of cancer.
Again there is not enough evidence to conclude that dioxins have carcinogenic effects at low
ambient concentrations. 
Three pathways were proposed to explain the presence of dioxins in incinerator emissions
(Hutzinger et al., 1985):
1. Dioxins are present in the incoming feed and are incompletely destroyed or transformed
during combustion.
2. Dioxins are produced from related chlorinated precursors such as polychlorinated biphe-
nols (PCB), chlorinated phenols and chlorinated benzenes.
3. Dioxins are formed via de novo synthesis from chemically unrelated compounds such as
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other chlorocarbons, or are formed by the burning of
nonchlorinated organic matter such as polystyrene, cellulose, lignin, coal and particulate car-
bon in the presence of chlorine donors.
It has now been veriﬁed that dioxins are present in all emissions, ﬂue gases, bottom ashes,
ﬂy ashes and scrubber water. Although each of the three pathways described above do occur
in large-scale incinerators, pathways 2 and 3 are more signiﬁcant than pathway 1. This is due to
a combination of modern combustion and ﬂue-gas-cleaning technologies and the fact that (for
thermodynamic reasons) dioxins are destroyed at temperatures above 800oC at residence
times of 2 seconds, the required operating conditions for waste incineration now.
There is general agreement that the most signiﬁcant way in which dioxins are formed is
when ﬂue gases are transported down cooling tubes between temperatures of 250 and 450oC
(Hutzinger et al., 1993). Both ﬂy ash (with its constituents, organic carbon, chlorides of alkali
and earth metals, metal activators and catalysts) and dioxin/furan precursors in the gas phase
play a role in the formation of dioxins (Stieglitz et al., 1989). In addition to this, parameters 
such as oxygen, water vapour and temperature have to be considered (Fielder, 1998). Dioxin

generation occurs mainly in dedusting equipment, especially electrostatic precipitators (Vogg,
1995). There is evidence that both reactions in the gas phase and reactions on particle surfaces
play a role in the formation of dioxins (Hutzinger and Fielder, 1991), and there are indications
that the mechanisms of these reactions are different. 
No signiﬁcant effect of the PVC content of waste on the formation of dioxins has yet been
established (Chang, 1996), although some studies have related the inputs of dioxins and furans
in the waste to the outputs (Obermeier, 1990). 
In summary, there are several factors that affect the formation and emission of dioxins and
furans: the composition and properties of the waste, the combustion conditions, the composi-
tion of the ﬂue gas, the amount of particulate matter carried in the ﬂue gas, the ﬂue gas resi-
dence time and temperature, the cleaning equipment used to control particulate matter and its
operating temperature and the method used to control acid gases combined with the one used
to control particulate matter (Kilgroe, 1995). It is not yet known which of these factors has the
most inﬂuence on dioxin formation. 
Despite de novo synthesis, however, the levels of dioxin emitted from a well-operated MSW
incinerator are considerably less than the levels in the input, as shown in Figure 12.5. Overall
modern incinerators act as net destroyers of PCDD/PCDF.
Historically, incineration was the biggest source of dioxin emissions to air in the UK. Her
Majesty’s Inspectorate of Pollution estimated that municipal waste incinerators released
between 460 and 580 g TEQ of dioxins compared with a total UK release of 560–1100 g 
TEQ in 1995 (HMIP, 1995). This ﬁgure had dramatically fallen to just 4.7 g TEQ by 1998 (UK

Environment Agency, 1999). This reduction was due to the new emission controls that came
into force at the end of 1996 (these included a 1 ng/m3 limit on dioxins) and resulted in the 
closure of a number of old municipal incinerators and the upgrading of the gas-cleaning 
technology of the remaining incinerators. 
Gas-cleaning equipment
The technologies employed to carry out the necessary ﬂue gas cleaning are described below. 
Electrostatic precipitators (ESP) 
Electrostatic precipitators are used for particle control. They use electrical forces to move the
particles ﬂowing out of the gas stream onto collector electrodes. The particles are given a 
negative charge by forcing them to pass through a corona or ionising ﬁeld. The electrical 
ﬁeld that forces the charged particles to the walls comes from discharge electrodes maintained
at high voltage in the centre of the ﬂow lane (Steinsvaag, 1996). When particles are collected
they must be carefully removed to avoid them re-entering the gaseous stream. This is achieved
by knocking them loose from the plates and by intermittent or continuous washing with water. 
ESPs act only on the particles and not on the entire gaseous stream. The removal efﬁciency
for particles is more than 99% with a low pressure drop. The performance of the equipment
is affected by particle size and other physical characteristics such as gas stream temperature,
ﬂue gas volume, moisture content, gas stream composition, particle composition, and particle
surface characteristics (Clayton, 1991).
ESPs come in one or two stage designs and can have different conﬁgurations: plate wire, ﬂat
plate and tubular, These conﬁgurations can be wet or dry depending on the method of dust
collection. Plate wire precipitators are widely used in solid waste incineration facilities because
they are well suited to handle large volumes of gas. In this conﬁguration, gas ﬂows between
parallel plates of sheet metal where weighted high voltage wire electrodes hang. The gas must
ﬂow sequentially over each wire within each ﬂow path. This distribution allows parallel opera-
tion of many ﬂow lanes. The removal of the particles captured by the collecting walls is done by
banging on the plates. The banging can dislodge some of the particles back into the gas stream,
reducing the efﬁciency of the process. Some of these released particles are re-captured in
other sections downstream of the same cleaning process, but the particles re-entering the
stream from the last section are not recaptured and escape the cleaning unit (Benitez, 1995;
Steinsvaag, 1996).
Wet precipitators 
The conﬁgurations described above can be cleaned using a continuous or intermittent ﬂow of
warm water mixed with detergents. Re-entrance of particles caused by banging operations is
minimal, but washing makes the device more complex, and water treatment has to be consid-
ered including the cost of disposing of the sludges formed (Steinsvaag, 1996).
Two-stage precipitators 
Two-stage precipitators separate the charging and collection stages to optimise the electrical
conditions for each stage. Due to the fact that charging requires high current density and elec-
tric ﬁeld and collection requires high electrical ﬁeld but much less current a discharge electrode
(ioniser) is placed before the collector electrodes. 
Mass-Burn Incineration of MSW 
287
Elements of IWM

Fabric ﬁlters 
In fabric ﬁltration, the gas ﬂows through a number of ﬁlter bags placed in parallel, leaving the
dust captured by the fabric. Extended operation of a fabric ﬁlter requires periodic cleaning of
the cloth surface. After a new fabric goes through a number of cycles of use and cleaning, it
forms a residual cake of dust that becomes the ﬁlter medium, which is responsible for the high-
ly efﬁcient ﬁltering of small particles that characterises fabric ﬁlters. They are widely accepted for
control of particulate emissions. The type of cloth fabric limits the temperature of operation of
fabric ﬁlters: cotton is the least resistant (355 K) while ﬁberglass is the most resistant (530 K).
This temperature requirement makes the use of a cooling system necessary for the gas before
it enters the equipment, but it is also necessary that the temperature of the exhaust gas stream
is maintained above the dew point because liquid particles block the pores in the fabric very
quickly. The major difference between different conﬁgurations of fabric ﬁlters is the cleaning
method used during operating cycles. 
Shaker cleaning 
Here the bag is suspended from a motor-driven hook or framework, which oscillates, and such
motion creates a sine wave along the fabric, which dislodges the collected dust. The dust falls
into a hopper below the compartment.
Reverse-air cleaning 
This method was developed as a less intensive way to clean the bags. Gas ﬂow to the bags is
stopped in the compartment being cleaned and a reverse ﬂow of air is directed through the
bags. This gently collapses the bags and the shear forces developed remove the dust from their
surface.
Pulse-jet cleaning 
This form of cleaning forces a burst of compressed air down through the bag expanding it vio-
lently. The fabric reaches its extension limit and the dust separates from the bag. Bags are
mounted on wire cages to prevent their collapse while the dusty gas ﬂows through them. The
top of the bag and cage assembly is attached to the equipment structure, whereas the bottom
end is loose and tends to move in the turbulent gas ﬂow. 
Scrubbers (wet, dry, semi-dry)
Scrubbers are used to control acid gases leaving the incinerator.
Dry scrubbing 
This process works by injecting an alkaline reagent (Ca(OH)2) into the ﬂue gas as a ﬁne dry
powder in an up-ﬂow reaction tower. This equipment is usually ﬁtted after a boiler and before
the particulate control system. In the most common design, the gases enter the bottom of the
reaction tower and the reagent is injected pneumatically through one or more nozzles.
Cyclone effects are used to promote good mixing of the powder and the gas. Most of the 
reaction product and the unreacted Ca(OH)2 is carried in the gas stream and removed in the
particulate control system along with dust and ﬂy ash. A small amount of material is deposited
in the bottom of the tower and removed by a conveyor. Gas residence time in the tower is
generally longer than in a semi-dry or wet system (Loader, 1991; Pritchard, 1995).
288
Chapter 12: Thermal Treatment
Elements of IWM

The system requires cooling of the gas to temperatures below 180oC before entering the
process. This is necessary because acid gas removal efﬁciencies are improved below this tem-
perature. Volatile metals such as mercury can be captured because they precipitate out at
lower temperatures (and the reformation rates for dioxin and furans are also reduced).
Dry injection systems are recommended to be used in combination with bag ﬁlters instead
of ESPs. The performance of acid gas removal is enhanced by the bag ﬁlter’s cake, which pro-
vides an additional reaction surface. 
Semi-dry scrubbing
Here the alkaline reagent is introduced as a wet slurry, but the residues from the process are
dry. The ﬂue gases leaving the incinerator enter the top of the reaction tower at around 230oC.
Flow spreaders ensure good mixing and an even ﬂow downwards (Loader, 1991; Pritchard,
1995). The reagent is injected as a spray of ﬁne droplets, and the acid gases are absorbed
into the aqueous phase on the surface of the droplets and neutralised. The water evaporates
on its movement downwards leaving only a dry powder consisting of calcium chloride, 
sulphate, sulphite and unreacted calcium hydroxide. Some of this material is deposited in the
bottom of the tower, but most is removed from the ﬂue gas by the particle control devices.
This equipment is slightly more complicated than the dry injection system and requires a slurry
make-up system.
Semi-dry systems can be used directly on incinerator ﬂue gases at high temperatures, but it
is preferable to reduce the gas temperatures below 220oC to improve abatement perform-
ance for acid gases and volatile metals and reduce the reformation of dioxins and furans (Clay-
ton, 1991). These systems are often used in combination with an ESP to increase the efﬁciency
of the particulate control device. If a bag ﬁlter is used, acid gas removal is also enhanced as the
ﬂue gases pass through the ﬁlter cake, which contains alkaline ﬂy ash plus any unreacted
hydroxide (Loader, 1991; Pritchard, 1995).
Wet scrubbing 
Wet scrubbing removes acid gases by direct contact with a washing solution. Particulate matter
is also removed to some extent by sticking to water droplets or wet surfaces. These processes
are deﬁned as wet systems because they produce a wet efﬂuent. There are many more
designs for this equipment than there are for dry or semi-dry systems. The principle remains
the same, however; the ﬂue gases pass through a reaction tower in which the acid gases are
removed by direct absorption into an aqueous washing solution. The ﬂow inside the tower can
be upwards or downwards. The washing solution varies; it can be water for highly soluble
compounds such as HCl and HF and some metal compounds, whereas for SO2 removal an
initial water wash stage can be followed by washing with an alkaline solution of NaOH
(Pritchard, 1995).
Nitrogen control 
Process optimisation and combustion controls such as ﬂue gas recirculation are used to control
nitrogen oxide emissions. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to use ﬂue gas treatment to
ensure low emission of NOx. In such cases, two technologies are used: selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) (Clayton, 1991; Loader, 1991;
Pritchard, 1995).
Mass-Burn Incineration of MSW 
289
Elements of IWM

SCR requires the injection of ammonia into the ﬂue gas. After this stage the gas moves
through a catalyst bed of base metals (copper, iron, chromium, nickel, etc.). This technique
reduces NOx emissions by up to 90% (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993).
SNCR uses the same principle of ammonia injection but no catalyst is used. The ammonia is
injected directly into the furnace as a gas. The removal efﬁciencies achieved are between 50
and 80% (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993).
Treatment of solid residues
The bottom ash, once it has been cooled in the quench tank, is usually passed under an over-
head magnet to recover any ferrous metal. Around 90% of the ferrous metal can be recovered
this way (IFEU, 1992). The remaining bottom ash, and the ﬂy ash and residues from gas clean-
ing then require disposal.
MSW contains inorganic pollutants, of which heavy metals form an important group (as list-
ed in Table 12.4 and in Table 8.8) The chemical nature of these may be modiﬁed by heat, but
they are not destroyed. They will therefore leave the incinerator either in the air emissions,
bottom ash, ﬁlter dust or sludge from gas cleaning. 
The distribution of common inorganic pollutants between these different outputs is shown
in Table 12.4. Due to the volume reduction involved in incineration, considerable 
concentration of these materials will occur in the resulting residues, especially in the ﬂy ash.
This has both advantages and disadvantages. Concentration of pollutants means that the
residues may need to be handled as hazardous wastes, necessitating disposal in special haz-
ardous waste landﬁlls, or further treatment. The converse of this is that being concentrated,
there is less material to render inert and treatment to remove mobile heavy metals (e.g cadmi-
um, mercury, copper, zinc) for re-use is possible (Vogg, 1992). Processes involving solidiﬁca-
tion, washing or melting techniques to render ﬂue dusts safe for ﬁnal disposal are under
investigation (Vogg, 1989).

Bottom ash generally has a low carbon content (1–2%), making this material suitable for dis-
posal to landﬁll, either directly or after further processing. In Japan, for example, ash melting in
a carbon arc furnace is used to reduce the volume of the bottom ash. This produces a vitriﬁed
slag with half the volume of the original ash, but the process is very energy intensive, using up
to 1000 kWh per tonne of ash. Ash recycling is common in several European countries: Den-
mark recycles 82%, The Netherlands recycles 90%, while France and Germany recycle 45
and 50%, respectively (International Ash Working Group, 1997 and Warmer Bulletin, 1999c).
Recent initiatives in the UK have raised the level of bottom ash recycling to 27%, the limiting
factor here being the development of markets rather than technical restrictions, although 
concern over the leachability of bottom ash has persuaded ash recyclers to concentrate on
bound applications such as asphalt, concrete blocks and cement sub-bases for the time being
(ENDS, 1999). 
Burning of refuse-derived fuel (RDF)
Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is produced by a speciﬁc process designed to select the combustible
from the non-combustible fraction of mixed MSW (described in Chapter 10). RDF consists
mainly of the lighter materials in MSW (paper and plastic), which are separated out and shred-
ded to produce ‘ﬂoc’ or non-densiﬁed cRDF. This can then be pelletized to improve handling,
producing densiﬁed RDF (dRDF). Pelletizing the RDF is costly however, with a high energy
consumption, so attention has begun to move to the use of ﬂoc RDF, handled by bulk handling
techniques (Ogilvie, 1992). A similar waste-derived fuel is used in some industries, notably the
cement industry, where shredded MSW can be used as a partial replacement for coal (Warmer
Bulletin, 1993b).
Coarse cRDF can be burned in a ﬂuidised bed incinerator (ETSU, 1993), and densiﬁed
dRDF can be burned in either a ﬂuidised bed or on a conventional grate.
The beneﬁts of using RDF, and cRDF in particular, have been summarised as follows (RCEP,
1993):
1. cRDF has a higher caloriﬁc value than raw MSW and is more uniform in combustion 
characteristics
2. cRDF contains much less non-combustible material than MSW, so there is less ash left for
disposal
3. overall efﬁciency is higher since the combustion characteristics can be tailored more 
precisely to the fuel speciﬁcation.
The air emissions from the Robbins Resource Recovery Facility, Illinois, where MSW is
processed to form high-quality cRDF, which is then combusted on site, are presented in Table
12.5. The emissions from both of the facility’s chimney stacks are well within the required lim-
its due to effective combustion of the cRDF and a high-efﬁciency air pollution control system.
This air pollution control system treats ﬂue gases using a dry scrubber, a fabric ﬁlter baghouse
and a selective non-catalytic reduction system (SNCR).
Burning of Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) 
291
Elements of IWM

Burning of source-separated paper and plastic
Source-separated fuel is similar in some ways to ﬂoc RDF (above), but would arise from source-
separated collections for materials recycling, rather than produced from a mechanical screening
process (Chapter 10). Current kerbside collection schemes for dry recyclable materials have
demonstrated that high recovery rates for most materials can be achieved (e.g. IGD, 1992). If such
schemes were to be extended country-wide, large amounts of materials would be collected
(Chapter 9). Whilst there is likely to be recycling capacity for metals and most glass, the amounts of
paper and plastic collected are likely to be well in excess of what can be recycled in an environ-
mentally and economically sustainable way. In the case of paper it will always be necessary to inject
virgin pulp into the system to compensate for the degradation of ﬁbre length with each successive
use. There will always be excess paper in the waste stream over recycling requirement. In the case
of plastic, recycling capacity is low because it is still a costly operation, resulting in a premium being
paid for recycled material over virgin. In the case of very lightweight plastic packaging items (e.g.
yoghurt pots, carrier bags, sweet wrappers), recycling is unlikely to be environmentally sustainable
because of the environmental burdens associated with washing and transport.
A logical use of this source-separated paper and plastic that cannot or should not be recycled
is as a fuel, since it has a high caloriﬁc value, and should be relatively free of material unsuitable
for the incineration process, since it is produced by a positive sort at source (compared to a
negative sort from mixed MSW as in the case of dRDF). This alternative fuel could either be
burned in power stations along with conventional fuel (using coal-burning grate technology), 
in small dedicated boilers in industrial plants to provide steam or heating, or in cement kilns. 
Trials are underway to assess the feasibility of such fuel usage (EPIC, 1997). The Association of

Plastic Manufacturers in Europe (APME) believes that emissions data from trial burns in Switzer-
land prove that waste plastic is a cleaner fuel than existing fossil fuels (Cosslett, 1997).
Emission limits
Strict emission limits for solid municipal waste incineration are currently in force in all EC 
countries as a result of the EC Directive for new and existing MSW incineration plants 
(E.C., 1989a, b) (Table 12.6). Old plants that were equipped only with electrostatic preci-
pitators (e.g. in the UK, Clayton et al., 1991) were not able to meet these standards, and
therefore were forced to either upgrade their emission control, to include at least gas scrubbing
equipment, or to shut down. It is possible that some plants failed the requirement for a mini-
mum residence time of 2 seconds at over 850°C, and in these cases retroﬁtting (modifying the
facility after initial installation) would not be an option. 
The improvement in incinerator emissions after retroﬁtting new gas-cleaning technology is
presented in Table 12.7. Retroﬁtting existing facilities to meet higher standards is sometimes a
more attractive option than building a completely new incinerator, although retroﬁtting costs

may be higher than just the difference in cost between a new plant meeting existing standards
and a new plant built to achieve higher performance (EC, 1997a). This is because retroﬁtting
often requires modiﬁcations and changes in design of the additional plant in order for it to ﬁt
existing equipment, which itself may also require modiﬁcation. Retroﬁtting costs range from
approximately 25% to 40% of the new build costs of an incinerator (EC, 1997b).
For the burning of RDF and source-separated materials the position is less clear. In several
countries (e.g. Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and the UK), these materials are legally
considered to be waste, and are therefore subject to the same emission controls as mass-burn
incinerators. Since they involve burning only part of the waste stream, both the variety and 
levels of many pollutants may be expected to be lower than for mass-burn incineration. 
Public acceptability
During the 1980s public concern over emissions from incinerators was very high. This period
saw the growth both of the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome, and of genuine concern
of the environmental effects of airborne emissions from the incinerators then operating. To
some extent, the public debate has failed to separate issues relating to incineration of hazardous
chemicals from those relating to the incineration of Municipal Solid Waste. Also, typically at that
time, dust-collecting electrostatic ﬁlters were the only emission abatement techniques used in
most European countries, giving rise to high levels of HCl, heavy metals and dioxins in stack
gases released. More stringent emission regulations, both on a national and European Com-
munity scale now mean that all new facilities require sophisticated gas-cleaning equipment to
achieve the regulated levels. Emission levels from such incinerators may be sufﬁciently low to
reduce concern over their environmental effects.

Value

Public concern and pressure group focus has turned instead to the perceived incompatibility
of incineration with materials recycling (ENDS, 1992c). If incinerators attempt to maintain a cer-
tain throughput for proﬁtability, this will obstruct schemes to remove certain materials from the
waste stream. This may be true for existing incinerators. For new incinerators, the design phase
should match proposed incinerator capacity to the waste generated from an area, after a given
level of materials recovery has occurred. Figure 12.6 shows that recycling metals and glass and
composting of organics has in fact a very positive effect on the caloriﬁc value of the residue. The
application of Energy from Waste incineration can complement materials recycling by utilising
collected paper and plastic that is in excess of recycling capacity, or when due to market variabil-
ity the prices of recycled paper and plastic fall below those which make recycling economically
feasible. The decision-making process must also take into account the environmental burdens
associated with each of the available processes. Flexibility and informed decision making is the
key to economically and environmentally sustainable waste management systems.

Summary
In this chapter landﬁlling is considered as a waste treatment process, with its own inputs and
outputs, rather than as a ﬁnal disposal method for solid waste. Landﬁlling essentially involves
long-term storage for inert materials along with relatively uncontrolled decomposition of
biodegradable waste. The use of landﬁlling is described and landﬁlling methods are discussed,
including techniques for landﬁll gas and leachate control, collection and treatment. 
Introduction
Landﬁlling stands alone as the only waste disposal method that can deal with all materials in the
solid waste stream. Other options such as biological or thermal treatment themselves produce
waste residues that subsequently need to be landﬁlled. Consequently, there will always be a
need for landﬁlling in any solid waste management system. Landﬁlling is also considered the
simplest, and in many areas the cheapest, of disposal methods, so has historically been relied
on for the majority of solid waste disposal. In several European countries (UK, Eire, Spain), the
USA and virtually all developing countries, landﬁlling continues to be the principal waste dispos-
al method, although as land prices and environmental pressure increase, it is becoming more
difﬁcult to ﬁnd suitable landﬁll sites, and so this position shows signs of changing. 
Not all cases of ‘landﬁll’ actually involve ﬁlling of land. Although the ﬁlling of exhausted quar-
ries and clay pits occurs in many countries (the UK in particular), above-ground structures are
also common. In countries such as Japan ‘landﬁlling’ can also take the form of ‘sea-ﬁlling’, where
material is used to construct man-made islands in Tokyo Bay and Osaka Bay.
The concept of landﬁlling as a ﬁnal disposal method for solid waste can be challenged. 
A landﬁll is not a ‘black hole’ into which material is deposited and from which it never leaves.
Like all the other waste options discussed in this book, landﬁlling is a waste treatment process,
rather than a method of ﬁnal disposal (Finnveden, 1993, 1995). Solid wastes of various 
compositions form the majority of the inputs, along with some energy to run the process. The
process itself involves the decomposition of part of the landﬁlled waste. The outputs from 
the process are the ﬁnal stabilised solid waste, plus the gaseous and aqueous products of
decomposition, which emerge as landﬁll gas and leachate. As in all processes, process 
effectiveness and the amounts and quality of the products depend on the process inputs and
the way that the process is operated and controlled. The same applies to landﬁlling: what
comes out of a landﬁll depends on the quantity and composition of the waste deposited, and

the way that the landﬁll is operated. This chapter considers both the objectives of the landﬁlling
process and the methods used to achieve them. 
Landﬁlling objectives
The principal objective of landﬁlling (Table 13.1) is the safe long-term disposal of solid waste,
both from a health and environmental viewpoint; hence the term ‘sanitary landﬁll’ which is
often used. Sanitary landﬁll describes an operation in which the wastes to be disposed of are
compacted and covered with a layer of soil at the end of each working day (WHO, 1993). As
there are emissions from the process (landﬁll gas and leachate), these also need to be con-
trolled and treated as far as possible.
To a limited extent, landﬁlling can also be considered as a valorisation process. Once collect-
ed, the energy content of landﬁll gas can be exploited, so landﬁlling could be argued to be an
Energy from Waste technology (Figure 2.4). Gendebien et al. (1991) estimated that there are
potentially 730 billion (109) cubic metres of landﬁll gas produced annually from domestic solid
waste, and that this would be equivalent in energy terms to 345 million tones of oil. If allowed
to diffuse freely from landﬁll sites, this landﬁll gas can present a serious risk both to the environ-
ment (methane is a potent greenhouse gas) and the health and safety of local residents
(methane is highly explosive). Collection and control of landﬁll gas is therefore needed for safe-
ty and environmental reasons. Once collected it makes sense to utilise the energy content of
landﬁll gas where it is produced in commercially exploitable quantities. It is not designed as an
Energy from Waste technology, however, since conditions in the landﬁll are relatively uncon-
trolled, and a large part of the gas often escapes uncollected.

Landﬁll can also be considered as a valorisation method when it reclaims land, either from
dereliction (e.g. exhausted quarries) or from the sea (e.g. as practised in Japan), and returns it
to general use. This is not always the case, however, since in many countries such opportuni-
ties are not available, and landﬁlls need to be sited on otherwise useful land. Thus while land-
ﬁlling can be a method for land generation, in most instances it consumes land.
So, although landﬁlling constitutes a means of valorising waste in two limited ways, its prime
objective is the safe disposal of solid waste residues, whether direct from households or from
other waste treatment processes.
Current landﬁlling activity 
Reliance on landﬁll for solid waste disposal varies geographically around the world (Figure
13.1). Countries such as the UK have traditionally used landﬁlling as the predominant disposal
route, partly because of its geology and mineral extraction industry, which has left many empty
quarries that can be ﬁlled with waste. Such sites, however, may not always be in suitable loca-
tions for minimising their environmental burdens (see below). Conversely, countries such as
The Netherlands, where the lack of physical relief and high water table have meant that large
void spaces are not available, have had to develop alternative disposal routes.
Landﬁlling – basic philosophy 
Archaeologists can gather information on the development of human culture by the excavation
of ancient settlements and the surrounding dump sites. Low population densities and a
nomadic hunter-gatherer existence meant that health problems due to solid waste arisings
were minimal. As settled, agricultural-based society evolved the disposal of solid waste became
more of a problem, the solution to which (at least initially) was open dumps. An open dump is
an area of land where uncontrolled deposition of waste materials occur. No distinction
between household and hazardous material is made and the waste is often set on ﬁre to
reduce its volume. Pollution of surface and groundwaters is common as well as migration of
methane from the site. Open dumps cause severe litter problems, noxious odours and the
breeding of disease carriers. The act of scavenging (see below) on such sites has a very adverse
effect on human health.
Today, open dumps occur mainly in developing economies and are a result of limited 
technical and ﬁnancial resources (US EPA, 1998). This leads to inadequate storage at the point of
waste generation and inefﬁcient or deﬁcient collection systems. Open dumping is an unsatisfac-
tory method of ﬁnal disposal as it is an uncontrolled system not based on an engineering design.
To control or eliminate the adverse consequences of open dumps they must be controlled by
isolating them using fencing, managing surface water, groundwater, leachate and landﬁll gas. Clo-
sure is also necessary by capping or even moving the contents to a sanitary landﬁll.
Historically, landﬁlling has consisted of dumping waste in deep earthen pits. Over time, and
with the percolation of rain water, the degradable fractions of the waste decompose and the
resulting products are diluted and dispersed into the underlying soil. On a small scale, this
‘dilute and disperse’ method of operation can be effective, since soils have a natural capacity to

further decompose organic material and to adsorb many inorganic residues. Such sites will still
produce landﬁll gas, however, which will diffuse into the atmosphere, and can cause safety con-
cerns if it is allowed to accumulate. With increasing urbanisation, increased waste generation
and increased difﬁculty in locating suitable and publicly acceptable sites, landﬁlls have increased
in size over time. As a result, dilution and dispersion is no longer an effective way of dealing
with the landﬁll site emissions. Leachate produced by large unlined sites can pose a serious risk
to groundwater supplies. The US Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has estimat-
ed that in the USA, around 40,000 landﬁll sites may be contaminating groundwater (Uehling,
1993).
To address the problems of landﬁll gas emissions and groundwater contamination, most
modern landﬁlls are operated on a containment, as opposed to a dilute and disperse, basis.
Sites are lined with an impermeable layer or layers of mineral (e.g. clay) and/or synthetic (e.g.
geotextile) liner, and include systems for collecting and treating both the resulting landﬁll gas and
the leachate. 
In Germany, for example, 94% of all municipal waste landﬁlls are lined and collect and treat
leachate prior to release into public sewage systems (UBA, 1993). The quantity of leachate
produced in a landﬁll depends on, amongst other things, the amount of water that percolates
into the site from rainfall and groundwater, so there has been a further tendency to seal the
landﬁll by capping and make the whole structure water-tight. Since 1993, for example, all land-
ﬁlls in the USA have to be kept sealed and dry, with plastic membranes isolating them from per-
colating rain and groundwater (Uehling, 1993). Dry containment will also reduce the initial
production of landﬁll gas, since a high moisture level is necessary for biodegradation. The
methanogenic micro-organisms, for example, require a moisture content of over 50% to be
active (Nyns, 1989). 
The dry containment method of operating a landﬁll has been described as long-term storage
of waste rather than waste treatment or waste disposal (Campbell, 1991), and does have
some signiﬁcant drawbacks. There will always be pockets of moisture within waste, and it is
generally accepted that all lining and capping systems will eventually leak, so rain and/or
groundwater will eventually enter the site. Thus the decomposition of the organic fraction of
the waste will eventually occur, with resulting emissions of landﬁll gas and leachate. Since pipes
and pumps buried within the waste eventually block and fail, there will be less chance of col-
lecting and treating these emissions if they occur in the distant future. In place of such dry con-
tainment, therefore, some experts are advocating almost the opposite: the acceleration of the
decomposition process by keeping the waste wet. This can be achieved by recirculating the
leachate collected within the landﬁll to keep conditions suitable for microbial activity. In this way
most of the gas and leachate production will occur in the early years of the landﬁll’s life, while
gas and leachate collection systems are operating effectively. By the time that the lining system
eventually fails, the leachate should be very dilute and so reduce the risk of groundwater pollu-
tion. Operating the landﬁll in this way as a large ‘bioreactor’ also means that the gas is given off
at higher rates, so making energy recovery economically more attractive. Further research with
the wet bioreactor method is required, however, before it replaces dry containment as the
preferred landﬁlling technique.

Landﬁll siting
No discussion of landﬁlling can neglect the problem of ﬁnding suitable, and publicly acceptable,
sites. Along with local residents’ concerns over trafﬁc, noise, odour, wind-blown litter (and
resultant effects on local property values), groundwater pollution has also recently become an
important issue in selecting suitable sites. Since all landﬁll sites are likely to leak eventually, new
landﬁlls should not be placed within the catchment areas of groundwater abstraction points,
where the contamination of drinking water could occur. Ideally, they should not be sited at all
on major aquifers, where the potential for groundwater percolation would be greatest. Ideally,
any new landﬁlls should be located over minor aquifers or non-aquifers (Harris, 1992). On
these grounds, the UK National Rivers Authority (now part of the UK Environment Agency)
produced a national Groundwater Vulnerability Map, which will be used to assess the ground-
water contamination potential of any new landﬁll developments. What has already become
clear, however, is that most suitable void space for landﬁlling in the UK occurs above major
aquifers. This is because most quarries, which form the bulk of suitable void space, have been
developed to extract chalk, sandstone and limestone, which form the majority of the major UK
aquifers. Thus, although the UK may have an abundance of void space for landﬁlling, in terms
of groundwater protection, it is not necessarily in the right place. As in other countries, it may
be necessary in future to consider greater use of above-ground sites located on non-aquifers
(Harris, 1992). Some of the main factors that must be considered when evaluating a potential
landﬁll site are listed in Table 13.2.

Table 13.2 Landﬁll siting considerations

Landﬁll site design and operation
The structure of one form of lined landﬁll site for containment of leachate is shown in Figure
13.2. The bottom liner of the site can either be a plastic (often butyl rubber or HDPE) or a
layer of another low-permeability material such as clay. Whilst the permeability of the synthetic
material is lower, they are vulnerable to mechanical puncture and so can then act as a point
source for leaking leachate. By comparison, clay barriers (often a number of metres thick) are
not subject to such localised failure, though they act as a diffuse source of leachate over the
whole area of the landﬁll site (Campbell, 1991). 
As well as a choice of material types, there is also a range of options in the way liners are 
laid down. As liner systems increase in complexity their costs will increase, but the risk of failure
decreases, so there is less likelihood of expensive remediation work following leakages. The
simplest form of barrier consists of a single liner, normally with a leachate collection system
above the liner. Rather than rely on one type of liner material, a single composite liner 
system has two or more liners of different materials in direct contact with each other. In this
design it is common to have a leachate collection system above a plastic liner, on top of a low
permeability clay layer. The liner system shown in Figure 13.2 is a double liner system: two
liners with a leachate collection system above the upper (primary) liner, and a leachate 
detection system between the two layers. The leachate detection system has a high permeabil-
ity to allow any leachate that has leaked through the primary liner to be drawn off. Again, 
each layer in a double liner system may either be a single liner or a composite of two or more
materials (Deardorff, 1991). A detailed cross-section of the liner systems required in Germany
for materials containing different amounts of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is presented in 
Figure 13.3.

Once the liner system has been installed, a cover of clay, soil or other inert material is nor-
mally applied to protect it from mechanical damage. Waste is then deposited and compacted,
and layers of inert material (soil, coarse composted material) are normally added to sandwich
the waste. The actual working face of the landﬁll is kept small and the fresh waste is covered by
landﬁll cover material at the end of every day to reduce the nuisance from wind-blown material,
and to keep off rodents, birds and other potential pathogen-carrying vermin.
Landﬁll leachate
The leachate collection system normally consists of a network of perforated pipes, from 
which the leachate can be either gravity drained or pumped to a leachate treatment plant. 
The most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on leachate quantity is the amount of rainfall, which will vary 
seasonally. Leachate production begins shortly after the process of landﬁlling begins and may
continue for a period of hundreds or possibly thousands of years. This is demonstrated in 
Figure 13.4, which presents an estimation (based on the model of Baccini et al., 1992) of the
time when different compounds in leachate will no longer be considered harmful to the envi-
ronment.
A storage sump or pool is often used so that surges in leachate production can be ﬂow bal-
anced before entering the treatment process. Landﬁll management practices greatly affect
leachate quality. Acceleration of the early phases of decomposition is needed to produce low
concentrations of organic matter and heavy metals in the leachate (Carra and Cossu, 1990).
This can be facilitated by having a low waste input rate, moisture control (by leachate recircula-
tion) or by having a composted bottom layer of waste. Leachate treatment can be carried out
on or off site by physical, chemical or biological methods. One of the most common methods
of leachate treatment is the use of aerated lagoons.

Landﬁll gas

The key processes and pathways that impact on methane release from landﬁlls are shown in
Figure 13.6. Landﬁll gas is collected using a system of either vertical or horizontal perforated
pipes. Since the gas will migrate horizontally along the layers of waste, vertical collection pipes
are likely to collect gas more effectively. The density of pipes will vary across the landﬁll, with
the greatest density needed at the periphery to prevent the migration of the gas laterally from
the site. Pumped extraction of gas is needed for efﬁcient collection, and thus less odour and
emission problems. Once collected, the gas can either be ﬂared off, to destroy the methane
and organic contaminants, or used as a fuel. As produced, landﬁll gas is saturated with water
vapour, and contains many trace impurities. This leads to a highly corrosive condensate, so if
the gas is going to be used in a gas engine for energy recovery, gas cleaning is normally
required. Similarly, if the gas is to be piped elsewhere for use as a fuel, in many cases it is puri-
ﬁed to remove the contaminants and the carbon dioxide, the latter to increase its caloriﬁc
value.
The rate of gas production also depends on how the landﬁll is managed. From a commercial
point of view, gas utilisation appears to be proﬁtable from about 1 year after the waste is land-
ﬁlled, and can be expected to continue to be so for no more than 15–20 years (Carra and
Cossu, 1990). In the USA there were approximately 150 landﬁll gas recovery with energy gen-
eration schemes operational in 1997; this was expected to rise to over 200 schemes by the
end of 1998 (Thorneloe et al., 1997). Approximately 100 schemes were operational in the UK
by 1997, generating a total output of 190 MW (ETSU, 1996a). More than 25% of all Canadian
landﬁll gas is recovered for energy generation, while in Germany approximately 65% of municipal
waste landﬁlls recover energy from landﬁll gas (Warmer Bulletin, 1997b).
Waste inputs
The above measures to ensure safe disposal of landﬁlled material are based on containment,
collection and treatment of emissions. As with all processes, however, the emissions will

depend on the inputs, i.e. on what waste is placed in the landﬁll in the ﬁrst instance. Restricting
the type of waste entering the landﬁll can ensure that fewer emissions are produced. This strat-
egy has gained ground in several countries. The German T.A. Siedlungsabfall (1993) ordinance,
for example, deﬁnes the characteristics of waste that can be deposited in each of two classes of
landﬁll. Class 1 landﬁlls will only accept waste with a total organic carbon (TOC) content of 
≤1% (See Figure 13.3). This means that the material will have to be incinerated before 
landﬁlling, as biological treatment cannot achieve this low level of TOC. Class 2 landﬁlls will
accept up to 3% TOC, but there are stricter requirements on the construction of such sites.
Landﬁlling of untreated mixed Municipal Solid Waste will therefore no longer be possible in
Germany by 2005. A key policy development that builds on the concept of the landﬁll ban is
the EC Landﬁll Directive published in 1999. Under the directive, biodegradable Municipal 
Solid Waste landﬁlling must be reduced to 75% by 2006 (compared to 1995 levels), dropping
to 50% by 2009 and 35% by 2016. Member states that landﬁll over 80% of their MSW 
may postpone these targets by a period not exceeding 4 years (EC Landﬁll Directive, 1999a).
This directive will result in many changes throughout the waste management industry in
Europe. Germany has gone one step further than this in a strategy unveiled by their environ-
ment ministry in August 1999, which states that all landﬁlling of German household waste
should be phased out by 2020. This calls for treatment techniques to be developed so that all
domestic wastes can be recovered ‘fully and environment-compatibly’ within two decades.
Currently, some 60% of the 30 million tonnes of domestic waste arising annually in Germany
is landﬁlled (ENDS, 1998).
In marked contrast to this restriction of landﬁll inputs, the UK has consistently argued in
favour of the co-disposal of certain forms of industrial and potentially hazardous waste with
Municipal Solid Waste. The rationale is that the difﬁcult-to-treat materials are diluted and can be
decomposed along with the normal solid waste. In a landﬁll, however, there is little control
over this process, and the potential for serious groundwater pollution should such landﬁlls leak
is signiﬁcant, so it is hard to view this as an environmentally sustainable method for the future. 
Scavenging
The Oxford Concise Dictionary deﬁnes a scavenger as ‘a person who seeks and collects discard-
ed items’; given this, scavenging has been an ongoing practice in waste management systems
since waste management began. Scavenging occurs at collection sites and landﬁll sites in 
developing countries and also in some developed countries. The practice is most prevalent 
in developing countries where social problems such as poverty, lack of training, education and
jobs, and homelessness force the poorest of the poor into surviving on the discarded material
of the rest of society. In developing countries scavengers are unfortunately part of most waste
management systems. Table 13.4 shows how widespread this existence is for many people in
developing countries.
Scavenging of waste can be split into two main types: scavenging for survival, where the tar-
get materials are food, shelter and clothing, and scavenging for revenue-generating material
such as plastic, paper, glass metal and fabrics. Whatever type of scavenging activity is being 
carried out, the danger and ill effects associated with working and/or living on a landﬁll are 
signiﬁcant. The immediate physical dangers of working on a landﬁll include working alongside
Scavenging 
307

heavy machinery, material slides, ﬁre/explosions, cuts or abrasions from contaminated sharps,
rodent bites, exposure to H2S from landﬁll gas and contamination of drinking water by
leachate. Long-term exposure to such conditions results in higher disease levels amongst scav-
engers (from a detailed review by Cointreau-Levine, 1997).
The situation with scavengers is by no means ideal, but must be addressed by waste plan-
ners in areas where scavenging is an issue, when the planners are designing new waste man-
agement systems. Outright banning of scavengers from landﬁlls is not the answer as this would
result in the scavengers having no means of earning a living or even just surviving, and would
therefore increase the social problems of the area.

Table 13.4 Studies on different aspects of landﬁll scavenging

The following recommendations for landﬁll managers were made by Boswell and Charters
(1997) to minimise the negative impact and maximise whatever positive beneﬁts can be gained
from the practice of scavenging.
1. Separate high-value loads from the general waste stream.
2. Separate activities of scavenging from the working face of the landﬁll.
3. Formalise the relationship between the scavengers and the site operator.
4. Improve operating standards on landﬁlls, including compaction, daily cover, management of
surface water and leachate, control of landﬁll gas and prevention of ﬁres.
5. Operate close supervision and operational controls at the landﬁll working face.
6. Provide protective clothing for both landﬁll workers and scavengers.
7. Separate scavenger settlements from waste management facilities and landﬁlls. 
Very few people choose to become scavengers, but when the situation forces people to
choose between starvation, crime and scavenging, many in the developing countries resort to
life on the landﬁlls.

Summary
The reprocessing of recovered materials into recycled materials is outside the boundary of the
waste management system modelled in this book. Recovered material that is reprocessed can,
however, be used to replace virgin materials, and this may result in overall savings in energy
consumption and emissions. 
In this chapter the manufacturing and recycling processes used for each material are brieﬂy
described to allow the reader to balance the advantages and disadvantages of materials 
recycling processes against virgin material production processes. The mantra that ‘Recycling 
is best’ is not always true, as the efﬁciency of virgin materials production continues to improve
at a rapid pace and each recycling process must be considered in the context of its speciﬁc 
location, the availability of raw materials, the exact process to be used and the availability of
markets.
This is presented as a ﬁnal option within the computer LCI model, so that savings associated
with the production of recovered material can be considered in the overall balance.
Introduction
According to the boundaries deﬁned in this book, materials recycling processes lie outside the
waste management system (Figure 14.1). In this system, materials destined for recycling cross
the system boundary as recovered secondary materials at the exits of Materials Recovery Facil-
ities, RDF sorting plants, biological treatment plants, mass-burn incinerators or transfer stations
for mono-material bank-collected material. These materials then enter the industrial processing
system for each particular material. This was chosen as the waste management system bound-
ary because at this point the recovered and sorted material has generally re-acquired value (the
secondary materials are sold on to the reprocessors), and so has ceased to be ‘waste’ (as
deﬁned in Chapter 1). Recovered materials, rather than recycled materials, thus form one of
the outputs of this waste management system.
One problem with this system deﬁnition is that it is based on economic criteria, and thus is
not necessarily absolute. As with any commodities, the market value of recovered materials
ﬂuctuates with supply and demand; in the case of recovered materials it can actually fall to a
negative value. A solution to this deﬁnition problem is to include the recycling of the recovered
materials within the waste management system boundary. In such a case, this material would
leave the system as recycled, rather than recovered material (i.e. as metal ingots, granules of

recycled plastic resin, etc.). The energy consumption and emissions associated with transport-
ing the material to the reprocessors, and the processing stages themselves would then also
need to be allocated to the waste management system.
Including recycling industries within the IWM system increases the complexity of the model.
For glass, steel and aluminium, recycling is part of the production process for the virgin material,

so is difﬁcult to separate out. The output of such an enlarged system is recycled material. Pro-
vided that a market exists for this material (i.e. produced at a competitive cost compared to vir-
gin material alternatives) it would then replace virgin materials. The costs and environmental
impacts of the virgin material production would thus be saved. To include these savings within
the present model requires that the virgin material process, from cradle to grave, also be
included within the system boundary. The method used to achieve this in the model is outlined
in Figure 14.2. 
In Chapter 22 (Model guide, Materials Recycling) a set of data on the environmental burdens
and economic costs of reprocessing the recovered materials is provided, to give an indication
of possible savings (or costs) compared to the use of virgin raw materials. This information is
included in the computer model as a ﬁnal option, to allow calculation of the overall environ-
mental burdens and economic costs for an enlarged waste management system that includes
the reprocessing stage and produces recycled, rather than just recovered materials.

Scope of this chapter
 The environmental burdens of collection and sorting of recovered materials are included within the
environmental burdens of the IWM system (A). This is what the IWM LCI model developed in this book
predicts. This chapter attempts to quantify the environmental burdens of converting the recovered material
from the IWM system into recycled material for further use (environmental burden B in the above figure).
Thus: the environmental  burden of an IWM system plus subsequent reprocessing of recovered material to
produce recycled material = A + B.
But using the recycled material leads to reduced virgin material usage and hence savings in
environmental burden C.
Thus, net overall environmental burden of waste management including reprocessing = A + B − C.

system.

Materials manufacturing and recycling processes
Transportation
The ﬁrst stage in the conversion of all recovered materials into recycled materials is the trans-
port from the sorting or collection facility, to the reprocessing facility. The distances involved
clearly depend on the relative locations of the waste management scheme and the reprocess-
ing plants, so there is a strategic need to locate such plants within easy reach of large potential
sources of recovered materials. Brief details of the subsequent reprocessing stages are given
below for each material.
Paper and board manufacturing and recycling
Paper manufacture relies on the fact that wet cellulose ﬁbres bind together with hydrogen
bonds when dried under pressure. Basically paper recycling reverses this process by wetting,
agitating and then separating the cellulose ﬁbres. Estimates suggest that the maximum number
of times paper ﬁbres can be reprocessed is four, so virgin ﬁbre will always be needed (Warmer
Bulletin, 1997c). Approximately 95% of the base material used in paper and board manufacture
is ﬁbrous (AFPA, 1997c) and a large percentage (90%) originates from wood, although crops
such as hemp, jute, ﬂax and bamboo are also used. The ﬁller (mineral additives used to
improve opacity, strength and smoothness) content of some grades of paper approaches 30%.
Many tree species, both hard and soft wood, are used to produce wood pulp. The wood used
for pulp is taken from the parts of the tree that are left after it has been used for other com-
mercial purposes such as construction and furniture making and also from forest thinning. The
paper industry uses approximately 12% of timber world-wide (PPIC, 1999) and 94% of the
wood used by the European paper and board industry comes from managed forests in
Europe; the other 6% comes from North America (PPIC, 1999). 
There are two major processes involved in the conversion of wood to pulp: mechanical
processes and chemical processes. Mechanical pulps are formed by the mechanical separation
of the ﬁbre from the wood matrix. The process results in a high (90–95%) pulp yield. These
pulps are used where opacity and good print quality are needed. The presence of large
amounts of lignin, however, results in reduced inter-ﬁbre bonding (resulting in low tensile
strength) and poor light stability. Mechanical pulps are bleached using alkaline hydrogen perox-
ide or sodium hydrosulphite that maintain a high pulp yield and do not remove lignin. Bright-
ness levels of 80% are common. The process of thermomechanical pulping (TMP) steams
wood chips at 120oC before the ﬁbre is mechanically extracted in a pressurised container. The
resulting ﬁbres are longer and less damaged and therefore give a stronger product than
mechanical pulps with only a slight loss of opacity. Softwoods are the preferred raw material to
produce optimum strength in the ﬁnal product. Chemical treatments can be added to the TMP
process to improve the strength of the ﬁnal product. Such pulps are known as chemithermo-
mechanical pulps (CTMP). The increase in strength is balanced by an associated loss of yield
and opacity. 
Semichemical pulps are produced by mild chemical digestion of wood chips prior to
mechanical separation, and yields are 70–80%. The main use for this type of pulp is corrugat-
ed media. Hardwoods are usually the raw materials for semichemical pulps.
Chemical pulps are produced by chemical digestion of both lignin and hemicellulose. Little
mechanical energy is needed to separate the ﬁbres from the wood matrix. This results in
314
Chapter 14: Materials Recycling

undamaged ﬁbres that are both long and strong. Chemical pulps are mainly used for strength
and performance in a variety of paper and board products. The Kraft process is the principal
chemical pulping process: mixtures of sodium sulphide and sodium hydroxide are the pulping
chemicals and yields are 45–55%. Higher yield pulps contain more lignin and are used in bags
and other products where strength is important. Lower yield pulps are bleached to remove
virtually all of the lignin producing high brightness products (>90%), and are used where per-
manence and whiteness are needed in addition to strength. Historically, elemental chlorine was
used as a bleaching agent, but environmental concerns over the efﬂuents (which contained
dioxins) from these processes resulted in replacement by chlorine dioxide and the develop-
ment of dioxin control processes.
Modern pulp mill processes maintain a white water system that is as closed as possible, so as
much water as is compatible with efﬁcient machine operation is recycled. Since 1975 water
usage has been reduced by 70% (PFGB, 1999) due mainly to better ‘housekeeping’. The
result of this is that 36 m3 water was used per tonne of pulp produced in 1992 (Warmer Bul-
letin, 1997c). Fibre recovery from discharged water is undertaken using ﬁltration, ﬂotation and
sedimentation. Pulp mills often use settling tanks and biological treatment methods followed by
further settling to treat liquid efﬂuents. These treatment processes themselves result in the
production of sludges that require appropriate disposal. 
Over the past 10 years energy consumption has been reduced by 30% (PFGB, 1999),
which has largely been due to improvements in energy efﬁciency, paper machine performance,
improved boiler efﬁciencies and a move to Combined Heat and Power (CHP) boilers, which
are at least twice as efﬁcient as conventional fossil fuel electricity power stations.
In 1997, the waste paper ‘recovery rate’ in Europe was 48.9%, the world average was 37%
and the leaders of waste paper recovery in the developed countries included the USA (45%),
Canada (45%) and Japan (53.1%) (CEPI, 1999). Waste paper reprocessing varies according to
the type of recycled paper product, which will in turn determine the type of waste paper that
is used as the process feed stock. Waste paper is graded into numerous categories (11 in the
UK; 23 in the USA; ﬁve main grades in Germany, with 41 sub-grades: the Confederation of
European Paper Industries list consists of ﬁve main grades and 64 sub-grades) according to
quality (Cathie and Guest, 1991). The higher quality grades (UK grades 1–4) (paper mill pro-
duction scrap, ofﬁce and writing papers), which need little cleaning, are used to make printing
and writing papers, tissues and wrapping papers, and are known as pulp substitute grades since
they are used to replace virgin pulps. Newsprint (UK grade 5) and other papers needing de-
inking are reprocessed for further use in the production of newspaper and hygiene papers. The
lower (bulk) grades (UK grades 6–11) are mainly used for the production of packaging papers
and board.
The details of the process stages will vary according to whether pulp substitute grades,
newsprint or bulk grades are treated, but the basic steps are shown in Figure 14.3. After an ini-
tial soaking, the waste paper is pulped to separate the ﬁbres, screened to remove contaminants,
de-inked, thickened and washed. During these reﬁning processes both nuisance materials and
some ﬁbres are removed from the system; such losses have been estimated at 15% for
newsprint reprocessing (Shotton, 1992). Therefore, the input of one tonne of recovered paper
will result in the production of approximately 850 kg of recycled paper. 
The rejects, efﬂuents and sludges generated by the recycling process include inks and solid
pigments, adhesive particles, small plastic particles and wax, short cellulose ﬁbres, paper ﬁller

and coating particles and large solid materials such as grit, wire (paper clips and staples) and
ceramics. Treatment and disposal of these wastes tend to be more complicated and costly than
treatment and disposal of efﬂuents and sludges from virgin pulp mills due to the increased vari-
ability and contamination of the raw waste paper feedstock.

which raw materials are converted at high temperatures (1420–1600oC) to a homogeneous
melt that is then formed into products (see Figure 14.4). Raw materials are selected according
to purity, supply, pollution potential, ease of melting and cost. Sand is the most common ingre-
dient, of which purity and grain size are important. Container-glass manufacture tends to use
sand between 590 and 840 μm for the best compromise between the high cost of producing
ﬁne sand and melting efﬁciency. Transport costs are often three to four times the cost of the
sand, so manufacturing plant siting should be close to a source of good raw materials. Com-
mon colourants for glass include iron oxides, chromium, copper, cobalt and nickel. Colour sep-
aration of recycled glass is necessary to avoid colour quality concerns upon remelting.
Cullet, or broken glass is used as a batch material to enhance glass melting. The input of
recovered cullet to the furnace lowers the temperature needed to melt the virgin raw materials,
thus leads to considerable energy savings (Ogilvie, 1992) and it reduces the amount of dust and
other particulate matter that accompanies a batch made exclusively from virgin materials. 
Certain glass-forming operations generate as much as 70% waste glass, which must be 
recycled as cullet. More efﬁcient manufacturing operations, such as the container industry, may
purchase cullet from recycled glass distributors. Typically between 10 and 50% of a glass batch
is comprised of cullet, but operations at 70–80% cullet are not uncommon. For container
glass, a 10% increase in cullet use reduces the melting energy by 2.5%, particulate emissions
by 8%, NOx emissions by 4% and SOx emissions by 10% (Gaines and Mintz, 1994).

The ﬁrst stage of glass reprocessing usually consists of a manual sort to remove gross 
contaminants (plastic bottles, ceramics, lead wine bottle collars) followed by automatic sorting
to remove ferrous contaminants and low-density materials (paper labels, aluminium bottle
tops). The former is achieved by magnetic extraction, the latter by a combination of crushing,
screening and density separation techniques. Around 5–6% of the recovered glass input is
removed in this way (Ogilvie, 1992). The crushed cullet is then ready for mixing with virgin raw
materials, prior to melting in the furnace and blowing or moulding of the ﬁnal glass products.
Recycled glass cullet is not only made into new containers such as bottles and jars, it is also used
for secondary markets such as ﬁbre glass and ‘glasphalt’, paving asphalt using crushed cullet
replacing stone aggregate. Since the use of recovered glass cullet is integrated within the nor-
mal glass production process, in consideration of the environmental burdens, glass reprocess-
ing will be considered up to the production of ﬁnished glass containers. 
Ferrous metal manufacture and recycling
Steel is essentially an alloy of iron and carbon. It contains less than 2% carbon, less than 1%
manganese and small amounts of silicon, phosphorous, sulphur and oxygen. Steel is made by
smelting iron ore in a furnace to produce pig iron, which is added to melted down scrap steel
before being further puriﬁed. Iron ore is the fourth most common element in the earth’s crust.
The abundance of the raw materials necessary for steel production (iron ore, coal, limestone
and scrap steel) and the relatively low manufacturing costs have resulted in the widespread use
of steel we see today. There are two main types of furnace used in the production of steel. The
basic oxygen furnace that produces sheet steel uses a minimum of 25% scrap steel, while the
electric arc furnace uses almost 100% scrap steel. The mechanical properties of steel can be
varied over a wide range by changes in composition and heat treatment. Mild steel contains
less than 0.15% carbon, medium steel contains 0.15–0.3% carbon, while hard steel contains
greater than 0.3% carbon. Stainless steel is a high alloy steel containing greater than 8% alloy-
ing elements such as chromium, nickel or silicon. Galvanised steel is steel coated with zinc to
protect against atmospheric corrosion even when the coating is scratched, as the zinc is prefer-
entially attacked by carbonic acid forming a protective coating of basic zinc carbonates. The
steel used for can manufacture is coated in a thin layer of tin (tinplate); this resists atmospheric
oxidation and attack by many organic acids.
Since the 1960s steelmaking has undergone many changes, essentially due to marked
increases in energy costs, the need for better production ﬂexibility and the impact of 
world-wide competition. The competition of other metals and materials and the greater 
availability of scrap has adversely affected the once exhaustive market for steels. Using the 
basic oxygen process, almost pure oxygen is blown onto the surface of the molten iron and
conversion to steel occurs ten times faster than with the old open-hearth process. The 
drawback of this process is that it is limited to the utilisation of 30% scrap. This amount of 
scrap in the steel mix is often barely adequate to utilise the scrap produced at the 
manufacturing plant. Electric furnace processes were initially used to produce special steels for
which the open-hearth process was not suitable. At operating temperatures of 3400oC the 
furnace is highly versatile (comparable to the open-hearth furnace) but most use high percent-
ages of scrap. Common grades of steel can be produced in up to 300 tonne batches in under
3 hours.

Chapter 14: Materials Recycling
Elements of IWM

Energy requirements for the three different steelmaking processes are shown in Table 14.1.
When the energy requirement is weighted according to the different proportions of raw mate-
rials used by the three basic processes, the total amount of energy per tonne of raw steel is
approximately 14 MJ per tonne for the open-hearth and the basic oxygen process compared
to approximately 6 MJ for the electric process. The main reason for this large difference is that
electric steel is almost always made from scrap, therefore energy is not required to reduce iron
oxide to elemental iron. 
It is important to appreciate that currently about 30% of the output of steel products is not
readily recoverable as scrap. Examples of such difﬁcult to recover materials include reinforcing
bars within concrete, wire products such as nails and fencing, buried piping and oil well casings.
It is this quantity of steel that must ultimately be replaced by the mining and reduction of iron
ore.
The use of scrap for steelmaking results in large reductions in air pollution, water use (40%
saving) and pollution, mining wastes and total energy consumption (virgin steel requires 36 GJ
per tonne while recycled steel requires only 18 GJ per tonne, SAEFL, 1998) while also con-
serving iron ore (1.5 tonnes per tonne scrap recycled), coal (0.5 tonnes per tonne scrap recy-
cled) and limestone. Blast furnace slag is used by the construction industry as an aggregate and
for road building. The savings in landﬁll space are also worth mentioning. Recycling operations
do, however generate certain emissions and waste streams that are subject to increasingly strict
legislation, thus increasing the cost of recycling in many cases. Furnaces that use large amounts
of galvanised scrap generate dust from which zinc can be recovered and recycled. US legisla-
tion requires that the dust be processed for recovery if it contains ≥15% zinc. 
Ferrous metal within household and commercial waste is found in the form of iron and steel
scrap, but the majority is in the form of tinplate in food and beverage cans. To reprocess steel
from steel scrap merely involves a sort to remove contaminants, before the scrap is melted and
recast. To produce high-grade steel from tinplate for further use, it must ﬁrst be detinned. This
process, shown in Figure 14.5, consists of shredding the incoming tinplate and removing con-
taminants, before electrolytic removal of the tin plating. The tin, a layer of 0.004 microns, rep-
resents between 0.25% and 0.36% of the input material (Habersatter, 1991; Boustead,
1993b), but the value of this metal makes it worthwhile to recover, melt and recast the scrap
tin for further use. The detinned steel scrap needs to be washed thoroughly to remove process
chemicals, and then baled for delivery to the steel converting plant.
Non-ferrous metal manufacture and recycling
The major non-ferrous metal to be recovered from household waste is aluminium, mainly in
the form of used beverage cans, so discussion of reprocessing will be restricted to this metal.

Aluminium is a silver-white metal obtained from bauxite, a residual rock composed almost
entirely of aluminium hydroxides formed by weathering in tropical regions. Aluminium is the
earth’s third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon) and the most abundant metal in
the earth’s crust (8% by mass).
Aluminium manufacturing is a two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage crushed bauxite is mixed
with hot caustic soda, which dissolves the aluminium oxide. Impurities such as sand can be ﬁl-
tered out and the caustic solution is cooled to crystallise the dissolved aluminium oxide into a
white sand-like powder. The second stage is the smelting process where the aluminium oxide
is dissolved at 900oC. A powerful electric current is passed through the liquid that splits the alu-
minium oxide into aluminium and oxygen. The molten aluminium is drawn off and made into
ingots.
The reprocessing of recovered aluminium is a much simpler and less energy intensive
process than the production of virgin aluminium. The total energy required to produce aluminium
from bauxite ore is around 183 GJ/tonne, whereas the total requirement from scrap is only 8
GJ/tonne (SAEFL, 1998). Reprocessing involves sorting of the recovered metal and then melt-
ing in a furnace (Figure 14.6). Since most aluminium is used in an alloy form with other metals
or coatings, it is necessary to select an appropriate mix of recovered metal to give an ingot of
the correct composition. Sometimes contaminants need to be diluted by the incorporation of
high-grade virgin material to meet more strict speciﬁcations. Aluminium is very reactive and has
a strong tendency to form a dross (an oxide containing other metals). Up to 5% of the molten
metal forms a white dross during processing. To recover the aluminium from the white dross,

salts (usually chlorides) must be added. This treatment produces a secondary dross and dispos-
al of this waste is becoming more carefully controlled and therefore more expensive. New
technologies including centrifugation, ﬂotation, plasma and electric arc melting are being inves-
tigated to recover white dross without the addition of chlorides. 
Plastic manufacturing and recycling
Plastics are made from oil, natural gas, coal and salt. The major feedstock is oil; the petro-
chemicals industry supplies the monomers for plastics production and manufactures a wide
range of additives to modify their behaviour. Plastics are produced by polymerisation, the
chemical bonding of monomers into polymers. The size and structure of the polymer molecule
determines the properties of the plastic material. In their basic form, plastics are produced as
powders, granules, liquids and solutions. The application of heat and pressure to these raw
materials produces the ﬁnal plastic product.
Plastics are classiﬁed as thermoplastic or thermosetting resins. Thermoplastic resins, when
heated, soften and ﬂow as viscous liquids; when cooled they solidify. The heating and cooling
cycle can be repeated many times without the loss of speciﬁc properties. Thermosetting resins
liquefy when heated and solidify with continued heating. The polymer undergoes permanent
cross-linking and retains its shape during subsequent cooling and heating cycles. Thermoset
plastics cannot be reheated and remoulded; however, thermoplastics can be reprocessed by
melting and hence readily recycled.

Almost 85% of all resins produced are thermoplastics and over 70% of the total volume of
thermoplastics is accounted for by the resins: polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Modern Plastics, 1994). They are made in a variety of grades and
because of their low cost are the ﬁrst choice for a large number of applications. A variety of
processing and shaping methods are available to form the desired product, of these processes
extrusion and injection moulding are the most common.
Plastics can be separated from Municipal Solid Waste by householders or at central sorting
facilities. Householders are not easily able to identify different types of plastic and studies indi-
cate that more people take part in source-separation schemes if they are not required to sort
different plastic types (Warmer Bulletin, 1997d). To facilitate sorting ahead of reprocessing the
American Society of the Plastics Industry developed a simple coding system in 1988 (Figure
14.7). The appropriate symbol is moulded into the base of rigid plastic containers. This system
has now been widely adopted. 
After separation of the resin types into individual, or at least compatible fractions, plastics can be
either mechanically or chemically recycled. In mechanical recycling the plastic is shredded or
crumbed to a ﬂake form, and contaminants such as paper labels are removed using cyclone sep-
arators. The ﬂake is then generally washed (this stage may also be used to separate different resins
on the basis of density), dried and then extruded as pellets for sale to the plastics market. 
Chemical recycling involves a more complex process whereby the plastic polymer is broken
down into the monomer form, and then re-polymerised. In this case, as with glass and steel,
the recycled product is indistinguishable from the virgin material. This recycling method has
been developed for certain resins, notably polyethyleneterepthalate (PET), where chemical
recycling via a methanolysis process is commonly used. However, the cost of the monomers
obtained from chemical recycling is frequently higher than the cost of monomers derived from
the traditional chemistry (La Manita and Pilati, 1996). This is often because the polymers
obtained by traditional methods are produced in large plants beneﬁting from economies of
scale whereas recycling plants of similar capacity would require collection over a vast area
incurring high transportation costs. Also contaminants present in polymer wastes require cost-
ly puriﬁcation technology to obtain polymerisation grade monomers. 
Feedstock recycling can treat large volumes of mixed polymer wastes, as the recycled prod-
ucts (oil or gas) can usually be joined to the crude oil stream to undergo traditional treatments.

However, only the basic organic structure is preserved by this technology and the oil or 
gas obtained is currently more expensive than equivalent products from primary fossil
resources.
Textiles
Textiles are manufactured from ﬁbres by a variety of processes to form knitted, woven or non-
woven fabrics. Textile ﬁbres can be classiﬁed according to their origin, either from naturally
occurring ﬁbres (animal, vegetable or mineral sources) or from manufactured ﬁbres (based on
natural organic polymers, synthetic organic polymers or inorganic substances). The scale of the
industry can be judged from the ﬁgures presented in Table 14.2.
Similarly to pulp and paper manufacturing, textile manufacturing requires large amounts of
process water for preparing the ﬁbres, large amounts of energy for processing the ﬁbres into
materials and large amounts of chemicals for dyeing and ﬁnishing the materials. From a Life
Cycle point of view, the energy required to plant and harvest cotton and all pesticides and fer-
tilisers associated with the growing phase must also be taken into account (as it should be for
wood also), as should the consumption of oil for the production of synthetic ﬁbres. 
Natural dyes (colours derived from plant or animal material without chemical processing)
have been used for thousands of years without showing any harmful effects. Synthetic dyes on
the other hand are often resistant to degradation and a few exhibit toxic effects to microbial
populations and can be toxic or carcinogenic to animals. The textile industry, again like the pulp
and paper industry, uses physical, chemical and biological methods for the treatment of the
efﬂuents from manufacturing mills.

Textile recovery has a long history, and has mainly been practised for economic rather than
environmental reasons. Unlike most recycling, a high proportion of textile reclamation takes
the form of reuse and therefore does not involve resource intensive reprocessing. Where re-
manufacturing is involved, such as the re-spinning of ﬁbres to make new products (Figure 14.8),
the procedures are generally less energy intensive and generally have fewer negative environ-
mental impacts than the production of virgin textiles, especially if re-dying can be avoided. 
Of the textiles currently recovered, the majority are re-used as cloth, rather than recycled as
ﬁbres. In the UK, for example, some 26% of recovered textiles are re-used as second-hand
clothing, 40% used as wiping cloths and 22% used as ﬁlling material. Only 7% is actually
reprocessed to produce recycled ﬁbres for cloth production (UK Textile Reclamation Associa-
tion, cited in Ogilvie, 1992). Within Europe the total amount of textile waste was estimated to
be around 4.2 million tonnes in 1995; only 20% of this was recycled (Europe Environment,
1998). The recycling process uses toothed drums, combs and pulling machines to tear the tex-
tiles apart and extract the ﬁbres. As with paper recycling, the process leads to a shortening of
the ﬁbres. Consequently, textiles cannot be recycled indeﬁnitely since at some stage the ﬁbres
become too short to be re-used.

Summary
The following chapters are a guide to the IWM-2 computer model. Each chapter describes the
details of the system boundaries and any assumptions made for each section of the model.
Where necessary, data tables and appropriate references are provided that support assumptions
or the use of either default or generic data. Once this background has been established, each
screen of the model is described in detail. The model does contain a help system and glossary. 
The following text contains a detailed description of the program’s potential applications and
limitations.
Introduction
Who are the potential users of the model?
Decision makers who want to obtain data on the overall environmental burdens and economic
costs of waste management systems, existing or proposed, are potential users. This group will
include individuals with such diverse interests as policy makers, waste management ofﬁcials,
consultants, academics, students and environmental groups.
What are the potential uses of the model?
The model’s most obvious uses are waste management scenario optimisation and compar-
isons. For example, investigating the environmental burdens associated with the implementa-
tion of a kerbside recycling system collecting either paper, or paper and glass, or paper, glass
and metals.
What data are needed to run the model?
The actual data needs of the model are small, as wherever possible default data are provided.
Although it must be emphasised that the more data that can be supplied by the user to describe
the waste management system under study the more accurate the results will be. The model
requires data on the number of inhabitants and households in the area under study, the
amount of waste generated per person per year, a waste characterisation of the area under
study (although default data from a number of countries are provided). Data (such as energy
requirements, operating costs and operating efﬁciency) are also required to describe each of
the waste management unit processes from collection through sorting, biological treatment,
thermal treatment and landﬁlling.

An important data requirement of the model is the description of the System Area electricity
generating grid (Hard coal, Brown coal, Oil, Natural gas, Nuclear and Hydro electric). The 
different methods of electricity generation each produce a signiﬁcantly different range of environ-
mental burdens. It is therefore essential to accurately represent the generating grid of the System
Area to ensure that the environmental burdens associated with electricity use are correctly mod-
elled. The default values in the Advanced screen of the IWM-2 model are based on the UCPTE
model (1994). Users can select generic country data from the list in the Select Country button,
but it is strongly recommended that more speciﬁc data are used if possible. To account for the
savings of environmental burdens associated with electricity generation that is not required, due
to the generation of electricity from thermal treatment, biogasiﬁcation and landﬁll, it is necessary
for the user to specify the makeup of the electricity generation grid that is being displaced. This
would typically be the type of electricity-generating facility in, or closest to the waste management
System Area. The model defaults to the current breakdown of the generating grid, but this can be
edited by the user to displace a single energy type or a mixture of energy types.
The IWM-2 model has no built-in sensitivity analysis function. It is recommended that the
user carries out their own limited sensitivity analysis, by changing individual parameters and re-
running the model and examining the results. The objective of this exercise is to identify the
most critical parameter with respect to the whole waste management scenario under investi-
gation and examine the validity of this data.
What is the goal of the model?
The goal of this model is to be able to, as accurately as possible, predict the environmental bur-
dens and economic costs of a speciﬁc waste management system.
What is the scope of the model?
The scope of this model is to enable a Life Cycle Inventory of a speciﬁc waste management sys-
tem to be carried out. The unit processes included within the model are waste generation,
waste collection, sorting processes, biological treatment, thermal treatment, landﬁll and energy
generation. Second-level burdens (those associated with building and decommissioning of
waste management facilities and equipment) are not included in the model, although they
should be included in the economic analysis. Where assumptions have been made, they are
highlighted (bold italics) and explained in the following text. Data quality is a major issue
throughout the model, as it is with all waste management models. Although default data are
provided where possible, it must be understood that the more high-quality data that can be
collected and input to the model the more accurate the output of the model will be. 
What is the functional unit of the model?
The functional unit of this model is the appropriate management of the total Municipal Solid
Waste arisings of a deﬁned geographical region during a deﬁned period of time (e.g. a year).
What are the system boundaries (cradle and grave) of the model?
The system boundaries of this model are as follows:
1. Inputs (Waste): the point where the waste leaves the household.
2. Inputs (Energy): the extraction of fuel resources.
326
Chapter 15: IWM-2: A Life Cycle Inventory Model
IWM2 Model Guide

3. Outputs (Energy): the electric power leaving an Energy from Waste facility, or from the com-
bustion of landﬁll gas (the electrical energy generated is subtracted from the energy con-
sumed, so is effectively used within the system, and not exported).
4. Outputs (Recovered Materials): material collection bank or exit of Material Recovery Facility,
Refuse-Derived Fuel plant or biological treatment plant.
5. Outputs (Compost): exit of biological treatment plant.
6. Outputs (Air Emissions): exhaust of transport vehicles, stack of thermal treatment plant, 
i.e. after emission controls, stack of power station (for electricity generation) or landﬁll 
lining/cap.
7. Outputs (Water Emissions): outlet of biological treatment plant thermal treatment plant or
power station (electricity).
8. Outputs (Residual Solid Waste): content of landﬁll at end of biologically active period.
Allocation procedure 
Allocation is deﬁned as ‘the partition of the input or output ﬂows (or costs) of a unit process to
the product system under study’ in ISO 14040 (1997). In the IWM-2 model the inputs and
outputs of each of the unit processes (waste collection, central sorting, biological treatment,
thermal treatment and landﬁll) are all done on a mass basis, except for thermal treatment which
is done on a mass and stoichiometric basis. Landﬁll gas and leachate are allocated on a 
component speciﬁc basis (i.e. based on the composition of the material landﬁlled); this
approach takes into account the underlying physical relationships between landﬁlled waste and
gas and leachate production as recommended by ISO 14041 (1998) and ISO TR 14049
(1999).

The IWM-2 computer model
Both the LCI and the economic assessment model are included in one computer model,
which operates in Windows 95 or higher. Based on Figure 15.1, the model follows the solid
waste stream through its Life Cycle. Each of the stages in the Life Cycle of waste is represent-
ed in the model by a window containing input questions. The answers to these questions

deﬁne the waste management system considered. The ﬁrst window of the model deﬁnes the
input, the amount and composition of waste as it enters the waste management system from 
both household and commercial sources. Since the effectiveness of any treatment process, 
e.g. composting, thermal treatment, will depend on what is in the waste stream entering 
the process, it is necessary to keep the different materials separate in the model, even though
they may be physically mixed together. By doing this, it is possible to characterise the material
composition of the waste, and hence also its caloriﬁc value, at any point in the Life Cycle.
The windows in the model represent waste collection, sorting and materials recycling, 
biological treatment, thermal treatment and landﬁlling, respectively. The structure mirrors 
Chapters 8–14 of this book. A description of the input data required for each screen, their 
relevance to the model and the assumptions made by the model are presented in the follow-
ing text. 
Throughout the model the ﬂow of the collected waste can be followed using the Streams
button in the bottom left hand corner of each of the six input windows. Within each window,
as materials are recovered, they are subtracted from the Residue stream and enter into the
Materials stream. Other outputs from processes are entered into the relevant streams
where they accumulate. Total costs for the system accumulate through the Life Cycle to 
produce the economic assessment.
By the end of the Life Cycle, all of the materials will have left the Residual stream and will
have been entered into either the Landﬁll or the Materials streams. This emulates the 
deﬁnition of the ‘cradle’ and ‘grave’ of solid waste discussed in Chapter 5 – the cradle is the 
point at which the material is thrown away (i.e. ceases to have value), the grave is the point at
which the material regains value (i.e. as secondary products) or is released as an emission 
to land, air or water. The model then totals the energy consumption, energy production, 
products, emissions to air, emissions to water and residual solid waste to produce the Life
Cycle Inventory for the solid waste of the chosen region.
The source of each piece of default data provided within the model can be accessed (to 
conform with ISO 14041) by double-clicking the box in which the data appears. A window
called Variable Information opens, containing the following information. 
1. Calculation – if the variable is calculated, the full calculation is shown here. Any other
calculated variable within this displayed calculation may also be viewed by double-clicking the
text description of that variable. This drill-down function ensures that all of the calculations in
the model are completely transparent (another ISO requirement). The drop-down list box
in this window allows tracking of the variables and their calculations viewed using the drill
down method.
2. ISO reference – the term ISO reference has been used to describe a data point or data
set used in the model that requires a full source reference to maintain the transparency of
the model as recommended by the ISO 14040 Standards (i.e. default data contained in the
model rather than user input data).
New users are strongly recommended to initially navigate through the model screens in the
order Waste Inputs, Waste Collection, MRF/RDF Sorting, Biological Treatments,
Thermal Treatments, Landﬁlling and ﬁnally Recycling, until they are familiar with the lay-
out and data requirements of each section of the model. New users are also advised to care-

Welcome to IWM-2 
The IWM-2 model has been designed to work similarly to any Windows program, with the term
‘scenario’ replacing the term ‘ﬁle’. A scenario is a description of a waste management system stored
within the IWM-2 program. The model allows the development of new scenarios and the modiﬁ-
cation of existing scenarios. All scenarios are saved in a directory within the IWM-2 program. 
The LCI model begins by offering the user ﬁve options (Screen 1).
• Select a scenario to open – opens previously saved scenarios. 
• Create a new scenario – allows a new scenario to be created, using default data.
• Setup conﬁguration – where the currency symbol and input screen position can be altered.
• Go to menus – gives access to the drop-down menus for Scenario, Utilities and Help.
• Introduction to IWM-2 – offers a brief introduction to the LCI model, the concept and
principles of IWM and a summary of waste management technology.

Screen 1 Welcome to IWM-2.

Click the option you require and then click OK. When selecting a scenario to open, highlight
the desired scenario in the Existing Scenario list and click OK. The scenario is loaded and its
name is displayed in the bottom left corner of the IWM-2 home screen.
When creating a new scenario the program asks Create a blank scenario? or Use a
template? If a blank scenario is selected the program opens a new version of the model that
only contains default data for certain of the waste management options. All of the default data
can be replaced by user data, if the user has more accurate local ﬁgures than the generic data
provided in the program. To use a template, the program allows the user to select an existing
scenario and use it as a basis for the development of a new scenario. Upon completion, the
program prompts the user to save this new scenario under a new name.
By selecting the Go to menus button, the user moves to the IWM-2 Main Screen
(Screen 2) but can only can view and use the drop-down menus under Scenario, Utilities
and Help. The Scenarios menu offers the user the following choices New, Open, Revert,
Delete and Exit. These menu options allow the user to create a new scenario, open an exist-
ing scenario, move from a changed scenario back to the last saved version of that scenario,
delete an existing scenario or exit IWM-2, respectively. The Utilities menu offers three choic-
es. Setup Conﬁguration allows the user to set the Window placement on screen and select
an appropriate currency symbol. Compare Scenarios is a key function that loads the results
of up to eight different scenarios, compares them and displays the results graphically. What’s
Changed? compares any differences between the mass ﬂows of an existing scenario with 
the previous saved version of that scenario. The Help menu provides access to the Help
contents, a Glossary of terms and a list of Conversion factors.
IWM-2 Main Screen
Once a scenario has been opened or a new scenario has been created the model moves to a
window called IWM-2 Main Screen (Screen 2). 
This screen contains the following control buttons arranged horizontally.
• Save – the save option (safety ﬁrst). 
• Streams – a full breakdown of waste arisings through each stage of the model. 
• Waste Flow – a simple schematic diagram describing the ﬂow of materials in the current
scenario.
• Results – the overall environmental burdens and economic costs of the whole scenario.
• Advanced – where the advanced variables in the model can be altered by the user.
• Notes – where the user can add text, describing the scenario, assumptions, etc.
The buttons arranged vertically are the sub-components (sections) of the overall model and ini-
tially should be opened and data entered sequentially. 
• Waste Inputs – deﬁnes the amount and composition of the waste material entering the
waste management system.
• Waste Collection – describes the waste collection system, allowing its environmental bur-
dens and costs to be calculated.
• MRF/RDF Sorting – describes Materials Recovery Facility and Refuse-Derived Fuel sorting
processes.
The User Guide 
331
IWM2 Model Guide

• Biological Treatments – describes both composting and biogasiﬁcation.
• Thermal Treatments – describes conventional incineration, Refuse-Derived Fuel burn
and Paper and Plastic Fuel burn.
• Landﬁlling – describes the landﬁll process.
• Recycling – describes the recycling of the materials recovered throughout the whole waste
management operation.
Once a scenario has been completed or if an existing scenario is to be edited then the user can
go directly to the appropriate section. 
The Undo button opens a window that lists the last 50 changes made to a Scenario. The
user can select the number of changes they want the model to undo.
The default currency symbol to be used in the model can be changed by clicking the small
button in the bottom right-hand corner of the main screen (a £ sign in Screen 2). 
The modelling procedure begins by the user clicking Waste Inputs and typing appropriate
values into the white data boxes. The white boxes of each screen can be easily navigated by
using the mouse or the Tab button (forwards), or using the Tab and Shift buttons ( ) 
(backwards); the Enter/Return button (↵) has no effect on the model.

Deﬁning the waste input for the LCI computer model 
– data sources
The ﬁrst step in carrying out an LCI for household and commercial waste is to deﬁne the
amount and composition of such waste generated by the area being investigated. As discussed
above, local weighbridge data on amounts and waste analysis results are needed for an accu-
rate estimate. The quantity and quality of household waste will depend on factors such as pop-
ulation density, levels of afﬂuence, housing types and efforts at source reduction. Commercial
waste will reﬂect both the types and level of local commercial activity.
If locally sourced data are not available, generic data contained in the model can be used, but
with caution. It is important to know what the generic data used reﬂects. Does household
waste include garden waste and bulky waste, or does it only include ‘collected household
waste’, i.e. the dustbin contents? Most national waste composition ﬁgures are based on col-
lected household waste; data on delivered household waste often do not exist. Similarly, little
reliable data on commercial waste arisings are available. Thus while generic information can be
used in the absence of local data, it is not an entirely satisfactory substitute.
Classiﬁcation of solid waste used in the Life Cycle Inventory
The categories of solid waste used in this analysis, and their deﬁnitions, are presented in Table
16.1. It will be seen that only the most basic level of the proposed European Recovery and
Recycling Association (ERRA) classiﬁcation (Figure 8.11) has been used. We still consider that
this level of detail remains sufﬁcient, due to the overall (relative) simplicity it affords. Using more
detailed categories will lead to a more accurate prediction of the overall environmental bur-
dens and economic costs of a waste management system, but will considerably increase the
complexity of the model. Here we believe that we have achieved an acceptable balance
between simplicity and accuracy. More sophisticated models are available from the UK Envi-
ronment Agency and the US Environmental Protection Agency.

The Waste Input screen 
This window in the model gathers data on the amount and composition of solid waste enter-
ing the system, from all sources. The instructions given in the window are listed below, with
additional comments on the type of data needed, and how the model handles the input.
The four sections (tabs) within this screen deﬁne the system and all of the household and
commercial waste managed within the system.
Tab 1 System area (Screen 3)
The user ﬁrst deﬁnes the system area.
System Area Deﬁnition:
Population
Average number of persons per household
From these ﬁgures the model calculates the number of households served, which is displayed
below. User data are entered in the white boxes.
Number of households served
This is a calculated value and is therefore displayed in a grey box. This convention is followed
throughout the model. Both the population and the average number of persons per household
need to be entered, as along with the number of households in the speciﬁed area, this allows
both per capita and per household data to be used. 
Residents’ Vehicle Distribution: 
Petrol (%)
Diesel (%)
The split between petrol and diesel cars is required for the calculation of the emissions from
fuel used during journeys to and from bring systems modelled in the Waste Collection window.
Default values of 90% petrol and 10% diesel are provided in the model; these values
can be changed by simply typing over them. If region-speciﬁc data are available, they should be
entered here.
The Waste Input Screen

Screen 3 Waste Inputs – System Area.

Tab 2 Collected Household Waste (Screen 4)
This section deﬁnes the amount of household waste generated in the system area and its 
composition.
Household Waste Generation and Composition:
Amount generated in system area (kg/person/year)
Composition (% by weight) Paper, Glass, Metal, Plastic, Textiles, Organic,
Other, Total
The Total is calculated by the model and can only result in a total composition of 100%
(shown in a green box); if the composition does not equal 100% the Total is shown in a red
box and the user must amend the input data. The model will not allow the user to progress
through the model if this Total does not equal 100%. If region-speciﬁc data are available on
the amounts of household waste generated per capita, and its composition, these should be
inserted. In the absence of region-speciﬁc data the ‘Select Country’ button takes the user to
a Country data table where generic national data on the average amounts and composition of
waste generated is stored. This national data can be selected (by double-clicking any data value
in the row of the desired country) for use in the model. The full reference for each country can
be accessed by double-clicking any one of the data values.
Detailed Metal Composition: (% by weight)
Ferrous
Non-Fe
Detailed Plastic Composition: (% by weight)
Film
Rigid
The model supplies default data for the detailed composition of both metals and plastic in
household waste but again if region-speciﬁc data are available they should be entered here. 
Tab 3 Delivered Household Waste (Screen 5)
This section details the amount of household waste delivered to Central Collection sites. For
simplicity in the model this material has been separated into Bulky Waste (such as furniture and
household appliances) and Garden Waste.

to be entered in the white boxes. No reliable generic data on commercial waste generation
are available for use as default values.
The model calculates the amounts of each waste material entering the system, using the 
categories in Table 16.1, and then adds these totals to the appropriate waste-stream columns.

Summary
The major environmental burdens associated with waste collection systems will be due to the
transport required, which consumes energy and results in signiﬁcant air emissions. The function of
the collection system, after all, is to transport the waste from the household or commercial prop-
erty to the sorting or treatment site. There may be other burdens, however, such as the produc-
tion of plastic bags used in the collection, or the cleaning of bins. This chapter describes the
assumptions made and the data required to complete the Waste Collection section of the model. 
Deﬁning the system boundaries
The system boundaries of the waste collection section of the IWM-2 model are presented in

leaves the household or commercial premises. The collection of household and commercial
waste by kerbside or bring systems, either as sorted fractions or as co-mingled restwaste, are
within the system boundary. The outputs of the system are air and water emissions, residual
waste and secondary materials that are the inputs for other processes (central sorting, biologi-
cal treatment, thermal treatment and recycling). 
Source reduction (e.g. home composting) is considered to be an activity that takes place
outside of the system boundary. The effects of source reduction on a waste management 
system can be modelled by reducing the Amount Generated (kg/person/year) and
appropriately adjusting the Composition (% by weight) in the Waste Input screen. Home
or backyard burning of both household and garden waste is not included in the model as this
activity (which is illegal in many countries) results in uncontrolled emissions to air and should
not be encouraged. The burdens associated with the washing of dry recyclables (such as glass
bottles and jars, plastic containers and metal cans) are also considered to be outside of the sys-
tem boundary. This is mainly due to the difﬁculty of gathering suitable data to model this activi-
ty. If dry recyclables are washed and/or rinsed as part of the ordinary household dish-washing
process, then little in the way of extra burdens could be associated with the waste manage-
ment system. However, if householders wash each dry recyclable item individually then the
overall increase in burdens from energy use (water heating) and water emissions (detergent
use) may become signiﬁcant. This model assumes that if householders have been encouraged
to separate dry recyclables correctly, then they have also been encouraged to wash this 
separated material (only if necessary) as part of their regular dish-washing process.
Environmental burdens due to transport 
The transport involved in collection systems involves a mixture of householders’ cars and
municipal waste collection vehicles, the exact combination varying with the collection method
used. At one extreme, in the use of central collection sites, most if not all of the transport will
involve the use of householders’ vehicles. Low-density materials banks will involve household-
ers driving to the bank sites, and then special collection vehicles emptying the banks and trans-
porting the materials to bulking depots, prior to sale and transport on to the materials
processors. At the other end of the spectrum, close-to-home bring schemes, within walking
distance of each property, and kerbside collections involve only municipal or contractors’ col-
lection vehicles. 
Calculation of the energy consumption and emissions resulting from each type of transport
require data on the distances driven and the average fuel consumption of the vehicles used.
Whilst the latter information is available (Table 17.1), details of distances driven will vary
widely between different areas, so cannot easily be generalised. As a result, these are included
as variable data in this analysis, and have to be inserted by the user for the geographical area
under study.
For bring systems (both central collection sites and low-density materials banks) the number
of special journeys made by car, each year, to the collection sites needs to be estimated, as well
as the average distance. Note that depositing recyclables in a materials bank in a supermarket
car park during a shopping trip would not count, as the transport there could be allocated to
the shopping trip. Theoretically the burdens should be divided between the two functions, but
340
Chapter 17: Waste Collection

this is beyond the level of detail of the present study. Data of this type are not readily available,
but could be acquired for any given region via a consumer survey. Fuel consumption and emis-
sion levels for private cars, (petrol and diesel), are presented in Table 17.1. 
Calculation of the energy consumption and emissions from kerbside collection is less
straightforward. Clearly the stop–start nature of most kerbside collection makes the use of
standard heavy goods vehicle (HGV) data inappropriate. Data for such stop–start kerbside 
collections of dry recyclables from schemes in Adur and Milton Keynes (UK) report fuel 
consumption of 44 and 20 litres per 100 km, respectively (Adur District Council, personal
communication; Porteous, 1992). What are needed for this LCI study, however, are the 
burdens per household serviced, or per tonne of material collected. Calculating this from fuel
consumption data requires the average distance travelled by the collection vehicle per house-
hold visited. Again this will vary with housing density, and with the distance that the collection
vehicle travels from the collection area to the sorting or treatment plant for emptying. This
problem can be avoided by using data that should be available to every collection system 
operator – the average fuel consumption per collection round. Knowledge of the average 
number of households served then allows calculation of the average fuel used per household
visit. Data of waste collected allow conversion into fuel used per tonne collected. The above
reported results from Adur give values of 32 litres per 1000 households visited or 14.3
litres/tonne collected (calculated from data in IGD, 1992), and 7.2 litres/tonne for Milton
Keynes (Porteous, 1992). Kerbside Dublin, a similar scheme collecting dry recyclables, has
reported a fuel consumption of 17 litres per 1000 households visited (5.8 litres per tonne col-
lected) over the ﬁrst 6 months of 1993 (ERRA, personal communication). Fuel consumption
per household visited is likely to be the more reliable measure, however, since the same dis-
tance must be covered by the vehicle, no matter how much waste is picked up from each
property. Consumption of diesel fuel can then be converted into primary (thermal) energy
consumption, emissions to air and water, and solid waste, using the generic data presented 
earlier in Chapter 5 (Table 5.7).
Other burdens
The input boundary for this LCI study has been deﬁned as waste at the point that it leaves the
waste generator, i.e. the household or commercial property (Chapter 5). Any materials need-

ed to get the waste from this point to a collection site or vehicle, (e.g. refuse bags, refuse bins
and recycling bags or bins) will therefore fall within the deﬁned boundaries, and the relevant life
cycle inputs and outputs, from cradle to grave, should be included. It is important to consider
these additional burdens, since the range of collection systems discussed above differ in the
number of different waste fractions collected, and hence in the relative need for different bags
or bins for the collection process.
Collection bags
Although they are normally included in analyses of household waste, collection sacks are not
strictly ‘waste’ during the collection stage as they are performing a useful function, i.e. contain-
ing the waste; they do become waste when the waste is subsequently delivered to a treatment
site (e.g. a Materials Recovery Facility or composting plant). 
Collection bags in common use are either paper or plastic, so the Life Cycle inputs and out-
puts in terms of energy, emissions and solid waste can be calculated from generic production
data for these materials, given the average weight per bag and the average number of bags
used per household per year. The number of bags used will vary with the quantity of waste
generated, size of bags and the degree of waste sorting and separation required in the home.
Sorting the waste into many fractions could lead to the collection of numerous half-ﬁlled collec-
tion bags. The generic data for production of both paper and plastic bags used in this study are
presented in Table 17.2. 
Note that burdens due to small refuse bags that are used to convey waste from the house
to a dustbin or large refuse sack will not be included, since these are part of the waste before it
leaves the property. Similarly, some schemes (e.g. Chudleigh, Devon, UK) use ordinary carrier
bags (plastic grocery bags) for collecting materials such as dry recyclables. Since these would
have been included in the waste stream in any case, the upstream burdens of producing these
bags should not be included.
Collection bins
Inclusion of the production burdens for collection bins in this LCI study is debatable, since 
they can be considered to represent capital equipment, rather than operating consumables.
Under the goal deﬁnition section in Chapter 5, capital equipment was excluded from the study.
However, this would artiﬁcially bias any comparisons between collection systems using different
collection container types. Bins consume a large amount of material (most often plastic) initially,
rather than on a weekly basis, but like bags, bins will also enter the solid waste stream eventually
at the end of their useful life. The burdens of bin use is therefore included; once calculated, it
will be possible to determine whether the burden of this ‘capital equipment’ is insigniﬁcant, as
originally predicted.
It is possible to calculate the relevant burdens from the use of bins given generic data on the
materials used, the weight of material per bin/container, and the expected useful life-span. For
example, the Blue Boxes used for dry recyclables in the Adur scheme in the UK are made from
1.6 kg of injection moulded polypropylene. After 3 years of operation, the boxes start to be
replaced (D. Gaskell, ERRA, personal communication). This gives a requirement of around 
0.5 kg of material, per household per year for this part of the collection. Wheeled bins 
(capacity 240 litres) have a weight of around 15 kg; a 10-year life expectancy would give a
material requirement of 1.5 kg of polypropylene per household per year.

Table 17.2 (continued) Inventory Data for the production of paper and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags and
polypropylene (PP) bins used in waste collection systems

Use of bins can lead to a further source of burdens, due to the need to wash the bins. This
is likely to be relevant where unlined bins are used to collect biowaste, since this can cause
severe odour and/or ﬂy nuisance in hot weather. This source of burdens should also be includ-
ed, especially in comparison of bin versus bag collections for biowaste, but data on the level of
bin cleaning, and on the typical amounts of water, etc. used are not readily available. Assuming
that around 25 litres of warm water (heated 20°C above ambient) are used per bin,
2.14 MJ would be needed. For simplicity it will be assumed that water is heated by
electricity with 100% efﬁciency, so around 0.6 kWh would be consumed per wash.
Any burdens due to the use of cleaning agents should also be included. A Life Cycle study by
Procter & Gamble on hard surface cleaners has shown, however, that the heating of the water
represents the major source of both energy consumption and solid waste generation from
such cleaning operations (P&G internal report), so the burdens of bin cleaning included here
will be restricted to this element.
Pre-treatment of waste
There will also be some environmental burdens due to waste sorting and treatment within 
the household. Some collection schemes for dry recyclables request that food cans, for 
example, are rinsed out prior to collection. These burdens occur prior to waste leaving the 
property, so are not included in this study, but could be included in other LCI studies with more
widely deﬁned boundaries. 
Economic costs
Care is needed when extracting data on the actual costs of individual collection systems.
Although costs are often quoted for various collection and sorting schemes, it is important to
understand exactly what is included in these costs, and equally importantly, what is excluded.
Often, quoted ﬁgures for materials recovery schemes include not only the collection system,
but also the sorting system and the revenues from the subsequent sale of material. Some costs
also include disposal savings for any material that is diverted from landﬁll. If the collection sys-
tems are operated by a municipality the costs of waste collection are often not separated from
other areas of expenditure, so the actual collection cost is not known. 
As with materials recovery systems, comparisons between the costs of different collection
systems require that standard accounting methods are used. A study by ERRA (1998) observed
that ‘the accounting systems used by 11 different European waste management systems were
as different as the systems themselves’. 
To calculate the economic costs of different collection systems it is necessary to use local
data. Salaries, a major component of collection costs, will vary geographically, so no general ﬁg-
ures are applicable. This section presents collected data to demonstrate the typical ranges of
ﬁgures for different countries.
Material bank systems
Data for the collection costs of bring systems are often presented inclusive of the sale of 
the collected material. This revenue is likely to be signiﬁcant compared to the collection cost.
This inclusive ﬁgure will therefore vary with market price ﬂuctuations of the materials. For a
346
Chapter 17: Waste Collection
IWM2 Model Guide

modelling purpose, it is more useful to have the collection cost separated from any subsequent
revenue.
Kerbside collection systems
Collection costs for kerbside collection systems are also quoted in a variety of ways: collection
only, collection plus sorting, collection plus sorting plus sale of recovered materials, collection
plus disposal, etc. Where full and transparent accounts have been published (e.g. IGD, 1992),
it is possible to calculate the contributions of these various components. In the Adur Blue Box
Scheme (W. Sussex, UK) for example, collection of dry recyclables costs 23.16 euro per
household per year (equivalent to 166.51 euro per tonne collected and sold on). Including
subsequent sorting of the material raises this ﬁgure slightly, to 26.45 euro per household per
year (190.17 euro per tonne). When the revenue from sale of materials is included, this 
falls again to 22.37 euro (160.83 euro per tonne) (IGD, 1992). Therefore, in contrast to bring
systems, income from materials is relatively insigniﬁcant in the inclusive cost; the key factor is
the actual cost of the collection.
The Waste Collection screen 
This screen contains ﬁve tabs: System Area, Collected Household Waste, Delivered
Household Waste, Collected Commercial Waste and Summary.
At the outset, it is necessary to stress the need for compatibility between the waste input
data and the waste collection data to be inserted here. The collection section attempts to cover
the majority of possible ways that waste can be collected, for all possible wastes, including bulky
household wastes, garden waste and commercial waste. Clearly all of these must have been
included in the waste generation data used. If, for example, the waste generation data inserted
does not include garden waste or commercial waste, the collection system should not include
their collection.
The program allows up to four Kerbside Collection Systems (KCS) and four Material 
Bank Collection Systems (MBCS) to be modelled together, as often the complete collection 
system of a large city or region is made up of a combination of more than one type of collection
system.
Tab 1 System Area (Screen 8)
The input data here deﬁnes the number and type (up to four of each) of collection systems
used for household waste within the system area. The user must specify the percentage of 
collected household waste managed by Kerbside Collection Systems and/or Material Bank
Collection Systems. The model displays the number of households served by each system.
Individually neither the Kerbside Collection Systems nor the Material Bank Collection Systems
can serve more than the total number of households within the system area, but together they
can serve the number of households in the system area twice. For example, a region may have
a Kerbside Collection System for every household but also provides a system of material banks
for the collection of recyclable material. In this case each household is being served by two 
systems. In the model as in real life, it is not possible to collect more waste than is generated
within the system area as deﬁned in the Waste Input screen.

The sum of the percentages of the Kerbside Collection Systems and the Material Bank 
Collection Systems must both equal 100%, as the user has already deﬁned the total amount 
of household waste collected. In the example shown in Screen 8, the user has speciﬁed that a
single Kerbside Collection Systems services 100% of the population in the system area, a 
single Material Bank Collection System also services 100% of the population in the system
area.
To illustrate the ﬂexibility of this approach to modelling collection systems, another 
example is presented below. Here, three different Kerbside Collection Systems operate 
within the system area, servicing 75%, 15% and 10% of the population, respectively. A single
Material Bank Collection System also serves the whole population; this is represented
schematically in Figure 17.2.

The tab calculates and displays the total amount of each material that is available in kg/house-

Systems (MBCS) that were speciﬁed in the System Area Tab will be available within the 
Collected Household Waste tab (up to a maximum of four sub-tabs for each system). 
Tab KCS#1 
This tab allows the description of a Kerbside Collection System, where collection vehicles pick
up biowaste, recyclable material and restwaste. If no ﬁgures are entered on this tab, the model
assumes that all household waste is collected as co-mingled restwaste either in plastic bags or
bins.

Dry Recyclables:
Material Collected (kg/household/year) Paper, Glass, Ferrous Metal, 
Non-Fe Metal, Film Plastic, Rigid Plastic, Textiles, Total
If separated, the amount of each material collected as dry recyclables is inserted here in the
form of amount per household per year. The model adds the amount of each material collect-
ed and displays the Total in the grey box. 
Kerbside sort?
The model asks whether kerbside sorting occurs, e.g. as in Blue Box schemes. ‘Yes’ is selected
if it occurs, ‘No’ if it does not. Kerbside sorting helps prevent contaminants in the form of non-
requested materials (e.g. organic or other waste) or non-targeted items of requested materials
(e.g. ﬁlms, foils) from entering the recyclables collection system. In the absence of a kerbside
sort, a default ﬁgure of 5% contamination (2.5% organic material and 2.5% other material) by
other waste materials is added at this stage (this can be changed in the Advanced window,
Waste Collection Tab, KCS# Tab if the user has better data). A lower sorting efﬁciency
resulting in 30% residue (which includes contaminants collected and sorting inefﬁciency) is
assumed in the subsequent MRF sorting stage (this default value can also be changed if required
in the Advanced window). If kerbside sorting does occur the default value for contamination
is 0% and the sorting efﬁciency improves; only 8% residue is assumed in the MRF sorting stage
(again this default value can be changed in the Advanced window).

Biowaste Bins/Bags:
Material collected (kg/household/year)
Paper 
Organic 
If biowaste is separated, the amount of organic material and paper (if paper is included in the
biowaste deﬁnition) collected in this stream needs to be entered. The model will remove 
5% of the total collected of both paper and organic material and add an equivalent weight of
plastic as contamination (plastic is assumed to be the most common contaminant found in
source-separated biowaste). As discussed in Chapter 9, even where biowaste is collected in bins
rather than bags, there is typically this level of plastic contamination. This default value can be
altered if necessary in the Advanced window, Waste Collection Tab, or Bins & Bags Tab.
Collection Vehicles:
Total diesel fuel consumption including transport to MRF, RDF plant, biological
treatment plant, incinerator or transfer station/landﬁll site (litres/ year) 
This includes collections for all of the different fractions (biowaste, dry recyclables and rest-
waste). This ﬁgure is simply added to the fuel consumption column.
Cost:
Total cost of this Kerbside Collection System (£/year) 
This ﬁgure should include all of the collections made, but not include any element for subse-
quent sorting or other treatments.
Tab MBCS #1 (Screen 10)
This sub-tab (one of up to four) describes Material Bank Collection Systems. These are bring
systems where householders deliver their (sorted or unsorted) waste arisings to collection
banks or containers placed on the street and at street corners.

IWM2 Model Guide
Screen 10 Waste Collection – Collection of Household Waste – MBCS #1.

Residents’ Transport to Material Bank Sites: 
Average number of special trips to site (household/year)
Average car journey length (km each way)
The numbers of journeys and average distances allow total fuel consumption of petrol and
diesel for the area to be calculated. Only special journeys to materials banks should be included;
visits to materials banks in supermarket car parks as part of regular shopping trips should not be
included. Similarly, where close to home materials banks are used and transport to the bank is
on foot, zero special car journeys should be inserted.
Amounts Collected In Single Material Containers:
Materials collected (kg/household/year) Paper, Glass, Ferrous Metal, Non-Fe
Metal, Film Plastic, Rigid Plastic, Textiles, Organics
This accounts for materials such as colour-separated glass or aluminium cans, which can be
transported to material processors without further sorting. This material is added directly to the
secondary materials stream. Organic material is added to the biological stream.
Market price for material sold (£/tonne) Paper, Glass, Ferrous Metal, Non-Fe
Metal, Film Plastic, Rigid Plastic, Textiles
The market prices that need to be inserted are per tonne of this material, ex-collection bank.
No price is input for organic material as it must be treated prior to it having any market value. 
Average diesel consumption for transport to bulking depot or reprocessing
plant (litres per tonne collected)
The average fuel consumption per tonne of material collected must be entered here. The
model adds this directly to the fuel stream.
Amounts Collected in Mixed Material Containers: 
Material collected (kg/household/year) Paper, Glass, Ferrous Metal, Non-Fe
Metal, Film Plastic, Rigid Plastic, Textiles
This allows for collection of material that needs a subsequent sort, e.g. at an MRF, prior to sale.
This could apply to the collection of mixed plastics, for example, or to a system where mixed
recyclables from high-rise housing are collected in communal containers. This material is added
to the sorting stream, which forms the input to the MRF.
Average diesel consumption for transport to bulking depot or MRF (litres per
tonne collected) 
This accounts for the transport from materials banks to either a central bulking site or transfer
station (for separated materials prior to sale and onward shipment to materials reprocessors)
or to a regional MRF. Since a variety of transport types is likely to be used, the simplest form of
data that can be used here is the average diesel consumption per tonne of material collected.
This value should be available to system operators.
Cost:
Average collection and transport cost (£/tonne collected) 
This needs to be exclusive of revenue from the sale of the recovered materials, which has
already been accounted for above. If only net data inclusive of revenues are available, these can
be used if zero sales values are inserted for the collected materials.

Tab 3 Delivered Household Waste (Screen 11)
This tab deﬁnes the materials that are delivered to central collection sites for garden and bulky
wastes. This is another type of bring system.
Residents’ Transport to Central Site:
Average number of special trips to site (household/year)
Average car journey length (km each way)
The model calculates the total consumption of petrol and diesel for the whole area on a round-
trip distance basis and adds this to the fuel stream. When the total fuel consumption over the
whole life cycle has been calculated, this is multiplied by the burdens of petrol or diesel use,
respectively, to give the overall primary energy consumption and emissions.
Bulky Waste Delivered: 
Recovery of materials (as % of delivered) Glass, Ferrous Metal, Non-Fe Metal,
Film Plastic, Rigid Plastic, Other
For the amount of bulky waste delivered, the percentage recovered is subtracted from the total
(as deﬁned in the Waste Input window) and added to the products stream. This allows for
the recovery, mainly of metals, which occurs at such sites due to removal of used domestic
appliances from the waste stream. 
Market prices (£/tonne) Glass, Ferrous Metal, Non-Fe Metal, Film Plastic,
Rigid Plastic
The market prices obtained from the sale of materials recovered from bulky waste are entered
here.

This adds the burdens of transporting the bulky waste residue for thermal treatment or dispos-

Garden Waste Delivered: 
Transport distance to biological treatment plant (km each way)
Transport distances to the biological treatment plant, thermal treatment plant and landﬁll are
used to calculate overall fuel (diesel) consumption, using the data in Table 17.1 above for a 20-
tonne truck load, based on a round-trip distance (i.e. assuming no return load is carried). Again
this default value can be changed in the Advanced window, General Tab. The amount of
Garden Waste delivered has already been deﬁned by the user on the Waste Input Screen,
Delivered Household Waste tab.
Cost:
Cost of central collection site and transport to treatment plants, excluding
material revenue (£ per tonne handled)
The cost of the central collection site, excluding any revenues from the sale of recovered materials
(mainly metals), needs to be inserted in terms of cost per tonne of material handled per year.
Tab 4 Collected Commercial Waste (Screen 12)
This tab deﬁnes any additional collection systems that deal with commercial waste that is not
managed by the household waste collection vehicles.
Dry Recyclable Fractions Collected:
Material available (tonnes/year) Paper, Glass, Ferrous Metal, Non-Fe Metal,
Film Plastic, Rigid Plastic, Textiles, Total
Material collected (tonnes/year) Paper, Glass, Ferrous Metal, Non-Fe Metal,
Film Plastic, Rigid Plastic, Textiles, Total
The model calculates and displays the total amount of material available in tonnes per year. The
amounts of each material collected in these separate fractions needs to be inserted here. It is
assumed that dry recyclables are transported to a MRF for sorting prior to sale, though this
need not always be the case. The model adds the speciﬁed amounts of material to the sorting
stream (dry recyclables). Since materials from commercial sources are likely to be less mixed
than from household sources, no contamination is added to the streams at this point, although
contamination rates can be added if desired in the Advanced section, Waste Collection
tab, under Collected Commercial Waste.

the fuel consumption column.

Material available (tonnes/year)

year. The model adds the speciﬁed amounts collected to the biological stream and uses these
inputs to calculate the respective fuel consumption, assuming a 20-tonne load and a round-trip
distance (no return load). This fuel consumption is then added to the fuel consumption column.
Restwaste:
Average diesel consumption for transport to RDF, incinerator, transfer station
or landﬁll (litres/year)
Costs charged to waste generator for waste management (£/tonne)*
*Assume collection costs borne by commercial waste generator.
The model assumes that transport costs to all treatment sites are paid for by the waste gener-
ator. The treatment/disposal charges levied are inserted here. These represent an income for
the waste management system, so will be subtracted from overall costs.

Tab 5 Summary (Screen 13)
This summary screen has been included in the model to allow the user to view the ﬂow of
material within the waste input and waste collection sections of the model. This acts as a check,
to ensure that all material speciﬁed in the waste input section is accounted for by the waste col-
lection system that has been described. Collection systems are often a major burden on the
rest of the waste management system so it is important that the user has deﬁned the system as
accurately as possible. 
The Input rows should be equal to the sum of the Transferred and Restwaste rows in
the Collected Household Waste and Collected Commercial Waste summary tables.
The term transferred refers to materials that have been separated (and therefore subtracted)
from the restwaste stream during the collection process and have been added to either the
products or biological stream. The calculations used to obtain the ﬁgures shown in the tables
can be examined by double-clicking any of the values; this opens a Variable Information
window where the calculation is fully described.

Summary
The major environmental burdens of both types of central sorting considered in this model are
associated with their usage of energy in whatever form: electrical, gas or diesel. If consumption
data can be obtained for the relevant processes, these can be converted into primary energy
consumption and emission, using the generic data for fuel and energy usage presented in Table
5.6 and Table 5.7. It is also necessary to consider the input and output material streams, which
determine where the products and residues of the process are destined to go, as these will
eventually cause environmental burdens in subsequent processes.
Deﬁning the system boundaries
The system boundaries of the MRF and RDF sorting section of the IWM-2 model are present-
ed in Figure 18.1. The inputs to the system are energy, raw materials and the waste from the
collection system. The outputs of the system are air and water emissions, residual waste and
secondary materials (RDF, paper, glass, metals, plastics, organic material for biological treatment
and residues to be incinerated) to be sent to other processes.

MRF sorting
Inputs
Average energy consumption ﬁgures for Material Recovery Facility (MRF) sorting are likely to
vary signiﬁcantly between schemes, since there is no standard MRF process. Energy con-
sumption is likely to be higher where more materials are separated in the MRF, as opposed to
at the kerbside, and to increase with the level of mechanised sorting, in replacement of hand
picking.
Recyclables streams that are collected co-mingled, such as mixed plastics and metals, need
more sorting, and hence more energy, than streams collected in a pre-sorted fraction, such as
glass or paper. To fully predict the likely energy consumption of any particular MRF process, it is
necessary to have data on the sorting energy needed for each of these individual streams. Table
18.1 provides information that has been collected for MRF processing. Electrical energy is used
to power conveyor belts, ferrous/eddy current separators and other equipment. Diesel is 
consumed mainly by auxiliary vehicles such as fork-lift trucks, mechanical shovels, etc., and gas
where used is normally for heating. Energy and fuel consumption have been averaged over the
total input to the MRF, since the individual fuel consumption cannot be allocated to individual
materials.
Outputs
Residues from MRFs arise from two sources: 
1. Material collected but not requested (i.e. the collection contaminants discussed in 
Chapter 9). The amount of such contamination can only be determined by a waste analysis
of what is collected in the recyclables fraction. This material will not be selected in the MRF,
so will become part of the residue.
2. Requested (i.e. targeted) material that is not separated out in the MRF (i.e. a sorting 
efﬁciency below 100%). 
The total amount of residue from a MRF will represent the sum of these two contributions, and
can vary from around 5% of the collected material, for Blue Box schemes with a kerbside sort,

to over 50% for co-mingled recyclables collected in a communal ‘bring’ container. Manual sort-
ing of plastic bottles can give a sorting efﬁciency of around 97% whereas automated sorting
results in between 88% and 95% efﬁciency (Resource Recycling, 1999). Analysis of the residue
is necessary to determine the exact contribution of the two factors. Table 18.2 shows residue
analysis results from the MRF at Prato, Italy, where on average the residue accounted for 35%
of the input material (this level of contamination has since fallen). During trials, the level of 
targeted material in the residue varied from 13% to 37%, depending on the rate of through-
put, leaving 63–87% of the residue made up of non-requested contaminating materials. This
represents a loss of 7–17% of the targeted material entering the MRF, or a sorting efﬁciency of
83–93%. Of the targeted material in the residue, some was damaged or contaminated, so not
all would actually be recoverable. This would mean that the true sorting efﬁciency would be
actually higher still. Sorting efﬁciency will clearly vary with the level of contaminants present and
the throughput of the MRF.
RDF sorting 
Inputs
The input to the Refuse-Derived Fuel RDF process is normally mixed or residual waste, which
has been collected co-mingled and unsorted. Data are available on the inputs and outputs of
the RDF process for wastes with typical MSW compositions (Figure 18.1). The introduction of
separate collection systems for individual waste fractions such as the dry recyclables, whether

using a bring or kerbside system, however, is likely to signiﬁcantly alter the composition of the
residual waste. Therefore it is important to be able to predict the inputs and outputs of the RDF
process for any input waste composition. 
Energy consumption
Several operations in the RDF process have signiﬁcant electrical energy consumptions, in parti-
cular primary shredding (12.5 kWh per tonne of rated capacity), secondary shredding (8.5 kWh/t)
and pelletising (9.5 kWh/t). The overall electrical energy consumption for the dRDF process
has been estimated as 55.5 kWh per tonne of rated capacity, i.e. per tonne of annual plant
input (this ﬁgure is used as a default value in the model). In addition, the drying process prior to
pelletising requires around 400 MJ of heat energy per tonne of rated capacity (ETSU, 1993b).

Refuse-Derived Fuel (dRDF). Source: ETSU (1993).

In plants where on-site combustion of RDF occurs, this drying heat requirement can be met by
burning some of the RDF produced, or by using waste heat from the power generation sys-
tem. Where no on-site burning of RDF occurs, heating by gas or other fuels will be needed.
The coarse Refuse-Derived Fuel (cRDF) process does not involve so many energy intensive
stages, nor the drying process. As a result, the energy consumption is lower and has been 
estimated at 6 kWh per tonne of plant input for the crude Type A cRDF and 21.5kWh per
tonne of input for the more reﬁned Type B cRDF (ETSU, 1992). (This ﬁgure of 21.5 kWh is
used as a default value in the model.)
Outputs
The individual outputs from the processes in a typical dRDF ﬂow line are shown in Figure 18.2.
When aggregated, these outputs give the total amounts of RDF, recovered materials, putrescible
ﬁnes, residue and air emissions from the dRDF process, as shown in Figure 18.3. This mass

balance applies to a ‘typical’ input waste composition, and shows that on average around 27%
of the input, by weight, is converted into dried, pelletised dRDF.
To estimate the mass balance for any input waste composition it is necessary to have infor-
mation on the composition of the different output streams (Table 18.3) and the distribution of
each material in the Input waste stream that enters the plant between the various RDF sort-
ing process outputs (Table 18.4). Using this information, it is possible to determine both the
amount and composition of the various process outputs (RDF, recovered materials, residue,
etc.) for any input waste amount or composition.

Economic Costs 
MRF sorting
As with environmental burdens, it is impossible to predict an average MRF processing cost as
there is no standard MRF process. Schemes that collect co-mingled recyclables, so simplifying
and perhaps saving costs in collection, are likely to have higher MRF processing costs than
schemes with kerbside sorting, where the MRF processing will be simpler. Thus there is a
trade-off of costs between the collection and sorting parts of the Life Cycle.
In most cases it is not possible to allocate costs to the processing of individual materials. One
study in the USA has tackled this problem, and has published the MRF processing costs for dif-
ferent materials (NSWMA, 1992). Ten privately owned MRFs were examined, and the results
show two distinct features: ﬁrstly there are clear differences between individual materials, as
might be expected due to the level of sorting needed. The second ﬁnding was that the costs
vary widely between MRFs, generally by a factor of three, but sometimes by up to a factor of
ﬁve for the same material. Data are also now becoming available for the sorting of packaging
materials from the Dual System in Germany, see for example Berndt and Thiele (1993). 
The other economic factor that needs to be considered at this point is the revenue obtained
from the sale of materials recovered at an MRF. Like any commodity, these are affected by mar-
ket forces and their prices will ﬂuctuate with supply and demand over time and geography. 
RDF sorting
Two studies by ETSU (1992, 1993b) have attempted to predict the economic costs of 
processing Refuse-Derived Fuel. The resulting costs depend on the capacity of the plant used,

due to economies of scale. The predicted break-even gate fee for a plant producing dRDF pel-
lets for sale in the UK was 33.88 euro per input tonne for a 100,000 tonnes/year plant, falling
to 31.66 euro for a plant with double this capacity. This gate fee is inclusive of revenues from
the sale of the fuel pellets and recovered ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and the costs of
transport and disposal of the residues. When these are split away, the processing cost for dRDF
can be estimated at 24.39 euro per input tonne, for a plant of 200,000 tonnes/year capacity.
For comparison, a plant of 100,00 tonnes/year capacity including a composting operation for
further treatment of the putrescible ﬁnes fraction, is estimated to have a break-even gate fee of
36.28 euro (ETSU, 1993b). Similar estimates have been made for the production and, in this
case, on-site combustion of cRDF (ETSU, 1992), giving a break-even gate fee of 47.79 euro
for a 200,000 tonnes/year capacity plant. 
MRF/RDF Sorting screen
The central sorting operations of both Material Recovery Facilities (MRF) and Refuse-Derived
Fuel (RDF) facilities are modelled in this window.

MRF Sorting Stream:

Output 
(tonnes)
These grey boxes display the materials in the sorting stream available to MRF sorting processes.
This convention of displaying the input to each process will continue throughout the model. This is
included for both transparency and to allow the user to design a waste management system based
on the actual materials in each waste stream at each stage in the waste management system.
Destination for outputs:
Recycling (%) 
Paper 
Glass
Metal
Plastic
Textiles
PPDF Burning (%)
Paper
Plastic
As it is possible to use paper and plastic as a fuel for energy recovery, as well as for materials
recycling, it is necessary to insert the relative usages of paper and plastic at this point. It is
assumed that glass, metal and textiles (if collected and sorted) are destined for materials recy-
cling. The model calculates the amount of each material left after removal of the residue, and
then adds the relative amounts to either the Materials stream (materials recycling) or to the
PPDF (Paper and Plastic Derived Fuel) burning inputs as appropriate.
MRF Energy and Fuel Consumption:
Electrical (kWh/tonne input)
25
Diesel (litres/tonne input)
Natural Gas (m3/tonne input)
Although there is no standard MRF process, an energy consumption of 25 kWh per input
tonne is provided in the model as a default value, based upon the data in Table 18.1. If the user
has access to more representative data, it must inserted here. The model adds the total ener-
gy/fuel requirement to the Life Cycle energy/fuel consumption totals.
Residue treatment: 
Treatment (%)
Transport distance 
Transport cost 
(km each way) (£/tonne)
Incineration
Landﬁll
(calculated)
The user deﬁnes the treatment method used for the residue and the average distance (one
way) to each type of treatment plant. The model adds the appropriate amounts of each material to
either the Thermal or Landﬁll streams, and calculates the fuel (diesel) consumed by trans-
port (assuming a 20-tonne load on a round trip basis, i.e. no return load), which is added to the
fuel consumption totals. The user also needs to insert the transport cost per tonne of residue
transported to thermal treatment or landﬁll.
User Note: The percentage of MRF input lost as residue is deﬁned in the Waste Collection
window, Collected Household Waste tab, KCS (Kerbside Collection Systems) tab, where
the model asks Kerbside sort ?- Yes/No. The model automatically inserts a value of 30%
where co-mingled recyclables are collected with no kerbside sort (if No is selected) and 8%
where a kerbside sort is used (if Yes is selected). This loss includes both contaminants collect-
ed, and sorting inefﬁciency. The model removes this amount of each material collected, and
adds it to the incineration or landﬁll streams, as appropriate. These default values can be
changed by the user in the Advanced window, Waste Collection tab.

This value should exclude revenues from sale of recovered materials and costs of residue dis-

next boxes.
Revenue from Sale of Materials to Reprocessor:

Recovered materials destined for recycling leave the waste management system deﬁned in this

system or not. If the user inputs a value, then that percentage of restwaste is used as the input
to the cRDF process. The model also automatically inserts both the amount of restwaste that
will be processed for cRDF, and the ﬁnal amount of cRDF that this will produce.
If the cRDF process is not part of the waste management system being modelled the default
value can be left as zero. Select the dRDF Sorting tab if this process is part of the waste man-
agement system to be modelled, or select the Next button.
The cRDF process does not include drying, so the weight is on an ‘as received’ basis. The
cRDF tab in the Advanced window allows the user to change the default values for the
screening process (prior to the RDF process) and those relating to the actual process outputs
(fuel, metals, residue and ﬁnes). The amount of fuel produced is inserted into the thermal
stream, which forms the input for the Thermal Treatment section of the model.
Residues:
Fines sent for biological treatment (%)
If a value is entered here then that amount of putrescible ﬁnes is added to the Biological
treatment stream; the remainder is added to the Landﬁll stream. If no value is entered, all
of the ﬁnes are added to the Landﬁll stream.
Distance to biological treatment (km each way)
Distance to landﬁll (km each way)
This allows calculation of fuel consumption burdens for the transport to the biological treat-
ment plant and to landﬁll. If the ﬁnes are treated on site, no transport is needed and a zero
should be inserted. This is calculated on a round-trip basis, assuming no return load.
Energy Consumption:
Electrical (kWh/tonne of input)
Natural gas (m3/tonne of input)
This is inserted automatically using the default data from the Advanced window in the cRDF
tab. The fuel/electricity used per tonne is multiplied by the input tonnage to get totals for con-
sumption, which are added to the Fuel stream.
Costs:
Processing cost excluding residue transport and disposal and revenue from
recovered materials (£/tonne of input):
This should be exclusive of the costs of residue transport or disposal, and the revenues from
sale of recovered materials or fuel. 
Transport costs to biological treatment plant (£/tonne of residue)
Transport costs to landﬁll (£/tonne of residue)
Revenue from recovered ferrous metal (£/tonne)
Revenue from recovered non-ferrous metal (£/tonne)
These costs need to be accounted for here, but the revenue from the fuel should not be
included as it does not leave the waste management system as deﬁned in this model. The
model assumes 89.1% ferrous and 50% non-ferrous metal recovery in the cRDF and dRDF
processes, respectively. These default values and the sources of each of the metal fractions can
be changed in the Advanced window in the cRDF tab, if the user has local data. 
MRF/RDF Sorting Screen

Tab 3 dRDF Sorting (Screen 16)
This tab deﬁnes densiﬁed Refuse-Derived Fuel (dRDF) production. The grey boxes here show
the Restwaste Available to dRDF, by subtracting the amount of restwaste used by the
cRDF process (if used) from the total amount of restwaste remaining in the system. The layout
of the tab is exactly the same as the cRDF tab, but the model uses a different Process Out-
put data table (which again can be edited in the Advanced window in the dRDF tab). 
Note that the dRDF process includes drying, so there is a weight loss due to loss of moisture;
this value can also be changed in the Advanced window in the dRDF tab.

Summary
This chapter provides environmental and economic data on the burdens and range of possible
costs associated with both composting and biogasiﬁcation. The model allows the user the
option of composting and/or biogasifying separately collected biowaste (see Chapter 11). The
model also allows the user to treat restwaste biologically (although this is not recommended if
the aim is to produce a marketable product). The model does not allow the user to model
more than one composting (or biogasiﬁcation) facility. Therefore, a separate but simultaneous
composting of biowaste and composting of restwaste (perhaps as part of a mechanical–biological
pre-treatment prior to landﬁlling) is not possible. 
Deﬁning the system boundaries
The system boundaries for biological treatment are deﬁned here as the physical boundaries of
the plant (Figure 19.1). Thus both the pre-sorting treatment and the biological process are

included. Materials enter the system as waste inputs and leave as compost, recovered second-
ary materials, residues (from sorting and composting), or as air or water emissions. Energy
enters the system as either electrical energy from the national grid, or as fuels (e.g. diesel). In
the case of biogasiﬁcation, some of the energy recovered in the biogas is consumed on site for
process heating, and it is assumed that the rest of the biogas is burned on site in a gas engine-
powered generator to produce electricity. Again some of this is used on site, but the rest is
exported from the site as electrical energy.
Typical ﬂow diagrams for composting plants and biogasiﬁcation plants are presented in 
Figures 19.2 and 19.3.
Waste Inputs
The feedstock for biological treatment can arise from at least three different sources: separate-
ly collected organic/paper material, mechanically separated putrescibles from an RDF process
or mixed and unsorted MSW. 
The current trend in Europe is towards a separated collection of organic material from
households. The exact composition of this feedstock will vary according to the deﬁnition of
‘green waste’ or ‘biowaste’ used by the collection scheme (see Chapter 9), but will generally
consist of kitchen and garden waste, plus in many cases non-recyclable soiled paper and paper
products. Even in narrowly deﬁned feedstocks there will always be a level of nuisance materi-
als, requiring a pre-sorting stage. Such nuisance materials arise from the inclusion of (1) bags
(often plastic) used to contain organic material; (2) other materials, which form a small part of
otherwise organic materials; (3) materials included in the biowaste by mistake. 
Mixed waste inputs, such as MSW will need extensive pre-sorting to remove all of the non-
organic material, which is not suitable for biological treatment. In contrast, ﬁnely sorted
putrescible feedstock from an RDF type process will have already undergone a sorting stage, so
will not require another pre-sort prior to the biological treatment process. 
Energy consumption
The energy consumption of the pre-treatment process will depend on the feedstock used.
Mixed feedstocks, such as MSW will need more extensive sorting per tonne of input, with
associated energy requirements, than more narrowly deﬁned feedstocks or those that have
already been mechanically sorted as part of an RDF process, irrespective of the subsequent
method of treatment. The energy consumption of the biological treatment process itself will
depend on the technology employed.
Composting
Composting involves a net consumption of energy, consuming process energy and not 
producing any energy in a usable form. The German Government (1993) report a typical
energy consumption of between 20 and 50 kWh (electrical energy) per input tonne for plants
capable of processing 10,000 tonnes of biowaste per year. Available data on the overall energy
consumption for various methods of composting are presented in Table 19.1, and suggest a
range of 18–50 kWh (electrical) per tonne of input. This variability will reﬂect both the different
feedstocks used, the different sizes of the composting plants, and the maturity of the

compost produced. Kern (1992) looked at several different composting methods and calculat-
ed an average energy consumption of 21 kWh/tonne input: for plants producing less mature
compost (rotte grades I–II) the average consumption was 18.3 kWh/tonne, whilst for plants
producing mature compost (rotte grades III–IV) the average was 30.7 kWh/tonne. For the
purposes of the LCI model, a default energy consumption of 30 kWh of electrical
energy per tonne of input to the composting plant is assumed.
Biogasiﬁcation
Biogasiﬁcation involves both consumption of energy during processing, plus the production of
useful energy as biogas. Since some of the biogas can be burned to produce steam to heat the
digester, and more can be burned in a gas engine to produce electricity, the energy require-
ment for the process can be met from within the biogas produced. The remaining biogas can
either be exported as biogas (i.e. as fuel) or burned on site to provide heat or to generate elec-
tricity (both for export). In this LCI model it is assumed that the biogas is burned on-site
for power generation, and that surplus energy is exported as electrical energy.
The electrical energy requirement for biogasiﬁcation has been reported as 50 and 54 kWh
per input tonne for two different processes (Schneider, 1992; Schön, 1992). This represents
around 32–35% of the gross electricity produced by the plant. In another example, a biogas
plant operated using the dry process consumed between 30 and 50% of the electricity pro-
duced (De Baere, 1993). Thermal energy is also required for the process, but this can be
obtained by using waste heat left after electricity generation, or by burning some of the biogas.
Therefore no additional energy needs to be imported into the site for this. In the LCI model,
biogasiﬁcation is assumed to consume 50kWh of the generated electricity, for
every input tonne (including nuisance materials and recoverable materials).

Secondary materials from pre-sorting
The amount of secondary materials that will be produced by a composting plant depends on
the composition of the input stream, and on the pre-sorting equipment installed. A narrowly
deﬁned input, such as biowaste or Vegetable Fruit and Garden waste (VFG) will contain a cer-
tain level of contamination; this material is not suitable for recovery. A mixed waste stream
input (MSW or household waste), will contain considerable amounts of glass, plastic, metal,
etc. that could be recovered for use as secondary materials, but levels of contamination are
likely to be high, and the quality of the material recovered is likely to be lower than that from
source-separated collection of recyclables (Chapter 9). Recovery of recyclables from the input
requires suitable sorting equipment or manual sorting; in most cases this is limited to magnetic
separation, which can remove up to 90% of incoming ferrous material.
Biogas/energy
The amount of biogas produced during anaerobic digestion will depend on the nature of the
organic material used as feedstock, as well as the process used. Biogasiﬁcation of a range of
industrial organic wastes from vegetables to dairy and brewing wastes in Switzerland produce
from 200 to 600 Nm3 per tonne of input (dry weight) (BfE, 1990). Biogas from household
wastes are normally expressed per tonne as received (i.e. wet weight): grass clippings, for
example, may be expected to produce 100 Nm3 per input tonne (German Government
report, 1993). Putrescible material mechanically sorted has been shown to produce 130–160 m3
of biogas per tonne (Van der Vlugt and Rulkens, 1984).

den waste. 

Production ﬁgures for the different processes reﬂect the amount of organic decomposition that is
achieved. The more complex two-stage process converts more organic material to biogas (around
65–70% by dry weight) than single-stage processes (around 45% by dry weight), giving typical pro-
duction rates of 115 and 75 m3 per tonne of biowaste, respectively (Korz and Frick, 1993). Biogas
composition, especially methane content, also varies with process type (Table 19.2), again being
generally higher in the two-stage process. The methane content generally varies from 50–75%,
the rest of the biogas comprising carbon dioxide and some trace components (Table 19.3). 
If it is assumed that 100 Nm3 of biogas are produced per tonne of input to the digestor (i.e.
after nuisance materials have been removed in the pre-treatment stage), with a methane con-
tent of 55% (methane has a caloriﬁc value of 37.75MJ/Nm3 (Perry and Green, 1984)), this will
give a gross energy potential of 2076 MJ thermal energy per tonne digested. If this is burned in
a gas engine to produce electricity with an efﬁciency of 33% (ETSU, 1995), this will give a gross
electricity production of 190 kWh per tonne digested. Figures reported by De Baere (1999)
for actual plant performances in Austria, Belgium and Germany agree with this; they report
gross electricity generation rates of 220 kWh/tonne, 165 kWh/tonne and 245 kWh/tonne,
respectively. For the LCI model, a gross production of 190 kWh/tonne of digestor
input will be used as a default value.
Compost
The quantity and quality of the compost produced by biological treatment are clearly not inde-
pendent. The more the product is reﬁned to improve the quality, the less the ﬁnal quantity,
(and hence the greater the residue). In many cases, different grades of compost will be pro-
duced, the important factor being the existence of a market for the material. Put simply, if there
is no market for the compost, regardless of its quality, it will be a residue rather than a valuable
product. One possible alternative use for compost, where there is no other market, is as land-
ﬁll cover material. This has the potential to save costs where soil has to be transported to a
landﬁll site, only to be used as daily cover material. 
Compost quantity
For composting, the ﬁnal amount of compost produced (wet weight) is in the region of 50% of
the input of organic material (organics plus paper) (ORCA, 1992a). The other 50% is lost due to
evaporation and respiration. Where further reﬁning of the compost occurs, the amount of com-
post actually marketed may be considerably less than this. For biogasiﬁcation, the amount of ﬁnal
compost-like material will depend on the extent to which the organic material is broken down
into biogas. Production can account for 33% by weight of a plant’s input (equivalent to 41% of the
input to the digester after the pre-sort) (De Baere, 1993). By contrast, the two-stage wet process
produces more biogas with a higher methane content than the dry process, leaving around 20%
of the plant input (22% of the digester input) as composted residue (see Figures 19.5 and 19.6).
For the purposes of the LCI model, it is assumed that in composting the mass loss
due to evaporation and biodegradation of the organic fraction of ﬁnal compost
accounts for 50% of the input to the composting process (i.e. after any pre-sorting);
for biogasiﬁcation, an average ﬁgure of 70% is used. 
Compost quality is the key factor that determines whether the output from biological treat-
ment processes is a valuable product or a residue. A valuable material is one that has a market,
hence the need to develop markets for different grades of compost. Producers will then either

be able to produce large amounts of lower grade composts, or smaller amounts of higher
grade material.
Compost quality is determined by the feedstock type, type of technology used and level of
process control. The physical characteristics, plant nutrient and heavy metal contents of a range
of composts derived from different feedstocks are presented in Tables 19.4 and 19.5. These
can be compared with the standards discussed in Chapter 11. It can be seen that the major
variability occurs in the heavy metal content. Not surprisingly, the more mixed the feedstock,
the higher the heavy metal content of the compost. The same pattern is shown for the com-
post-like residues from biogasiﬁcation (Table 19.6). So, while it is possible to make compost
from mixed waste streams, the high level of contamination may mean that no market for this
material can be found. It is accepted in Germany, for example, that the composted residue
from biogasiﬁcation is not marketable as compost (German Government report, 1993) and
that it needs to be disposed of. In 2005 the T.A. Siedlungsabfall ordinance will no longer permit
this material to be landﬁlled directly in Germany, so incineration will need to be used.

Environmental beneﬁts of using compost
The compost produced by both the aerobic composting process and the anaerobic biogasiﬁ-
cation processes (after de-watering and aerobic composting) can be used as low-quality fertilis-
er (or soil improver). Based on the amount of marketable compost produced, the model
calculates and credits the recycling column of the inventory results with the savings in environ-
mental burdens associated with the production of fertiliser containing the equivalent amount of
N, P2O5 and K2O as is in an average compost. The model assumes that the average mois-
ture content of compost is 40% and that the average N, P2O5 and K2O content of
compost is 1.18, 0.68 and 0.9 % dry weight, respectively (see Table 19.4). Based on
these ﬁgures, the amounts of N, P2O5 and K2O available in 1 tonne of wet compost are 0.71,
0.41 and 0.54%, respectively. The emissions to air associated with the production of fertilisers
are presented in Table 19.7.
The data presented in Table 19.7 includes the emissions from the fertiliser production
processes and the emissions from energy utilisation of each of the production processes. 
Sorting residue
This will consist of two types of materials: (1) non-biodegradable materials arriving as nuisance
materials in biowaste, or materials in mixed waste that have not been recovered as secondary
materials; and (2) degradable material (organic or paper) that is either unsuitable for biological
processing (e.g. too large) or is removed adhered to nuisance materials. There is little data
available that distinguish between these types, however. Where the feedstock is source-sepa-
rated biowaste, a nuisance level of around 5% is typical (Chapter 9). Where the feedstock is
mixed waste such as MSW then the level of sorting residue is likely to be much higher, although
where recovery of other materials occurs (e.g. La Voulte, Figure 19.4), residue rates as low as
4–5% may be found. 
In the LCI model it is assumed that all of the categories other than paper and
organics are removed as residue during the pre-sort. In addition, 2.5% of the organ-
ic and 2.5% of the paper fractions are added to the residue to account for material
that is not readily biodegradable, or that adheres to the nuisance materials as they
are removed. These ﬁgures can be edited by the user if better data are available.
Compost-reﬁning residue
This represents the composted/digested output that is not marketed. The amount will range
from zero, if a use can be found for all of the compost, to 100% of the output if no market can
be found.
Air emissions
The major air emission by volume from biological processing will be carbon dioxide, which is a
contributor to the greenhouse effect. In aerobic processing the organic material is broken down
directly to carbon dioxide and water. In anaerobic processing, biogas containing methane and
carbon dioxide is produced, of which the methane also forms carbon dioxide when burned.
The amount of emissions per tonne of process input will depend on the moisture content of
the incoming material. In the following calculations an average moisture content of
50% is assumed. The actual level will depend on the ratio of paper to wet organic material
present, but ORCA (1992a) suggest that 50% is the optimum moisture content level for com-
posting feedstocks.

For composting, the dry weight loss during composting is approximately 40%, giving a dry
weight loss of 200 kg per wet input tonne. Assuming that most of the organic material decom-
posed is cellulose, with a carbon content of 44% (from formula), composting will evolve
approximately 323 kg of CO2 (164 Nm3) per tonne of wet organic feedstock.
For biogasiﬁcation, the dry weight loss varies with process type, and reports vary from 45 to
70%. Assuming a mid-range dry weight loss of 55% means that 275 kg of organic matter is
converted into gas. If all this was converted to carbon dioxide the total emitted would be 
444 kg (226 Nm3) per tonne of digester input. This does not agree with published biogas 
production ﬁgures, however. Given the composition of biogas in Table 19.3, combustion will
convert the methane to carbon dioxide and water in the reaction:
CH4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2H2O
Complete combustion of the biogas will therefore produce 0.982 Nm3 of CO2 per Nm3 of
biogas burned, equivalent to 1.93 kg of CO2. Given a production of around 100 Nm3 of bio-
gas per tonne of organic material feedstock, this produces a CO2 emission of 193kg per input
tonne, considerably less than that predicted from the dry weight loss during the process. This
discrepancy probably reﬂects some process losses, and more importantly the aerobic matura-
tion stage that follows the anaerobic stage. During this stage the material needs to be aerated
and heats up, demonstrating considerable aerobic microbial activity, during which further car-
bon dioxide is likely to be released.
For the purposes of the LCI model, overall carbon dioxide emissions are assumed
to be 320 kg and 440 kg per tonne of wet organic material, for composting and bio-
gasiﬁcation, respectively.
Few complete data sets are available at the time of writing with respect to air emissions from
composting processes, although the odour problems that can occur around compost plants
demonstrate that air emissions are signiﬁcant. Air emissions resulting from the combustion of
biogas are presented in Table 19.3.

Table 19.9 Water emissions from biological treatment processes. Sources: *1, Schauner (1995); 2, Bergmann and Lentz,
(1992)

Water emissions
The aqueous efﬂuents reported for biological treatment vary widely in both amounts and com-
position, depending on both the process used and the feedstock. In composting, considerable
evaporation will take place during the process. Any run-off collected is often sprayed back onto
the composting material to maintain sufﬁciently high moisture contents. If waste paper is includ-
ed in the feedstock, this will absorb much of the water, and so little or no leachate is actually
produced (see Table 19.8). 
In biogasiﬁcation, water is produced when the digested material is pressed or ﬁltered. Large
amounts will be produced, especially in the wet (low solids) process type. Some of this water
will be recirculated to adjust the water content of the incoming feedstock, but the rest needs to
be treated prior to discharge. Typical amounts and compositions of the leachates produced by
both composting and biogasiﬁcation are presented in Table 19.9.
Economic costs
Data on the economic costs of biological treatment are not always reported on a 
consistent basis, so comparisons are difﬁcult to make. In many cases biological treatment is 
considered as a ﬁnal disposal option, and consequently costs given are as an all-inclusive 
‘gate fee’ or ‘tip fee’. This cost will include allowance for any revenues collected from the sale
of recovered materials, compost, and energy from biogas utilisation, and include disposal costs
for any residues requiring thermal treatment or landﬁlling. The problem with this level of
accounting is that the cost of biological treatment will vary with the market prices of energy,
compost and recovered materials and the cost of landﬁll. Alternatively, cost data for biological
treatment can refer to the biological processing itself (e.g. as in ORCA, 1991b). This is 
more useful when modelling the economics of the overall waste management system, since 
it is independent of the cost of other parts of the system, but this type of data is not widely 
available.
Biological Treatments
The Biological treatments section of the model begins with a window that provides a 
breakdown of the input materials available to the composting and biogasiﬁcation processes.
Again this has been included in the model to ensure complete transparency for the user.

This allows users to identify collection systems that may result in the collection of more biolog-
ical material than their existing facilities can treat, and alter the waste management system
accordingly.

the particular process being modelled. If this ﬁgure is not known, the default value is a generic
ﬁgure of 50%. The model calculates the total amount of compost produced. The user speciﬁes
the percentage of ﬁnal compost that is sold as opposed to treated as a residue; the model’s
default value is set to zero. 
User Note: the amount of compost that is sold is given a recycling credit, based on the pro-
duction of chemical fertiliser containing an equivalent amount of N, P and K. This means that
the emissions that are avoided by using compost instead of chemical fertiliser are credited to
the waste management system. For consistency within the model, if compost is sold then a
recycling credit is added to the recycling section of the model, as is done for the sale of other
recycled materials (such as paper, plastic and metals, etc.) see Chapter 22 for details. 
Energy consumption (kWh/tonne of plant input)
The energy consumption per tonne of the composting plants input is added to the Fuel stream.
Again, a very generic ﬁgure (30 kWh/input tonne) is used by the model as a default value.
Residue:
Incineration
Landﬁll
Sorting residue treatment (%) 
Compost residue treatment (%) 
Transport distance (km each way) 
Transport cost (£/tonne) 
The user speciﬁes how much of each residue is treated by incineration or landﬁlled directly.
The user must also insert the one-way distance in km from the biological treatment plant to the
incinerator or landﬁll. The model calculates the fuel consumption assuming a 20-tonne load
and that no return load is carried, and adds the fuel used to the Fuel stream. The transport
cost is added to the costs stream.
Revenue From Recovered Materials:
(£/tonne)
If any income is generated by the sale of material recovered prior to the composting process it
must be entered here.
Costs:
Processing costs (£/tonne plant input)
Market price for compost (£/tonne)
The Processing cost is the overall cost for pre-sorting and composting, not including rev-
enues from sale of products, or costs of transporting residues. (If only an inclusive cost is avail-
able, this can be inserted if the revenue and other cost boxes on this tab are left blank). These
costs and revenues are inserted by the user to calculate the overall cost of composting. 
Tab 3 Biogasiﬁcation (Screen 19)
As can be seen from Screen 18, the Biogasiﬁcation tab is similar to the Composting tab.
The Plant input, which was deﬁned in the Process Inputs tab is calculated by the model
and displayed in the ﬁrst row of grey boxes. The only differences in this tab are that the default
value for Mass loss is 60% (higher than the aerobic composting process as the organic mate-
rial is digested, pressed to remove excess moisture then composted); the default value for

energy consumption by the process is 50 kWh/tonne (higher than for aerobic composting) and
the model provides a default value of 190 kWh/tonne energy production from the process.
The user is also required to enter the market price, £/kWh, for any surplus electricity that is
exported from the biogasiﬁcation process. These costs and revenues are entered by the user
to enable the model to calculate the overall cost of the biogasiﬁcation process described.

Summary
The major environmental burdens of mass burn incineration, Refuse-Derived Fuel burn incin-
eration and Paper- and Plastic-Derived Fuel burn incineration are considered in this model. The
model does not include approaches such as pyrolysis, gasiﬁcation and the incineration of waste
in cement kilns due to the relative lack of suitable operational data available at the time of writ-
ing. It is recognised that as these approaches become more common they should be included
in the model. The system boundaries, inputs and outputs and energy balance of Mass Burn
incineration, Refuse-Derived Fuel burn incineration and Paper- and Plastic-Derived Fuel burn
incineration are discussed.
Deﬁning the system boundaries
Before the inputs and outputs of thermal treatment can be assessed, it is necessary to deﬁne
the system boundaries for the process. These are shown in Figure 20.1, and include the

emission abatement processes within the system. The actual emissions to air will therefore
depend on the type of emission abatement equipment installed, and the efﬁciency of its opera-
tion. For this study, emission data from both old incinerators and modern, state-of-the-art
equipment are available to the user, but as the overall objective is to assess possible effects of
future IWM schemes, rather than what is currently being achieved it is expected that the mod-
ern incinerator data will be used most often. As with all aspects of this LCI approach, if local
data on existing or planned incinerators are available, these should be used in preference to
generic ﬁgures.
The amounts of solid and aqueous wastes generated will also depend on the type of gas-
cleaning process used: a dry-scrubbing system will generate only solid waste whereas a wet
gas-scrubbing system will produce both solid and aqueous wastes.
For the purpose of this LCI, it is assumed that recovered energy is used to gener-
ate electricity only, and that this electricity is exported from the system.
Data availability
The outputs of the incineration process clearly also depend on the inputs, i.e. what is burned.
Most incinerators are mass-burn facilities, with an input of mixed MSW, and data are generally
available on the associated outputs. However, as fractions of the waste stream are removed 
for recycling or composting, or when RDF or source-separated materials are burned as fuel,
the input to the incineration process may be markedly different (see Chapter 12). 
To predict the outputs from such different combustion scenarios it is necessary to be able to
attribute energy production and emissions to individual materials or fractions within the inciner-
ator’s input. Whilst this is possible for energy production, emissions cannot be reliably attrib-
uted for two reasons. Firstly, there is a serious lack of data in this area, since most experience
has been with the mass-burn approach. Secondly, there are interactions between different
materials in the combustion process, such as in the de novo production of dioxins, and these
mechanisms are not yet fully understood.
Available data are presented for incineration of mixed MSW, dRDF and for combustion of
individual materials. It needs to be borne in mind, however, that not all emission data sets are
complete, and that incineration of mixtures may not give rise to the sum of their parts, since
interactions may occur.
Waste Inputs
The input to the thermal treatment system will be either MSW, Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) or
source-separated paper and plastic depending on the process involved. Burning RDF or paper
and plastic as fuels involves a relatively consistent and well-deﬁned feedstock. The input to
MSW incinerators, however, comprising of restwaste and residues from other waste treatment
processes, is much more variable. This feedstock will vary with the waste composition, which
has been shown to vary both geographically and seasonally (Chapter 8). 
394
Chapter 20: Thermal Treatment
IWM2 Model Guide

Further variability in the input to MSW incinerators will also occur when materials are recov-
ered for recycling or composting, so affecting the composition of the remaining restwaste. This
will affect the overall caloriﬁc value of what is burned, and has led to concern over the compat-
ibility of recycling with Energy from Waste schemes (e.g. ENDS, 1992). Whilst any materials
recovery and recycling scheme will reduce the overall throughput of a mass-burn incinerator,
the average caloriﬁc content of the throughput may rise or fall, depending on which fractions
are removed. Several studies have looked at this effect and in general, recovery of glass and
steel for recycling will increase the average caloriﬁc content, as will separate collection of
putrescible material for composting. 
The caloriﬁc value of the feedstock, and its variability, needs to be considered when planning
an MSW incinerator. Problems with the caloriﬁc value of the waste input rising above the heat
capacity of the incinerator plant have been encountered in both Switzerland and Japan. In both
these countries, plastics now need to be excluded from the feedstock to prevent damage to
some incinerators. In Greece, by contrast, the high level of putrescible waste has resulted in a
caloriﬁc value too low to give effective burning.
Energy consumption
The thermal treatment process, as well as liberating energy from the feedstock, also consumes
energy. This is required for operating the cranes, moving grates or ﬂuidised beds, fans for air
injectors, and emission control equipment, as well as for general heating and lighting. The on-
site energy consumption will particularly reﬂect the level of ﬂue-gas treatment. For MSW incin-
eration, ETSU (1993a) suggest that around 14% of the electrical power generated is consumed
on-site, with a speciﬁc consumption of around 70 kWh per tonne incinerated. Energy is also
required in the form of natural gas, to heat up the incinerator during start-up. For this ETSU
(1993a) give an average ﬁgure of 0.23 m3/per tonne. For the purposes of the LCI model, it
will be assumed that there is an electric energy consumption of 70 kWh per tonne
incinerated and a natural gas consumption of 0.23 m3/per tonne incinerated. 
For RDF and alternate fuel (paper/plastic) burning, there will be some energy consumed by
the ﬂue-gas cleaning equipment, although no appropriate data are available for this. It is likely to
be lower than for MSW incineration, since there is less plant to operate. For the purposes of
the LCI model, it will be assumed that there is an energy consumption of 20 kWh per
tonne of RDF or paper/plastic fuel burned.
Outputs
Energy
Energy released during incineration may be used for several purposes (heat and steam produc-
tion, electricity generation), each with its own conversion rate for the amount of useful energy
produced. For the purposes of this LCI, the user can select whether the recovered
heat is used to generate electricity or both electricity and steam and alter the gross
energy recovery rate accordingly.

Mass burn
Energy production will depend on the composition of MSW, and will be higher in countries
with high levels of paper and especially plastic (generally Northern Europe), and lower where
there is a high level of wet organic/putrescible waste (Southern Europe). For Germany values
in the range 8.3–9.2 MJ/kg are given (Bechtel and Lentz, unpublished), Sweden 7–11 MJ/kg
(Svedberg, 1992), and for the UK a gross caloriﬁc value of 8.4–10 MJ/kg has been reported
(Barton, 1986; Porteous, 1991). It is necessary to take account of the water content of MSW
as received at the incinerator, since this will reduce the overall caloriﬁc value per kilogram, due
to both its weight (dilution effect) and latent heat of evaporation. In the case of the UK, this
reduces a typical gross caloriﬁc value of MSW from 8.4 MJ/kg to 7.06 MJ/kg. For comparison,
the caloriﬁc value for fuel oil is 40–42 MJ/kg, for hard coal 25–30 MJ/kg, for peat 9–13 MJ/kg
and for wood chips 7–13 MJ/kg (Svedberg, 1992). 
In the LCI model, to allow for variability in the feedstock, the caloriﬁc value of the
input to MSW incinerators will be calculated from the composition, using the material-
speciﬁc caloriﬁc values given in the Advanced Variables window – Thermal Treatment
tab of the model.
RDF
Ranges given for the caloriﬁc value of RDF vary from 11-18 MJ/kg (Swedish data; Svedberg,
1992) to 18–20 MJ/kg (UK data; Ogilvie, 1992). The exact value will vary with the composition
of the original waste, and the process used to produce the RDF. For the purpose of the LCI
model, a caloriﬁc value of 18 GJ/tonne will be assumed for RDF.
Source-separated fuel
The caloriﬁc value of this alternative fuel will depend on the ratio of paper to plastic burned. In
the LCI model the net caloriﬁc values of each fraction given in the Advanced Vari-
ables window – Thermal Treatment tab of the model are used to calculate the
caloriﬁc values of any speciﬁed mixture.
Energy recovery
Clearly not all of the primary heat energy released in an incinerator can be recovered in a 
useful form, and the level of recovery depends on the use to which the energy is put. 
Since boilers attached to municipal waste incinerators must operate at lower steam tempera-
tures to reduce corrosion, incinerators producing electricity only have a conversion efﬁciency
of around 20% (RCEP, 1993). ETSU (1993) predict a gross power production of 520 kWh
per tonne of waste with a net caloriﬁc value of 8.01 GJ/tonne, giving a conversion efﬁciency 
of 23% for a plant of 200,000 tonnes per year capacity. Once the on-site power consumption
of 70 kWh/tonne has been subtracted, this gives a net export of 450 kWh/tonne from the site. 
Energy recovery for district heating schemes, such as used extensively in Japan, recover
around 70% of the energy released, whereas combined heat and power (CHP) schemes, 
which utilise the residual heat after generation of electricity, achieve an overall conversion efﬁciency
of around 70–90%. This means that a plant such as in Frankfurt, burning 420,000 tonnes of
waste per year can provide 30,000 people with both electricity and district heating, replacing
the need for some 64,000 tonnes of fuel oil per year (Bechtel and Lentz, unpublished).
396
Chapter 20: Thermal Treatment
IWM2 Model Guide

For the purposes of the LCI model, a Gross electricity production efﬁciency of up
to 30% is recommended, depending on the age of the facility, etc. for MSW inciner-
ators recovering electricity, whereas a Gross electricity production efﬁciency of up
to 90% is recommended, again depending on the age of the facility, etc. for MSW
incinerators recovering both electricity and steam. For plants burning RDF or a
paper/plastic fuel, an efﬁciency of 30% will be assumed due to the more homoge-
nous and controlled nature of the feedstock.
Energy recovered during incineration is credited as an energy gain in the LCI
model and is assumed to displace electricity production that depends on convention-
al fuel. The exact mix of the displaced energy can be speciﬁed by the user in the Advanced
window – General tab. Therefore net emissions from the incineration process are the
emissions from the process minus the emissions that would have been produced by the mix-
ture of electricity selected by the user. 
Air emissions
It is important to remember that due to the conservation of mass, whatever materials enter the
incineration process will leave it in one state or another. Although organic pollutants may be
broken down into harmless molecules, heavy metals within the waste stream will either be left
in the ash (clinker), removed as ﬁlter dust or will escape to the air. The total amount produced
will remain the same, so as ﬂue gas cleaning becomes more effective and less inorganic pollu-
tants are emitted to the atmosphere, the amounts collected from the ﬂue gas cleaning process
will correspondingly increase. 
Mass burn
The most signiﬁcant pollutants emitted from unsorted MSW incineration are the acid gases (hydro-
gen chloride, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides), carbon dioxide, particulate matter (PM), dioxins/
dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs) and heavy metals (mercury, cadmium, lead) (Clayton, 1991).
The approach used in the LCI model to estimate emissions from the incineration process is
based upon the model developed by the US EPA and described in ‘Application of Life Cycle
Management To Evaluate Integrated Municipal Solid Waste Strategies’ (Research Triangle Insti-
tute, 1997). This approach splits the emissions into non-metal emissions (CO, SO2, NOX,
HCl, PM, dioxins/furans) and metal emissions (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn). Allowing a dif-
ferent modelling approach to be taken for each group of emissions. 
The non-metal emissions CO2, CO, SO2, NOX, HCl, PM and dioxins/furans are calculated
using a stoichiometric approach involving a combustion equation and ultimate analysis of the
components of solid waste (RTI, 1997, Appendix F, Combustion Process Model, pp B2–3).
With the exception of CO2 for which there are no air pollution controls, the non-
metal pollutants are assumed to be controlled to speciﬁc concentration levels that
are independent of the waste stream composition.
Carbon dioxide emissions are based upon a stoichiometric equation for waste combustion
for each waste component (RTI, 1997, Appendix F, Combustion Process Model, pp. B10–11).
Flue gas production is also based upon this stoichiometric approach. The ‘emission factors’ for
CO2 and ﬂue gas production are presented in Table 20.1.
The tonnages of each material in the incinerator process input are multiplied by the emission
factor for CO2 and ﬂue gas to calculate the emission of CO2 and ﬂue gas.

IWM2 Model Guide

The non-metal pollutants are assumed to be controlled to speciﬁc concentration levels (as
facilities are operated to comply with target emission levels) that are independent of the waste
stream composition. For these pollutants the user may select default values based upon either
the US Federal Standards (1995) for Municipal Waste Combustors (Subpart Eb) or the average
performance of a new facility. These values are presented in Table 20.2.
The ‘emission factors’ for each of these non-metal pollutants is calculated by multiplying the
standard (for either US Federal or New Facility) by the volume of ﬂue gas generated per tonne
of material combusted. These ‘emission factors’ are shown for each material component in
Table 20.3 (US Federal Regulations) and 20.4 (emissions from a new facility). 
Metal emissions are based on the metals composition of individual waste components. The
model assumes that the emissions attributed to a component are in proportion to its
metals content. This also assumes that the tendency of a metal to volatise and escape
through the stack is the same regardless of how the metal is bound to the waste.
The metal emissions to air are calculated by multiplying the emissions of metal per tonne of
waste component before gas cleaning (uncontrolled emission factors) by the removal efﬁciency
for that metal of the air pollution control devices (RTI, 1997, Appendix F, Combustion Process
Model, pp. C1–4). The uncontrolled emission factors for metals are presented in Table 20.5.

It is possible that the use of this methodology will result in an estimate of controlled 
emissions that breach an emissions limit. The model does not warn the user of any such 
violation. Care must be taken when modelling the incineration process that the process 
input, derived from previous stages of an Life Cycle Inventory strategy, does not result in breach
of emissions standards.
RDF and source-separated fuels
Data for burning RDF and paper and plastic are presented (as well as emissions data for MSW
incineration as a comparison) in Table 20.6. Note that the data for RDF burning are from UK
trials with only dust precipitation equipment. Use of gas-scrubbing equipment would reduce
airborne emissions, but would increase solid waste generation from the ﬁlters.
Water emissions
This arises only from use of wet gas-scrubbing equipment. Figures given for the amount of
sewage produced range from 200 to 770 litres per tonne of waste input (SPMP, 1991; ETSU,
1993; Bechtel and Lentz, unpublished). In the LCI model it is assumed that all water
emissions are treated on-site, with only resultant sludges leaving the site.
Solid waste
Solid residues from incineration arise from two main sources: combustion residues (bottom
ash and ﬂy ash) and solid residues from the gas-cleaning system. The latter will include both ﬁl-
ter dusts and sludge residues resulting from water treatment (where wet gas-scrubbing systems
are installed).
Mass burn 
Mass burn of typical MSW results in 250–300 kg of bottom ash per tonne of waste (SPMP,
1991; IFEU, 1992; ETSU, 1993, IAWG, 1997). To allow for variability in the mass burn incin-
erator feedstock in an IWM system, however, the amount of bottom ash in the LCI model
is calculated from the ash content of each fraction of the waste in the Advanced window
– Thermal Treatment tab of the model.
Dry gas cleaning systems produce approximately 45–52 kg of dust and residues (calcium
chloride and surplus lime) per tonne of waste. The semi-dry or semi-wet processes are 
similar, producing 40 kg of loose ash mixed with calcium chloride and surplus lime per tonne 
of waste. Wet gas-scrubbing results in 20–30 kg of dust and 2.5–12 kg of sludge residue 
per tonne of waste (SPMP, 1991; IFEU, 1992; IAWG, 1997; Bechtel and Lentz, unpublished).
In the LCI model it is assumed that for each tonne of MSW incinerated, 20 kg of 
ﬁlter dust and 12 kg of sludge residues from the gas-scrubbing system are produced.
RDF
RDF combustion will typically leave a residue of approximately 86 kg ash/carbon per tonne
input, with a further 1.8 kg of ash ﬁltered from the ﬂue gas (Ogilvie, 1992). Data are not avail-
able for residues from further emission control, but are likely to be similar to those above for
mass burn. It is therefore assumed that a further 12 kg of sludge residues result from
gas scrubbing, giving a total of 13.8 kg from the gas-cleaning process.

Source-separated fuel 
Ash contents of different fractions of the waste stream are given in the Advanced window –
Thermal Treatment tab of the model. To these must be added the solid waste generated from
ﬂue gas cleaning, to give total solid waste produced. Figures given by Habersatter (1991) for
total solid waste from combustion in Switzerland are typically 35 kg/tonne input for plastics, and
87 kg/tonne for paper/cardboard, but these are more conservative than those given for the ash
content alone by Barton (1986) for UK waste. In the LCI model, therefore, the bottom
ash production is calculated from the ash content levels in the Advanced window –
Thermal Treatment tab of the model; the gas-cleaning residues are assumed to be
the same as for RDF combustion above.
Economic costs of thermal treatment 
Mass burn
The economic costs of incineration are generally considered to be high, because of the capital
investment required to set up a plant. When calculated per tonne of waste input, economic costs
of mass-burn incineration vary widely across Europe (Table 20.7). Variability within countries
results from four key factors: incinerator capacity, level of gas-cleaning equipment installed,
whether energy is recovered or not, and whether economic instruments exist to encourage the
generation of power from waste. With the implementation of the EC directives on new and
existing MSW incinerators, all facilities now need to have extensive gas-scrubbing equipment, so
making incineration more expensive, and less variable in cost. The majority of new incinerators
will have energy recovery facilities. The economics of incineration with energy recovery are 
further improved when there are ﬁscal instruments designed to encourage the use of waste as 
a ‘renewable’ energy resource. For example, in the UK the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO)
of the 1989 Electricity Act required electricity supply companies to purchase electricity generated
from non-fossil fuel (including MSW). This guaranteed a market at a price premium for the 
Energy-from-Waste projects accepted under NFFO, which was worth 6–13 euro per tonne of

waste input (DoE, 1993). A similar scheme operates in Germany, whereby energy generated
from waste can be supplied to the grid at any time for a guaranteed premium price.
RDF and source-separated materials
The original aim of RDF was to produce a readily transportable fuel that could be sold as a
commodity alongside other fuels such as coal, hence the need for pelletising. This requires
markets, however, which have proved difﬁcult to develop for RDF. One reason is that in 
several countries when burned, it is still legally considered to be waste, and therefore subject to
the same emission controls as mass-burn incineration, so differs from the combustion of coal
and other fuels. As a result, surviving RDF plants burn the pellets on site, and export electricity
into the national grid, and/or district heating. The additional cost involved here is the cost 
of operating the dedicated boiler, less the revenue from the sale of electricity. Since many 
RDF plants integrate RDF production and combustion on one site, these costs may not be 
separated out.
The concept of burning source-separated materials collected for recycling has not been fully
explored, and here too markets for the paper and plastic fuel must be developed. If this can be
done, this energy producing outlet would ﬁx a lower economic value for this material, i.e. its
caloriﬁc value. If the recycling markets for these materials are weak due to oversupply/lack of
demand, the material could be sold for its caloriﬁc content (given that the caloriﬁc content of a
50:50 mix of paper and plastic would have about the same caloriﬁc content per kg as industrial
coal).
The additional costs that need to be considered here are those for operating the boiler and
associated emission control equipment, net of any revenues from the sale of exported electricity.
Since this process has yet to be fully developed, no appropriate data on such costs are available.

The values in the grey boxes show the total material available to the thermal treatment
processes at this stage in the Life Cycle. The compost fraction in the thermal stream input is the
compost residue that cannot be sold.
Restwaste Added To Thermal Stream At This Stage:

If restwaste is to be added to the Thermal stream, the user must enter the percentage of the
total remaining Restwaste stream here. The model displays the composition of this amount
of restwaste in the second row of grey boxes.
Total Material Available For Thermal Treatments:

The model adds the restwaste fraction to the material available in the Thermal stream and
displays the new total amount of material available for thermal treatment here.

Incineration (2) 
This allows the user to identify what fraction of the total material available for thermal treatment
is sent to new or old incineration facilities. If the sum of the two incineration processes does not
equal 100%, then by default the remaining material is sent to landﬁll. This allows users to 
identify systems that may result in the availability of more material suitable for thermal treat-
ment than their existing facilities can treat, and enables them to alter the waste management
system accordingly.

Incineration Input and Presort:

Presort residue (%) 
Process input (tonnes) 
The model calculates and displays the composition of the input to the incineration plant as
deﬁned in the Process Inputs tab. If a pre-sort of the material entering the incinerator occurs
the user can enter the percentage of each material that is discarded as residue. This allows the
user to account for unsuitable material such as large metal objects or potentially hazardous
material that may damage the process equipment or pose a risk to the operators. The model
calculates and displays the composition of the ﬁnal process input.

The model displays the total process input and calculates from this the total caloriﬁc value of this
material. No default value for the gross efﬁciency of energy recovery is given as this depends
very much on the technology used. The model does provide ranges for energy recovered as

Costs:
Incineration cost (£/tonne process input)
The cost entered should include any revenue from sales of electricity and ferrous metal, but
not the cost of residue transport or disposal. Where revenue includes both electricity and
steam generation, it would be appropriate to replace the price of electricity with a weighted
price to take into account the larger price paid for steam (heat) energy.

Transport cost to hazardous waste landﬁll (£/tonne)
The model calculates the transport costs assuming that ﬂy ash, ﬁlter dust and gas-cleaning
residues are sent to a hazardous waste landﬁll, while bottom ash is sent to a non-hazardous
waste landﬁll.
Tab 3 Incineration #2
This screen is exactly the same as the Incineration #1 tab, but allows the user to input dif-
ferent default values for the operation of the incineration process. The default data sets includ-
ed in the model are for: (1) an incinerator that meets the US EPA regulations on air emissions;
and (2) a new incinerator with high-speciﬁcation gas-cleaning technology that performs consid-
erable better than the minimum regulations (Table 20.2). This gives users the ability to model
two different incinerators within a single scenario.

Summary
The environmental burdens associated with the landﬁll process, including leachate generation
and treatment and biogas generation and treatment, are considered. The system boundaries,
inputs and outputs and energy balance are discussed.
Deﬁning the system boundaries
This chapter describe the inputs and outputs of the process, in both environmental and econom-
ic terms, so that the Life Cycle Inventory and economic assessment of solid waste systems can be
completed. Considering landﬁlling as a waste treatment process, rather than simply a sink for the
ﬁnal disposal of solid waste, the inputs and outputs for the process are shown in Figure 21.1. 
The environmental burdens of landﬁlling waste will depend both on the landﬁll design and
method of operation, and the nature of the waste deposited (see Table 21.1). While there has

been a lot of attention paid to the details of landﬁll site location and the design of various systems
for gas and leachate containment and/or treatment, there has been less emphasis on the effect of
future changes in the composition of the waste materials that will be destined for landﬁlls. As more
materials are recovered from waste streams for recycling, both the amount and the composition
of the residual waste, from both household and commercial sources, may alter signiﬁcantly. 
Although some data are available for the inputs and outputs of the landﬁlling process, these
generally refer to the landﬁlling of mixed waste streams, such as MSW. Data relating to the indi-
vidual material fractions within such waste streams are not normally available. Thus it is difﬁcult
to extrapolate from the effects of present waste streams to the environmental effects of future
waste streams with different compositions. This will be attempted, however, in this section: by
collating data from landﬁlls containing mixed waste streams and the limited amount of data on
the behaviour of individual materials within landﬁlls, it should be possible to estimate the out-
puts from landﬁlls for a range of different waste inputs. 
Waste inputs
There are four main waste streams from municipal solid waste management systems that are
landﬁlled: Restwaste, Sorting residues, Biological treatment residues and Ash. Landﬁlls are also
likely to receive some industrial wastes, sewage sludges, etc., but these are not included with-
in the boundaries of the system under study here, except those resulting from energy or raw
material consumption by the waste management system itself.
Restwaste
Restwaste or residual waste is collected from both household and commercial sources and
landﬁlled directly. This will vary in composition with geography and time of year and according
to what fractions of the waste stream have been recovered or removed for biological or ther-
mal treatment. Where the landﬁll is located near to the collection area the restwaste will be
delivered directly by the collection vehicles; in the case of a distant landﬁll, the restwaste may

to the landﬁll in larger capacity trucks, rail cars or barges.
Sorting residues 
Sorting residues from waste sorting processes at Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) or
Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) plants (Chapter 10), or from pre-sorting processes at biological
treatment plants (Chapter 11). 
Biological treatment residues
Residual material from composting or biogasiﬁcation processes. This is the stabilised organic
material produced that does not become valorised as compost, due to contamination or lack of
a suitable market.
Ash
Ash from thermal processing, whether it has been burned as mixed MSW, as RDF or as
source-separated material (Chapter 13). This will include the bottom ash (or clinker/slag),
which is disposed of in non-hazardous landﬁlls and the ﬂy ash and residues from gas cleaning
systems, which are disposed of with the bottom ash in some countries but in others are
deposited separately in hazardous waste landﬁlls.
Solid waste from energy production or raw material manufacture
Solid waste generated during the production of energy, fuel and other raw materials (such as
the plastic for refuse sacks), which are consumed within the system is another source of solid
waste resulting from the waste management system itself, which is included in Figure 21.1. In a
full ‘dustbin to grave’ analysis these also need to be taken into consideration. The data given for
the amounts of these wastes (Chapter 9) often do not specify the composition of these wastes,
though it is likely that, in most countries, a large part will be comprised of ash from energy 
generation plants. While some of these materials may have possible further uses, or alternative
methods for treatment, it is assumed for the purposes of this study that they are all landﬁlled.
Energy consumption
The landﬁlling process will consume energy both in the form of vehicle fuel and electricity. For
household waste that is landﬁlled directly, where the distance from the collection area to the
landﬁll site is large, a transfer station may be used to bulk up the waste for more efﬁcient trans-
port by larger truck or rail. No data are available on the energy consumption of transfer sta-
tions, although generic fuel consumption data for road transport (Chapter 9) can be used to
estimate fuel consumption for onward transport to the landﬁll site. For all waste types landﬁlled,
fuel and electricity will also be consumed in the operation of the site itself. Data suggest that the
fuel consumption for the landﬁlling process is around 0.6 litres of diesel per cubic metre of void
space ﬁlled (Biffa Waste Services, 1994).
Outputs
The inputs to a landﬁll system occur over a limited time period – essentially the working life of
the site. The outputs from the system occur over a much longer time span, which may involve
Outputs 
413
IWM2 Model Guide

at least tens and maybe even hundreds of years. The outputs calculated in the following 
sections are therefore integrated over time, since the gas and leachate produced by each tonne
of waste landﬁlled will eventually be released.
Landﬁll gas production 
Gas production
This must be considered separately for the types of waste that are landﬁlled. As well as posing
a local health and safety concern, landﬁll gas has a more global environmental effect. Consisting
mainly of methane and carbon dioxide, both ‘greenhouse gases’ (especially the former), landﬁll
gas has become signiﬁcant in the debate over global warming and climate change. Methane has
been reported to be responsible for about 20% of recent increases in global warming (Lashof
and Ahuja, 1990) and landﬁlls are thought to be a major source of methane. In the UK, landﬁlls
are the single largest source of methane, contributing an estimated 46% of total production in
1996 (AEA, 1999), with over 1000 sites reported to be actively producing gas (Brown, 1991).
Globally, it has been estimated that methane from decomposition of municipal solid waste,
whether in crude dumps or organised landﬁlls, could account for 7–20% of all anthropogenic
methane emissions (Thorneloe, and referencess therein, 1991).
Landﬁll gas from Municipal Solid Waste, Restwaste and Sorting residues
In the literature, the amount of landﬁll gas generated per tonne of municipal solid waste
deposited has been estimated by three different methods: 
1. by theoretical calculations using the amount of organic carbon present in the waste 
2. from laboratory-scale lysimeter studies
3. from gas production rates at existing landﬁlls. 
Not surprisingly, therefore, there is considerable variability in the estimates of landﬁll gas pro-
duction (Table 21.2). Theoretical yields tend to be high (e.g. Gendebien et al., 1991), since
they often assume that all of the degradable material does break down, but there may well be
pockets within a landﬁll where little decomposition occurs due to insufﬁcient moisture content.
Lab-scale lysimeter studies use actual refuse, but are not likely to reﬂect fully the conditions
existing in a real landﬁll. Data from existing landﬁlls should be the most appropriate, but these
too are difﬁcult to interpret. 
Gas production rates vary over the active life of a landﬁll (Figure 21.2), so it is necessary to
extrapolate from measured current gas production rates to the total gas production integrated
over this active period. Gas yields from landﬁll sites also do not fully reﬂect the amount of gas
generated within the landﬁll, since the yield will also depend on the gas collection efﬁciency.
Estimates of collection efﬁciencies vary (20–25%, De Baere et al., 1987; 40–70%, Carra and
Cossu, 1990: 40–90%, Augenstein and Pacey, 1991; 40%, RCEP 1993), and will depend on
size, shape and engineering design of the landﬁll site. For the purposes of the LCI model the
default value for landﬁll gas collection is set to zero; this represents a landﬁll with no gas collec-
tion system. Users modelling landﬁlls with gas collection systems can either input their own
data or enter a ﬁgure of between 40 and 90 %, as supported by the references above.
Given the different methods used to reach the estimates of gas production, Table 21.2
shows some consensus on the amounts of gas produced by landﬁlling MSW, at around 
414
Chapter 21: Landﬁlling
IWM2 Model Guide

150 Nm3 per tonne of waste as received (i.e. including moisture content). Some laboratory
studies produced only 120 Nm3 per tonne (Ehrig, 1991), but equally, the average gas yield
from landﬁll sites in the UK has been estimated to be 222 Nm3 per tonne (Richards and Aitchi-
son, 1991), so the amount of gas actually produced may well be in excess of 150 Nm3 per
tonne of Municipal Solid Waste.
Landﬁll gas is only produced from the biodegradable fractions of MSW, however, which are
essentially the putrescible organic fraction, the paper and board fraction and any non-synthetic
textiles. Together these typically constitute around 60% by weight of MSW in Europe (Chapter 8).
Therefore, gas production for these fractions might be expected to average around 
250 Nm3 per tonne. Other fractions such as glass, plastics and metals will probably affect the
rate of decomposition, since their presence is likely to facilitate water percolation of the waste
and diffusion of gases, but they will not markedly affect the total level of decomposition 
over time. Lysimeter studies of these putrescible fractions have shown similar levels of gas 
production from food waste (191–344 Nm3/tonne) and cardboard (317 Nm3/tonne), but
lower values for magazines (100–225 Nm3/tonne) and newspaper (120 Nm3) (Ehrig, 1991).
Comparisons with the biogasiﬁcation process (Chapter 11) are also useful. In a much shorter
time span (≤20 days) up to 150 Nm3 of biogas can be produced per tonne of biomass in the
accelerated process under controlled conditions. As degradation in a landﬁll occurs over a
much longer time, more complete decomposition is likely to occur than in the biogasiﬁcation
process, and there are also likely to be some process losses in biogasiﬁcation. A ﬁgure of 
250 Nm3 landﬁll gas per tonne of biodegradable waste (organic, paper and textile
fractions) is therefore considered realistic and used in the LCI model.

Table 21.2 Production of landﬁll gas from MSW and selected waste fractions

Landﬁll gas from biologically treated material
Where biological treatment has been used to reduce the volume of waste for disposal, or where
markets cannot be found for composted or anaerobically digested residues, these materials 
are also landﬁlled, and biochemical degradation will continue within the landﬁll. There are few
estimates of the amount of landﬁll gas produced by such material. In laboratory studies, partially
composted MSW (‘a few days in a technical compost reactor’) produced 133 Nm3 of landﬁll
gas (compared to 160 Nm3 for untreated MSW in the same test), while a partially composted
organic fraction produced 176 Nm3 (Ehrig, 1991). For residues from biogasiﬁcation and 
composting, IFEU (1992) used an estimate for landﬁll gas production of 20Nm3 per tonne of
restwaste entering the biogas/composting process. If, as in some biogasiﬁcation processes
(Chapter 11) the residue represents 20% of the input, this would give a gas production of 
100 Nm3 per tonne of residue landﬁlled. In the LCI model, this ﬁgure of 100 Nm3 per
tonne of residue landﬁlled will be used for gas production from landﬁlled residues
from both composting and biogasiﬁcation processes.
Landﬁll gas from ash
Given complete combustion, any ash entering a landﬁll should contain no organic carbon.
Therefore no landﬁll gas should be generated. Not all combustion processes will completely
remove the carbon, but it will be assumed for the purposes of this model that no land-
ﬁll gas is produced from ash.
Landﬁll gas composition
Landﬁll gas is produced by the anaerobic decomposition of biodegradable organic material. As
different anaerobic reactions proceed at varying rates, the composition of the gas released will
vary through the different phases of the active life of a landﬁll site, as shown in Figure 21.3. It will
also vary with the type of waste contained, but a typical landﬁll gas composition is given in Table
21.3. The major component is methane, which usually comprises 50–55%, followed by carbon
dioxide which makes up most of the remaining volume. In addition more than 100 different

volatile organic compounds have been identiﬁed as trace components, many of which are
known to be toxic or carcinogenic. The actual trace components vary according to the landﬁll
and the landﬁlled waste, but the major ones found are hydrogen sulphide, vinyl chloride, ben-
zene, toluene, trichlorethane and mercaptans (Willumsen, 1991). 
If no collection system exists for gas control or energy recovery, all of the landﬁll gas will
eventually leak out of the site and enter the atmosphere. Where gas collection occurs, around
40% will typically be recovered (see above), whilst the remaining 60% still enters the atmo-
sphere.
Gas control and energy recovery
In the simplest form of gas control, the collected gas is ﬂared on the site to destroy both the
combustible fractions of the gas and most of the organic trace components. Any methane, car-
bon monoxide and hydrogen in the landﬁll gas should be converted to carbon dioxide and
water if combustion is complete. Comparing the performance of three different ﬂaring sys-
tems, Baldwin and Scott (1991) found a large difference in combustion efﬁciency, however,
with one system releasing 16% of the ﬂare exhaust as unburned methane. In an efﬁcient ﬂare,
however, all of the methane was shown to be burned. An efﬁcient ﬂare was also shown to sig-
niﬁcantly reduce, but not remove completely, levels of trace components from 4427 mg/m3 to
32.8 mg/m3 (a 99.3% reduction) (Table 21.4). Analysis of the ﬂared gas from several systems
also showed low levels (< 10 mg/m3) of components not present in the unburned gas, such as
methyl cyanide, nitromethane, acrolein, ethylene oxide and some alkynes, which must be
formed de novo in the ﬂaring process. 
Landﬁll gas combustion control is enforced by regulatory requirements in Germany, The
Netherlands, Switzerland, France and some states in the USA. Enclosed ﬂare technology was
developed in response to these requirements. Although enclosed ﬂaring costs approximately
four times as much as open ﬂaring, combustion is more controlled and can be monitored more
effectively (ENDS, 1999). The UK Environment Agency guidelines stipulate combustion at a
minimum of 1000°C for at least 0.3 seconds. Table 21.5 summarises the landﬁll gas ﬂare regu-
latory requirements in Germany and Switzerland.
Where the collected landﬁll gas is used for energy recovery, this can involve either heating
applications (steam raising via boilers, kiln ﬁring or space heating), or power generation sys-
tems. Power generation systems can involve spark-ignition or dual-fuel diesel engines, or gas
turbines (in increasing order of generation capacity). Before the landﬁll gas is burned in these
engines it is normally compressed and dewatered, which also removes most of the trace con-
taminants to protect the engines from acid gases and particulate matter. Comparison of the
exhaust emissions from the different types of gas engines suggests that levels of contaminants
can differ widely, as in Table 21.6. 
The composition of landﬁll gas (with a typical methane content of around 55%) is similar to
that of biogas (Chapter 11), so has a similar heat content. Given a caloriﬁc value of 37.75 MJ/Nm3
for methane (Perry and Green, 1984), landﬁll gas has an energy content of 20.8 MJ/ Nm3.
The UK Department of Environment (1989) gives a ﬁgure of 15–21 MJ/Nm3 of landﬁll gas,
depending on its methane content. A heat content of 18 MJ/Nm3 will be assumed for this
analysis. This amount of thermal energy is released on combustion; the amount of useful
energy resulting will depend on whether the gas is used for heating or power generation pur-
poses. For the purposes of this study, it will be assumed that where energy recovery

Table 21.6 Emissions from power generation plants using landﬁll gas.
Notes: Differences in emissions reﬂect both differences between 
gas engine types and differences in the quality of the incoming landﬁll gas.
At sites A and B the gas was dried, ﬁltered, compressed and cooled before
use. At site C the gas was passed through a wet scrubber to remove acid
gases, then compressed, cooled,  ﬁltered and heated to 70°C before 
combustion. All three sites were in the UK. Source: Young and Blakey

occurs it involves the burning of landﬁll gas in a gas engine to generate electricity,
which is then exported into the grid. A conversion efﬁciency of 30% will be assumed
(ETSU, 1995); this is in line with the value used for the biogas engine in Chapter 11
(Schneider, 1992; Schön, 1992), giving an electrical energy recovery of 1.5 kWh per
Nm3 of landﬁll gas collected. 
Leachate
As with landﬁll gas, it is difﬁcult to provide ‘typical’ ﬁgures for the generation of leachate from
landﬁlled wastes, since both the amount and composition of leachate will depend on many fac-
tors, including the nature of the waste landﬁlled, the landﬁlling method and level of compaction,
the engineering design of the landﬁll, and the annual rainfall of the region.
Leachate production
The amount of leachate produced within a landﬁll will depend mainly on the rainfall of the area,
how well the landﬁll is sealed (especially the cap), and the original water content of the waste
deposited. Data on the amount of leachate produced by actual landﬁll sites are not commonly
reported, but IFEU (1992) estimates that around 13% of the rainfall on a landﬁll site emerges
as leachate. For sites in Germany with an average annual rainfall of 750 mm, this would pro-
duce around 100 litres of leachate per square metre of landﬁll site, per year. Using an estimat-
ed 20-metre depth of landﬁlled waste, with an approximate density of 1 tonne/m3, this gives a
leachate production of 5 litres per tonne of landﬁlled waste per year. If the active period for
leachate production is around 30 years, the total amount of leachate produced would be 150 litres
per tonne of waste. The model therefore assumes that 150 litres of leachate is 
produced per tonne of waste landﬁlled.
Leachate composition
More data are available on the composition of landﬁll leachate than on the volume produced,
but since the leachate composition depends mainly on the nature of the waste landﬁlled,
reported leachate data differ widely. As with landﬁll gas, leachate composition also varies with
the stage of decomposition of the waste: the initial acidiﬁcation stage is characterised by low
pH, along with high levels of organic matter (high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) values), calcium, magnesium, iron and sulphate, which all
decline as the methanogenic stage is reached (Spinosa et al., 1991). 
A range of composition data from Municipal Solid Waste leachate are given in Table 21.7,
from which the complexity of leachate mixtures can be seen. A range of volatile organic materials
plus up to 46 non-volatile organic substances have been analysed from a single landﬁll site
(Öman and Hynning, 1991). Since in many cases the biochemical pathways involved in the
creation of leachate substances are not known, it is not possible to allocate individual pollutants
to the different fractions of Municipal Solid Waste. One exception is the organic content of the
leachate (BOD/COD), which is derived from the biodegradable fractions, i.e. from the
putrescible organic, paper and textile fractions. For the purposes of modelling, therefore,
it is assumed that all of the BOD produced originates from these three fractions. All
other leachate components are assumed to arise equally from all of the MSW material
fractions that are landﬁlled, since it is not possible to identify their source with any
degree of certainty.

Table 21.7 Composition of landﬁll leachates from MSW, ash and biologically
treated material (mg/litre, except for dioxins/furans). Source: IFEU (1992)

Leachate composition data for the other two major types of material from the Municipal
Solid Waste stream entering landﬁlls, biologically treated material (composting and biogasiﬁca-
tion residues) and thermally treated material (ash), are also given in Table 21.7. Note that the
residues from thermal treatment will include both bottom ash (clinker), which is relatively inert,
and ﬂy ash, which often contains high levels of inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals and
salts. In some countries the ﬂy ash is classiﬁed as a hazardous waste and subjected to stricter
controls during its disposal. No data were available for the leachate composition from ﬂy ash-
containing landﬁlls, however. For the calculation of leachate resulting from ash in land-
ﬁlls in the LCI model, the ﬂy ash and bottom ash amounts are combined, and the
leachate composition from bottom ash is used. 
Leachate collection and treatment
Landﬁlls operated on a ‘dilute and disperse’ basis will release all of the leachate generated into
the surrounding soil and rock strata, where the constituent materials may be further broken
down by soil micro-organisms, adsorbed onto soil particles or may enter the groundwater sys-
tem. Most large modern landﬁlls are lined by a geomembrane or layer of compacted clay,
however, and operate on a ‘containment’ basis. The leachate produced within the sealed land-
ﬁll can either be recirculated to accelerate the process of decomposition, or drained/ pumped
out for leachate treatment. Both recirculation and leachate treatment will consume
energy, though these are not included in the present model due to lack of suitable
data (if the user has data, this energy should be added to the total energy input for
the landﬁll section).
Leachate treatment can involve a range of physical (neutralisation, evaporation, drying, etc.)
and biological (anaerobic digestion, bio-oxidation) processes to produce an efﬂuent that can be
discharged to municipal sewage systems or surface waters. Depending on the process used,
the treatment of leachate from the methanogenic phase of landﬁll activity can produce from 
9 to 22 kg of solid residue for every cubic metre treated (Weber and Holz, 1991). These
residues can themselves be treated by incineration or landﬁlling, in which case they will pro-
duce further residues and emissions. For simplicity in the LCI model, any leachate treat-
ment residues will be added to the total amount of ﬁnal solid waste.
As was discussed in Chapter 13, it is generally accepted that most landﬁll liners will eventual-
ly leak, so that part of the leachate will be discharged directly into the underlying strata, from
where it can contaminate the groundwater. For a lined site, therefore, It is difﬁcult to estimate
the proportion of the leachate generated that will be collected and treated, as opposed to leak-
ing into the substrata. The level of leakage will depend on many factors, including the type of
liner used (single versus multi-layered, mineral versus synthetic membrane, etc.), the geology
of the site (permeability of underlying strata), and the efﬁciency of any leachate collection and
treatment system. Although there is evidence that many lined landﬁlls have leaked, there is little
empirical data on leakage amounts. For the purposes of the LCI model the default value
for leachate collection is set to zero; this represents a landﬁll with no leachate col-
lection system. Users modelling landﬁlls with leachate collection systems should
input their own data or can enter an estimated ﬁgure. This is clearly an area where reliable
data are urgently needed.

Final inert solid waste
Although it does not physically leave the site, one of the primary outputs of the solid waste
management systems described in this book is the ﬁnal solid waste left in a landﬁll at the end of
all decomposition processes. This will not be the same weight of waste as was originally land-
ﬁlled, since some of the waste has been degraded and will be released from the landﬁll as land-
ﬁll gas or leachate. The weight of each type of solid waste (mixed MSW, waste sorting residues,
biological treatment residues, ash) that enter landﬁll is known, but the amount remaining after
decomposition will depend on how extensive the degradation process has been. Rather than
attempt to predict the weight loss of the waste while in the landﬁll, the input ton-
nages will be used as amounts of ﬁnal solid waste.
In any case, the important attribute of the ﬁnal solid waste is its volume, rather than its
weight, since landﬁll sites ﬁll up rather than get too heavy. Using the speciﬁc densities of the 
different waste materials (Table 21.8) and the known input tonnages, it is possible to calculate
the volume of material that is consigned to landﬁll. Whilst some further compaction and settling
of the landﬁlled material may occur as decomposition occurs, this volume will approximate

to the ﬁnal volume of solid waste resulting from landﬁlling, and will be the ﬁgure
used for the output of the LCI model.
The environmental consequence of the remaining ﬁnal solid waste is land consumption (or
land generation if landﬁlling is used as a means of land reclamation). If we assume an average
depth of waste in a landﬁll (IFEU, 1992, assuming a depth of 20 m), it is possible to calculate
from ﬁnal solid waste volume to space consumption by landﬁlling. Since landﬁlls vary widely in
geometry, however, depending on whether they are used to reclaim former quarries, clay pits,
or as above-ground structures, this conversion will not be attempted, and the environmental
burden of producing solid waste will be quoted as a volume requirement in this LCI model.
Economic costs
As with the other waste treatment options discussed earlier, the economic costs of landﬁlling
vary widely across Europe and North America. The variability reﬂects geographical differences
mainly in land costs, landﬁll design and engineering requirements and labour costs. A detailed
model for the evaluation of the economics of landﬁll gas recovery is available (Milke,1998), but
a far less detailed approach is applied in this model to keep it simple. 
The economic costs of landﬁlling should include the cost of the land, capital costs of site con-
struction, operating costs, closure costs and long-term post-closure monitoring and aftercare
costs. It is unlikely that most costs currently quoted fully account for all of these costs, in partic-
ular those for post-closure monitoring and aftercare. The duration of post-closure monitoring
and aftercare may be extensive. In the USA, a 30-year post-closure monitoring period is man-
dated, although there can be signiﬁcant leachate emissions for considerably longer periods. As
discussed above, leakages are also quite likely to occur: a survey found that 18% of 1000 UK
landﬁll sites studied had suffered ‘signiﬁcant’ pollution incidents or failures (ENDS, 1992).
Remedial costs following leakages can also be very expensive. Escapes of landﬁll gas accounted
for most (48%) of the pollution incidents in the above survey, typically costing 65,000–130,000
euro to remediate. Surface water contamination accounted for 27% of incidents, with a typical
cost of 6500–20,000 euro, whilst ground water pollution, accounting for 15% of incidents, had
costs typically ranging from 65,000 to 1.3 million euro. Several instances of groundwater pollu-
tion cost over 1.3 million euro to rectify.
As a result of the above potential costs for remediation work, it is likely that the real cost of
landﬁlling is higher than currently quoted ﬁgures. A report by Pearce and Turner (1993) came
to the same conclusion and suggested that additional external costs of between 1 and 5 euro
per tonne should be added to the current ﬁgures. The same is likely to hold, to varying
degrees, in other European countries.

The collection and pre-sorting module covered transport of the residual waste to either a local
landﬁll site or a transfer station if a distant landﬁll site is used. If a transfer station is used, the user
must input the amount of energy/fuel used at the station per tonne of waste managed. The
model calculates the total amounts of energy/fuel consumed to handle all of the waste, and
adds this to the fuel/energy consumption totals within the model.
For onward transport to the landﬁll, the user enters the one-way distance to the landﬁll site.
The model calculates the fuel consumed, assuming a 40-tonne truck capacity and that no
return load is carried.

Energy Consumption:
Electrical energy consumption of landﬁll site (kWh per tonne input)

efﬁciency percentage) is added to the air emissions total. The collected portion is assumed to
be burned, whether in a ﬂare, furnace or gas engine, with the resultant air emissions. If energy

If the site is unlined, or lined but with no leachate collection and treatment system, it is assumed

the leachate materials are therefore added to the totals for water emissions. If the site is lined
and leachate collected and treated, the amount collected is calculated using the collection efﬁ-
ciency estimate, and the resulting efﬂuent and residues added to the respective totals for water
emissions and solid waste. The amount not collected is again assumed to leak from the site,
and is added to the water emissions totals.
Costs:
Transfer/transport cost of restwaste (£/tonne)

The user inserts appropriate local unit costs for these operations, per tonne of waste material
handled. The cost of landﬁlling should be inclusive of site purchase, construction, operation, gas

the overall system cost.

Summary
Energy consumption and emissions for recycled material manufacture are quantiﬁed where
possible. These are then compared with the energy consumption and emissions associated
with the production of an equivalent amount of the virgin material, so that overall savings or
additional costs can be calculated.
Deﬁning the system boundaries
The inputs and outputs of the recycling process are presented in Figure 22.1. The recycling
processes are included within the system boundaries of this waste management LCI, but the
processing of recycled materials into recycled products is outside the system boundaries of this
model.

Inputs
Several reports have been produced providing data on the energy consumption and emissions
resulting from materials recycling (e.g. Habersatter, 1991; Henstock, 1992; Ogilvie, 1992; Por-
teous, 1992; Boustead, 1993a, b; BUWAL, 1998). Before using such data in the context of this
chapter, however, it is necessary to determine their relevance.
In many cases the aim of the studies (e.g. Henstock, 1992) has been to compare the envi-
ronmental burdens of producing recycled versus virgin material. This comparison is made on a
‘cradle-to-produced material’ basis: for virgin material this is from extraction of raw materials,
whilst for recycled materials the cradle is often deﬁned as the start of the collection process for
the waste materials. This is not the appropriate comparison to determine the environmental
savings or costs that can be attributed to the recovered materials leaving an IWM system. The
environmental burdens of collection and sorting are included in such reports, but in the IWM-
2 model developed in this book, they have already been accounted for within the waste man-
agement system boundaries. Therefore, what the present study requires are data for just the
transport to the reprocessors and for the reprocessing itself. These can be added to the bur-
dens of the deﬁned waste management system. If any relative savings/costs are to be calculat-
ed, the relevant comparison would be between the transport and reprocessing burdens for the
recycled material, and the total burdens for the virgin material, from raw material extraction to
produced material (Figure 22.2).
A second note of caution is needed when interpreting the burdens of materials recycling. The
burdens associated with material production (whether virgin or recycled) are usually presented
on the basis of per kilogram (or per tonne) material produced, i.e. per unit of output. This is not
the form of data relevant for an LCI of solid waste. The ultimate function of an IWM system is to
manage a given amount of waste in an environmentally and economically sustainable way, not to
produce recycled material (Chapter 5). The functional unit of the whole system is therefore the
amount of waste entering the system, not the amount of recovered or recycled material leaving
the system. If the reprocessing stage is to be taken into account in the overall system, therefore,
data on environmental burdens need to be in the form of per tonne of recovered material sent
for recycling, i.e. per unit of input, rather than output.
In the following sections covering the environmental burden of reprocessing each of the
recovered materials, data will be presented for the following:
1. Energy consumption and emissions associated with production of the virgin materials that
this material could replace (starting from raw material extraction). 
2. Energy consumption and emissions associated with the reprocessing of recovered materials
into recycled material. 
3. The potential saving (or addition) of energy consumption and emissions for every tonne of
recovered material sent for reprocessing. 
4. Energy consumption and emissions associated with transporting the recovered material
from the collection/sorting facility to the reprocessing facility. This needs to be subtracted
from any potential savings to determine the actual savings (or additional costs) likely.
When considering the potential savings associated with materials recycling, the following notes
of caution should be borne in mind.

The data presented below tend to be generic (average data) or taken from a speciﬁc study of
individual processes. Whilst the purpose is to give a broad indication of the available savings, the
data will not be universally applicable.

Environmental benefits (or costs) of including recycling in an IWM system
Comparing the overall burdens of an IWM system with recovery plus reprocessing of materials
(Ar + B), with a system without materials recovery, where all products use virgin materials (Anr +
C), the difference in the overall (system) environmental burden due to recycling is (Ar + B) − (Anr
+ C), where Ar  is the burden of an IWM system that includes collection and sorting of recyclables,
and Anr is the burden of a waste system that does not include collection and sorting of
recyclables.
Difference in overall burden due to recycling  = Ar + B − Anr − C = ΔA + B − C
Where ΔA = difference between burden of IWM system with collection and sorting of recyclable,
and system with only disposal of these materials, i. e.  (Ar − Anr )
There will be an overall environmental benefit (reduced burden) so long as ΔA + B < C.
Choosing between recycled and virgin material
In product or package manufacture, there will be an environmental reason for choosing recycled
over virgin material if the burdens of producing the recycled material are less than those of
producing an equivalent amount of the virgin material,
i.e. ΔA + B < C for  that material,
where
ΔA = the difference in burden between collecting and sorting the material and collecting
and disposing of the material by incineration and/or landfilling,
 
B  = the burden of transporting and reprocessing the material
C = the burden of production from virgin raw materials.
Figure 22.2 Calculating the environmental beneﬁts of recycling versus the
use of virgin materials.

It is assumed that recycled material performs equally well and can replace an equal quantity of
virgin material. This is not always the case since some high grade materials, e.g. writing papers,
etc. cannot be replaced with recycled materials of equal quality.
Transport burdens
The energy consumption and emissions (per tonne) associated with transporting the 
recovered materials from the collection or sorting site (at which point they leave the basic LCI
model developed in this book) to the reprocessing site will obviously vary with the distance
involved. The fuel consumption data in Chapter 9 and the fuel production and use data in
Chapter 5 are used to calculate the energy consumption and emissions associated with this
transport. The calculation assumes that 20-tonne (payload) trucks are used and that the trucks
carry loads in both directions. 
Feed-stock energy
There has been considerable discussion as to whether feed stock energy should be included in
comparisons between virgin and recycled materials. Habersatter (1991) includes the feed stock
or inherent energy of both virgin and recycled materials, whereas Henstock (1992), in a com-
parison of recycled and virgin low-density polyethylene, includes the inherent energy of the
raw materials used to make the virgin resin, but not the inherent energy of the recovered plas-
tic used to produce the recycled resin. This convention signiﬁcantly increases the apparent
energy savings due to recycling. The decision must reﬂect the aim of the study, which is deﬁned
in the goal deﬁnition (Chapters 4 and 5). The aim of this study is to predict the energy con-
sumption and emissions associated with managing the solid waste of an area in an environ-
mentally and economically sustainable way. 
The inherent energy contained in the waste entering the system is not considered as con-
tributing to the energy consumption. Therefore the inherent energy of the recovered
material will not be considered as part of the energy consumption of the recycling
process. For consistency, therefore, the inherent energy of the virgin raw materials
will also not be included as part of the energy consumption of virgin materials. It can
be argued that the inherent energy of the material has not actually been consumed; it has
merely been locked up and can be released at a later time, e.g. by burning as a fuel. The net
effect of this convention is to give conservative estimates of the energy savings due to recycling.
The processing energy savings and inherent energy savings of recycling are both given in 
Table 22.1, for all materials, so the higher value can be calculated if required.
Paper
A wide range of data has been reported for the energy consumption and emissions associated
with the production of paper, whether from recovered or virgin materials. The ﬁgures differ
according to the type of pulp or paper that is being produced (e.g. newsprint or bleached

Table 22.1 Summary of environmental beneﬁts and costs of recycling. Table gives the calculated effect on energy consump-
tion and emissions of reprocessing recovered materials, compared to the production of virgin material. Results are per
tonne of recycled material produced. 
Note: ﬁgures are indicative only and vary with processes and equipment used. Figures give the difference between reprocess-
ing burdens for producing 1 tonne of recycled material and the burdens of producing 1 tonne of virgin material. The 
burdens of collecting and sorting the recovered material, and transporting it to the reprocessors are not included. Similarly,
diversion of recovered material from landﬁll is not included in the solid waste savings

sulphite paper), and the boundaries chosen for the calculations (e.g. whether the data are for
pulp production only, or for complete paper production; whether de-inking is included for
recycled paper or not, etc.). What is important when making comparisons, is that similar prod-
ucts are compared and that comparable boundaries are drawn.
For newsprint production using 100% recovered paper, for example, the primary energy
consumption for pulping, de-inking, paper making and efﬂuent treatment has been calculated at
14.5 GJ per tonne produced. (This does not include collection, sorting and transport.) Equiva-
lent production of newsprint from virgin wood consumes 21.0 GJ per tonne, giving a primary
energy saving due to recycling of 6.5 GJ per tonne produced (Pulp and Paper, 1976). Similar
savings have been calculated when energy consumption has been averaged across the different
grades of paper and board produced (Figure 22.3). The average primary energy requirements
for virgin and recycled paper processing were reported as 25.1 GJ (range 20–28) per tonne
and 18.0 GJ per tonne, respectively in 1985, giving an average saving of 7.1 GJ per tonne
(Porter and Roberts, 1985). It is likely that energy consumption has fallen since that time, due
to more efﬁcient processing techniques. The requirement for virgin paper making in the UK in
1989, for example, was around 21 GJ per tonne produced (Ogilvie, 1992).
Considerably higher energy consumption ﬁgures for both virgin and recycled paper have
been quoted by some sources. Habersatter (1991), using data from Swedish and Swiss
sources, gives energy consumptions of 53.0 GJ per tonne for production of virgin unbleached
sulphite paper and 29.7 GJ per tonne for 100% recycled paper. The reason for this apparently
higher energy consumption is that the inherent energy (i.e. caloriﬁc value) of the wood or
recovered paper feed stock is also included in these totals. The inherent or feed stock energy
of wood or waste paper is around 15 GJ per tonne and 2.02 tonnes of air-dried wood or 
1.02 tonnes of recovered paper are needed to produce 1 tonne of unbleached sulphite pulp
or 1 tonne of recycled ﬁbre pulp, respectively (Habersatter, 1991). Subtracting the appropriate
feed-stock energies (30.3 GJ/tonne and 15.3 GJ/tonne, respectively) leaves a processing energy
requirement for unbleached sulphite paper of 22.7 GJ/tonne and 14.4 GJ/tonne for recycled
paper. These accord with the data quoted above, giving an energy saving due to the process-
ing associated with recycling of 8.3 GJ per tonne of paper produced.
Before leaving the subject of energy consumption in paper production, it is necessary to add
a cautionary note on using primary energy totals alone to compare the environmental beneﬁts
of paper recycling. As well as the total energy consumption, it is necessary to know how the
energy was produced, and in particular, whether it came from renewable or non-renewable

sources. Many pulp and paper mills in Sweden, for example, generate their own electricity and
steam on site using by-products from the pulping process (bark, process liquors, etc.). Some
plants produce excess steam or electricity, which is exported from the site. Such use of biomass
(a renewable energy resource) will result in no net production of some emissions, such as car-
bon dioxide, since these were absorbed during the growing of the trees in the ﬁrst place. By
contrast, recycling processes will tend to use power generated from fossil fuel with a net pro-
duction of carbon dioxide and depletion of ﬁnite fossil fuel reserves (though equally power
could be generated from on-site boilers fuelled by waste paper). The point here is that energy
consumption is not an environmental burden in itself; what is important are the environmental
burdens resulting from the generation of the energy used, i.e. the emissions and the depletion
of ﬁnite resources.
Carbon balance
In the IWM-2 model, to allow the allocation of the environmental burdens of paper recycling,
paper production using virgin material (wood) is allocated a CO2 credit (a negative burden) as
it requires grown trees to be harvested. It is assumed the wood comes from forests managed
in a sustainable manner and young trees are re-planted as part of the usual forest management
process. The growth period of trees is when they take up and ﬁx CO2 most rapidly, so paper
production from virgin material results in a net uptake of CO2.
Paper recycling on the other hand, does not require trees to be cut down and therefore the
rapid CO2 uptake associated with new growth does not occur. As paper recycling uses energy,
the overall process is a net CO2 producer (but many other air and water emissions are avoid-
ed by paper recycling) (Figure 22.4).

Table 22.2 Energy consumption and emissions from recycled and virgin
paper production.
*Not including inherent energy of feed stock materials

In the IWM-2 model paper production from virgin material is allocated a CO2 credit of
1.833 tonnes CO2 per tonne virgin wood consumed (BUWAL, 1998) (the US EPA model uses
a ﬁgure of 2.2 tonnes CO2 per tonne virgin wood consumed, from Kramer and Kozlowski,
1979). This credit is added to the total CO2 burden from virgin paper production presented in
Table 22.2. It is expressed in the model by subtracting the emissions associated with recycled
paper production from the total emissions associated with virgin paper production, represent-
ed as A–B in Figure 22.4.
The emissions (to air, water and as solid waste) associated with production of recycled and
virgin paper are presented in Table 22.2. Note that these data relate to conditions in Switzer-
land where steam production for both virgin and recycled paper production uses fossil fuels,
and electricity production is assumed to be according to the general UCPTE model introduced
in Chapter 5. If virgin pulps were made in integrated pulp mills such as in Sweden, fuelled by
biowaste by-products, the emission levels associated with virgin pulp production would be
generally lower.
To calculate the energy consumption and emissions per tonne of recovered paper sent for
reprocessing, rather than per tonne of recycled paper produced requires data on material loss-
es during the process. The actual process losses will depend on the quality of the input ﬁbres,
the level of ﬁller in the recovered material, the type of recycling process employed and the

quality of recycled product required. For recycled newsprint manufacture, a loss of 15–18% is
typical (Claydon, 1991; US EPA, 1997), and across different paper grades a general loss of
15–20% applies (Cathie and Guest, 1991). Taking the former ﬁgure and an energy saving of
5.6 GJ per tonne produced (above), the energy saving amounts to 4.8 GJ per tonne of recov-
ered paper sent for reprocessing. There are few savings in emissions and in the overall amount
of solid waste generated as the pulping process has improved signiﬁcantly in recent years,
whereas, the environmental burdens associated with paper recycling (mainly from the de-inking
process) have remained unchanged.
Glass
The use of recovered glass cullet in glass making has the advantage of lowering the furnace
temperature needed to melt the other raw material ingredients. These energy savings can be
estimated by the simple equation:
Energy savings (%) = 0.25 × % of scrap glass used (BUWAL,1998).
Considering the process of glass recycling up to the production of the hot ‘gob’ of glass, 
energy consumption and emissions data per tonne of 100% recycled glass produced are 
presented in Table 22.3. 
Corresponding data for the production of 100% virgin glass are not available, since all glass
production processes incorporate some recovered glass, either collected post-consumer materi-
al or production scrap, because of the furnace energy savings available. Extrapolating linearly from
the data for recycling rates of 100%, 65% and 60% given by BUWAL (1998), however, it is pos-
sible to estimate the energy consumption and associated emissions for glass production from vir-
gin materials (Table 22.3). Using this estimate, it can be seen that the recycling of glass saves
around 3.46 GJ per tonne of glass produced. There are savings in the amounts of those emissions
that are associated with this energy production, but there are slight increases in the amounts of
some air emissions, notably NOx, hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) and lead, associated with recycling. 
Contaminants (metals, ceramics, paper) are reported to constitute 2.7% of the feed stock
(Habersatter, 1991). The default substitution ratio (the amount of virgin product replaced by 
1 tonne of recycled product) in the model assumes that contamination is around this 3% level
in feed-stock cullet.

Metal – ferrous
Typical primary energy consumption and emissions associated with the full production process
for tinplate from 100% recovered material are presented in Table 22.4, along with data for the
production of tinplate from virgin materials. These ﬁgures, from BUWAL (1998), suggest an energy
saving of around 18.6 GJ per tonne of tinplate produced, when recovered tinplate is used.
There are also savings in most, but not all emissions.

Table 22.3 Energy consumption and emissions from recycled and virgin
glass production.
*Calculated by extrapolation from data for 100%, 65% and 60% recycled
glass

The amount of recovered material input that is lost in the reprocessing of tinplate is report-
ed as 8.2% by Habersatter (1991); Porteous (1992) suggests a loss of 5% in the process up to
the production of de-tinned washed steel. Taking the former value would mean that each
tonne of recovered tinplate delivered to the reprocessors would produce 918 kg of recycled
tinplate. The typical primary energy consumption associated with this production would there-
fore be 18.36 GJ per tonne of recovered tinplate used, or an energy saving (when compared
to the use of virgin materials) of around 12.4 GJ per tonne (using the BUWAL data). Compar-
isons of the amounts of emissions (including solid waste) associated with the processing of 
1 tonne of recovered tinplate scrap versus production of an equivalent amount of tinplate from
virgin are also presented in Table 22.4.
For the large part of ferrous scrap not in the form of tinplate, reprocessing is simpler and
consists only of removal of contaminants and then remelting. For iron, the energy needed to
remelt is 1.8 GJ per tonne whilst iron production from ore requires 7.92 GJ per tonne. This
would give an energy saving of 6.12 GJ per tonne of recycled iron produced. For steel, the
energy saving of using electric arc melting of scrap versus virgin steel production using a blast
furnace is around 15.8 GJ per tonne (Ogilvie, 1992). Assuming the same material loss as used
above (8.2%), the possible savings from recycling of iron and steel, per tonne of recovered
material used, would be 5.0 GJ and 12.9 GJ, respectively.

Table 22.4 Energy consumption and emissions from recycled and virgin
tinplate production

Metal – aluminium
There are clear energy advantages in the use of recovered material to produce aluminium, due
to the large energy requirement of production from virgin materials (bauxite). Since the pro-
duction of virgin aluminium relies on electrolysis and consumes large amounts of electrical
energy, the total primary energy consumption and emissions are heavily dependent on the
method used for electricity generation. Data from Switzerland for the energy consumption and
emissions associated with the production, per tonne, of both virgin and recycled aluminium are
presented in Table 22.5. Average European values have been used for primary aluminium pro-
duction, rolling and recycling. As only 60% of the aluminium used in Switzerland comes from
Europe, the actual places of origin of the metal (Canada and Iceland) have been considered for
the remaining 40%. Production in these countries is solely by means of hydroelectric power.
The data here use a ‘Western world’ model (UCPTE, 1994) for electricity generation.
The data presented here show that energy savings associated with aluminium recycling can
be in the order of 175 GJ per tonne of recycled aluminium produced. There are also large sav-
ings in most of the associated emissions to both air and water, and in the overall amount of solid
waste produced.
In the model a material loss of 5% during the recycling process is assumed (a default value of
95% substitution ratio), due to the removal of any contaminants in the recovered material feed
stock, and that this material becomes an additional residue for landﬁlling. The savings in primary
energy and emissions per tonne of recovered aluminium sent for reprocessing are calculated
by the model.

Table 22.5 Energy consumption and emissions from recycled and virgin
aluminium production.
*Using a ‘Western world’ scenario for electricity generation

Plastics
There have been numerous reports calculating the energy consumption and emissions associat-
ed with the production of speciﬁc virgin plastic resins (e.g. Kindler and Mosthaf, 1989; Lundholm
and Sundström, 1986; Habersatter, 1991; PWMI, 1993 [see review in Ogilvie, 1992]). Compa-
rable detailed data are not available, however, for the process of plastics recycling, probably due
to its relatively recent introduction and rapid rate of development. Clark and New (1991) suggest
that the energy savings from plastics recycling vary from 27 to 215 GJ/tonne, depending on the
resin type, but there is no detail on how these ﬁgures are obtained. A more detailed study by
Henstock (1992) reports the energy consumption and some emissions associated with the
reprocessing of low-density polyethylene ﬁlm collected from supermarkets into recycled LDPE
granules and then into recycled polyethylene bags. The primary energy consumption of the
reprocessing from recovered LDPE ﬁlm into recycled LDPE granules (excluding sorting at the
stores and transport) is presented as between 25.4 and 33.2 GJ per tonne of recycled LDPE
produced. The air emissions that result from the electrical power and propane consumption
during the process are presented in Table 22.6, but no details of emissions to water are provided. 
For reprocessing of rigid plastic bottles (HDPE), Deurloo (1990) gives a ﬁgure of 2.88 GJ of
electricity per tonne of recycled HDPE produced (equivalent to 7.6 GJ thermal energy/tonne,
using the UCPTE generation efﬁciency of 37.8% – Chapter 5). Again, the only air emissions
included are those for the electricity generation, but data for water emissions were given 
(Table 22.6).

*Assuming a material loss of 5%; †assuming a material loss of 15%; ‡using best case data; §feed-stock energy not included;
¶calculated from power consumption and material losses

For the production of virgin LDPE and HDPE, data (averaged across Europe) give total pri-
mary energy consumptions of 88.55 GJ and 80.98 GJ per tonne, respectively (PWMI, 1993).
These include the inherent energy of the feed-stock material used (47.73 GJ/t), and it can be
argued whether this should be included when comparisons are made. As discussed above,
using the recovered material does result in the saving of the raw material that contains this
amount of energy, but using the convention stated above, the inherent energy of the plastic
feed stock will not be included in the energy consumption of using virgin plastic. Taking the data
given above for recycling, this results in a potential (processing) energy saving due to LDPE
reprocessing of 7.6–15.4 GJ per tonne produced, and a saving of 25.7 GJ per tonne of recy-
cled HDPE produced.
Table 22.6 also gives the energy consumption and emissions reported for the production of
other virgin plastic resin types. Although no recycling data are available for these, if the pro-
cessing consists of ﬂaking, washing, drying and granulating, then they may well be similar to
those reported for LDPE and HDPE. More data are clearly needed in this area, however.
The material loss during the recycling process is given as 5% for LDPE ﬁlm (Henstock,
1993), and 15% for HDPE (Deurloo, 1990), though this will depend on how well the 
material has been sorted and is likely to vary between different resin types. Using these 
values, however, the potential energy saving associated with recycling will be in the order of
7.2–14.6 GJ per tonne of recovered LDPE, and 21.8 GJ per tonne of recovered HDPE,
reprocessed.
One of the assumptions made when calculating possible savings due to materials recycling is
that the recycled material performs in exactly the same way as the virgin material. This is not
always the case, especially with regard to some plastics. For example, bags made from the
recycled LDPE described above had to be 30 μm thick, compared to 20 μm for a bag made of
virgin HDPE (Henstock, 1992). Similarly use of recycled material is reported to result in higher
wastage rates than virgin material (an increase of 3.5%) during bag production. Thus while the
ﬁgures calculated and used here will give a broad estimate of potential savings, their accuracy
must be viewed with some caution.
On the other hand, it has been possible to use recycled HDPE material successfully in laun-
dry detergent bottles. By co-extruding a layer of recycled plastic between two outer layers of
virgin material, over 25% of recycled material can be used, without the need to change the
weight, performance or aesthetics of the bottle. In these cases, therefore, a straight compari-
son of the energy consumption and emissions of recycled versus virgin material production is
valid.
Textiles
Information on the energy consumption and emissions of textile recycling processes is very lim-
ited. One study on the woollen industry reported that the energy consumption of producing
woven cloth of virgin wool was 115.61 GJ per tonne, compared to 56.61 GJ per tonne for
cloth with 100% recycled content, giving a saving of 59 GJ per tonne produced (Lowe, 1981).
For knitted products, virgin wool use consumed 108.28 GJ per tonne, compared with 56.61 GJ
per tonne for recycled material (a saving of around 52 GJ per tonne). Note that these ﬁgures
are per tonne produced, not per tonne reprocessed; no data are available on material losses
450
Chapter 22: Materials Recycling
IWM2 Model Guide

during processing. The ﬁgures for virgin wool do not include the initial scouring process, so 
the actual savings associated with the use of recycled content are likely to be larger (Ogilvie,
1992).
Economic costs
Just as there can be savings or additional costs in energy consumption and emissions, there will
be economic savings or costs associated with the production of recovered materials. The addi-
tional costs will be the transport cost to the reprocessors, and the cost of the reprocessing
operation. Since the price paid for the recovered material by the reprocessors has already
been included in the income of the basic model, it must be included within the processing
costs.
Additional income to the system when reprocessing is included comes from the sale of recy-
cled material, values for which can be found in current commodity market prices.
Thus if the transport and processing costs (including recovered material prices) exceed the
value of the recycled material, there will be an extra cost incurred by reprocessing the recov-
ered material. Alternatively, overall cost savings will occur if the value of the recycled material
produced exceeds the transport and reprocessing costs.
In the ﬁnal analysis, recycled material will only sell if it is priced competitively compared to
virgin. How close the recycled material price comes to the virgin price will depend on whether
it has equal performance for the intended use (e.g. in the case of glass) or whether there is a fall
in performance that requires a compensating discount. In either event the price for recycled
material is pegged to virgin material prices and is thus relatively ﬁxed. For the recycling industry
to expand, therefore, it is necessary for the transport and reprocessing costs to be competi-
tively less than the virgin material price. For materials where there are large energy savings
resulting from reprocessing compared to virgin production (e.g. aluminium, steel), this will
hold. If there are high reprocessing costs and/or small associated energy savings, it may not be
possible to produce the recycled material for a competitive price, as is often stated for plastics.
In such cases, other options are still possible. Rattray (1993) conducted an exercise with differ-
ent sectors in the plastics industry in the USA to determine where cost savings could be found
in the recycling of HDPE, so that the cost of recycled resin could be reduced below that of vir-
gin resin. By optimising the system rather than individual operations within it, the exercise gen-
erated ideas to reduce costs by 20 cents per pound. Likely savings would be more in the
region of 6–8 cents per pound, but this would be enough to allow recycled material to com-
pete well with virgin material for many end markets.
The alternative way to encourage materials recycling would be to lower the price the
reprocessors pay for the recovered materials, either by improving the efﬁciency of the waste
management system or by increasing the charges levied against users of the system.

Materials recycling 
The materials recycling screen of the LCI model is shown in Screen 27.
Recycling Processes:
Material available for recycling (tonnes)
FSW * avoided ^ by recycling (%)
FSW * savings due to recycling ~(tonnes)
*FSW= Final Solid Waste
^ A negative value indicates that FSW is created
~ Includes savings from avoided material production
The model calculates and displays the total amount of material collected by the waste manage-
ment system for recycling. The user can edit the FSW * avoided ^ by recycling (%)
default values given in the model if more accurate local data are available. This term FSW *
avoided ^ by recycling, simply accounts for the avoidance or creation of solid waste 
during the recycling process. The model calculates the ﬁnal tonnage of recycled materials and
subtracts the environmental burdens associated with these materials from the overall environ-
mental burdens of the waste management system being modelled. 
Compost Recycling Credits:
Marketable compost produced (tonnes)
By Composting
By Biogasiﬁcation

The model calculates and displays the total amount of compost recycled as a soil improver and
adds the appropriate recycling credits to the recycling section of the model.

Transport from Sorting Facility/Collection Bank to Reprocessing Plant:
Distance one way (km)
The user inputs the average distance (one way) in km to the reprocessing plant used for each
material. The model calculates the energy consumption and emissions. The model then calcu-
lates the savings in energy consumption associated with the recycling of the amount of recov-
ered material predicted in the rest of the model. The energy consumption and emissions from
the transport to the reprocessing plant are subtracted to give the actual savings likely from the
recycling process. 
Recycling Costs:
Transport costs (£/tonne input)
Process costs (£/tonne recycled) 
Recycled price (£/tonne recycled)
The user inserts these economic data and the model calculates the additional cost or saving
attributable to the recycling of the recovered materials. Default values in the Recycling Tab of
the Advanced Variables screen specify the material loss associated with the recycling of each
material, if region-speciﬁc data are available they should be entered here.

User note: the energy emissions data include the emissions from the generation and supply
of electricity. 
The user can select the breakdown of the energy displaced by any energy recovered within
the modelled waste management system (from thermal treatment, biogasiﬁcation and landﬁll
gas). The model defaults to the current breakdown of the generating grid, but this can be edit-
ed by the user to displace a single energy type or a mixture of energy types.
System area generating efﬁciency (%)* Hard coal, Brown coal, Oil, Nat. Gas,
Nuclear, Hydro
*Efﬁciency including generation, production and supply
The model provides a default set of System area generating efﬁciency values; this accounts for
the losses in energy during the generation, production and supply of electricity. Again users can
enter their own values if they have more accurate data.
Fuel Consumption Data:
Average petrol car (litres/km)
Average diesel car (litres/km)
Diesel truck (litres/km)
This fuel consumption data applies to the whole waste management collection system, the
transport of materials between collection, processing and ﬁnal disposal. Default values are sup-
plied but these can be replaced by the user if more accurate data are available.
Collection Vehicles:
Diesel truck load (tonnes)
The model defaults to a 20-tonne truck being used for collection and transport of all materials
within the waste management system. This value can be altered here if necessary, but any
change applies to all truck transport throughout the whole system.
Gross caloriﬁc value:
Electricity (GJ/kWh)
Petrol (GJ/litre)
Diesel (GJ/litre)
Nat. Gas (GJ/m3)
These values are used to calculate the total energy consumption of each section of the waste
management system (Energy consumption = Gross caloriﬁc value x 100/efﬁciency of genera-
tion or production and supply of fuel).
Production Of Other Fuels:
Efﬁciency (%)*
Petrol
Diesel
Nat. gas
*Efﬁciency including generation, production and supply
Default values for the efﬁciency of production and supply of Petrol, Diesel and Natural Gas are given
here; these ﬁgures can be edited by the user if more accurate country-speciﬁc data is available.

Waste Collection
The Waste Collection tab contains variables relating to the Kerbside Collection systems,
the Material Bank Collection systems, Collection Bags (both plastic and paper) and Commer-
cial waste collection.

Default values are provided for each of the contamination rates; the values are taken from 
available literature and communications with actual operators. The availability of local data to
use in place of the default values will improve the accuracy of the model. The Kerbside Sort
option is available in each of the KCS tabs in the Collected Household Waste tab in the
Waste Collection screen. The contamination rate in kerbside collection systems is very low
(default value of 0) where the additional kerbside sort is carried out by the operator. This rela-
tively uncontaminated material can be well sorted in an MRF and less material is lost as residue
(8%) compared to a similar kerbside collection system operated without a kerbside sort
(30%).
Waste Collection

IWM2 Model Guide
Screen 29 Advanced Variables – Waste Collection – KCS#1.

Plastic contamination rate in biowaste (%)
The plastic contamination rate in biowaste defaults to 5% (2.5% rigid plastic and 2.5% ﬁlm
plastic); this material is subtracted from the Plastic stream and added as plastic contamination
to the Organic stream, the same amount of Organic material is subtracted from the Organic
stream and added to the Restwaste stream to balance the material ﬂow.
The three other KCS tabs in the Advanced Variables screen are exactly the same as the
above. The default data set being used by each will depend on whether Kerbside Sort or
No Kerbside Sort has been selected for each of the kerbside collection systems described in
the model.

Contamination Rates:
Organic contamination rate in material collected in mixed material containers (%)
Other contamination rate in material collected in mixed material containers (%)
MRF–Amount of material collected in mixed material containers lost as residue (%)
Again the default values for contamination rates that are supplied in the model are based upon
available literature and operator experience. Actual local data will, as always, improve the accu-
racy of the model.
The three other MBCS tabs in the Advanced Variables screen are exactly the same as
the above.

Tab 2 Waste collection – Bins & Bags (Screen 31)
Collection Bins:
Total weight of bins used (kg/household)
Average lifespan of bins (years)
Household equivalent (kg/year)
Calculated
Number of washes (household/year)
Electrical energy used (kWh/bin wash) 
For comparison with bag systems, the effects of bin use are calculated. The user inserts the
(average) total weight of bins used per household, and the average life span of the bins used.
This is converted into an equivalent total usage of material per year for the system area, and
then into energy consumption and emissions. It is assumed that the bins are made from injection-
moulded polypropylene.
Bin washing accounts for additional energy consumption and emissions due to the heating 
of the water used. The user inserts the average number of bin washes carried out per house-
hold per year. The model calculates the total number of bin washes per year in the area, and
converts this to electricity consumption using the estimated ﬁgure of 0.6 kWh per bin washed.
This ﬁgure can be edited by the user if more accurate data is available. Electricity usage is
totalled throughout the solid waste Life Cycle and converted to primary energy consumption
and emissions using generic data.

This section accounts for the upstream impacts of the use of bags (i.e. during raw material acqui-
sition, processing, bag manufacture and transport). The user is required to insert the average
weight of the bags, the bag material (paper or plastic), and the number of bags used per house-
hold per year, for each fraction collected in this way. The model calculates the total amount of
paper and plastic required, and converts this to energy consumption and emissions by multiply-
ing by the generic data for production of paper and plastic given in the materials impacts section
of the model. It is assumed that the paper bags are made from 100% recycled paper,
and that the plastic bags are made from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) although
many refuse sacks are made at least partly from recycled LDPE; reliable data for
such processes are scarce.
The model assumes that the amounts of waste deﬁned previously already include
refuse sacks and/or bins. This modelling approach allows the user to compare the
effects (with respect to air and water emissions only) of using bags versus bins.

Screen 32 Advanced Variables – Waste Collection – Commercial.

Contamination Rates:
Plastic contamination rate in biowaste (%)
Organic material contamination rate in dry recyclables (%)
Other material contamination rate in dry recyclables (%)
MRF – Amount of dry recyclable material lost as residue (%)
As the composition and quality of commercial waste is completely region-speciﬁc no contami-
nation rate default values are provided with the model. Low contamination rates are to be
expected in commercial wastes as they are normally of a more homogeneous nature than
household waste. This low contamination rate again results in optimum sorting efﬁciency in an
MRF and therefore low (8%) amounts of material lost as residue.
RDF Sorting
The RDF Sorting tab contains variables relating to both the sorting and processing of cRDF
and dRDF fuels.
Tab 3 RDF Sorting – cRDF (Screen 33)
Screening Of Input Material:
Waste rejected due to unavailability of plant (% of waste input)
Rogue items rejected (% of plant input)

Two screening processes are available to the user; the default values contained in the model
are based on best available data.

These default values describe the effect of the RDF Sorting process on the incoming waste frac-
tions, and are based on the best available data (to see reference in model double click any
piece of data on this screen).
Tab 3 RDF Sorting – dRDF
The dRDF tab is the same as the cRDF tab except that the default values are different and there
is a default value given for Loss of moisture due to drying and pelletising (% of fuel fraction).
Thermal Treatments 
The Thermal Treatments tab contains variables relating to process operating data, emis-
sions data (based on old and new facilities), Refuse-Derived Fuel burning processes and Paper
and Plastic-Derived Fuel burning processes.

Process #1.

Energy Inputs:
Nat. Gas (m3/tonne)
Electricity (kWh/tonne)
The energy input per tonne of the process is required to balance against the energy generated
and recovered from the process. 
Energy Outputs:
Cal. value (GJ/tonne)
This allows the model to calculate the caloriﬁc value of the waste stream entering the incinerator.
Solid Residues (tonnes/tonne input):
Hazardous*
Non-hazardous**
*Fly ash, ﬁlter dust and gas cleaning residues
**Bottom ash
The Solid Residue stream is split into hazardous and non-hazardous material to allow the
user to determine the impact of any particular system on available landﬁll space for both types
of landﬁll. A waste management system designed around large volumes of material being incin-
erated is unsustainable if adequate hazardous landﬁll space is not available.
Tab 4 Thermal Treatments – Incineration Process #2
The Incineration Process #2 tab is exactly the same as the Incineration Process #1
tab, but can be modiﬁed to allow two different (new and old) incinerators to be modelled with-
in the same waste management system.

material entering the landﬁll.

IWM2 Model Guide
Screen 37 Advanced Variables – Landﬁlling.

Landﬁll Gas:
Energy potential (MJ/Nm3)
Gas generated (Nm3/tonne)
As with all the previous default values, the ﬁgures above are from available literature. Actual
operating data for the energy potential of the landﬁll gas will again improve the accuracy of the
overall model. 
Landﬁll Leachate:
Leachate generation (m3/tonne)
Solid waste from leachate treatment (tonne/m3 leachate treated)
Using the default values shown here the model calculates the total volume of leachate generated
by the material entering the landﬁll. The model also calculates the amount of solid waste residue
generated during the treatment of this leachate and adds this amount to the total amount of mat-
erial to be landﬁlled. Both ﬁgures can be edited by the user if more accurate data are available. 
Landﬁll Volume of Waste:

As landﬁlls run out of space rather than become too heavy, the model calculates the ﬁnal vol-
ume of the material landﬁlled in each scenario. Default values are provided (based on available
literature). These values can be edited by the user if necessary.
Recycling
The Recycling tab contains variables that relate to the amount of Material Lost during the
recycling process. These ﬁgures are used by the model to calculate the revenue per tonne of
output from the recycling section.

These ﬁgures are used to calculate the air and waste emissions and the 
recycling process costs (per tonne output) and the price for recycled materials
(per tonne output).

Waste System Flow
The Waste System Flow (Screen 40) is a schematic representation of the ﬂow of materials in
the model. This has been included to allow users to view (and print) a simple diagram that
summarises each scenario, enabling quick and easy comparisons.
The Waste System Flow represents the entire waste management system: the ﬂow of material
is from the top left (inputs) to the bottom right (outputs). Figures are given for Collected
Household Waste, Delivered Household Waste and Commercial Waste; the sum of these is
the Total Waste input to the system.
Single-material collection banks result in the ﬁrst output from the system with the collected
material being sent directly to reprocessors (Materials column).
Of the remaining waste, fractions can be sent to Sorting, PPDF burning or RDF burning, 
Biological treatment, Incineration and ﬁnally Landﬁll.
Sorting waste results in the production of residue that can be incinerated or landﬁlled or
waste suitable for Paper and Plastic-Derived Fuel burning. This burning process results in a frac-
tion of the waste being combusted and the resulting ash being landﬁlled.

The waste fraction sent to RDF processing can result in the production of an organic fraction
that can be sent for biological treatment and the recovery of materials (such as metals and glass)
from a pre-sort. The RDF fuel that is produced and subsequently combusted results in ash that
must be disposed of to landﬁll.
The waste fraction sent to Biological treatment can be pre-sorted to improve the quality of
the ﬁnal compost. The pre-sort can result in a residue that can be incinerated and materials
(such as metals and glass) that can be sent for recycling. The material lost due to evaporation
and biodegradation is accounted for in the Combusted column (due to space restrictions
another column could not be added to this diagram). The product of Biological treatment, and
Compost, is accounted for in the Materials column in the ﬂow diagram.
The waste fraction sent for Incineration (including the resides from Sorting and Biological
treatment) can also be subjected to a pre-sort, resulting in recyclable materials. The remaining
waste that is combusted results in ash that must be disposed of to Landﬁll.
Any waste that has not been treated by one of the previous methods is sent directly to land-
ﬁll.
The Waste System Flow presents the ﬁgures for the Total amount of materials recovered by
the system, the Total amount of waste combusted by the system and the Total amount of waste
landﬁlled by the system. These ﬁgures are then presented as the percentage of the Total waste
input to the system.
As the ﬁgures presented in this schematic diagram are the waste ﬂow of the scenario, they
do not match the ﬁgures in the Final Solid Waste tab in the results section of the model. The
ﬁgures in the Final Solid Waste tab take into account the Life Cycle of the scenario and
therefore include solid waste arisings from energy production and leachate treatment and sav-
ings in solid waste from energy production and recycling.

In the table above, the variables used in the model are presented in the ﬁrst column titled
Description. The ﬁrst three rows of the grid (Collected Household Waste, Delivered House-
hold Waste and Collected Commercial Waste) describe the composition and present the total
amount of waste material entering the system. In the table, the ﬁgures in black represent inputs
to the system, while the negative ﬁgures in red represent material being transferred to another
process or out of the system. The destination of each of the transferred materials is shown by
the abbreviation in the second column of the table (the key is at the top of the tab). 
Groups of rows can be subtotalled by clicking the Sub-Total button (select the rows to be
sub-totalled and click the Apply button); this is helpful when investigations into the ﬂows of
individual waste fractions are being made. The sub-total of all the columns in the Restwaste
tab should come to zero if the waste management system is complete.
The calculation used to obtain the ﬁgures in the table can be viewed by double-clicking the
number itself. A Variable Information window opens, which displays the full calculation for
every variable used in the model and gives reference details where appropriate.
For example, the calculation used to obtain the value for Collected Household Waste –
Paper is (double-click the box at row 3 column 3):
S1Population * ( S1HouseholdWastePersonYear/1000 ) * ( S1HouseholdPaperPercent/100)
The letter and number combinations before each variable are part of the internal identiﬁca-
tion system of the model and can be ignored. Some of the variables shown in the Calculation
tab are calculated from other calculated variables. These secondary calculations can also be
viewed by the user by double-clicking the full variable name within the Calculation tab.
For example, KCS1Dry recyclables – paper, the ﬁgure is calculated using:
−S2KCS1NumberHouseholds * ( S2KCS1DryRecyclablesPaper/1000 ) * ((100 −
S2KCS1OrganicContamination −S2KCS1OtherContamination)/100) 
and the term Organic Contamination is calculated from:
if S2KCSI KerbsideSortChoice = “Yes” then
S02KCS1OrganicContaminationRateWithSort else
S02KCS1OrganicContaminationRateWithoutSort
This ability to drill down into the model and view every calculation for every piece of data in
the model is the only way true transparency can be achieved.

Results 
The Results window includes ﬁve tabs: Costs, Fuels, Final Solid Waste, Air Emissions
and Water Emissions. Each tab displays a table of results broken down into Collection,
Sorting, Biological, Thermal, Landﬁll, Recycling and Total.
Throughout the results section, resources used (fuel and costs) and emissions generated
(solid waste, air emissions, water emissions) are in black type, while offsets (revenue, energy
produced, reductions/savings in solid waste, air emissions, water emissions) are in red type.
Rows showing Totals (for Costs, Fuels/Energy and Final Solid Waste) are highlighted
with yellow text on a blue background. On the Air Emissions tab, GWP (Global Warming
Potential) is calculated and presented as an example of an internationally agreed Impact catego-
ry (see Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) in Chapter 4); to highlight that this is different from
the other results in the table the row has black text on a green background. 
The drop-down menu labelled Number display allows the user to select the format of the
results tables. The data can be presented as the Nearest whole number, between 1 to 4
decimal places or as Scientiﬁc notation.
By clicking the Print button, the option to print, copy or save each results table becomes
available.
Tab 1 Results – Costs (Screen 42)
The Costs table presents the Costs (i.e. expenditures), Revenue and Total costs of
each phase of the waste management system as well as providing a Cost/household and a
Cost/person. Double-clicking any data box in the results table opens the Variable Informa-
tion screen containing the calculation details and reference information. The absolute costs pre-
sented in the model should not be considered as 100% accurate (e.g. for determining fees for
waste management services), but the relative differences in costs between different scenarios can
be used as simple guidelines. 
Tab 2 Results – Fuels (Screen 43)
The Fuels tab again displays numbers as black, representing energy consumption and red, rep-
resenting energy production. The gross caloriﬁc values used to convert kWh of electricity, litres
of petrol and diesel and m3 of natural gas into Giga Joules are in the Advanced Variables
screen on the Fuels tab.

Tab 3 Results – Final Solid Waste (Screen 44)
The Final Solid Waste tab presents data on the amounts of waste being sent for ﬁnal dis-
posal to landﬁll. This is broken down into Non-hazardous and Hazardous material (ﬂy
ash from incineration), solid waste from the production of energy used in the waste manage-
ment system (Industrial-energy in the table), solid waste from the manufacturing process for
bin bags and collection bins, solid waste from leachate treatment, a total tonnage and a total
volume. As before, black numbers represent generation, negative red numbers represent off-
sets to resources used and emissions generated. 
User Note: the Total column of the results section presents the net results of each Life 
Cycle Inventory, i.e. the global burdens of each waste management system modelled. When
recycling is carried out, the associated burdens or savings in burdens are added to the burdens of
the local waste management system (collection, treatment and disposal) giving a global perspective
of the burdens associated with the waste management system rather than a local one. To calculate
the local burdens of a waste management system, export the data from the Results tables into a
spreadsheet and calculate a new total that excludes the Recycling ﬁgures from the calculation.

Global Warming Potential (GWP) is included in this results table and is calculated from the
Carbon Dioxide equivalents (over a 100-year time horizon) presented in the Advanced
Variables screen on the Other tab. These ﬁgures are based upon the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC, 1996) report on climate change. GWP is calculated and pre-
sented as an example of an internationally agreed impact category, but this does not imply that
GWP is the only (or the most important) impact category. To calculate other impact categories,
the Print/Export function allows the user to copy the results table into a spreadsheet where fur-

The Water Emissions tab presents the emissions to water (in grams) for each phase of the

The purpose of the Emissions Guide is to provide some guidance for users that may not be
familiar with either the parameters or the units (with respect to scale) used in the Air and
Water Emissions tabs of the Results screen. Some selected parameters are put into per-
spective by deﬁning them with respect to emissions from the activities of daily life. For example,
the power to supply one home for 1 year produces 0.02 g of cadmium, while the emissions
from one vehicle for 1 year produces 3,750,000 g of carbon dioxide. This perspective will
allow users to better interpret the results of the model and to better understand the relevance
of the emissions from the whole waste management system.

Compare Scenarios
This feature of the IWM2 model allows the user to compare the results of two and up to eight
saved scenarios. This is achieved by clicking the Utilities menu on the main screen and select-
ing the Compare Scenarios function. The model then requires the user to select which sce-
narios to compare (double-click to select, click Next button to begin the comparison) and
calculates the results of all the scenarios. This takes a little time so please be patient. The results
of this are presented in the Compare Scenarios window. 
The model contains seven theoretical scenarios; the results of these are compared in the
text below. The Happyville scenarios are as follows:
• Happyville1 – Baseline scenario, all waste arisings to landﬁll without landﬁll gas collection or
leachate collection.
• Happyville2 – All waste arisings to landﬁll with landﬁll gas collection and energy recovery and
leachate collection and treatment.
• Happyville3 – Separate collection of 25% paper and 50% organic material for composting,
restwaste as 2 above.
• Happyville4 – Material bank collection system for dry recyclables, restwaste as 1 above. 
• Happyville5 – Kerbside collection of dry recyclables plus Material bank collection system for
dry recyclables, restwaste as 2 above.
• Happyville6 – Separate collection of biowaste (paper and organics), Kerbside collection of
dry recyclables plus Material bank collection system for dry recyclables, 25% of restwaste
incinerated with energy recovery, remaining restwaste as 2 above.
• Happyville7 – Separate collection of biowaste (paper and organics), Kerbside collection of
dry recyclables plus Material bank collection system for dry recyclables, all restwaste inciner-
ated with energy recovery. All residues to landﬁll with landﬁll gas collection and energy
recovery and leachate collection and treatment.
In the ﬁgures the cost comparisons of the Happyville scenarios are not shown as the generic
numbers used are not representative of real waste management costs at any single location and
could therefore be viewed as misleading. Cost data should always be entered by the user and
should reﬂect realistic costs of waste management under the prevailing (or proposed) local
conditions.
The box in the top left corner of the screen contains the results (Costs, Fuels, Final Solid
Waste, Air Emissions and Water Emissions) that have been compared by the model.

variable within this set (e.g. Total) by clicking. The results of the user’s selected scenarios are
presented in the table in the top right of the screen and this data is presented graphically below.
In the bottom left of the screen the user can select (click on and off) which phases of the waste
management system are graphed. The model allows the user to select the scale on the graphs
by using the Units drop-down menu at the top of the screen; this ensures that the graphs can
be switched between grams, kilograms and tonnes depending on the variable being studied. 
User Note: the scenario comparison section (like the results section) presents the net results
of each Life Cycle Inventory, i.e. the global burdens of each waste management system mod-
elled. When recycling is carried out, the associated burdens or savings in burdens are added to
the burdens of the local waste management system (collection, treatment and disposal) giving
a global perspective of the burdens associated with the waste management system, rather than
a local one. This is why in Scenario #7 above the total amount of material landﬁlled is negative.
Of course at a local level this is not the case: residues from collection, sorting, composting and
thermal treatment still need to be landﬁlled locally. But, when the savings in solid waste pro-
duction due to the use of recycled materials rather than virgin materials are added to the
amount of material requiring landﬁll, the overall ﬁgure can sometimes be negative. This situa-
tion occurs in waste management systems with high recycling and diversion rates. 
The user can select from the list of Air Emissions and compare these emissions between
each of the scenarios as in Screen 48, which presents data on Global Warming Potential. 
User Note: Global Warming Potential is included in the Air Emissions as an example of an
Impact Category, as the methodology for calculating this as been agreed by the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1996).

Making comparisons
This section looks at the results that can be obtained from a Life Cycle Inventory of solid waste,
and considers ways in which such results can be interpreted and used. Life Cycle Inventories
for solid waste, or for any other product or service, are mainly used in a comparative way (Fig-
ure 27.1). The absolute environmental performance (in terms of energy consumption and 
emissions) or economic cost is less informative than a comparison between different options to
see which is preferred. This comparison may be between completely different systems or

How to use the LCI tool?
Approach 1: Assume waste stream is constant, and compare the performance of different
Integrated Waste Management systems in dealing with this waste.
- valid comparison
Approach 2: Assume the waste management system is constant, and look at the effect of
altering the amount and composition of waste that the system handles.
- valid comparison if comparing geographical differences in waste
- caution needed if looking at changing the materials entering the waste stream in a given
area, since these materials performed a function before they became waste. Alternative
materials for this function may have environmental burdens elsewhere than in the waste
management system. A product-speciﬁc LCI is needed to ﬁnd the best material for any
function, throughout the Life Cycle, not just in the waste management system.
How to choose between options?
Single criterion
– where there is a single over-riding concern (e.g. lack of landﬁll space)
Multiple criteria
– where more than one issue is important (e.g. energy consumption
and landﬁll space)
– ‘less is better’ – where one option is lower in all categories
– Impact Assessment – can combine some parameters that contribute
to the same environmental effect such as global warming (must be a
transparent process).

products, or between an existing one and a potential improvement. This section looks at how
LCI results for solid waste can be used effectively in a comparative way. But ﬁrst it is necessary
to determine which comparisons are valid (Figure 27.1).
The objective of the LCI of solid waste was deﬁned earlier as attempting to predict the envi-
ronmental performance (in terms of emissions and energy consumption) and economic costs
of an integrated waste system, which can manage the waste of a given area. A valid compari-
son, therefore, is between alternative IWM systems that deal (in different ways) with the spec-
iﬁed waste stream of the area in question (Approach 1, Figure 27.1). 
Rather than keeping the waste stream entering the system constant and looking at the effect
of altering the waste management system, an alternative approach is to keep the waste man-
agement system constant, and to investigate the effect of altering the amount and composition
of the waste stream entering the system (Approach 2, Figure 27.1). This could take the form of
asking “What would be the effect of removing all plastic (or paper, glass, metal, etc.) from the
waste stream?” These comparisons, however, need to be treated with considerable caution.
The LCI model can predict how present waste management systems would perform with
changed waste inputs, and if particular materials were eliminated from the waste stream, but
that is not the end of the story. If materials are eliminated from the waste stream by not using

them in products or packaging, then there will also be environmental and economic effects ear-
lier in the Life Cycle of the product or package itself, i.e. before it becomes waste. Thus while
the burdens of waste management may be reduced, there may be greater Life Cycle burdens
elsewhere, such as in the sourcing, manufacture or transport of any replacement material.
Choosing which material to use for a given product or package requires a product-speciﬁc LCI,
rather than the LCI for waste that has been developed in this book. Again this shows the
important linkage between product-speciﬁc LCIs and the LCI for solid waste; both are impor-
tant as they answer different questions.
Given that a valid comparison is being made, how can the user choose between different
waste management system options on the basis of LCI results? The full inventory for each
option will consist of all the different parameters presented in Figure 27.2; how can useful com-
parisons be made between such extensive lists?
1. Single criteria. If there is a single over-riding environmental or cost consideration, then the
basis of choice between alternative waste management systems is straightforward. If the aim
is to minimise landﬁll requirement (as in countries such as Japan), then the system that
meets this objective can be chosen. Similarly, if cost is the only important factor, the cheap-
est option can be selected. There are few instances, however, where a single factor alone is
important. Indeed, if the objective of Integrated Waste Management is environmental and
economic sustainability, then both environmental burdens and economic costs must be
considered. Similarly, within the realm of environmental burdens, there are many individual
factors to consider, rather than just one.
2. Multiple criteria. Where many categories, both environmental and economic, are consid-
ered important, choosing between alternative waste management options will be straight-
forward if one option has lower burdens, in all respects, than the other. Given the number
of parameters calculated in this LCI for solid waste, it is generally unlikely that the energy
consumption, individual emissions to air and water, ﬁnal inert waste and cost of one system
will all be lower than those of an alternative system. If all burdens are lower, selecting the
preferred system is simple; if, as is more likely, some burdens are higher whilst others are
lower, a method to trade-off these difference is needed.
Choosing between different waste management alternatives on the basis of environmental
and economic performance is facilitated if the number of parameters to be considered can be
reduced by aggregation. As discussed in Chapter 4, various methods have been used to aggre-
gate inventory data into a smaller number of impact categories. The method that has been
most widely accepted is the aggregation of parameters that contribute to the same environ-
mental effect. Methane and carbon dioxide emissions, for example, both contribute to the
greenhouse effect and so will lead to global warming. Using equivalence factors according to
their relative effect on global warming, it is possible to aggregate emissions of these gases
together into a global warming impact category. The release of 1 kg of methane will cause an
equivalent contribution to global warming as 21 kg of carbon dioxide, taken over a 100-year
time-span (IPCC, 1996), giving a Global Warming Potential (GWP) for methane of 21 (CO2 is
taken as the reference global warming gas). Similar Impact Assessment methodologies have
been suggested for some, but not all, of the environmental impact categories listed in Table 4.2
(Potting et al., 1998; Finnveden and Potting, 1999; De Haes et al., 1999). Further develop-
ment of this important stage of a Life Cycle Assessment is ongoing. 
486
Chapter 27: Scenario Comparisons

The objective of the IWM-2 computer model is limited to producing a Life Cycle Inventory,
so a full Impact Assessment is not attempted. In the model however, the impact category of
Global Warming Potential is calculated as an example of how Impact Assessment can be
applied.
Identifying improvement opportunities
In discussions of Integrated Waste Management in this book, there has been considerable
emphasis on the use of Total Quality Management techniques. One of the key concepts of
Total Quality is continuous improvement: the process of continually monitoring performance
and looking for ways to improve a system. As it provides a way to monitor performance, the
LCI of waste can not only be useful in choosing between different options, as demonstrated
above; it can also be used within any waste management system to identify areas for potential
improvement.
The importance of operations in the home
To identify where the greatest potential for improvement exists, it is ﬁrst necessary to deter-
mine where the largest burdens occur, and then ﬁnd ways of reducing them. Essentially, this
consists of running a sensitivity analysis on the system, to show which possible alterations will
result in signiﬁcant improvements. When this is done, some unexpected results can occur.
Clearly, if the environmental performance of the waste treatment processes is improved, there
will be overall system improvements. If, for example, more of the landﬁll gas could be collect-
ed and burned with energy recovery, or more landﬁll sites were lined with leachate collection
and treatment, there would be fewer potentially harmful emissions to air and water. What is
perhaps surprising, however, is the signiﬁcant effect that the behaviour of householders can
have on the overall system. 
Taking a basic waste collection system, where all household waste is collected (on a weekly
basis, where 30 litres fuel is used to collect waste from 1000 households) co-mingled, the
effect of householders’ behaviour can be predicted. If each household was to wash out its bin
with warm water every month, the energy consumption of the collection system would
increase by approximately 16%. Similarly, if each household in the system was to use an extra
5 g LDPE plastic collection bag per week, there would also be a 16% increase in the energy
consumption of the collection system. If every household was to make one special trip of 
2 km each way by car each week to a material bank site to drop off recyclable materials, this
would have a dramatic effect on the energy consumption of the collection system, which
would increase by 190%. 
The importance of the actions of the householders should perhaps not come as a complete
surprise. After all, the household is the source of the waste that needs to be managed, and the
place that the initial sorting of waste can occur. Householders can have a very dramatic effect
on the burdens of waste management by reducing the amount of waste that they put into the
waste management system in the ﬁrst place, by choosing to use, for example, concentrated or
compact products that contribute less waste themselves, and use less packaging per use. Using
reﬁll packs or light-weighted containers will also tend to reduce the overall generation of
household waste. If households were to generate less waste the overall environmental burden
Identifying Improvement Opportiunities 
487
IWM2 Model Guide

of managing the total amount of waste would fall accordingly. Similarly, for the waste that they
still generate, households can ensure that as much as possible is valorised by effectively separating
the waste into the different categories requested. 
One of the most important opportunities for overall environmental improvement, there-
fore, is likely to occur within each household. The household’s behaviour in generating, and
separating the waste (if required) and also in its use of car transport, collection bags and bin
washing will have major effects on the overall system performance. Any burdens that occur at
the household stage will repeated in every household in the system, so can end up having a
highly signiﬁcant overall effect.
This importance of consumer behaviour in determining the overall environmental burden of
both products and services has been highlighted before. The well-known LCA practitioner 
Dr Ian Boustead has often told the story that the overall energy consumption for producing a
bottle of whisky can be doubled simply by the consumer driving a short distance to the shop to
purchase this item alone. Hindle et al. (1993) have similarly shown that it is by focusing on the
usage of a product by consumers that the largest potential environmental improvements can be
identiﬁed. In waste management too, householders’ behaviour has a critical effect on the overall
environmental burden. Communicating with these vital players in the system is essential. Invest-
ing time and money in educating households about the effect their own actions in generating and
handling waste can have on the environment would seem to be time and money well spent.
System improvements
Whilst the case studies described above may not themselves be strictly applicable to a particu-
lar area, they do provide some general pointers as to how an Integrated Waste Management
system can be optimised.
Optimising collection – Collection of the waste usually represents a signiﬁcant part of the eco-
nomic cost of a waste management system, and, as the above examples show, it can also be a
signiﬁcant source of environmental burdens. Optimising the collection system will therefore
improve the overall performance of most systems, in both economic and environmental terms.
This means collecting all of the waste from households in the form necessary for the chosen
waste management options in as few visits as possible. At the same time the comfort level of the
householders must be maintained for full participation and co-operation to be achieved.
Including paper in the biobin – There are several advantages in adopting a wider deﬁnition of
biowaste, when source-separated organic material is collected for composting, non-recyclable
paper can be included in the biowaste. The major advantage is the diversion of more material
from landﬁll (i.e. less ﬁnal solid waste produced, along with the emissions that landﬁlling pro-
duces) along with the production of more useful product (compost). There are other beneﬁts
as well, including the need to rinse out the collection bin less often, the production of less
leachate during collection and composting, and the production of a compost with a higher
organic matter content (see Chapter 11 for full details). 
Benchmarking waste treatment processes and identifying outliers – When the model is used,
the most useful results will come from inserting locally sourced data for the region and system in
question. In such cases the generic data supplied in the model can be considered as a benchmark
against which the local process performance can be assessed. If the level of energy consumption
or emission generation differs widely from the benchmark ﬁgure, this will act as a prompt to re-
check the data, and perhaps to seek ways of carrying out the relevant process more efﬁciently.

IWM2 Model Guide

What’s Changed?
The ﬁnal function of the model allows a detailed examination of the changes within one sce-
nario resulting from the adjustment of one or more variables. The What’s Changed? func-
tion in the Utilities menu enables users to quickly view the effects of changing variables as a
scenario is being developed or to view them in a previously saved scenario (Screen 50). 
For example, a fundamental change such as increasing the number of people per household
in the Waste input screen – System Area tab results in major changes in the mass ﬂow
throughout the model (more than 200 variables change, the exact number depending upon
the existing scenario), but a small change such as increasing the landﬁll gas recovery rate only
results in two variables changing in the model. 
As with previous tables, double-clicking any data box opens the Variable Information
screen containing the appropriate calculation details and ISO reference information. As before,
black numbers represent generation, negative red numbers represent savings. This function

has been designed as a method to help users quickly identify in detail the consequences of their
decisions within the model. This is likely to be helpful during the process of optimising waste
management systems, as it can be used as a very simple sensitivity analysis.
