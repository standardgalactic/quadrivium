§2-1-1 Validity of Arguments
Jen Davoren

About arguments
Arguments connect a collection of premises to a conclusion.
There are good arguments and not so good arguments.
As logicians, we want to know what makes the difference.

Validity of arguments
An argument is valid if and only if
whenever the premises are all true, the conclusion is also
true.

Validity of arguments
An argument is valid if and only if
whenever the premises are all true, the conclusion is also
true.
For an argument with premises A1, A2, . . . , An and conclusion
B, we write
A1, A2, . . . An |= B when the argument from
A1, A2, . . . , An to conclusion B is valid.

Validity of arguments
An argument is valid if and only if
whenever the premises are all true, the conclusion is also
true.
For an argument with premises A1, A2, . . . , An and conclusion
B, we write
A1, A2, . . . An |= B when the argument from
A1, A2, . . . , An to conclusion B is valid.
When Σ is a collection or set of premises, we also write
Σ |= B
when the argument from premises Σ to conclusion B is valid.

Validity of arguments
Validity A1, A2, . . . An |= B requires truth-transfer from the
collection of premises A1, A2, . . . , An to the conclusion B.

Validity of arguments
Validity A1, A2, . . . An |= B requires truth-transfer from the
collection of premises A1, A2, . . . , An to the conclusion B.
Equivalently, an argument is valid if and only if it is
impossible for the premises A1, A2, . . . , An to be all true while at
the same time the conclusion B is false.

Validity and the material conditional
From the relationship between logical consequence and
tautologies, we can also derive a corresponding relationship
between argument validity and tautologies.
Deduction Theorem (semantic form):
A1, A2, . . . , An |= B
if and only if
(A1 & A2 & . . . & An) ⊃B is a tautology
if and only if
(A1 & A2 & . . . & An) |= B.

Example: validity of arguments
Test whether or not
(p & ∼q) ⊃r, ∼r |= p ⊃q.
p

r
(p & ∼q) ⊃r
