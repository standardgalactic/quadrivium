ELECTRICITY GENERATION
1.1	
INTRODUCTION
Peat is formed from decaying vegetation over a period of thousands or tens of thousands 
of years and is the precursor to coal. It has been used as a fuel since time immemorial. 
This book is concerned with its fuel use in the current milieu. Properties of peat will be 
discussed as they arise in descriptions and accounts of its industrial use. 
1.2	
SHATURA POWER STATION, MOSCOW OBLAST
This power station, now operated by E.ON, began producing electricity commercially in 
1925, initially with peat as the sole fuel. There was gradual partial adoption of other fuels, 
and by the early years of the 21st Century the fuel mix contained around 10% peat, balance 
natural gas, fuel oil and coal: this continues. The nameplate capacity is 1493 MW. Plate 1.1 
below shows the power station as it now looks.

The peat used at Shatura is locally sourced. It now has combined cycle generation whereby the 
residual heat from gas turbine generation is diverted to generation from a steam turbine [2]. 
The plant dates back to when not all of the region was supplied with electricity, and was 
part of a move towards wider electrification (see footnote). Peat was the sole fuel up to 
the 1980s [3]1. Full-scale production was preceded by a trial plant which produced 5MW 
of electricity and was commissioned in late July 19202. By that time there was extensive 
production of the peat for domestic heating, and electricity from this unit was used to 
power the machinery for that.

Electricity generation
Notwithstanding the dual gas- and steam turbines now at Shatura as noted, we have to 
conjecture that the 5 MW pilot generator there used a steam turbine as gas turbines did not 
come into use in electricity production until about 20 years later [5]. If the steam turbine 
used saturated steam efficiency would have been in the neighbourhood of 30%. If we 
postulate that the peat had experienced some natural drying without any further dewatering 
its calorific value would have been ≈ 10 MJ kg-1. These data provide a route to estimating 
the rate of use of peat at the 5 MW plant at Shatura and this is in the boxed area below. 
5 MW of electricity requires 5/0.3 = 16.7 MW of heat, requiring peat supply at:
16.7 × 106 J s-1/(10 × 106 J kg-1) = 1.67 kg s-1 or 144 tonne per day.
The plant at Shatura has expanded from 180 MW to its present capacity over the decades, a 
major change being the installation of natural gas burners in the 1980s. Where a peat fired 
power plant is in need of refurbishment fluidised bed combustion is seen as being suitable, 
and that this applies to Shatura has been noted [6] (see also section 1.3.2).
Before moving on from Russia to a totally different part of the world, the fact that there 
is abundant peat on Sakhalin Island and that it is being considered for fuel use [7] will be 
mentioned. At present there is major power production from lignite at Sakhalin. There is 
a little more on Russia in Section 1.9.

RWANDA
1.3.1	 PREAMBLE
Two such facilities are at the development stage in Rwanda, where the benefits of locally 
obtained peat over expensive exported fuels are seen as being important to the economy. 
The two will be considered in turn.

1.3.2	 THE GISAGARA POWER STATION [8]
Construction of this began in 2015. Production at a nameplate capacity of 80MW is 
expected by 2020, with peat as the sole fuel. It will burn the peat in a fluidised bed. The 
location is 75 km from the national capital Kigali. The time to completion depends not 
only on building and commissioning but also on setting up the peat supply. The peat will 
be obtained from the South Akanyaru deposit, also in Gisagara. The peat will need to be 
harvested, air dried (over two to three days: it is mechanically turned during drying) and 
stockpiled. A calculation similar to that in section 1.2 for Shatura reveals that of the order 
of 2000 tonne per day of the peat will be needed. Plate 1.2 below shows peat from the 
South Akanyaru deposit. South Akanyaru peat is moderate in ash, 6–20%.
Plate 1.2. Peat from the South Akanyaru deposit, Rwanda. Image taken from: http://www.esi-africa.com/news/
rwanda-add-peat-power-plant-to-its-resources/
A longer term view of ‘power from peat’ in Rwanda is taken in [9], in which the following 
information is given. Although South Akanyaru is currently the only peat reserve in Rwanda 
to be drawn on for electricity production there are several other such reserves. The quantity 
at South Akanyaru, estimated as an equivalent amount of dried peat, is 69 million tonnes. 
The total known amounts are 155 million tonnes, calculated to be capable of producing 
500 MW of electricity over a 30 year period. (See also section 7.4.)

1.3.3	 THE GISHOMA POWER STATION
A distance of 200 km from Kigali, this plant is intended to produce 15 MW of electricity 
from peat. The construction project has met with difficulties [10]. Even so, it is expected 
after significant delays to be producing electricity in the second half of 2016. It will use 
peat from nearby. Gishoma is expected to supply power to a cement works, an arrangement 
which was intended to be in place for 25 years. However, questions have been raised as to 
whether the peat in close proximity to the proposed station will be enough to sustain it 
that long. The quantity of peat required for 15 MW would, on the basis of the calculation 
in section 1.2, be expected to require (3 × 144) = 432 tonnes per day of peat. This is in 
fact exactly the daily amount stated in [11]3, and the concern is that if local peat became 
depleted this would have to be transported from other deposits including Akanyaru.

FINLAND
1.4.1	 THE TWO PEAT FIRED POWER PLANTS
Details of these are given in Table 1.1, which is followed by comments.
Name of the plant
Details
Rauhalahti
Wood, coal and peat used as fuels, which can be fired together. Combined 
heat and power (CHP): electricity for the grid and heat for local industries 
including a paper mill. A change in the 1990s from burning peat as p.f. to 
burning it in a fluidised bed. 418 GWh of electricity in 2005.
Toppila
Also CHP. In service since 1977. Current fuel mix 65% peat, balance wood 
[16].
Table 1.1. Finnish peat fired power stations.
Wood and peat are the only naturally occurring fuels in Finland. It is recorded in [12] that 
the peat as fired at Rauhalahti has a calorific value of 10 MJ kg-1 (see endnote 4). The figure 
given for 2005 electricity production converts to a rate of supply of:
418 × 109 Wh/(365 × 24 h) = 48 MW
Not only was there performance enhancement by replacement of pulverised fuel burning 
with a fluidised bed, but also a reduction in nitric oxide emissions [13] enabling the plant 
to comply with Finnish standards [13]. On the negative side emissions of nitrous oxide, a 
greenhouse gas, were raised by use of a fluidised bed instead of pulverised fuel [14]. Wood 
usage has exceeded peat usage at the plant since 1998. Finland has over 1 billion tonnes of 
recoverable peat [15]. It finds thermal application other than in power generation, as will 
be described later in the book.
Plate 1.3 below shows the Toppila power plant, the nameplate capacity of which is 210 MW 
of electricity, and this is from two generating units.

The peat used at Topilla has been examined for slagging propensity [17] and it is noted that 
slag formation had sometimes caused shutdown. Slagging of course means ash deposition on 
to surfaces and consolidation there. Five peat samples – four from the deposit that serves 
Topilla and one from elsewhere – were examined in [17]. The ash from each of these was 
analysed and the slagging index (Rs) determined. The scale of this is such that Rs > 2.6 
indicates severe slagging whilst Rs < 0.6 signifies non-slagging. Two of the four ashes from 
the Finnish peats had Rs values not far from unity, indicating significant slagging. The other 
two had Rs values of ≈ 0.2 and ≈ 0.1, indicating no slagging4. For a little more on Finland 
see Table 8.1.

THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
1.5.1	 EDENDERRY POWER STATION
This power plant in Ireland began operations in 2000 when it was solely peat fired. Since 
2008 it has co-fired with biomass and ultimate aim is 30% biomass [18]. It uses fluidised 
bed combustion. The output of electricity is up to 128 MW from a single steam turbine, 
and peat combustion is 1 million tonnes annually.

Its presence is seen by some in the community as depleting the local peat reserves to the 
jeopardy of the area.
1.5.3	 WEST OFFALY POWER STATION
This uses peat to provide steam for a turbine rated at 150 MW. The peat is burnt in a 
fluidised bed. The plant has been in service since 2004.

ESTONIA
1.6.1 THE VÄO POWER PLANT
There has been peat fired electricity generation on the site of Väo since circa 1920. The 
present plant dates only from 2009, and uses peat and wood chips. Using a CHP cycle, it 
produces 25 MW of electricity and 49 MW of heat. A second power plant at Väo is under 
construction which, using the same fuel mix as the original one, will produce 21.4 MW 
of power and 76.5 MW of heat [19].

INDONESIA
The country has enormous reserves of peat, but an examination of possible power generation 
from it in the 1980s led to a negative outcome. There was further interest in circa 2006 
because of the aging of some of the oil fields in Indonesia, when imported peat was 
proposed. There is one small power station in southern Sumatra which is peat fired [20]. 
See also section 6.1.
1.8	
IRISH PEAT FIRED POWER STATIONS NO LONGER IN SERVICE
These include that at Portarlington, which generated over the period 1950–1988 [21, 22]. 
It used lumps of peat (‘sods’) therefore required grate combustion, and it is noted in [23] 
that a chain grate stoker was used at Portarlington. Peat in lump form was at that stage the 
sole fuel, and Portarlington had two steam turbines each capable of producing 12.5 MW. 
Reference [23] gives the condition of the steam as 425 pounds per square inch and 825oF 
(29.3 bar, 441oC), and consultation of steam tables reveals that the steam must therefore 
have had a high degree of superheating.

Electricity generation
The Allenwood power station, also in Ireland, was in service from 1952–1994. It used peat 
in sod form as fuel. In 1952 there was a debate in the Irish legislature5 on Allenwood [24] 
some points from which are paraphrased below.
i)	 Peat was being taken from Dublin to Allenwood in spite of the availability of peat 
near Allenwood. 
ii)	Peat from near Allenwood was used for purposes other than electricity generation, 
and the Electricity Supply Board was prepared to buy any surplus whilst continuing 
to source peat from merchants in Dublin. 
iii)	Some peat was being transported from the vicinity of Allenwood to Dublin, then 
back to Allenwood6.
iv)	Peat from near Allenwood was all hand-won, whereas it was the policy of the 
Electricity Supply Board to use machine-won peat. 
v)	The Electricity Supply Board conceded that it was cheaper to use hand-won peat 
than to use imported coal. 
Allenwood produced electricity at 40 MW. See section 3.2 for more on Allenwood peat. 
There was major use of peat to generate electricity in Belarus up to 1986 [25]. It was replaced 
by oil and natural gas. That was of course when Belarus was still part of the Soviet Union. 
As is usual there are different varieties of peat and they include Carex peat, an example of 
a sedge peat. 
1.9	
SWEDEN
There are a number of power plants in Sweden using peat amongst other fuels. They include 
Örtofta (39 MW CHP), Dåva-2 (30 MW CHP) and Karlskoga (15 MW CHP). The E.ON 
power plant at Abyverket uses peat amongst other fuels.
1.10	 LITHUANIA
The Fortum Klaipėda CHP plant uses 5% peat in the fuel balance [26]. A photograph 
of this facility forms plate 1.5 below. There is also major household use of peat as a fuel 
in Lithuania.

1.11	 FURTHER INFORMATION AND BACKGROUND ON THE 
STRUCTURE OF DEPOSITIONS
When coal is being used in power generation the rank of coal is of great importance. One 
does not use the term rank for peat, although one might use the term maturity. Groups 
on this basis are fibric, hemic or sapric in ascending order of maturity [27, 28]7. With a 
peat neither maturity nor the nature of the original plant deposition is invariant along a 
depth profile. Also important in a coal is the type, dependent on the nature of the plant 
decomposition and expressible by petrographic analysis.
The maturity of a particular peat is dependent on time since deposition. Varieties of peat 
include sphagnum peat having originated from mosses of that genus as well as sedge peat 
whose botanical precursor is grass-like. The co-existence of several such varieties at a peat 
deposit means that in an application such as electricity generation characterisation of the 
peat is imprecise. Such details are not however totally lacking, for example sphagnum peat 
forms a major part of Finland’s peat reserves. Interesting though these features – maturity 
and botanical origin – are, they do not play a part in thermal utilisation of peats to the 
degree that their equivalents for coal do.
Though it is very much the exception rather than the rule, peats do sometimes show signs 
of maceral presence. A maceral is of course the organic counterpart, roughly speaking, of a 
mineral and maceral analysis is central to coal characterisation. The analogy with minerals 
goes further: whereas in an inorganic formation there are identifiable minerals and amorphous 
rock in a coal there are macerals and groundmass. The discussion of variation of botanical 
variation within a layer of peat can be taken further by considering the peat later in its 
development where it has become lignite. In is totally intuitive that differences in botanical 
composition and in maturity will determine which part of the peat becomes macerals and 
which becomes groundmass. One occasionally encounters the term ‘peaty groundmass’ in 
a petrographic account of a lignite.
Peat usage in power generation is fairly minor on the world scene, the countries reviewed 
in this chapter being the only ones engaged in it. Hypothetical production of power from 
the vast peat reserves of Bangladesh is covered in Chapter 4. It is interesting to note that 
although the USA has never had a peat fired power generation programme expertise from 
that country was drawn on by the Russian power industry before the days of the Cold 
War [29]. At Nayiza, 50 miles from St. Petersburg, peat fired power was put in place by 
American experts as a Technical Exchange Scheme and that part of Russia became known 
as Amerika. Since the demise of peat fired electricity in that part of Russia, ‘Amerika’ has 
become an extremely cold ghost town.

BRIQUETTED AND 
PELLETISED PEAT
2.1	
BACKGROUND
To briquette a solid fuel is of course to mould it into a regular shape, and across the range 
of solid fuels – coals of all ranks and biomass – there has been briquetting. This chapter

Briquetted and Pelletised Peat
It is interesting to note that commercial production of briquettes in Ireland predates the 
Portarlington and Allenwood power stations, which nevertheless used peat sods. The output 
of each of these was moderate, and higher output had it been required could have been 
obtained by substitution of briquettes for raw lumps.
At the time of its closure in 1992, the briquette factory at Lullymore in Co. Kildare was 
one of four briquetting factories operated by Bord na Móna, still functioning as a provider 
of electricity amongst other services, which was brought into being by the Turf [Peat] 
Development Act 19468. In 1992 the four factories were producing between them 560000 
tonnes annually of peat briquettes [3], whereas it was estimated that there was a market 
only for 400000 tonnes, and further decline was expected. Lullymore was identified as the 
factory having the highest production costs of the four. 
The briquette factory at Croghan was closed in 2000, having commenced production in 
1961. By 1970 it was producing 137000 tonnes annually [4]. The method of briquetting 
at the Bord na Móna factories of the period was as follows. Each of the factories received 
about 1000 Imperial tons per day of milled peat, which was first made as homogeneous 
as possible by being placed on a belt and allowed to fall under gravity to form a layer of 
about 8 m depth. Attention was paid to moisture content, ash content and bulk density 
of the peat so assembled. In order that the supply of peat along the path to the pressing 
stage should be uniform and consistent, this was followed by levelling of the peat. Drying 
followed using heat obtained from burning pulverised peat. The force experienced by the 
peat in the press was 7 Imperial tons weight ≡ 70 kN. 
Peat briquettes continue to be made in Ireland and some find their way across to Great Britain9. 
Bord na Móna currently manufacture peat briquettes at Littleton and at Derrinlough [5], 
and marketing is directed at household users. The process is (as noted) binderless.
Moving on to Belarus, it is reported in [7] that in 2010 a quantity of 2.93 million tonnes 
of peat briquettes was produced in that country and that 1.69 million tonnes were exported. 
Countries receiving peat briquettes from Belarus include Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland 
and Germany. In June 2016 the Swedish company Vattenfall entered into a contract to 
purchase peat briquettes from Belarus [8].

This is a suitable point in the book to introduce the matter of depletion of peat deposits 
and effects of that on carbon dioxide. The peatlands of the world are seen as a carbon 
dioxide sink possibly as important as the trees of the world in their carbon sequestration 
role (see Chapter 6). On the time scale of coalification, microbial action ceases with 
peat and subsequent transformation is geochemical. A peat deposit however experiences 
microbial activity, and the microbial population of a peat deposit is large and varied. Some 
micro-organisms function aerobically and some anaerobically. Decomposition by microbes 
to carbon dioxide can be via methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) subsequently oxidised 
by microbial action. One might intuitively expect that humic acid decomposition would 
contribute to carbon dioxide release. However lignites, to which peat is the precursor, are 
rich in humic acids indicating that the humic acids are not lost even on the time scale of 
coalification. To this can be added the fact that the carboxyl and phenol structures in peat 
represent carbon already in a higher oxidation state than elemental.

Briquetted and Pelletised Peat
An appreciation of the above can be obtained from an examination of typical analysis figures 
for a peat. A Finnish peat had oxygen content 35.5% [9], signifying the oxidised carbon in 
its structure as carboxylic groups and phenolic groups. A peat in situ can have a moisture 
content as high as 80% and this leads to a further point of importance. Peat decomposition 
is restricted by waterlogged conditions at peatlands [10]. So to drain a peatland even without 
subsequently burning the peat will also have effects relevant to carbon dioxide build-up. In 
Belarus as well as more widely the effects of peat fuel usage on carbon dioxide levels is of 
some concern, and there are moves to offer wood briquettes instead of peat briquettes to 
some users. Wood is carbon-neutral: the fact that peat is not, and the reason why, have been 
emphasised in a recent contribution to the literature [11]. Two further points will be made:
i)	 Peatlands have been drained not to obtain the peat as fuel but to free up land for 
agriculture, in which case one would expect the highly humic peat to provide a 
good growth medium for crops. Peatlands have also been drained to make space 
for the planting of trees. 
ii)	Peatland once drained can be restored by re-wetting [12]. This has in fact taken 
place in Belarus [13], where carbon credits have ensued (see section 5.4). Even so 
this is not always totally effective, as has been discovered in the Iraqi wetlands. In 
Estonia (next row of the table) Sangla Turvas, a major producer of peat briquettes, 
was declared bankrupt in 2015, and its assets have been taken over by another 
company who intend to resume production [14]. The peatlands of Siberia (next 
row) also contain natural gas hydrates, and recent evidence that these are releasing 
methane increasingly rapidly is causing concern [15]. Methane is of course a more 
powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

PELLETISED PEAT
Generic quantities for ‘peat pellets’ are given in [16] as:
Moisture Content: 5–10%

Briquetted and Pelletised Peat
There has since 2006 been a peat pelletising factory at Gusevskiy in Russia [17]. This takes 
3 tonnes per hour of milled peat and converts that to pellets. The moisture content of the 
pellets is such that major drying is required in their manufacture and this is carried out 
simultaneously with particle size reduction in a drum dryer (see below).
Plate 2.2. Drum dryer at the peat pelletising factory at Gusevskiy. Image taken from [17].
The peat pellets from Gusevskiy contain no binder, are of low sulphur and low ash. So they 
have the makings of a very satisfactory general-purpose solid fuel. 
2.4	
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Limited but not insignificant usage of peat in these beneficiated forms is taking place. 
Expansion has to be weighed against protection of peatlands as noted and an awareness of 
their importance to carbon sequestration. There is more on carbon sequestration in Chapter 6.

Carbonised Peat
The peat from which the briquettes in row 1 were made was from a deposit which had been 
drained. Briquetting was binderless, and the calorific value of the briquettes was as high as 
18.4 MJ kg-1. The Turkish peat in the second column was 41% oxygen, dry basis. Experiments 
were performed in the thermogravimetric unit across the entire mixture composition range 
from peat only to lignite only, and the temperature corresponding to the maximum rate 
of mass loss was noted. This is about 470oC up to 20% peat, declining to around 300oC 
at and beyond 50% peat. Note is made of the fact that this temperature is slightly higher 
for 20% peat, balance lignite than for lignite only. There is an obvious reason for studying 
blends of peat and lignite in this way: peat and lignite frequently co-exist in the earth. 
Moving to the following row, the carbonised solid residue from the microwave carbonisation 
of the Russian peat had an internal surface are of 1320 m2 kg-1, making them very suitable 
for use as activated carbons. The work in the following row dates from nearly a century ago 
and was conducted in the UK. It used peat from Ireland which, before testing, had been 
spread out and air dried for time of the order of months.
Wet carbonisation of peat (following row) is a means of beneficiating peat. In [5] peat from 
Minnesota was reduced in moisture content from 85% to 67% by heating in the temperature 
range 175 to 260°C. A continuous process was used, and the calorific value enhancement 
as a function of residence time, which varied from 1 minute to one hour, determined. Such 
enhancements of up to 20% were observed. The peat so beneficiated could be briquetted 
or mechanically dewatered down to 35–40%. We note in passing that Minnesota has the 
largest are of peatland of all of the lower 48 states of the US10, and some is harvested for 
horticultural (not thermal) use [6].
Moving on the work in [7], some of the peat-derived carbons had been activated with 
carbon dioxide11. The basis of this is:
CO2 + C → 2CO
The others were chemically activated with sodium carbonate. Some of the peat samples were 
acid washed to demineralise them before being carbonised and carbonisation was at 750oC 
or at 850oC. Across the range of carbons activated with carbon dioxide the BET surface 
areas ranged from 282 to 622 m2g-1. Chemical activation gave values of around 525 m2g-1. 
When a substance is intended for use as an adsorbent it is advantageous for most of the 
surface area to be in the micropores, rather than the meso- or macropores. For the peat-
derived carbons in this study the percentage of the porosity in the micropores ranged from 
44% to 88%. Benzene uptake was expressed in g benzene per 100 g of carbon, and were 
in the range 1.17 to 8.18 in these units. A related calculation follows.

The mid range in the above amounts of benzene is 4.7 g per 100 g carbon. The molar mass 
of benzene is 78 g mol-1 so this becomes (using Avogadro’s number) 3.6 × 1022 molecules per 
100 g carbon. Using a value of 3 × 10-19 m2 for the surface area of one per 100 g of the carbon, 
of 108 m2 per g carbon. This is below the BET areas indicating that the adsorption did not reach 
a monolayer. There is a fairly obvious reason for this. The diameters of the micropores are less 
0.7 nanometre (nm). A pore this size if circular would have a cross section of:
π × (0.35 × 10-9)2 m2 = 4 × 10-19 m2
Allowing for approximations made, this is about the same as the area of a benzene molecule, 
and supports the view that most of the micropore volume would be of too small pore diameter 
to admit benzene molecules. Most of the adsorption is therefore in the mesopores which for all 
of the seventeen carbons except four accounted for less than half of the pore volume [7]. The 
BET area is measured with nitrogen which is able to get into the micropores.

Carbonised Peat
Moving on to the next row, it is noted in [8] that in some locations peat from carbon 
might not be able to compete economically with charcoal, from wood pyrolysis, in this 
application. In the work on Canadian peat in the following row surface areas of 900 m2g-1 
were obtained. The distribution of pore sizes depended on the choice of chemical for 
activation: zinc chloride favoured micropore formation and phosphoric acid promoted 
mesopore formation12. The peat in the following row is from the part of Malaysia called 
Selangor. Concern has been expressed [11] about the drainage of peatlands in Malaysia, where 
such drainage has sometimes taken place to accommodate palm oil plantations. Sengalor is 
one of two remaining sizeable peatlands in Malaysia. In the work in the final row of the 
table, the peat originated in Eastern Malaysia, not at the Malay Peninsula.

CARBONISED PEAT PRODUCTS
3.2.1	 ACTIVATED CARBONS
Manufacturers of activated carbon from peat include Peat Resources Limited in Toronto 
[14]. As is clear from the research investigations in the previous section carbonisation is 
followed by activation, and in [14] it is stated that chemical activation is used to make 
adsorbent carbons for wastewater treatment. Steam- or CO2- activated carbons are used for 
gas cleansing and for mercury capture from post-combustion gases.

Carbonised Peat
There are extensive peatlands in the Netherlands, and peat derived activated carbons have 
been made there since 1921 [15]. Peats have different degrees of maturity (see section 1.10) 
and therefore of transformation of the original plant material and it is noted in [15] that 
in the Netherlands the more mature peats, identifiable by being darker in colour, were 
chosen for this application (see also Table 4.1, where this quality in relation to peat from 
Bangladesh in noted). The earliest Dutch peat derived activated carbons were used in the 
sugar industry. At the present time the Dutch industry produces activated carbon at its plant 
in Klazienaveen from peat amongst other starting materials including lignite. There has been 
activated carbon production in Ireland using peat from Allenwood [16] (see section 1.8).
3.2.2	 PEAT COKE
This has been made from peat sod in Finland and in Germany. In the latter there has been 
a tendency to use peat sod rather than milled peat in heating applications.
Peat coke finds metallurgical application, notably in the production of ferrosilicon. In 
1906 [17] peat coke was suggested for the smelting of magnetite in Canada. It was noted 
that peat for the purpose was available in Ontario and in Quebec. Use of peat coke goes 
much further back even than this. In a tome from 1840 [18] it is stated that coke from 
the carbonisation of Lancashire peat ‘contains nothing which would, during the burning, 
be more injurious to iron than wood charcoal or the best [coal-derived] coke whether it be 
used to work iron, or under boilers for the generation of steam’. That there should have been 
an interest in such products from peat that time is for one fairly obvious reason: peat is cut 
from the surface, and coal mining at that time was an appallingly dangerous occupation. 
3.3	
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Carbonisation overlaps with gasification, and is describable as ‘partial gasification’ This will 
be discussed in a subsequent chapter. See also section 5.2 and illustration therein.

The entry in the first row of the table appertains to a time 40 to 50 years into the industrialisation 
of England. The part of Yorkshire where the peat was discovered – Swaledale – remains 
rural. It is recorded in [1] that the peat did not burn readily so was mixed with coal from 
Tan Hill. Coal mining at Tan Hill continued until 1930. Peat drying of the barley has an 
effect on the flavour of the resultant whisky and the expression ‘peaty whisky’ is used by 
connoisseurs. (See also row 17.) In one part of Scotland where peat is so used there has 
been concern about local depletion and peat has had to be brought from a different part 
of Scotland. Peat co-exists with lignite in the Kathmandu Valley, and in application to 
brick production is supplemented with wood. Amounts neither of peat nor of lignite are 
sufficient for export. Use of peat in the production of ceramics (next row) long predates 
industrialisation. When copper is used to prevent slagging in a peat fired boiler (row five) 
the oxychloride (Cu2(OH)3Cl) and the sulphate (CuSO4) are equally effective.

Reference [6] contains interesting information additional to that in the table. For example, 
the French Army used peat from Alsace as a fuel during WWI. It is also stated that during 
the Great Depression there was significant fuel use of peat in England, as there was during 
WWII. Such peat was in the form of peat sod. It is reported in [7] that experts from 
Ireland, from the Netherlands and from Canada were hired to advise on peat reserves in 
the then East Pakistan. It is recorded in [7] that the calorific value of this peat is 6000 to 
7000 BTU per pound, and the middle of the range converts to 15.2 MJ kg-1. Other places 
where advice from the Irish concern Bord na Móna (see Section 2.2) has been sought in 
relation to peatlands include Angola, the Ivory Coast, Mozambique, Central America, 
Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Chile, China, Angola, Madagascar and Fiji [8]. Their 
leadership in the field is clear. (See the entry on Burundi.)

Notwithstanding the statement in the following row of the table, peat from Sweden is mainly 
put to horticultural use. It is recorded in section 1.8 that power stations from Sweden which 
use peat amongst other fuels are CHP, therefore able to contribute to district heating. In 
Finland likewise district heating accompanies power generation. Moving on to the next row 
of the table and noting that CHP in Lithuania with a fuel mix including peat was described 
in a previous chapter, the ‘heat plants’ referred to in the table are new ones with versatility of 
fuel supply. Some older ones use peat in grate combustion (see reference 26, Chapter 1). In 
Latvia (next row) the government document ‘Guidelines of Energy Development 2007–2016’ 
expresses the possibility of a resurgence of fuel usage of peat. 
Moving on to Korea (row eleven), in the reconstruction after the Korean war there were 
proposals for peat for industrial purposes and for the heating of large buildings including 
schools and orphanages, as well as for steam locomotives in place of coal. It is noted in [12] 
that in Korea peat is cut from rice paddies13. There was some steam locomotive use much 
earlier in Canada (following row). Reference [14] introduces the term ‘condensed peat’ which 
means peat prepared for fuel use by mechanical breakage of the lumps and concomitant 
air drying [15]. It is noted in [14] that in the use of the peat for steam locomotives it 
cost $2.50 per ton so to process the peat, which added to the cost of the raw peat which 
was $17.50 per ton. An acre of the peatland drawn on produced one thousand tons of 
condensed peat. Locomotives trialled with peat fuel included that in the illustration below 
(or ones very like it).

Moving on to the next row, the motivation for attempted development of the peat source 
near Ottawa was the distance of the city from coal fields. The undertaking reached pilot 
stage when 300 acres of peatland were allocated to the developers and storage facilities 
capable of holding 300 tons of peat were provided. Digging was to a depth of 8 feet, and 
the site was served with a railway for transporting the peat for storage to await distribution. 
That was in 1906, and in 1913 the operation became commercial though only for a very 
short time, and the commencement of WWI precluded revival. Use of peat for steam 
locomotives in Ireland was on an exploratory basis in the mid Nineteenth Century. By a 
century later Welsh coal was the fuel used by the Irish railways, but restricted availability 
of this as a result of the exigencies of WWII lead to a revival of interest in peat. This was 
used not alone but mixed with coal to extend it. After the War there was R&D into using 
peat (called turf in Ireland) as the sole fuel for a locomotive and 1000 h.p. was aimed for. 
Some musings follow.

1000 h.p. ≡ 746 kW of power to the locomotive requiring, at 15% efficiency [18], 4973 kW of heat. 
Using a value of 15 MJ kg-1 for the calorific value, peat required = 
[(4973000 J s-1)/(15 × 106 J kg-1)] × 3600 s hour1 = 1.2 tonne per hour.
The locomotive’s tender could carry 8½ tons (8.6 tonne) of turf, enough to sustain it 
for 7 hours when operating at the nominal power. So the numbers hang together. 
The chief engineer in the post-war endeavours to use peat in locomotives was O. Bulleid of 
the Southern Railway in England, and he also experimented with peat there. The locomotives 
in Bavaria (next row) operated during the final quarter of the Nineteenth Century and could 
reach speeds up to about 47 m.p.h. It is clear from the table that there has been significant 
activity into peat for steam locomotives.

In the enterprise in the next row peat or wood chips are used according to price, and it is 
noted in [20] that as orders for peat are renewed over the years the peat is brought by the 
suppliers from increasingly distant locations. Japanese whisky is less peaty than Scotch whisky, 
in spite of the fact that peat is used in its production (following row). It is recorded in [21] 
that a distillery on Hokkaido uses peat from the Ishikari river basin to dry the barley. Half 
(in area terms) of the peatlands at the Ishikari river basin are paddy fields (see endnote 11). 
There is also peat utilisation in the production of whisky in Tasmania14.
The entry in the following row is strictly outside the period covered by the book, although 
as the author has stated elsewhere [23] it is not possible to assign even to within a decade 
a date to ‘industrialisation’. It is reported in [22] that export of peat by canal was widely 
practised in that part of Europe at that period. The endeavours in Burundi were aided by 
Bord na Móna amongst other foreign organisations. At the time of reference [24] Burundi 
was producing 3550 tons per year of peat fuel, which was being used at places including 
prisons, hospitals and school canteens. Peat from Burundi has the disadvantage of being 
unusually high in ash, 20% in contrast to about 5% for peat fuel from Ireland or from 
Finland. In Lesotho, a landlocked country in southern Africa, peatlands occur at considerable 
altitudes. Charcoal is often encountered with the peat, indicating that there have been peat 
fires (see also Section 8.3).
In today’s world we hear a lot about ‘Energy-Return-on-Energy-Invested’ for fuels including 
crude oil: for an oilfield in the North Sea it might typically be 5–10 barrels returned for one 
barrel ‘invested’. That theme for peat in very early industrial usage occurs in reference [26], 
next row of the table. With reference to a particular Irish peat source (near Portarlington: 
see Section 1.8) it is stated that, because of the high moisture content, 6 to 10 tons of wet 
peat must be gathered for every one ton of the final peat fuel product obtained, and that 
a new approach involving compressing the peat during the harvesting process could reduce 
this to 2.5 tons per ton of useable peat. At that time ‘artificial heat’, raised by burning a 
fuel, was sometimes applied to the drying of peat, although natural evaporation was more 
common and dewatering by compression was also practised as noted. A tonne of peat could 
be accompanied by up to 9 tonne of water, and it is easy to show that thermal dewatering 
of this by ‘artificial heat’ would make production of the peat fuel quite non-viable in EROEI 
terms15. Moving on to the next row peat, being very high in volatiles, is more productive 
of liquid pyrolysis products than even lower rank coals are. Peat tar in general has been a 
good source of organics including phenols. The statement regarding Belgium in the following 
row is equally true of other European countries including England. At that time and earlier, 
production of metallic lead in England used peat where coal was inconveniently distant.

The English location where iron smelting was trialled with peat (following row) is, anomalously, 
a centre of higher rank coal production. Why go to peat? Certain advantages are pointed 
out, chiefly that the peat in contrast to the coal with which it was being compared contained 
no sulphur therefore no ‘sulphuretted hydrogen’ (H2S) was produced on thermal breakdown 
such as occurs in such a metallurgical application. There was a counter-argument that the 
peat in Amiens in northern France had been found to contain significant sulphur. Writing 
about half a century into the industrial era, the authors of [30] point out that then and 
earlier blacksmiths tried to adapt to whatever fuel was available. Whereas those in Wales 
adapted to anthracite those in Cornwall adapted to peat.
Digression into the sulphur content of peats generally is appropriate at this point as in any 
industrial combustion applications sulphur dioxide emissions have to be strictly controlled. 
Below are given some sulphur contents of peat reported in the research literature.
Peat from Western Canada [31].
0.2% sulphur dry basis.
Finnish peat used in power generation. [32]
≈ 0.2% sulphur dry, ash-free basis.
Peat reserves in Rwanda. [34]
Average 0.69%.
Muthurajawela peat deposit, Sri Lanka. [35]
Organic sulphur across 40 samples in 
the range 0 to 2.22%. Also some pyrite 
(FeS2) and sulphate in every sample.
Peat Ağaçbaşı region Northern Turkey [36].
0.14 to 0.16% across a range 
of seven samples.
Coastal peat from Germany [37].
Increasing amounts of pyritic sulphur 
with depth into the bed.
Peats are usually low in sulphur. It is noted in [33] that in the 1980s and 1990s SO2 
emissions in Finland were controlled by substituting peat and low-sulphur coal for fuel oil. 
In the case of the German peat in the final row, iron had entered the deposit as ions in 
fresh water. Sulphate from a marine incursion is reduced to sulphide by bacteria and the 
pyrite formed in this way.
Returning to Table 4.1, three scenes of activity follow. There is lead ore in south west 
England, and both peat and coal have been used in the smelting of that in a device working 
along the principles of a blast furnace: reduction of the metal from its oxidised state in 
the ore to elemental. Moving on to the next row of the table, we first reiterate the point 
made earlier that there has never been electrical power production from peat in the USA. 
In a survey of 1922 peat deposits in the USA with potential fuel use were identified, but 
such use or even further appraisal was precluded by destruction over time of the deposits.

FURTHER REMARKS
The just under forty entries in the table are intended to give a representative scan of peat fuel 
usage other than in power generation and domestic heating, which are covered separately. It 
inevitably has something of a historical tone because some of the entries date from a century 
or more ago, although they are no less interesting for that. In reviewing past applications 
for peat fuel we can read significance into the fact that the USA has never had major fuel 
peat production and therefore did not provide a lead or stimulate world interest16. In terms 
of the present and the future there is the fact that peat is (as already noted) not carbon 
neutral, compounded by the fact that to burn it is to return sequestrated carbon to the 
atmosphere as fossil fuel carbon dioxide. Earlier proponents for peat fuel would not have 
sensed this disadvantage, a major one in these ‘carbon constrained’ times. On the other hand 
successful power generation from peat continues in a number of countries as recorded in 
this book and there are also domestic heating and gasification applications, to be discussed 
in following chapters.

Gasification and Liquefaction of Peat
5	
GASIFICATION AND 
LIQUEFACTION OF PEAT
5.1	
PRODUCER GAS
This is the most basic form of manufactured gas, made by passing air and (possibly) 
water into a bed of coal, coke or other suitable feedstock notably (nowadays) biomass, the 
producer gas from which will be ‘carbon neutral by paternity’. The first ‘gas producer’ entered 
service in the mid 19th Century and was a Siemens invention. The dominant flammable 
constituent is carbon monoxide and, especially if water is admitted to the producer as well 
as air, hydrogen. The resulting gas is heavily diluted with nitrogen, restricting its calorific 
value to around 5 MJ m-3.
Notwithstanding the lack of fuel use of peat in the USA previously noted, there has been 
producer gas production from peat in that country. It is noted in [1] that in early 20th 
Century USA there were gas producers using peat. More details are given in [2], where it 
is also recorded that there was such usage in Germany and in Sweden. A figure of 48000 
cubic feet of producer gas per ton of dry peat (52800 cubic feet of gas per tonne of dry 
peat) is given as well as a calorific value of 152 BTU per cubic foot (5.75 MJ m-3) for 
producer gas in Europe. Two peats were examined, one from Massachusetts and one from 
Florida. The former yielded a gas of calorific value 166 BTU per cubic foot (6.27 MJ m-3) 
and the other a gas of calorific value 175 BTU per cubic foot (6.62 MJ m-3). These are 
very good calorific values. The tests were done at the USGS fuel-testing plant at St. Louis 
Missouri with a gas producer designed for bituminous coals and anthracite. Each of the 
peats was air dried before gasification, and there would have been some residual water to 
react according to:
C + H2O → CO + H2
Also the high calorific values suggest that small amounts of hydrocarbon have found their 
way into the producer gas. This might have been by simple pyrolysis although it is possible 
that there was some subsequent cracking. It is also noted in [2] that although there had 
been air drying of the peat this was not essential to the peat gasification process, and that 
raw peat can be so converted to gas. Consideration was given to the possibility of using 
the gas so produced to make electricity, and the conclusion reached that 2 to 3 pounds of 
dry peat would raise ‘1 electrical horsepower hour’18. These data are examined in the boxed 
area below.

Gasification and Liquefaction of Peat
Assigning the peat a calorific value of 16 MJ kg-1, 2.5 lb (1.13 kg) would release 18.08 MJ of heat.
1 h.p. hour = 2684519 J or 2.68 MJ.
Now the generation of electricity would have been at about 20% efficiency, so the heat produced 
at the generator per 2.5 lb of peat gasified would have been about four times that or around 
10.7 MJ. This requires about 2 cubic metres of producer gas.
Using the European value on the previous page for yield of producer gas, 1478 m3 of producer 
gas per are yielded per tonne of dry peat, so 1.13 kg of dry peat yields 1.7 cubic metres which 
having regard to approximations made (for example in the efficiency) is in fair agreement with 
the required quantity of 2 cubic metres of producer gas calculated above.
Notwithstanding the promise of these investigations, producer gas from peat was not to 
catch on in the US and had become non-existent by 1920. This was in spite of an awareness 
that the preparation required to gasify the peat involved much less than the preparation 
required to burn it directly. 
Any review of use of producer gas generally would require inclusion of mobile applications. 
In the 1930s and 1940s in many countries a gas producer would be attached to a vehicle 
to provide fuel for it. Reports of the time reveal little application of peat this this, although 
it is amongst the feedstocks by means of which 38 trucks drove from Rome to Paris on gas 
producers in 1935 [3]. The trucks ranged from 4 tons to 13 tons in weight and it is possible 
that the respective feedstocks – wood, charcoal, coal and peat – were being evaluated for 
suitability. In 1938 Germany there were 6000 commercial trucks powered by producer gas, 
using feedstocks including peat (also wood and brown coal briquettes) [4].
Sweden was mentioned in passing earlier in this chapter. Reference [5] is an account of 
the production of producer gas from peat in Sweden at that time, and will be drawn 
on in what follows. The first peat-utilising gas producer in Europe was that at Skabersjo 
in Sweden, entering service in 1904 and being extended in 1906. The gas was burnt to 
supply electricity at up to 0.22 MW to the nearby population. The peat requirement of 
the combined gas producer generator set-up at Skabersjo is given as 2 kg (4.4 lb) of peat 
per h.p. hour, a little up on the trial values obtained at the St. Louis plant reported above. 
At Visby in Sweden there was electricity from peat derived producer gas not for general 
distribution but to service a particular local industrial concern [5]. Later extended, the unit 
initially could provide 250 h.p. (0.18 MW) of electricity. In early 20th Century Germany 
there was producer gas production from peat at Nymphenburg near Munich [2]. The gas 
from it had calorific value 4.3 MJ m-3.

At Dartmoor (see Table 4.1) fuel gas was being made from peat for lighting purposes in the 
1840s. Over the period June–September 1851, 2000 tons of peat were cut on Dartmoor 
by convict labour from the prison and a considerable proportion of it was used to provide 
gas for lighting at the prison [6]. One might expect the calorific value of such a gas to 
be somewhat higher than that of producer gas from the peat because of the absence of 
nitrogen from the retorted gas. However, decarboxylation of the humic acids causes the 
retort gas to be diluted with carbon dioxide. In the boxed area below are given figures for 
the composition of the gas from pyrolysis of a Swedish peat under nitrogen [7]. Across peat 
samples, especially with degree of maturity, such figures will vary but those below can be 
seen as representative and some related calculations follow.

(0.222 × 889) + (0.204 × 283)] kJ mol-1 = 12.3 MJ m-3
a value about twice that of producer gas.
By way of comparison this value is about the same as that for blue water gas and lower 
than those for retorted coal gas or carburetted water gas which are around 20 MJ m-3. It 
is about a third the calorific value of natural gas.

STEAM GASIFICATION
Conventional steam gasification involves passing steam into a bed of the material being 
gasified and conversion of it to a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. In the 
processing of wastes gasification by means of an electric arc – ‘plasma gasification’ – is 
becoming increasingly prevalent [8]. This can be done in the presence of steam and peat 
has been evaluated as a substance suitable for such treatment to yield a ‘medium BTU’ 
fuel gas [9]. It is believed that peat is more suitable for this than are coals, largely because 
(see section 4.1) peat tends to be low in sulphur. Alternatively to a fuel gas a synthesis 
gas, having CO and H2 in the ratio 2:1, might be obtainable by this means and there are 
reports [9] that a peat from Quebec had in exploratory steam plasma gasification yielded 
a gas having a value of 1.8 for this ratio.

Gasification and Liquefaction of Peat
It is also possible to gasify peat with supercritical water. Reference [10] from Peat Resources 
Limited (see section 3.2.1), dried peat having a calorific value of 21 MJ kg-1, was treated 
with water in the supercritical part of its phase diagram, and there were liquid and solid 
by-products. The temperature range was 350–440oC. The liquid products comprised both 
water-soluble and water-insoluble parts, and yields of char and gas were respectively up to 
27% of the coal weight and up to 30% of the coal weight. The gas had a calorific value of 
2.81 MJ kg-1 (note the non-standard units), whereas if a calcium hydroxide catalyst was used 
there was a dramatic increase of this to 27.7 MJ kg1. This is because of increases in hydrogen 
and hydrocarbon contents (especially the former) over the gas obtained without a catalyst. 
Some of the other catalysts (e.g. potassium carbonate) brought about an enhancement in 
calorific value but not the extent that the calcium hydroxide did. If heavy oil rather than 
gas was the desired primary product the best catalyst was rutile.

LIQUID FUELS FROM PEAT VIA FISCHER-TROPSCH (F-T)
That this is possible there is no question. When it was considered in detail for Finland 
[11] the concern was depletion of the peatlands with all that that involves in terms of 
sequestration, expressed in section 6.2 of this book. The issue is ‘multifactorial’ to a degree 
of complication. A peat bed is formed only over a period of thousands or tens of thousands 
of years, orders of magnitude lower than times for coalification. In expansive peatland such 
as those in Finland carbon capture from the conversion of plant cellulose to humic acids 
(‘peatification’) in a single year is measurable, and a value for this in relation to Finland is 
given in [11] as 5 Mtonne per year CO2 equivalent, about the sequestration performance 
of 125 million trees19. Finland is heavily afforested and has of the order of 20 billion trees 
so clearly at the present time that has greater potential for carbon sequestration, but that 
in some locations peatland and arboreal carbon sequestration are equally important is 
believed. There are also the following points to be thought of, each of which has in more 
general terms been considered previously in this book. Flora in the peatlands take up carbon 
dioxide, and when peatland is drained (as has happened to a degree in Finland [11]) there is 
decomposition carbon dioxide. Liquid fuels made from peat are not of course carbon-neutral, 
as liquid fuels made from wood are. So in examining the feasibility of peat as a feedstock for 
manufacturing any fuel the loss of its sequestration capacity has to be factored in. That is 
true for such things as wood and energy crops, but these are much more rapidly renewable 
than peat is (respectively time of the order of years and time of the order of millennia).

FURTHER REMARKS
The theme of the section above is continued into the next chapter. That a particular area 
of peatland can change from net sequestration to net emission is not in doubt.

COMPARISONS WITH CARBON SEQUESTRATION BY TREES
This matter for Finland was discussed in an earlier chapter, in which it was also pointed out 
that loss of or damage to peatlands adversely affects carbon sequestration and that this has 
been a disincentive in introduction of new uses such as liquefaction. In contrast to Finland 
which has about 20 billion trees, Iraq has only about half a billion [1]. There are peatlands 
in southern Iraq some of which were drained under the regime of Saddam Hussein [2], so 
a suggestion that the remaining unspoilt peatlands might be as important as the trees in 
carbon sequestration in that country can be taken seriously. Other countries are examined 
along these lines in Table 6.1 below, which is followed by comments.

Table 6.1. Trees and peatlands (both carbon sequestrators) in selected countries.
With reference to the first row of the table it is envisaged that once the restoration referred 
to is complete owners of peatland will be able to generate income from the carbon credits. 
Restoration involves re-admittance of water where there has been draining. The point was 
made earlier in the text that drainage of peatland enables the peat to break down and 
release carbon dioxide. It is stated in [4] that CO2 arising in this way in the UK is 2.98 
megatonnes annually, about 1% of the total annual release in that country. A point made 
in section 5.5 will be repeated with emphasis: processes in peatlands can work for or against 
carbon dioxide mitigation. There is loss of mitigation when peatlands are drained. There is 
gain in mitigation when peat develops naturally from vegetation.
In Australia (following row), very extensive peatlands from the south east of the country have 
been selected for discussion. Here again the generation of carbon credits is seen as important 
and where restoration of the peatland takes place that will generate credits on the basis of 
avoidance of carbon dioxide emissions from the peat. Additional to this is sequestration by 
existing deposits: maintenance of these in a condition such that they continue to sequestrate 
carbon dioxide is equivalent to restoration of damaged peatland in its potential to generate 
carbon credits [5]. So amounts of peat carbon (‘carbon stock’) are here expressible in financial 
terms. Carex and sphagnum peat are both evident in the Snowy Mountains as are other 
sorts including peat originating from the Australian genus Empodisma. In Brazil (next row) 
the combined effect in carbon terms of deforestation and of emissions from peatlands is 
major. If it could be reversed – as of course it could in principle by reforestation and by 
re-wetting damaged peatland – that would offset the CO2 emissions from the entire fleet 
of motor vehicles in the country.

This discussion is concerned with peatland vis-à-vis trees in carbon sequestration. That the 
two sometimes coincide interactively is of course well known and that is the basis of a peat 
swamp, where debris from the trees is prevented from decomposing in air by the presence 
of large amounts of water. This leads to peat formation and such peat can be an emitter of 
carbon dioxide. Bacho in Thailand (next row) is an example. A peat mound (next row) is 
due to the hydraulic action of the water content, and can sometimes be correlated with the 
presence of aquifers. That at Taung Bo Gyi is the only documented one in Asia. Details of 
peat mounds in other locations are given below.

Fibric, mesic and sapric peats all feature in the description of peatlands in Tasmania [8]. 
At Wisconsin (next row) the area of the mound is equivalent to that of a circle of  200 m 
diameter making it significantly larger than the mound in Tasmania. Carex peat features in 
the ‘mix’ at the site of the mound. Those in Caithness (next row) are squat by comparison. 
Returning to Table 6.1, the modest peatland area of Afghanistan has been largely damaged 
by draining for urban development. The ecosystem at the Danau Sentarum National Park 
(next row of the table and Plate 6.1) includes peat swamps.

Details of peat samples from the Danau Sentarum National Park are given in [13]. An 
average across 431 peat samples of the carbon content, dry basis, was 51.3%. This will first 
be compared with the value for another peat from Kalimantan [14] the carbon content of 
which is 53.9% and the oxygen content 30.4%, elemental balance H, N and S (0.52%, 
compare with the values in section 4.1). These data can be used as background for a few 
general considerations.

Carbon sequestration
The high oxygen content reflects the fact already emphasised in this book that much of the 
carbon in peat is already in an oxidised state in carboxylic and phenolic structures. Burning 
of the peat causes this carbon to enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Carbon in lower 
oxidation states, that attached to other carbons and to hydrogens, also becomes carbon 
dioxide. It is carbon in these two forms which is the basis of the carbon sequestration 
capacity of peatlands and together they constitute the carbon stock of the peatlands as noted 
above. A mineral soil as opposed to a peat soil has a low humic acid content making the 
carbon ‘dilute’ and precluding fuel usage (though the carbon would burn if a sample of such 
soil was placed in a muffle furnace at say 1000ºC). Yet another document originating in 
Indonesia [15] provides a means of estimating by calculation the carbon stock of a peatland 
from the following correlations:
Co = BD × PCC
where Co is the organic content of the soil (kg m-3), BD the bulk density (kg m-3) and PCC 
the (analytically determined) percentage carbon of the peat, and:
Cstock = CoAh tonnes
where A is the area of the peatland and h its depth. 
A generic value for Co [14], making the first of the correlations above redundant, is 0.06 
tonne m-3 (60 kg m-3), although a more precise calculation might assign different values for 
fibric, hemic and sapric peats (respectively 0.08, 0.06 and 0.05 in [15]). A simple example 
calculation is in the boxed area below.
are informed in [16] that the Keasden Moor peat deposit in Lancashire, England area of 25 ha 
(250000 m2). At a site within the deposit where the depth is 1 m the carbon stock would be:
0.06 tonne m-3 × 250000 m2 × 1 m = 15000 tonne (600 tonne per hectare).
Note that if for whatever reason – decomposition or burning – any of the carbon stock is 
converted to carbon dioxide, a factor (44/12) = 3.67 applies. The world’s peatlands occupy 
an area of 400 million hectares [17], so for say 5m depth the carbon stock is equivalent to 
carbon dioxide in a quantity:
0.06 tonne m3 × 400 × 106 × 10000 m2 × 5 m × 3.67 = 4 × 1012 tonnes.

The total number of trees in the world is of the order of 3 × 1012 each capable of taking 
up 0.04 tonne per year of carbon dioxide so the total arboreal sequestration is 
3 × 1012 × 0.04 tonnes = 1.2 × 1011 tonnes year-1.
So the carbon stock of the peat is equivalent to that sequestrated by trees in:
(4 × 1012/1.2 × 1011) years = 33 years.

Carbon sequestration
The comparison is interesting and helpful if viewed with an awareness that the value for 
peatlands is nowhere near as simply obtained as that for the trees. In the latter case it is 
simply removal by photosynthesis at a rate of around 40 kg per tree per year. The former 
case is much more multi-faceted as already emphasised in this book, for example in section 
5.4. Rather than take the numerical information in the above calculations as being hard 
numbers, a reader should see it as indication that forest conservation and attention to peatland 
condition each have an role in carbon sequestration. A further interesting perspective is that 
there are live trees over a thousand years old, the time scale for peat production from dead 
vegetation. Some information on the areas and depths of peatlands of Madagascar (following 
row) is given in [18]. A maximum peat depth of 10.5 m was recorded for the country. 
With reference to the entry for Kazakhstan, whether histosol (derived from the Greek word 
for ‘tissue’) is synonymous with peat has to be considered. ‘Histosol’ occurs in the titles of 
many very recent research publications e.g. [20]. The World Reference Base for Soil Resources 
2014 [21] defines histosols as ‘Soils with thick organic layers’ and does not give a definition 
for peat although in a detailed description of histosols it is stated that ‘Histosols comprise 
soils formed in organic material accumulating as groundwater peat (fen)…’ and that ‘They 
[histosols] vary from soils developed in predominantly moss peat in arctic, subarctic and 
boreal regions, via moss peat (Sphagnum species)…’. Moreover, it is also stated in [21] that 
peat soils are a common name for histosols. It would not be correct to say that histosol is a 
term more commonly used in agricultural and horticultural applications of such substances 
than in thermal. 
The peat in Ethiopia noted includes Carex peat, which has already featured in this book 
in relation to places including Tasmania and Belarus. The Carex species is classified as a 
‘sedge’ (see section 1.11). Peat is not however abundant in Ethiopia, as mineral soil tends to 
dominate. In natural carbon sequestration in Ethiopia the trees therefore have the major part 
to play. Guyana (next row), which has a number of trees comparable to that for Ethiopia, 
has major peatlands. In carbon budgeting for the respective countries the difference will 
feature centrally. In Taiwan (next row) the total absence of peatland will have to be factored 
in. Taiwan is a major oil refining country, capacity 1.2 million barrels per day (2014 figure 
[25]). It is a rule of thumb that the carbon footprint of the refining of a barrel of oil is 50 
kg of CO2. So the Taiwanese oil refineries if working at nameplate capacity would release 
annually an amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to a carbon stock of:
1.2 × 106 bbl × 365 day year-1 × 50 kg × 44/12 = 22 Mtonne.

Carbon sequestration
so hypothetical discovery of a peatland in Taiwan with this degree of carbon stock would offset 
the refining if it was kept in good condition and drainage was avoided. In such a situation 
one could view upkeep of the peatlands as equivalent to sequestration of the carbon dioxide 
from the refineries. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has 0.3 billion trees. Japan 
(next row) had a refining performance in 2014 of 3.75 million barrels per day [26]. Carbon 
stock of about 250 Mtonne carbon dioxide equivalent would offset the annual emission. 
Points of wider interest can be made with reference [27] as background. A deposit of peat 
will experience microbial activity causing decomposition as already noted, and salination of 
peat can decelerate such microbial decomposition as is shown in [27] with the Netherlands 
peat as an example. The salination process might therefore be expected to be a potential 
source of carbon credits. The peat deposit in Sri Lanka (following row) has a depth of ≈ 1 m 
therefore the carbon stock is:
0.06 kg m-3× 150 × 106 m2 × 10 m = 90 kilotonne.
and this is in terms of elemental carbon, not carbon dioxide equivalent. Cuba (next row) 
is one of a number of countries for which estimates have been made of carbon dioxide 
release due to drainage of peatlands, and this is 2.7 Mtonne annually. The carbon dioxide 
so released [29] is classified into that due to peatland drainage for peat cutting and that due 
to peatland drainage for other purposes. Where removal has been for peat fuel production 
there is the additional factor of CO2 release from that on burning. Examining the quantity 
of 2.7 Mtonne of carbon dioxide we note that the carbon footprint of a motor car is ≈ 400 g 
per mile21 so the quantity is equivalent to that from:
(2.7 × 1012 g/400 g mile-1) = 6.75 × 109 miles
For an average annual mileage of 12000, this is equivalent to 
the CO2 release from just over half a million cars.
In Poland (following row), with its very extensive peatlands, the annual loss of CO2 from 
drained peatlands is an order of magnitude higher at 25 Mtonne. Fuel peat production of 
peat in Poland, which 70 years ago was major and included briquettes, has disappeared and 
all current production is for agriculture and horticulture. As noted in an earlier chapter, 
Poland currently imports peat briquettes from Belarus.

In the Falkland Islands (next row) peat is used for fuel, and peat cutting activity is shown 
in Plate 6.2. A remarkable 94.6% of the total land area of the Falklands is peatland, the 
highest figure for any territory in the world [29]. The carbon stock is 1000 Mtonne [30], 
equivalent to 3670 Mtonne of carbon dioxide. The trees of the Falkland Islands would take 
about 500 years to sequestrate this amount of carbon dioxide so this is clearly a scene where 
peatland storage of carbon dioxide is more important than arboreal. There has been significant 
impairment of the peatlands from production as would be expected, with accompanying 
carbon dioxide release. The peatlands of Peru (next row) include those of the southern 
Peruvian Amazon where measurements of quantities have been made [33]. The mean depth 
of the peatland examined was 2.5 m, although it was as deep as 9 m in a few places. The 
carbon stock of the southern Peruvian Amazon peatlands has been examined [32],

and marked variations across an expanse noted. One part of the peatlands had a carbon 
stock of (1391 ± 710) tonne per hectare. The lower bound of this range is 681 tonne per 
hectare, which compares well with the value of 600 tonne per hectare calculated for the 
peatland in England above. The upper bound is nearly half an order of magnitude higher 
than that for the peatland in England. The peatland at Hula (next row) was drained in the 
1950s22 to provide land for agriculture. There has been re-wetting of part of them. One 
would expect the peatlands to releasers in view of their condition. Israel has only 573 trees 
per square kilometre [1], compared with for example > 12000 trees per square kilometre 
in the UK and 10000 trees per square kilometre in Australia (where the total area includes 
over a million km2 of desert). The trees in Israel are able to take up only of the order of 
5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, by calculation like that for Cuba previously 
equivalent to emissions from about a million cars. With neither trees nor peatlands as major 
natural sequestrators Israel is at an advantage23.

In Mongolia (following row) there is the anomaly that the peatlands release nearly three 
times as much carbon dioxide as the usual anthropogenic sources such as industry and 
motor vehicles combined. Reconditioning of the peatlands is seen as a priority undertaking 
in Mongolia. At the Melaleuca forest in southern Vietnam (next row) the terrain is very 
varied, and it includes extensive areas containing both peat and clay having a carbon stock 
of 544 tonnes per hectare [36]. This can be compared with values given for Peruvian and 
for English peatlands earlier in this section. Pakistan (next row) is another example of a 
country where damaged peatlands have become major emitters of carbon dioxide. Factors 
having led to the poor condition of the peatlands in Pakistan include animal grazing and 
drainage to make land available. Moving our discussion from Asia to western Europe, the 
drainage referred to in Spain was largely to clear land not to grow crops on but to build 
on, so the scenes of former peatlands are now urban. There has been some restoration 
of damaged moss peatlands with encouraging results, indicating that a return to original 
condition is possible. There has been significant fuel use of peat in France (next row) in 
earlier times and this and other ‘human activity’ have caused the peatlands there to be in 
less than pristine condition.
6.2	
FURTHER REMARKS
Some reiteration on the role of peatlands in carbon sequestration will be helpful here. 
Cellulose in vegetation originates with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so if it is burnt 
the carbon dioxide is put back where it came from. That is why wood and other plant-
derived fuels are carbon neutral. Their carbon dioxide on burning does not raise the carbon 
dioxide level of the atmosphere as does carbon dioxide from coal, gas or oil but maintains. 
How much better if the carbon was not even put back but remained in the ground. That 
is not ‘neutral’ in carbon dioxide terms but positively sequestrating and it is of course what 
happens when dead vegetation goes to peat. That is why the peatlands of the world are seen 
as being so important in carbon control.
The table above and comments thereon have however shown that good stewardship of a 
peatland is necessary for it to fulfil its carbon sequestration otherwise it might become 
ineffective or (more probably) become a releaser of carbon dioxide as shown in a previous 
section of this book. That is why carbon credits can be generated by keeping a peatland 
in good order by avoidance of such things as peat cutting and animal occupancy. Similarly 
restoration of damaged peatlands by flooding with water generates credits, although that 
such flooding will not fully repair a damaged ecosystem in clear. From the examples in the 
above table it is clear that if the peatlands are to contribute to carbon dioxide reduction 
and attainment of Kyoto targets attention to peatland condition and an awareness of its 
vulnerability will have to be high on the agenda.

INTRODUCTION
Fuel use of peat took place in prehistoric times. Consistently with the title of the book 
however this chapter will deal only with usage in industrial times even though down the 
pre-industrial centuries there was such use on a significant scale.

HISTORICAL EXAMPLES
Plate 7.1 below shows an open peat fire at a cottage. At least as recently as the early 20th 
Century such an arrangement was used in places including Ireland and Scotland, and the 
fire would be kept alight all the time.

Plate 7.1. Open peat fire in a cottage. Image taken from:

Charles Dickens’ journal for 184124 records a visit to Glencoe, Scotland [1] and he has this 
to say: ‘Now and then we passed a hut or two, with neither window nor chimney, and the 
smoke of the peat fire rolling out at the door’. This is clearly an example of such use of peat 
fuel. Similarly, the statement which follows was published in 1843 [2]: ‘…in some parts of 
England they consume peat or turf, the use of which is common among the poor Irish’. 
It would appear that peat was not restricted to poorer households. In Charlotte Bronte’s 
‘Jane Eyre’, published in 1847, there is record of the ‘radiance of a glowing peat fire’ in a 
household which, though not opulent, was in different social category from the cottages and 
huts previously referred to. It is interesting, although not all that surprising, that peat was 
burnt with coal and wood in those times in what we’d now call co-firing. In Anne Bronte’s 
Wuthering Heights, also first published in 1847, there is a description of ‘the radiance of 
an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood’. One can legitimately infer more 
from this. Given the location of ‘Wuthering Heights’25 it can be concluded that the coal 
was from one of the coalfields around Leeds. This coal is bituminous and in a domestic fire 
grate needs kindling. This is where the high-volatile peat would have served its turn. When 
the organic chemistry came into being, largely in Germany, a few decades later this role was 
taken by proprietary ‘firelighters’. Fairly obviously it is to peat so used that the following 
lines from Vita Sackville-West’s poem ‘The Garden’, first published in 1946, relate:
My mood is like a fire that will not heat;
There’s touchwood, and a chequer-board of peat;
The sturdy logs laid ready, sere and dry;
The match-box, and the chimney swept and high;
There’s all the setting for a roar of flame

‘Chequerboard’ refers to the appearance of the peat itself. The term is frequently applied to 
peat. Plate 7.2 below shows a horse-drawn conveyance delivering peat fuel to rural Yorkshire

A fireplace is open to the room in which it is installed whereas a stove, though drawing air 
from the room, is enclosed.26 A Scottish manufacturer of wood stoves [3] declares that its 
stoves are, without modification, suitable for peat alone or blended27 with wood. Stoves in 
this range have ventilators which can be adjusted from fully open to fully closed (in which 
case air is supplied solely by natural leakage via the door and other fittings) and release heat 
in the range 5 to >10 kW depending on size. A simple calculation follows.28

Domestic heating with peat
Section 2.3 gives a ‘generic value’ of the calorific value of pelletised peat of 17–21 MJ kg-1. Using 
the middle-of-the range value of 19 MJ kg-1, the rate of peat fuel supply for 10 kW of heat is:
(10 kJ s-1/19000 kJ kg-1) × 3600 s hour-1 ≈ 2 kg hour-1
The stoves in [3] are for room heating. Even so it is of interest to estimate at what rate the stove 
if set up to do so would supply hot water. Imagine that it was heating water from 20 to 80ºC. 
The rate of supply of water m is calculable from:
m kg s-1 × (80 – 20)ºC × 4180 J kg-1ºC-1 = 10000 J s-1
↓
m = 140 kg hour-1 (30 Imperial gallons per hour).
Up-to-date information from a supplier of Scottish peat in processed form [4] gives 225.75 GBP 
as the price of a 1050 kg package. 1050 kg of the briquettes will, retaining the calorific value 
above, release on burning:
1050 kg × 19 × 106 J kg-1 = 20 GJ
So the cost per GJ is (225.75/20) GBP = 11.3 GBP ($US15 at the current exchange rate). 
Now a barrel of oil is capable of releasing on burning 6 GJ. The current OPEC price of oil is 
$US41 per barrel so the cost of 1 GJ is just under $US7.
The discussion continues in the main text.
No more can be claimed than that the figures for peat and oil hang together. Peat unlike 
oil is subject to no benchmark price, and the price used in the calculation is one example 
of a wide range which will apply. Crude oil will not be burnt as such, and distillates from 
it (kerosene, diesel) will attract much higher prices than residue (heavy fuel oil). One point 
can however confidently be made. Throughout the history of ‘oil and gas’ unit heat from 
natural gas has been cheaper than unit heat from unit heat from oil by a factor of five or 
more. So the calculations in the boxed area can be extended to a price of around $US1.50 
per GJ or less from natural gas, an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding figure 
for peat, and this cannot be disregarded. One might want to have a peat fire in a private 
residence for its intrinsic appeal, but if peat is being purchased at the market price it is 
disadvantageous in comparison with natural gas. To heat a room of a house with peat 
makes sense as the aesthetic delight is being paid for but it would not but not be feasible 
to heat (for example) a school or a hospital with peat from the market. In the pre-oil era 
there was integrated peat production and use in nearby enterprises such as brewing and 
evaporation of seawater to make table salt, [5] but even then it was not always an attractive 
alternative to coal.

AIR REQUIREMENTS
In a commercial scale bed of solid fuel, or in testing on the scale of a pot furnace, air is 
supplied at a controlled rate. This is necessary so as to avoid too much air, jeopardising the 
combustion temperature, or too little causing incomplete combustion. Excess air to a degree 
of 20% is common is power generation from solid fuels. In stoves and fireplaces all air is 
taken from the room and there is very limited control by means of the ventilation devices 
referred to above. Below is a calculation of the air requirement of a fireplace or stove using 
peat. Analysis data are for a Rwandan peat [6].

The sulphur and nitrogen in the peat are too small to have significant effect on the air 
requirement. These will however be considered from the environmental point of view later 
in this discussion.
From the working in the table above, the oxygen requirement per kg coal is:
(21.4 + 12.5 – 12.8) = 21.1 mol.
Accompanying nitrogen = (21.1 × 3.76) mol = 79.4 mol.
Volume of air measured at 1 bar 298K = [(79.4 + 21.1) mol /40 mol m-3] = 2.5 m3

A word of explanation of the figures in the working will be helpful. The negative oxygen 
requirement arises from the fact that part of the coal is already oxidised, otherwise it would 
not have an oxygen content. An amount of oxygen equivalent to this has to be deducted 
from the oxygen requirement. The factor of 3.76 arises from the 79:21 proportion of nitrogen 
to oxygen in air. A volume of 1 m3 of any gas or gas mixture under the temperature/
pressure conditions given contains 40 mol (as can easily be deduced from the ideal gas 
equation). Earlier in this section of the book a fuel supply rate of 2 kg hour1 was estimated 
for a 10 kW supply, so for this 5 m3 of air is required. Of course, the figures used in the 
calculation of air requirement are for dry peat. Any moisture present can be allowed for 
by adjustment of the elemental analysis figures. Water vapour in the hot post-combustion 
gas just acts as a diluent. 
The nitrogen content of the peat in the above calculations is 1.2%. On combustion most 
of this will become elemental nitrogen N2 although, depending on the conditions, some 
will go to nitric oxide NO. Such NO, derived from the nitrogen content of the fuel, is 
called fuel NO. With such fuels as natural gas and petroleum distillates there can also be 
thermal NO, derived from the nitrogen content of the air. This occurs only at temperatures 
above ≈ 1200oC, much higher than those in stoves and fireplaces burning peat. (See also 
section 1.4.1.)

Domestic heating with peat
The sulphur content of the peat is 0.4% [6]. Calculations follow in the boxed area below.
The sulphur content of any fuel on combustion goes quantitatively to sulphur dioxide SO2.29
I kg of the peat contains 4 g of sulphur which becomes on combustion 8 g of SO2 or 0.125 mol. 
Inventory of total dry gas resulting when 1 kg of the peat is burnt under stoichiometric conditions: 
Nitrogen 79.4 mol.
Carbon dioxide 42.8 mol.
Sulphur dioxide 0.125 mol.
------------------------------------
Total 122.325 mol.
parts per million of sulphur dioxide = (0.125/122.325) × 106 = 1020
and three further points will be made. First, the post-combustion gas if instead of being directed 
away was released into the room would be intolerably high. Secondly, use of this fuel on a higher 
scale than domestic, for example in power generation, would require scrubbing of the flue gases 
to remove sulphur dioxide. Thirdly, in the smoke plume from the stove or fireplace the sulphur 
dioxide will dilute by two to three orders of magnitude. These relate to emission standards: the 
ambient standard will be parts per hundred million.

HAZARDS WITH PEAT
8.1	
SPONTANEOUS HEATING
The propensity to spontaneous heating of peat was examined according to the principles 
of ignition theory by the present author in the 1980s and the 1990s [1, 2]. Propagation of 
combustion in peat once ignited was also considered [3].

Peat dust at particle sizes up to ≈ 200 μm exploded in an atmosphere of 
flammable gas. Minimum ignition energy 47 mJ in the absence of a flammable 
gas, dropping to < 10 mJ in atmospheres of 2% propane or 4% methane.

Two general points will be made in relation to the first row in the table. One is use of the 
word ‘powder’ in its title: it has long been held that ‘powder explosion’ is at least as satisfactory 
a term as ‘dust explosion’, perhaps a better term. The distinction is in the particle size and 
is quite arbitrary. Secondly, it is emphasised in the table that the behaviour is subsonic. 
Dust explosions cause major overpressures for short times but are not detonations in which, 
of course, propagation is supersonic. The high ignition energy for dust explosions when 
compared with those for gaseous explosions is also general. In the work in the next row 
of the table, the pre-ignition pressure of a dispersion of dust particles was found to have 
a strong effect on the severity of any consequential explosion as determined by maximum 
pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise.

Moving on to the next row, the definition:
KST = maximum rate of pressure rise × (vessel volume)1/3, units bar m s-1 as in the table 
or N m-1s-1 in SI. 
applies. From the figures in the table the strong effect of water is evident, and the authors 
of [6] fitted their data to:
KST = 341 – 2.58W – 42.0 lnφm
where W is the percent water content and φm is the mean particle size in microns. 
The particle size dependence in the above equation is such that to double the particle size other 
things being equal will reduce KST by 42ln2 = 29. The largest particle sizes used were 500 μm. 
Putting this into the above and setting KST at zero signifying no explosion:
2.58W = 341 – 42ln500 = 80
↓
W = 31%.
The equation in [6] has probably been extended in the above working beyond the scope 
envisaged by its developers. Correspondence between the moisture content for the lowest 
value of KST observed (Table 8.1) and that calculated as just high enough to preclude explosion 
(above) is quite encouraging. Letting the particle size be 100 μm gives a water content of 57% 
for zero KST.

Hazards with peat
With reference to the work in the next row one might wonder about the reason for testing 
peat for dust explosion propensity in an atmosphere containing introduced flammable 
gas. There is the obvious point that peat beds do release methane (see Section 2.2). Low-
temperature devolatilisation of peat will release such gases, so the methane and propane can 
be seen as ‘simulated volatiles’ in the work in [6]. 
There have been dust explosions with peat in Finland. They include a fatal one [8] in 
which the ignition source was provided by a lump of peat having undergone spontaneous 
heating. This arose from deposition of peat particles of millimetre size on their way from 
silo to mill. Having regard to the fact that post-combustion gas is used at the mill to dry 
the particles, the sequential operations of movement of the bulky peat with its resistance 
to flow and milling of it at a higher temperature than ambient make for a milieu where a 
dust explosion can occur. One of avoidance measure is design of the silo exit in such a way 
that deposition (‘arching’) does not occur. The work in [8] also contains some test results, 
in which KST
 values up to 183 bar m s-1 were reported and this can be compared with the 
values given above.
8.3	
PEAT FIRES
In section 6.1 of this book the carbon stock held by peatlands at various parts of the globe 
were given, and in section 4.2 it is emphasised that peat is not carbon neutral. The ‘carbon 
stock’ on burning therefore enters the atmosphere as fossil fuel derived carbon dioxide and 
adds to the carbon dioxide level. This is in contrast to a forest fire, where the carbon dioxide 
is non fossil fuel derived simply being put back where it came from. Fires in peat lands 
therefore negate their carbon sequestration role. Once peat is ignited it tends, especially at 
lower ambient temperatures or in the absence of wind, to propagate by smouldering instead 
of by flaming and this is very productive of smoke.

Hazards with peat
The illustration supports the statement in the previous paragraph that it is at places with 
lower ambient temperatures that peat smoulders: Sumatra is a warm location (average 
temperature 26oC with only small fluctuations [9]) and that the peat there is flaming is 
very clear from the plate. 
Peat fires are of major concern internationally. Indonesia is a scene of them as noted, as 
are for example parts of southern Africa. The abundant emissions from them easily cross 
international borders.

POSTSCRIPT
Peat lacks both the carbon neutrality of wood fuels and the petrographic structure of coals. 
Its properties, including its softness and the high volatiles, have determined the thermal 
applications to which it can be put and which are discussed herein.

ENDNOTES
1.	 This reference, whilst giving useful information on Shatura, mistakenly states that the locally sourced 
fuel was lignite when in fact it was peat. This might have been a translation error. 
2.	 This was under Vladimir Lenin’s Goelro Plan [4], announced in February that year. That expansion of the 
country’s industry was strongly dependent on nationwide electrification was the keynote of his policies. 
3.	 One could take a ‘sideways view’ of the calculated result and conclude that the peat in the condition 
in which it arrives at the power station has a calorific value of 10 MJ kg-1.
4.	 See Table 4.1 for more on slagging.
5.	 Houses of the Oireachtas. 
6.	 A ‘nonsensical performance’ in the words of the Member.

10.	It is exceeded by Alaska.
11.	The alternative is activation with steam: C + H2O → CO + H2. Either way carbon is removed from 
the structure and pores are left behind. 
12.	For more on Canadian peat see sections 3.2.2 and 4.1.
13.	Many of the rice paddies of Japan are ‘peaty’ [13]. 
14.	For more on Tasmanian peat see section 6.1.
15.	A reader wanting to satisfy him or herself of this should use a value of 2400 kJ kg-1 for the heat of 
vaporisation of water and a value of 15 MJ kg-1 for the calorific value of the dried peat.
16.	Early activity in the US into making fuel gas from peat is discussed in the next chapter.
17.	The online version of this book consulted by the author is clearly from a much later date than this. The 
section of the book on the drying of peat cites work from 1850–1853.
18.	Reference [2] says electrical horsepower per hour which is presumably a mistake.
19.	On the basis that a tree captures 40 kg per year of CO2.
20.	This jeopardises peatland in ways including eating the plants and introduction of new plants by carriage 
of seeds, each of which affects the ecosystem. Pressure on the peatland surface due to the weight of the 
animals will also have an effect [36].
21.	This is an up-to-date figure. Possibly a higher one would apply to Cuba where many cars are very elderly.
22.	One of the earliest major engineering projects of the State of Israel, created 1948.
23.	Israel has signed the Kyoto Protocol. No emission reduction requirements were imposed [34].

other than West Yorkshire.

29.	This peat is 4.8% as-received basis in ash. As a point of detail, it is not impossible that some of the 
SO2 goes on to form sulphates in the ash. That depends on amounts of sodium and calcium in the 
ash-forming constituents of the peat. Any magnesium in the peat will not form a sulphate in the ash.
