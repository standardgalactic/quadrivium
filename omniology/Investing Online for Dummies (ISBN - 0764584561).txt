Introduction
W
elcome to Investing Online For Dummies, 5th Edition, and to the exciting
world of online investing. Regardless of whether you’re a new investor
or an experienced trader, this book can guide you to the Internet-based
resources that can help you make better, more informed investing decisions
than ever before. The Internet offers an astounding amount of financial infor-
mation, and Investing Online For Dummies, 5th Edition, provides clear instruc-
tions and ample illustrations so that you don’t get lost in cyberspace. With the
assistance of this book, you can find up-to-the-second stock quotes, historical
financial data on public companies, professional analyses, educational materi-
als, and more.
In this book, I show you how to get started, what you really need to know,
and where to go on the Internet for additional information. You don’t need to
memorize complex commands or formulas. I describe everything in plain
English, and I leave the Wall Street–speak out in the street.
Thousands of new Web pages are added each day. Many institutions bring
educational and government materials online, large and small commercial
enterprises create Web-based services, and individuals also account for
much of the content that is posted online. This vast amount of content con-
tinues to grow in size and sophistication but still remains user-friendly. New
online investor applications are added on a regular basis. Today you can fine-
tune your online investing in more ways than ever before because more
Internet resources are out there than ever before.
As the amount of online content constantly increases, it also changes. Some
sites listed in this book may have changed or gone away due to mergers with
larger sites. Some Web sites just vanish for no reason. If a site has moved,
you may find a link to the new location. If not, try a search engine such as
Google (www.google.com), Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com), or MSN (search.msn.
com) to locate the resource you need.
Who Are You?
According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project (www.pewinternet.
org), one out of every ten Internet users has bought or sold stocks online. As
of September 2002, this number was about 12 percent of all Internet users.
The survey goes on to state that

 On a typical day, between 1 and 3 percent of all Internet users buy or 
sell stocks, bonds, or mutual funds online. Additionally, online investing
grew by 40 percent from March 2000 (10 million Americans) to
September 2002 (14 million Americans).
 More men than women are likely to buy or sell stock online. As a matter
of fact, the ratio of men to women making trades is two to one.
 Age doesn’t seem to play a significant role in who’s investing online.
However, Internet users in the 30-to-49-year age bracket seem to take the
lead in this area.
 Educated individuals with higher incomes are more likely to have traded
online than other online users. As of September 2002, about 17 percent
of Internet users with college degrees had bought or sold stocks online.
Only 8 percent of those individuals without a college degree had traded
stocks online. The study also indicated that individuals with household
incomes of $75,000 or more are four times as likely to have traded secu-
rities online.
 More experienced Internet users are more likely to buy or sell stocks
online. Moreover, individuals with high-speed connections (that result in
real-time streaming stock quotes and other financial information) are
more likely to trade online.
A September 2004 study by J. D. Power (www.jdpower.com) of 4,885 online
investors indicated that newer online investors have different characteristics
than more experienced online investors: These newer online investors:
 Are younger and female: Newer investors tend to be 18- to 34-years-old
and female.
 Are more conservative: The volatility of the market and decreased returns
on investments have made newer online investors more cautious.
 Have smaller portfolios: Newer online investors tend to have smaller
portfolios and a lower risk-tolerance level.
Throughout this book, I assume that you want to join the ranks of newer
online investors or that you already invest online and want to maximize your
returns. Therefore, you want to
 Take advantage of all the timely investment information available on
the Internet.
 Get some work done with the Internet. Online selecting, evaluating,
and monitoring of investments can be time-consuming. Online investing
really is work.
 Partner with the Internet in making your money work harder for you.

Investing Online For Dummies, 5th Edition 

About This Book
This book has no hidden agenda. It focuses on common-sense ways to create
and build wealth with the Internet.
I’ve designed Investing Online For Dummies, 5th Edition, for beginning online
investors, but experienced investors can also benefit from it. Each chapter
stands alone and provides all the instructions and information you need to
solve an investment problem or to make an investment decision.
Most online investors will read this book in chunks, diving in long enough to
solve a particular investment problem (“Hmmm, which online brokerages
offer wireless trading?”) and then putting it aside. However, I’ve structured
the book in such a way that if you want to read it from beginning to end (even
though the book’s primary function is as a reference tool), you can do so.
I discuss online investment topics in a logical way, from online investing fun-
damentals through making your own online stock transactions to purchasing
bonds online and directly from the federal government.
Here’s a quick rundown on some of the topics I cover:
 Building your own online investment information system
 Using the Internet to simplify your financial planning
 Selecting the online brokerage that meets your individual needs
 Finding personalized trading platforms from major online brokerages
 Locating Internet resources for the selection of mutual funds
 Working with Internet tools for analyzing and selecting stocks and bonds
 Using mutual fund and stock online screens to find investment candi-
dates that will help you meet your financial goals
 Trading online or going wireless and paying the lowest commissions
possible
 Keeping track of your portfolio and knowing exactly how your assets are
allocated (even the holdings in your mutual funds)
 Discovering direct stock purchase and ShareBuilder plans that let you
become an online investor for as little as $25 a month
 Uncovering how stock options work and determining the value of your
employee stock option plan
 Finding out how to take advantage of international opportunities online
Additionally, I offer warnings to help you avoid dangerous or costly traps,
and I point out excellent online investment resources. Investing Online For
Dummies, 5th Edition, puts you in the driver’s seat on the Information
Superhighway. It provides the Internet knowledge you need to get the edge
on investors who rely solely on newspapers and magazines.

Introduction

How to Use This Book
If you have a question about an online investing topic, just look up that topic
in the table of contents at the beginning of the book or in the index at the end
of the book. You can get the help you seek immediately or find out where to
look for expert advice.
Investing has evolved into a specialized field and isn’t particularly easy for
“normal” people. Don’t feel bad if you have to use the table of contents and
the index quite a bit. Luckily, the Internet offers plenty of sites that let you
practice before you buy or trade.
If you want to experience electronic trading (and are concerned that a mis-
take may cost you money), try practicing at the Investing Online Resource
Center, located at www.investingonline.org. The Investing Online
Resource Center includes a free stock market simulation center. You can test-
drive online investing or try out a new investment strategy without losing a
dime or having to register.
If you’re new to investing on the Internet, check out the first three chapters in
Part I. They give you an overview of the Internet and some important investor
tips. To get more familiar with the Internet, try some of the activities that I
detail in these chapters.
If you’re new to the Internet, I recommend getting a copy of The Internet For
Dummies, 10th Edition, by John R. Levine, Carol Baroudi, and Margaret Levine
Young (Wiley Publishing). This book is great for anyone who needs help get-
ting started with the Internet. The Internet For Dummies, 10th Edition, can
assist you in hooking up with local Internet providers, surfing the Net, down-
loading free software, and joining mailing lists or user groups.
If you’re a new investor, check out Chapter 18, which offers warnings about
online frauds, schemes, and deceptions. When you start subscribing to
investor newsgroups, mailing lists, or online publications, you’re likely to
receive e-mail stock tips and investment offers. Treat these messages as you
would any telephone cold call. Thoroughly examine the investment and get a
second opinion from an independent investment expert you respect before
you purchase.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has four parts. Each part stands alone — that is, you can begin
reading anywhere and get the information you need for investment decision-
making. Or you can read the entire book from cover to cover. The first part of
this book lays the groundwork that beginning online investors need. The next
4
Investing Online For Dummies, 5th Edition 

three parts focus on how you can navigate the Internet to get the information
you want about specific types of investments, online trading, and portfolio
tracking.
Here’s a quick rundown of the parts of the book and what they contain.
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals
In Part I, you find out what investor tools are available on the Internet for spe-
cial interest groups such as children, college students, seniors, and women.
The chapters in Part I discuss important investor uses of the Internet: searches
for financial topics, electronic mail, newsgroups, and access to databases that
until recently were only available to large financial institutions. You also find
out how to make your money work harder and how to find an online brokerage
that meets your individual needs. You clearly see how new online trading plat-
forms and technology can make online investing assist you in achieving your
personal financial objectives.
Part II: Finding the Right Investments
The chapters in Part II show you how to find the right investments and the
best ways of purchasing those investments. This part of the book describes
how you can select, analyze, and buy mutual funds, stocks, and bonds on the
Internet. The chapters in this part of the book cut through the jargon and get
to the heart of what investments are (and what they’re not). These chapters
help you understand rates of return and what mutual funds, stocks, and
bonds are all about. They also cover how to research and analyze stocks and
bonds online. I point you to many online sources for annual reports, eco-
nomic data, analyst recommendations, industry standards, and more. You
discover great online investment analysis tools so that you don’t have to be a
math whiz to determine which investment is best.
Part III: Expanding Your Investment
Opportunities
Part III includes a chapter that details how to evaluate international invest-
ments. You also find out how to use the Internet to find investment opportu-
nities, such as initial public offerings (IPOs) and dividend reinvestment plans
(DRIPs), how to find information about stock options, and how to evaluate
the value of your employee stock option plan. This part of the book also
covers online portfolio management and explores some of the latest tools
available online.

Introduction

Part IV: The Part of Tens
No more guessing about what to hold and when to fold. Part IV provides
handy top-ten lists packed full of ready online references. The chapters in
this part cover such essentials as avoiding cyberfraud, knowing when to hold
and when to fold, and recognizing buying signals.
What’s New
A number of features have been added to this edition that make using
Investing Online For Dummies an even more exciting and beneficial reference
book. Changes throughout Investing Online For Dummies, 5th Edition, include
new investor-related Web sites and updated information about Web sites that
now require user registration. This revised edition shows how some Web
sites now charge fees for access and provides alternative Web sites that pro-
vide similar content at no charge.
Investing Online For Dummies, 5th Edition, omits obsolete Web sites or Web
sites that have gone out of business and includes new online investor Web sites
that offer improved content or services. Statistics, tables, and graphs have all
been updated. The emphasis of many chapters has changed to reflect current
trends in online investing. The following are highlights of what you find:
 Due to the aging of America, the interest in tax-deferred accounts has
dramatically increased. Therefore, you find more information about the
benefits of individual retirement accounts (IRA) and how the Internet
can assist you in maximizing your IRA returns (see Chapter 3).
 In the early days of online investing, online stock-picking communities
were overflowing with “pump-and-dump” schemes, wild corporate rumors,
and other nefarious activities. Today’s stock-picking Web sites and stock-
picking communities have matured into online resources that can be help-
ful in identifying securities that are winners (check out Chapter 3).
 Get introduced to online “bankerages” in Chapter 4. By combining your
online banking and brokerage account, you can save time and money, as
well as enjoy the flexibility and convenience you couldn’t get with scat-
tered services.
 Is your life too complex? Want a simple way to invest? See Chapter 6 and
try online investing in index or exchanged-traded funds.
 Online investors can now use Web sites to examine and compare mutual
fund fees to determine the true cost of a mutual fund. Get the scoop in
Chapter 7.
 See Chapter 8 for new, robust, online stock and bond valuation tools
developed by academics and specialists.
6
Investing Online For Dummies, 5th Edition 

 Refer to Chapter 10 to discover how you can use the Internet to take a
closer look at corporate governance and discover the warning signs of a
company’s bankruptcy before it’s too late.
 Get up-to-date information about the dramatic changes in buying sav-
ings bonds and Treasury securities online in Chapter 13.
 In Chapter 17, discover online asset allocation tools that were previously
available only to financial institutions. See how you can use these online
tools to make certain that you’re adequately compensated for the risk
you are taking by making an investment.
And so much more . . .

Chapter 1
Finding Investor Stuff on the Net
In This Chapter
 Creating your own online information system
 Using search engines
 Joining newsgroups
 Subscribing to Internet mailing lists
 Accessing online databases
 Finding Web sites that fit your unique needs
T
he Internet has more than two billion Web pages and is still growing. This
information overload has sent some timid investors to full-service brokers,
where they pay high commission fees for brokerage services and investment
advice. Smart online investors can avoid information overload by developing
their own information systems.
This chapter shows how you can take maximum advantage of the Internet’s
many investment tools, links, and resources. The chapter explains the
Internet basics of using search engines, finding investor newsgroups, sub-
scribing to investor mailing lists, accessing online databases, and using Web
sites tailored to your specific needs to maximize your personal wealth.
Building Your Own Online 
Information System
Investments provide opportunities to make money in both a bull market (that
is, an up market) and a bear (down) market. No one ever knows for certain
whether the market will go up or down, but investors can develop an informa-
tion system to watch indicators for potential price changes and investment
opportunities. This chapter introduces the elements you can use for building
an online investment information system that meets your specific needs.

Investment indicators often signal future market trends. For example, changes
in bond prices and interest rates often reflect trends that may affect stock
prices. That is, if bond yields decline, investors often rush to purchase stocks,
causing stock prices to increase.
Investors need this information to decide whether they should buy, sell, or hold.
Gathering, organizing, and saving this information can be time-consuming.
However, using your own online information system can make the process more
efficient.
Successful investing involves five basic steps:
1. Identifying new investments
2. Analyzing investment candidates
3. Purchasing investments
4. Monitoring investments
5. Selling investments — and reaping your rewards
The following sections summarize online sources of the information you need
for each step. Knowing what type of information you need and where to get it
online can help you build your personalized online information system.
Identifying new investments
Before investing, you need to clearly state your financial objectives and
know your risk-tolerance level. This information can help you determine
your required rate of return. By doing this type of homework, you can 
determine which categories of financial assets you may want to consider
investing in. For example, if you’re selecting investments for your Individual
Retirement Account (IRA), you don’t want to invest in tax-exempt municipal
bonds (because being tax-exempt twice isn’t the best way to make use of tax
exemptions).
Here are some examples of online sources for identifying investment 
opportunities:
 Company profiles describe a firm’s organization, products, financial
position, chief competitors, and executive management. (See Chapter 10
for details.)
 Direct purchase plans (DPPs) show how to purchase stock in a com-
pany without paying a broker’s commission. (See Chapter 15.) 
 Directories of investor sources provide hard-to-find information that’s
necessary for investment decision-making. 
12
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) describe how to join dividend
reinvestment programs to purchase company stock at a discount and
without a broker. (Chapter 15 shows you how to get started.)
 Initial public offerings (IPOs) are new opportunities for investor profits.
(See Chapter 15.)
 Investing e-zines (electronic magazines) provide educational articles
and pertinent facts for beginning and experienced investors. (See
Chapter 2.)
 Mailing lists provide opinions and investors’ insights about investment
candidates. (I discuss mailing lists later in this chapter, in the section,
“Uncovering Investor Information from Mailing Lists.”)
 News reports on the Net can provide information about new investment
opportunities. (See Chapter 11.)
 Newsgroups are informal, online groups of individuals who share their
ideas about a common interest. You can find dozens of investment-related
newsgroups with topics ranging from specific types of investments to
investor strategies. (See “Understanding How Newsgroups Can Help You,”
later in this chapter.)
 Online databases (free and fee-based repositories of information) provide
historical stock prices, economic forecasts, and more. (See the section
“Using Free and Fee-Based Online Investor Databases,” later in this chap-
ter, for examples of what’s available.)
 Search engines (specialized Internet programs that seek the data you
desire) provide you with links to the Web pages that have the investor
information you want. (I discuss search engines later in this chapter, in
the section “Setting Up Your Basic Investment Search Strategy.”)
 Stock recommendations from professionals enable you to find out what
brokers and analysts are saying about your investment selections. (See
Chapter 11.)
 Mutual fund and stock screens for selecting specific securities enable
you to sort through thousands of investment candidates in seconds to
find not only the right investment but also the best investment available.
(I discuss Internet-based mutual fund screening in Chapter 6 and stock
screening in Chapter 9.)
Analyzing investment prospects
The process of analyzing investment prospects includes examining groups of
investments or individual securities. For this task, you need information to
forecast the timing and amount of future cash flows of investment candidates.
That is, the price you pay today is based on the future income of the asset.
13
Chapter 1: Finding Investor Stuff on the Net

Figuring out what the asset will be worth in the future requires some home-
work, analysis, and luck. Here are a few examples of online sources for this
type of information:
 Company profiles and annual reports often forecast the company’s
future revenues and earnings. (For more information about finding
annual reports online, see Chapter 10. You can find more information
about company profiles in Chapter 11.)
 Databases (free and fee-based online sources) provide news, market
commentary, historical stock prices, economic forecasts, industry stan-
dards, and competitor information. I introduce you to these databases in
the section “Using Free and Fee-Based Online Investor Databases,” later
in this chapter. 
 Earnings estimates from brokers and analysts give you forecasts of a
company’s future earnings. (See Chapter 11.)
 Industry or business-sector news can frequently indicate whether an
industry is in a downward cycle. (See Chapter 11.)
 National economic data can point you toward a particular investment
strategy. For example, if the country is going into a recession, you 
may want to select stocks that provide you with some defense. (See
Chapter 11.)
 News databases offer breaking news that can help you judge whether
your stock purchase is a winner or a loser. (Chapter 2 offers a good
overview of online news sources.)
 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings provide you with
financial statements from publicly traded companies. These companies
are required to file financial statements every 90 days and more often if
big events are happening within the firm. More than 7,000 publicly
traded firms are now filing online. (For details, see Chapter 10.)
Purchasing investments
After you decide which investments you want to purchase, you have to decide
how you want to purchase them. For example, you must decide whether you
want a full-service broker or, for online investing, either a premium discount
broker who offers online trades and advice or a discount broker that only 
executes your trades and doesn’t offer any recommendations. (See Chapter 4
for details.)
You may participate in an automatic investment plan (AIP). With your
approval, this type of plan deducts a certain amount from your checking
account to purchase mutual funds, savings bonds, or other investments.
(Chapter 7 provides step-by-step directions for opening an AIP account.)
14
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

Monitoring investments
If you have more than one investment, you likely want to monitor and com-
pare their performances to the market and to similar investments. Here are a
few examples of the information and the software you need to accomplish
this objective:
 Market-monitoring tools send alerts that you determine. For example, if
your stock increases by 25 percent, you may want to consider selling it.
You can set up an alert that sends you an e-mail message notifying you
that your stock has reached this target.
 The Internet provides many portfolio management programs that let you
know when your investments are in the news.
 Online portfolio management tools can automatically send you an e-mail
message at the end of the day to let you know whether your investments
gained or lost value.
 PC-based portfolio management tools are downloadable software pro-
grams that assist you in tracking your investments and record keeping.
 Your online broker may track your portfolio for you and keep records of
your profits and losses.
See Chapter 17 for more details about online portfolio management.
Selling investments
You need to decide what proportion of your personal wealth you want to
invest in specific assets, how long you want to hold those assets, and
whether now is a good time to sell those assets to harvest your rewards. To
that end, you need information about the following topics:
 Asset allocation methodologies: You need to determine what portion of
your portfolio should be invested in mutual funds, stocks, and bonds.
(See Chapter 3 to find a strategy that’s right for you.)
 Capital gains and tax issues: The Smart Money Capital Gains Guide
(www.smartmoney.com/tax/capital) can assist you in understanding
the tax implications of investing activities.
 Selling strategies: Determining when you should harvest your invest-
ments requires using specific order execution strategies, mutual fund
redemption plans, and analyses. (See Chapters 4, 5, 7, and 17 to explore
these topics in more detail.)
15
Chapter 1: Finding Investor Stuff on the Net

Setting Up Your Basic Investment 
Search Strategy
Search engines are commercial enterprises that collect and index Web pages
or Web page titles. You can use them to help you sift through all the Web
pages out there so that you can find the information you need.
Some of these enterprises review the sites they collect, and others provide
site information unfiltered and unedited. Some search engines (like Yahoo! at
www.yahoo.com) are hierarchical indexes and use subject listings that are
similar to the card catalog in a library. Often, you can search hierarchical
indexes by keyword (a word that sums up or describes the item or concept
that you’re seeking) and by topic.
Knowing how to use a search engine is a basic Internet skill. Currently, more
than 600 different search engines exist on the Net. These Internet tools can
be divided into two categories: metasearch engines and search engines.
Metasearch engines
Metasearch engines enable you to enter a single search term to query many
individual search engines. This kind of all-in-one shopping is used to match
your inquiry to the millions of Web pages on the Internet. Metasearch engines
often have different approaches to presenting your results. Some metasearch
engines just query a wide variety of search engines and report your results
without you having to go to several search engines. Other metasearch engines
bypass existing search engines and query multiple online sources for your
search results. Here are some examples of metasearch engines:
 Dogpile (www.dogpile.com) searches the Web, Usenet newsgroups, FTP
sites (sites for downloading software and data via FTP — the file transfer
protocol), weather information, stock quotes, business news, and other
news wires. (For more information about Usenet newsgroups, see the
section “Understanding How Newsgroups Can Help You,” later in this
chapter.) This site also includes a Web catalog.
 Momma (www.momma.com) simultaneously queries a series of search
engines and properly formats the words and syntax for each source
being probed. The search results are then organized into a uniform
format and presented by relevance and source.
 Metacrawler (www.metacrawler.com/index.html) works like Dogpile
but doesn’t search Usenet newsgroups and FTP (file transfer protocol)
sites. Search results aren’t annotated.
16
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 SurfWax (www.surfwax.com) allows users to put together search sets.
For example, an “Investor” SearchSet can include The Wall Street Journal,
CNNfn, The New York Times, and so on. You can also use tools for explor-
ing search results. For example, SiteSnaps allows you to quickly view page
content, and ContextZooming allows you to search highlighted terms.
FocusWords offers suggestions about how you can narrow or broaden
your search. Finally, you can use an InfoCubby to save your search results
for later retrieval. SurfWax offers three levels of service (free, silver, and
gold). With your free registration, you receive the free level of service that
includes three SearchSets of up to 15 sources each. Silver and Gold 
subscribers pay $24 and $60 per year, respectively. Each registered level
has access to all of SurfWax’s capabilities; the difference is the extent of
permitted uses. (Firm pricing is available on a custom basis.)
 Profusion (www.profusion.com) allows you to search one, some, or 
all of the listings from AltaVista, About, AOL, Lycos, Raging Search,
WiseNut, Metacrawler, MSN, Adobe PDF, LookSmart, Netscape, Teoma,
and AllTheWeb. You can fine-tune your search by selecting your search
type, the number of results per page, the number of results per source,
and when you want the search to timeout. You can narrow your search
by looking into vertical search groups, such as Business or Finance.
 Vivisimo (www.vivisimo.com) technology was developed by researchers
at Carnegie Mellon University. Vivisimo doesn’t index the Web; it simulta-
neously searches several major search engines and directories (such 
as Fast, MSN, Yahoo!, AltaVista, Lycos, Open Directory, Excite, and
WebCrawler). The Vivisimo technology then groups results into clusters
of titled folders that best fit the query.
Popular search engines
Search engines are trustworthy Internet programs that match the words in
your query to words on the Internet. Each search engine is a competitive,
commercial enterprise with different databases, search programs, and fea-
tures. Everyone has a favorite search engine. The search engine that is best is
the one that works the best for you.
Search engines employ spiders or crawlers (robot programs) that constantly
seek new information on the Internet. These robot programs index and cate-
gorize their findings and then let you probe their lists with keywords. The
engine shows your search results with short descriptions and hyperlinks.
Just click the hyperlink to go to the Web page you seek.

Chapter 1: Finding Investor Stuff on the Net

Here are a few of the more popular search engines on the Net:
 Excite (www.excite.com) enables you to browse many subject cate-
gories, such as investing. It uses a combination of concept (a general
idea) and keyword (a specific word in the Web page) searches, so the
results are usually pretty good. If you’re unsatisfied with your findings,
click the Excite Metasearch link at the bottom of the page for more
results.
 Google (www.google.com) is currently ranked as the number-one
search engine. It has the largest amount of the Internet indexed. Google
offers the Google Toolbar, a quick-and-easy-to-install toolbar that auto-
matically appears along with the Internet Explorer toolbar to increase
your ability to speedily find information on the Net.
 MSN (search.msn.com) enables you to set preferences to automatically
correct spelling errors, select the number of results per page, and deter-
mine whether search responses should include summaries. Additionally,
you can search from any one of MSN’s international Web sites. If you’re
unfamiliar with search engines, click Help to get the advice you need.
Additionally, MSN has a new beta that is supposed to be a “Google
beater,” a search engine, index, and crawler. For more information see
beta.search.msn.com/default.aspx?FORM=HPRE. 
 Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) is a popular starting point. This directory
search engine includes a vast array of subject directories, categories,
and special services, such as People Search, Weekly Picks, What’s New
This Week, Yahoo! Loan Center, Finance Yahoo!, and Real Estate Yahoo!

Personalized search engines
With more than two billion Web pages, your
search for investment information is likely to
dredge up many articles that are outdated or
simply not relevant. One way to increase your
treasure-to-trash ratio is to use a personalized
search engine. My Yahoo! (my.yahoo.com)
allows users to set up profiles for (among other
things) specific news topics and a stock portfolio.
The My Excite Web site (my.excite.com)
includes much of the same personalization fea-
tures as My Yahoo! With your free registration,
you can select page colors, settings, content,
and layout (two columns or three?).

Selecting the best search engine
With more than two billion Web pages on the Internet, finding the one page
you need to complete your investor research can be difficult. Using search
engines is often like a crapshoot. Sometimes you win (and you find the Web
page you want), and sometimes you lose (you find no relevant Web pages in
your search results). If you lose, you have to go to another search engine and
spend more time researching.
Not all search engines are equal. Some have indexed a large portion of the
Internet. Others are just starting or are slow in keeping up with the thou-
sands of new Web pages that are added each day. To be competitive, search
engines are always adding new features. Some search engine databases
include Usenet, mailing lists, news sources, indexes, directories, Web sites,
company profiles, and other information. Other search engines include only a
portion of this data.
When you evaluate search engines, see how they match up to the following
criteria:
 Subject directory: Does the search engine enable you to limit searches
to specific subject areas? Searches are quicker if the search engine offers
a subject directory because it searches only in the topic area that you
specify.
 Results ranking: Does the search engine rate your search results so that
you know how likely you are to find what you’re looking for? (For exam-
ple, listings with relevancy ratings of less than 90 percent are usually
worthless.)
 Web: Does the search engine look through the World Wide Web for your
results?
 URL (Uniform Resource Locator): Does the search engine provide the
Internet addresses for your search results? Getting the address can be
very helpful; you can save or print the results of your search and then
later you can backtrack and get to those difficult-to-find Web sites.
 Summary: Does the search engine provide a short text description of
the search results?
 Boolean searches: Does the search engine allow you to conduct more
targeted searches?
Portal is another name for search engine. Portals are designed to be the
Internet user’s first window on the Web. Often, you can personalize portals to
get financial news, current portfolio data, and interest rate information before
moving on to other Web sites. Examples of portals include CBS MarketWatch
(www.cbsmarketwatch.com), Microsoft Network (www.msn.com), and
MSNBC (www.msnbc.msn.com).

Understanding How Newsgroups 
Can Help You
Newsgroups are discussion forums (or electronic bulletin boards) where
individuals post messages for others to read and answer. New newsgroups
appear — and old, unused newsgroups disappear — almost daily.
The advantage of these groups is that the opinions of authors are disparate
and come from around the world. There are between 20,000 and 50,000 pub-
licly accessible newsgroups. Some of these newsgroups are filled with spam
(junk mail), and others are inactive shells. Newsgroups range from serious to
silly and support almost all religious ideologies, political points of view, and
philosophical beliefs. If you want to know what investors think about a par-
ticular investment, a newsgroup is a good place to look for the answer.
Newsgroup participants aren’t necessarily investment professionals, but
many of them are savvy investors.
Knowing how newsgroups are named can help you determine whether a 
certain newsgroup may interest you. Newsgroup names typically have two or
more parts. The first section of a newsgroup’s name is the most general
grouping or topic. Here are some examples of different first names that may
be of interest to online investors:
Section
Description
Alt
Alternative subjects, ranging from the serious (investing
and finance) to the weird (occult and alternative lifestyles)
Biz
Business subjects, including commercials
Misc
Miscellaneous topics, from items for sale to finance
Newsgroups can have names with two sections. For example the first section
can be alt, and the second section can be invest. The name of the newsgroup
then would be alt.invest. Some newsgroups do not have any subgroups, 
but others have 20 or more subgroups under the major topic. One example 
of a major topic is alt.invest.real-estate, which branches into other
newsgroups, such as alt.invest.real-estate.methods. That is, each 
component of the name represents a different level in the newsgroup. The last
named component is the actual theme of the group. For example, alt.invest.
real-estate is about investing in real estate.
Subscribing to a newsgroup is easy. With most browsers, you simply click the
name of the newsgroup you want to subscribe to. For details, use your Web
browser to check out Beginners Central at Northern Webs (www.northern
webs.com/bc/index.html). Discover how to navigate your browser’s news-
reader, select a newsgroup, and post to newsgroups.

Finding the perfect newsgroup
The Internet provides various sources for finding Usenet newsgroups. Here
are a few examples:
 Harley Hahn (www.harley.com/usenet) provides Harley Hahn’s Master
List of Usenet Newsgroups. The master list includes a short description
of each newsgroup, placed in a category and organized in an easy-to-use
search list.
 Yahoo! Groups (groups.yahoo.com) offers nearly 3,000 investment
groups and more than 600 online investing mailing lists. In this popula-
tion, 60 subgroups focus on e*Trade. Registration is free. You can even
start your own Yahoo! group.
 Robot Wisdom Newsgroup Finder (www.robotwisdom.com/finder/
index.html) enables you to search by historical period, numbers of
articles, and country or state locations. This site uses clickable maps of
the United States and the world. Responses include the newsgroup
name, address, description, charter, and sometimes Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQs) if available.
Tired of the same old newsgroups? Discover all the Web’s new newgroups by
going to Newsville at www.newsville.com/news/newnews.html.
Finally, some investor news reading
One of the easiest ways to find newsgroups is to go to Google (www.google.
com). Click Groups, then click Browse all of Usenet. At the next Web page
shown in Figure 1-1, to select your topic enter your keyword in the Directory
Search or scroll through the Usenet names. Regardless of which approach
you select, you’ll discover a listing of newsgroups that may be of interest to
you. Each group includes the group’s name, a description of the group, the
group’s category, and other characteristics. These characteristics can
include information about the number of group members, whether the group
is open to the public, restricted, moderated, and so on.
The best feature of this site is that you can post your questions directly to
the newsgroup without a great deal of fuss. You can also search newsgroup
articles for keywords. For example, assume that you’re thinking about invest-
ing in Microsoft. As part of your research, you can see what newsgroup mem-
bers had to say about the company, and when they said it.
Another great feature is that you can research the author of the newsgroup
article. Google shows how many articles the author has posted and which
newsgroup that author is posting to. This data can indicate which news-
groups regularly carry the type of information you’re seeking.

Getting the Message from 
Investor Message Boards
With investor message boards, you can read what other online investors are
saying about an investment that may interest you. Overall, these message
boards include many honest, knowledgeable investors, with only a few
unscrupulous fraudsters with questionable intentions. Therefore, you must
determine what is sound advice and what is trash. Make certain that you
complete your own research before acting on any message board informa-
tion. The following are a few of the top-rated investor message boards online:
 Silicon Investor (www.siliconinvestor.com/stocktalk) has several
levels of membership. Basic membership is free with your registration.
The free, limited level allows you to post between one and two messages
per day. You can’t turn off ads and can’t make use of advanced features
such as Next 10 and Search. Paying subscribers have unlimited posting
privileges, the ability to turn off ads, and access to Next 10, Search, and
Advanced Search features. Subscriptions are $19.95 per month, $29.95
per $29.95, and $49.95 for six months. Annual subscriptions are $89.95,
and a lifetime subscription is $199.95.
Figure 1-1:
Google has
introduced a
new way to
search for
newsgroups.

Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 The Motley Fool (boards.fool.com) is free with your registration. Here
you find company discussions sorted by name, industry, and market
analysis, as well as an investors’ roundtable for discussing strategies.
Before you post, don’t forget to read the “Fool Community Guidelines” at
www.fool.com/help/?display=community04. 
 Raging Bull (www.ragingbull.com), now owned by Lycos, has more
than 15,000 active message boards. Participants earn a “power rating”
that indicates how much credibility a member has earned with the com-
munity. Features include lists of the most active message boards and
message boards with the greatest number of posts.
Uncovering Investor Information 
from Mailing Lists
Mailing lists are e-mail groups that are started by organizations or individuals
who purchase mailing list programs. Then they advertise to others who may
be interested in joining a topic-specific discussion group. The advertisement
usually provides precise instructions for subscribing to the mailing list.
You subscribe to a particular mailing list by sending an e-mail message to the
list’s moderator. In return, you receive an e-mail message confirming your
enrollment. This message typically includes the address you use for posting
messages to the mailing list, the rules of the discussion group, and instruc-
tions for removing your name — that is, unsubscribing — from the mailing list.
Mailing list participants exchange e-mail about issues in their subject areas. If
someone starts a thread, or topic, that you want to comment on, you post
your comments to the list, using the instructions you received when you 
subscribed.
To answer questions or make comments, subscribers send an e-mail message
to the mailing list address (which differs from the mailing list program’s
address), and everyone gets a copy of the message. Unlike newsgroups, most
lists are moderated so that inappropriate messages aren’t sent to the group.
Today more than 300,000 mailing lists exist. You may find a mailing list while
surfing the Net, but they tend to be private. The best source for finding an
investor-related mailing list is Tile.net (www.tile.net). Tile.net has more
than 66,000 public mailing lists and is growing. Don’t despair; the site is
searchable and provides information that describes each mailing list and how
to subscribe (and, more importantly, how to unsubscribe if it doesn’t meet
your requirements). Another good mailing list directory is CataList (www.
lsoft.com/lists/listref.html), which includes more than 66,000 mailing
lists. It’s searchable by site, country, and number of list subscribers.
23
Chapter 1: Finding Investor Stuff on the Net

(Sometimes knowing how many subscribers will receive your investment
question is a good idea.)
Don’t lose that information about how to unsubscribe! Mailing list members
receive an average of 30 messages per day. If you just signed up for four mail-
ing lists, you may have more than a hundred messages tomorrow.
Using Free and Fee-Based 
Online Investor Databases
Online investors have their choice of searching free or fee-based online data-
bases. One advantage of both types of databases is that they’re constantly
open. That is, you can access them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
It’s a no-brainer that savvy online investors should start with the free data-
bases. If the information you desire isn’t available in the free databases, try
fee-based databases. If you carefully select a fee-based database for your
well-constructed query, you can often get the information you want without
paying big bucks.
Totally free databases
The Internet is a network of networks linking millions of computers worldwide
for the purpose of communicating. The Internet was originally developed 
in 1969 for the U.S. military and gradually grew to include educational and
research institutions. These colleges and universities have never charged for
the Internet they assisted in creating. Consequently, many free reference
sources exist online. Here are a few examples: 
 Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (www.stls.frb.org/research/
index.html) provides links to high-quality economic research such as
FRED II (Federal Reserve Economic Data), a historical database of eco-
nomic and financial statistics, and FRASER (Federal Reserve Archival
System for Economic Research), a new collection of scanned images of
historical economic statistical publications, releases, and documents.
Sign up for the mailing list and be notified about late-breaking data or
new publications.
 The Federal Web Locator (www.infoctr.edu/fwl/index.htm#toc) is
a service provided by the Center for Information Law and Policy and is
intended to be the one-stop shopping point for federal government infor-
mation on the World Wide Web. 
24
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 Government Information Locator Service (www.access.gpo.gov/
su_docs/gils), shown in Figure 1-2, contains records of public informa-
tion throughout the U.S. government. Government Information Locator
Service (GILS) records and describes the GILS holdings of a particular
agency. However, the GILS database is updated irregularly. Each GILS 
document is available as a downloadable ASCII text file and as an 
HTML file. 
When all else fails — fee-based databases
For specialized investor topics, the only information available may be in an
online database that you have to pay for. How each organization charges for
database access varies from company to company. Charges can be by query,
month, hour, or document. Most firms were designed for large corporate use,
and they tend to flounder in their attempts to find equitable ways of charging
individuals for private use.
Fee-based databases have several limitations. Often, they use their own
search methodologies that require some getting used to, and they can be
costly. The fee structure may be geared for corporations and too expensive
for individual use. Databases tend to be traditional and may not have that bit
of unique information you’re seeking.
Figure 1-2:
The
Government
Information
Locator
Service
(GILS).

Chapter 1: Finding Investor Stuff on the Net

Here are a few examples of fee-based databases (all price quotes are as of
this writing and are subject to change, just like everything else on the
Internet):
 Lexis-Nexis (www.lexis-nexis.com) includes information from major
regional and national newspapers, news sources, company information,
and financial information, including SEC reports and proxy statements,
in addition to other business sources in English and foreign languages.
Find the information you need in one of two ways: select the product or
service that you want to subscribe to or choose a particular topic. Lexis-
Nexis accepts online credit-card payments. You can pay as you go, $3 for
news sources, $4 to $12 for company and financial information. Or you
can pay by the day or the week. For example, newspaper, business, and
financial databases are $250 weekly or $75 daily. The top 34 business
sources are $150 per week or $50 per day. Major papers (such as The
New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Chicago Tribune) are $75
per week or $30 per day.
 Highbeam Research (www.highbeam.com/library/index.asp) has,
among other things, electronic access to many newspapers, periodicals,
and journals that you can search by keyword. Highbeam Research is a
good source for background or academic financial research. Basic serv-
ice is free and limited to previews of articles. Full membership includes
unlimited access, lets you archive articles, and provides alerts when
new articles about a topic you’re researching are posted. A free seven-
day trial is available. Full membership is $19.95 per month or $99.95 for
12 months.
 STAT-USA (www.stat-usa.gov) is sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Commerce. This site includes economic indicators, statistics, and news.
It also offers data about state and local bond rates, foreign exchange
rates, and daily economic news. Statistics include interest rates, employ-
ment, income, prices, productivity, new construction, and home sales.
Subscriptions for individuals are $75 per quarter or $175 per year. 
Getting Online Investor Information
Geared to Your Needs
Today, online investors come from the entire spectrum of society. Online
investors range from young to old, beginners to professionals, and so on.
Each of these groups has specific needs and interests. Many of the individu-
als in these special-interest groups are looking to online communities for
answers and information about their special investment needs. Others see
communities as a way to make online investing simpler because information
is geared to their way of thinking. The Internet provides special Web sites tar-
geted to online investors with specific interests. The following is a sample of
what you’ll find on the Internet.
26
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

Investor Web sites for children
Every day you’re bombarded with information about the stock market. Turn
on the car radio, walk through a hotel lobby, or watch the news on television,
and you get updates about the stock market whether you want to or not. In a
recent Merrill Lynch survey of 512 teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17,
about 9 percent who save their money invest in mutual funds or stocks. How
can young people invest? A parent must open a custodial account because a
minor can’t make securities transactions without the approval of an account
trustee. The Merrill Lynch statistic indicates an interest in investing that’s
supported by a number of online Web sites aimed at children.
Here are a few examples of the wide range of online resources that can meet
the needs of even the youngest investor:
 Big Money Adventure (www.agedwards.com/public/content/fcgi/
bma/frontpage.fcgi) is a site in which you select your guides and
adventure based on your age: 2 to 6, 6 to 10, and 10 to adult. Visit the
Rainbow Castle, jump into a storybook adventure, and learn about
investing, or you can play a stock-picking game and win prizes.
 The Young Investor Web site (www.younginvestor.com) is an interac-
tive community designed for children and parents. Find out the funda-
mentals of managing money and investing. Don’t forget to visit the game
room and play a few investing games.
Web sites for young investors
A recent NASDQ (National Association of Securities Dealers) survey showed
that college-aged individuals (18 to 34 years old) account for about 20 percent
of all U.S. investors. Online brokerages target these investors as their next rev-
enue source. Many online brokerages understand that college-aged investors
don’t have a lot to invest now but will likely become substantial investors
over time.
Here are a few examples of sites that target this group:
 Edustock (library.thinkquest.org/3088) is an educational Web site
designed by high school students for investors young and old. The Web
site includes beginning investor tutorials about how to select stocks,
company profiles, and a free 20-minute delayed online stock market 
simulation.
 Independent Means (www.anincomeofherown.com) is a Web site
designed for women under 20 (and their over-20 mentors) to find an
income of their own. The motto of the Web site is “girls, money, and
power.” Discover articles about money and investing, teen business
pages, and more.
27
Chapter 1: Finding Investor Stuff on the Net

 TeenAnalyst (www.teenanalyst.com) is staffed by a group of young
investors aged 15 to 16 years old. Using their experience and knowledge
of investing, they bring young investors information in a fun and infor-
mative manner.
Other investor special-interest sites
Many financial institutions sponsor special-interest Web sites that provide
selected groups with the information they need to be educated investors.
These and other specialty Web sites (which are often nonprofit) understand
that many investor sites attempt to educate online investors but fail to do so
correctly because they don’t understand the unique needs, top issues, and
interests of the Internet users they serve. The following sections present 
a sampling of the various special-interest investor Web sites available:
Senior investors
Older investors can turn to the following sites for investment information:
 Money & Investing (www.eldernet.com/money.htm) is geared to
senior citizens. You access this site from the ElderNet home page.
ElderNet’s Money & Investing site provides tutorials on the basics of
investing, mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. Also, it includes sound
advice on how to select a financial advisor.
 ThirdAge (www.thirdage.com/money) provides information about
investing, money management, and retiring well for adults in their mid-
40s through 50s. If you’re investing for an early retirement, this Web site
can help you.
Socially responsible investors
If you have an active social conscience, consider these sites as starting
points for your investment research:
 SocialFunds.com (www.socialfunds.com) has more than 1,000 pages of
strategic content to help investors make informed decisions regarding
socially responsible investing. The Web site provides news, information,
research, investment analysis, and financial services.
 The Investor Responsibility Research Center (www.irrc.org) provides
research related to corporate governance, social issues, and environ-
mental practices. Get information about corporate benchmarking and
environmental indexes.
 The Social Investment Forum (www.socialinvest.org) offers compre-
hensive information, contacts, and resources on socially responsible
investing. The Web site includes an online guide, financial services,
news, and research.

Minority and women investors
The following sites are representative of Internet investment resources tar-
geted specifically at minority and women investors:
 The Gay Financial Network (www.gfn.com) provides free financial
news, information, and services. The site also includes articles by fea-
tured columnists and a weekly poll.
 WIFE.org (www.wife.org) is the Web site of the Women’s Institute for
Financial Education (WIFE), a nonprofit organization dedicated to finan-
cial independence for women.
 iVillage MoneyLife Personal Finance for Women (www.ivillage.com/
money) targets women who want to take control of their finances and
start investing. Other topics include handling credit and debt, life 
and money, and money talk.

No Experience Required: Getting
Started with Online Investing
In This Chapter
 Discovering how to get a cost-free investor education online
 Locating beginner investor and new online investor Web sites, FAQs sources, 
and glossaries
 Getting expert advice and news from online news sources, newspapers, magazines, 
and more
 Getting investment newsletters automatically sent to your e-mailbox
 Investing and earning profits with investment clubs
 Practicing what you’ve discovered with Internet stock simulations
T
he Internet can assist you in getting the information you need to be a savvy
investor. I suggest that you start with one of the many online tutorials for
beginning investors. I highlight several helpful online tutorials in this chapter. I
also show you the best Web sites for new investors. I continue with directions
to online Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) sources and Internet glossaries to
help you with those troublesome investment terms and concepts that the
experts use.
This chapter also points out where you can find expert advice and late-breaking
financial news from online news organizations, newspapers, and magazines. You
discover how you can find scholarly financial journals to research the latest
stock-picking methodology that your lunch buddy expounds daily. I even show
you how to get specialized investment newsletters automatically sent to your
e-mailbox so that you can stay on top of current events. I often give you prices
for various services, as well, but these prices may change, so check the Web
sites for any updated information.
Finally, this chapter shows you how to practice what you’ve discovered with-
out losing a dime. First, you can join or start an investment club, which enables
you to learn and earn with other folks that are interested in maximizing their
investment returns. Second, you can register for one of the many online stock
simulation games (some even offer monthly prizes or cash awards).

Getting Smart Online
A study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project (www.pewinternet.org/
reports.asp) shows that 63 percent of U.S. adults are now online, and many
of them — especially those with several years of online experience — have
built Internet use into their lives in practical ways. This research indicates
that if you start using the Internet to do your own investing, you won’t spend
a significantly longer time in front of your computer than other people do.
Connecting to the Internet gives you access to millions of documents, a vast
variety of software programs, and high-caliber information that in the not-too-
distant past only large financial institutions could access. The World Wide 
Web provides an easy-to-use interface with which you can access the Internet’s
many financial resources. With your Web browser, you can acquire an educa-
tion in investing, frequently avoid costly financial services, and conduct high-
grade online research.
Online investor tutorials
If you’re serious about seeing your capital grow at the fastest rate possible,
you need to get smart about investing. The Internet provides many online
tutorials, courses, and feature articles that can bring you up to speed.

Avoiding information overload
When you’re just starting out on the Internet, you
can easily become overwhelmed by the huge
amount of business and financial information that’s
available. The best way to avoid this information
overload is to divide these sources into specific
categories. You can add these categories to your
browser’s bookmark file. (Netscape Communicator
calls them bookmarks.In Internet Explorer, they’re
known as favorites.) For example, this chapter pro-
vides information for these bookmark categories:
 Investment clubs
 Investment news and market commentary
 Investment publications
 Investment simulations
 Investment tutorials and training
Bookmarks offer a convenient way to retrieve
Web pages. When you find a Web page that you
know you’ll want to revisit, add it to your Web
browser’s list of bookmarks (or favorites — both
terms mean the same thing). The next time you
want to visit that page, you don’t have to search
for it or remember the series of links you fol-
lowed to reach the page in the first place.
Instead, you can simply select the page from
your list of bookmarks, and voilà! You’re there.
Your Internet browser has menu commands and
icons that enable you to create and organize
your bookmarks. For more information about
bookmarks, refer to The Internet For Dummies,
10th Edition, by Levine, Baroudi, and Young
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Traditional investment bankers and brokerages that are competing for your
investment dollar often sponsor these sites.
These Web sites are usually 80 percent content and 20 percent sales pitch. In
my opinion, the ratio makes them well worth the annoyance or inconvenience
of having to complete a free registration or read an advertising banner. Here
are a few examples of these informative sites:
 About Investing for Beginners (beginnersinvest.about.com) is
designed to help investors understand why the stock market exists,
what makes a stock undervalued or overpriced, and what makes stock
prices change. This collection of short online tutorials covers most of
the basics and can be very helpful for beginning investors.
 Investing Basics (www.aaii.com/invbas) contains feature articles from
the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII). Articles show
individuals how to start successful investment programs, pick winning
investments, evaluate their choices, and more. The articles cost nothing
with your free registration. However, higher levels of information require
your membership. Basic membership is $29 a year for 10 issues of 
the AAII Journal, the Annual Guide to the Top Mutual Funds, Yearly Tax
Planning Guide, Local Chapter Access, AAII Research portfolios, Discount
Broker Survey, Guide to Dividend Reinvestment Plans, Guide to Investment
Web Sites, and other reports. Enhanced membership is $53 and includes
all the Basic membership benefits, plus six issues of the AAII Computerized
Investing newsletter, member access to the Computerized Investing “site-
within-a-site,” and a 300-page online guide to Computerized Investing. The
$349 lifetime membership includes both the Basic and Enhanced member-
ship benefits for life.
 CNN/Money 101 (money.cnn.com/pf/101) is written by the editors of
Money magazine and includes 23 interactive courses on managing all
your finances. Each online tutorial takes about ten minutes. Lessons
include calculators, quizzes, and a library for supplemental materials for
online investors who want to dig deeper.
 NASD Investor Education (www.nasd.com/stellent/idcplg?
IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=13&ssSourceNodeId=5), provided
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, offers educational
materials for investors. In the top margin is information about investor
alerts, investment choices, investing resources, investor protection,
markets and trading, online tools for research, simulation games, and so
on. The left margin shows top links for investors. The center of the page

Web sites for new investors
You can find many investor news, finance, banking, and investment organiza-
tions on the Internet. Competition is high, so companies are willing to give
away a large amount of high-quality information, downloadable software, and
online tools for free. These organizations hope that individual investors, like
you, will become fans of their great services. This way the online company
can become a well-known entity that can charge advertisers for banner ads
or require financial institutions to pay high fees for using their services. 
To see a few examples of investment sites for new investors, check out the
following Web pages:
 MSN Money (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/research/wizards/
SRW.asp), shown in Figure 2-1, shows you how to research a stock.
Discover how to determine whether a company is financially sound, how
much investors are willing to pay for the stock today, how much investors
are likely to pay for the stock in the future, and how the stock compares to
the industry.
 SmartMoney University (university.smartmoney.com) is a great
starting place if you’re a beginning investor or if you want to look up a
specific investing concept. Here, you discover the basics of investing
theory, are introduced to the concept of risk management, and get famil-
iar with the major asset categories.
Glossaries
As you cruise the Internet, you may encounter Web sites that discuss stocks,
online trading, technical analyses, and derivatives. The language may seem
arcane and undecipherable; however, the Internet can help. You can find
many online glossaries that can assist you in stretching your vocabulary.
Here are a few examples:
 InvestorWords (www.investorwords.com), shown in Figure 2-2, has
more than 6,000 definitions of financial terms and 20,000 links between
related terms. This broad financial glossary can save you time and effort.
 Prudential’s Glossary of Terms (www.prufn.com/learningcenter/
glossary) provides an online glossary for finding the definitions of
financial and investment terms. This extensive glossary offers helpful
examples of how investment terms are used.
 Yahoo! Financial Glossary (biz.yahoo.com/f/g/g.html) is a conve-
nient glossary that includes hyperlinks that define words used in the
text. For example, if a definition uses the word option, you can click the
hyperlink and get the definition of option.

Maximizing Your Internet 
Browser with Bookmarks
If you want to return to a first-rate online source, you’re likely to use a short-
cut, such as a bookmark or a favorite. If you use the Netscape browser, you
bookmark the Web page. This acts as a shortcut to the online source. If you
use the Internet Explorer browser, you save the page as a favorite. (I refer to
both of these types of shortcuts as bookmarks for this section of the chapter.)
If you’ve used the Internet for a while, you likely have a long list of book-
marks. Today hundreds of bookmark managers can help you with the follow-
ing problems: 
 Eliminating dead links: Frequently, Web sites merge, go out of business,
or are redesigned so that the page you have bookmarked no longer exists.
 Lessening errors in subfolders: Sometimes bookmarks are filed in the
wrong subfolder or you forget which subfolder contains the specific Web
page you’re seeking.
 Increasing portability: In many cases, the bookmark you’re seeking is
saved on your desktop computer and is not accessible from a remote
computer, such as at your local library.
 Reducing the cumbersome nature of your bookmarks: Systems that
include hundreds of bookmarks in dozens of subfolders often don’t
allow for easy access to the specific bookmark you seek.
If you want to tame your bookmarks so that you get the most out of your
online experience, it’s wise to use a free online bookmark management serv-
ice. Not only can you continue to create bookmarks to your favorite Web
sites, but you often can use the bookmark lists others have created for the
topic areas that interest you. This service can shorten your online research
time. The following are a few examples of bookmark management services:
 FreeLink (www.freelink.org), shown in Figure 2-3, provides free links
(both public and private) with password protection that you can use
anytime from anywhere. You can build your own hierarchy of bookmarks
or start with one of FreeLink’s samples to organize your interests.
 Backflip (www.backflip.com) is listed as one of PC Magazine’s top
100 Web sites. Backflip gets you back to the Web pages you have saved
and allows you to share your bookmarks with others. Backflip is a free
service that lets you organize and search your Web sites in your own
Yahoo!-style directory, and you can reach your bookmarks from any-
where on the Internet.
36
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 MyBookmarks.com (www.mybookmarks.com), with your registration, is
a free Internet service that allows you to keep your browser bookmarks
and favorites online so that you can access them from anywhere. For a
quick start, you can import your existing Internet Explorer and Netscape
bookmarks and AOL places. You can edit and organize your bookmarks
and then export them back to your browser. 
News You Can Use
Savvy investors are knowledgeable investors. By using the Internet, you can
easily keep informed about fast-breaking business and investment news, as
well as stay in tune to the political and economic environment that affects your
investments. Hundreds of business and finance Web sites provide compilations
of this data, which means that at any time, on any day, you can discover the fol-
lowing by using the Internet:
 What the experts are saying about the economy
 Changes in industry trends
 What’s happening at companies that interest you

 What the experts are saying about your investment candidates
 Forecasts of future earnings
 Historical performance data
Remember, identifying investment candidates doesn’t cost you a dime. You can
track companies that interest you for several months or several years without
being obligated to purchase their mutual funds, stocks, or bonds. The Internet
helps you quickly and easily check out how these companies react to a volatile
market, what technological changes are affecting their industries, and how
shifts in the regional or national economy affect company performance.
This section divides online investment news sources into six categories. The
sources that I list in this chapter are a selection of the Internet’s best offer-
ings for your daily reading. Be certain to look for features that have value to
you, such as breaking news, special features, delayed stock quotes, multime-
dia news, searchable archives, and newsletters.
Large news organizations
This section contains information about large Internet news organizations
and focuses on those that specialize in investment and financial news. Many
of these organizations now provide free wireless features so that you can stay
in touch with the latest news using your PDA (personal digital assistant) or
mobile Internet-enabled telephone. I also include international news organiza-
tions that may have affiliations with newspapers, magazines, TV stations, or
radio stations:
 Bloomberg Personal Finance (www.bloomberg.com) is loaded with
timely news, data, and analyses of financial markets and businesses.
Find data on securities, statistics, indices, and research for free. With
your free registration, you receive access to Bloomberg University and
Market Monitor.
 CBS MarketWatch (cbs.marketwatch.com) offers many services with
your free registration. You get unlimited use of online portfolio tools,
information about indices and the market, and full access to message
boards. You can sign up for e-mail alerts to get news as it happens or at
the end of the day. You can also retrieve portfolio information using your
wireless PDA.
Newspapers
Many of the nation’s daily newspapers have online editions that provide fast-
breaking news. Frequently, these sources offer online portfolio management,
delayed quotes, historical stock prices, and other resources:
38

U.S. corporations and international companies listed as American
Depository Receipts (ADRs). Additionally, you can find quotes, news,
and overview information on nearly 20,000 companies that traded on
non-U.S. markets. 
In the left margin, click Company Research. Next enter the name or up to
ten ticker symbols of companies you want to research. If you’re research-
ing a mutual fund, enter the name of the fund or up to ten ticker symbols.
On the next page, you receive news and quotes, company profiles, finan-
cials, analyst ratings, research reports, and Web resources. You can get
two levels of service: free and fee-based ($59 per year for nonsubscribers
of the print edition). Subscribers can receive articles back to 30 days for
free. Articles more than 30 days old are $2.95 for all researchers. 
Magazines
Like newspapers, many business and investment publications have online
versions that provide the same news and feature articles that their paper-
based counterparts do. Often, these online publications include additional
features, such as Web-based tools for calculating your investment returns or
tracking your portfolio. Here are a few examples of online magazines that are
available:
 BusinessWeek Online (www.businessweek.com) is free to all sub-
scribers of BusinessWeek magazine. Free registrants get a daily briefing,
special reports, the searchable archive, banking centers, quotes, and

tors, yield and rate information, retirement advice, Web site recommen-
dations, personal finance information, advice, and an FAQs section.
Scholarly journals
If you really want to check out those newfangled stock analysis methods, you
can find lots of scholarly financial journals online. Some articles you can down-
load immediately. Other Web sites provide only abstracts, and you may have to
contact the author by telephone, fax, e-mail, or U.S. mail for the complete arti-
cle. Here’s a sampling of the many scholarly financial journals online:
 Financial Economics Network (www.ssrn.com/fen/index.html)

Multimedia investment news 
Sometimes it’s easier to listen to the latest investment news than to read the
small print on your monitor. If you are in a public location, such as an airport,
you can use earphones so that you don’t disturb other travelers. Most online
investment news stations require RealPlayer (www.realplayer.com) or
Windows Media Player (www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/
player/download/download.aspx). The following are a few examples of
online news stations:
 ABC Stockmarket Broadcasts (www.abcnews.go.com) offers hourly
audio business reports. In the left margin, click Video & Audio to access
breaking news stories. The site offers a 14-day free trial, and subscrip-
tions are $12.95 per month with RealOne SuperPass and include CNN,
NASCAR.com, the Weather Channel, BBC News, iFilm, and more.
ABCNews on Demand is $4.95 per month, uses RealPlayer, and doesn’t
offer a free trial or any of the SuperPass content.
 Bloomberg.com (www.bloomberg.com) provides free, up-to-the-minute
business news that you’re bound to find useful. Click the Bloomberg
Media tab on the Home Page to get breaking news stores. In the left
margin, click Bloomberg Radio, and you can listen to an update on the
major indices, the stocks that are moving the market ,and much more. 
 Business TalkRadio Network (www.businesstalkradio.net) offers free,
live, online programs 24/7, demos of programs, and access to archived
programs. You need Windows Media Player to listen to live and archived
programs. If you don’t have the plug-in, just click the Windows Media
Player link to get the free download.
Electronic newsletters
The Internet offers investors hundreds of newsletters. For your convenience,
these newsletters can be sent to your e-mailbox at regular intervals. Many
newsletters are free and require only that you provide your name and e-mail
address. Others are fee-based and can cost anywhere from a few dollars to
several hundred dollars per month.
The quality of these newsletters varies. Higher-quality newsletters have edu-
cational value. Junk newsletters often promote a stock-picking methodology
or recommend that you purchase a particular stock. For example, I once
received a newsletter encouraging me to buy stock in a gold mine in Bolivia.
This e-mail was clearly junk, and I deleted the message immediately.
41
Chapter 2: No Experience Required: Getting Started with Online Investing

Sometimes when you visit a Web site or complete a free registration, you may
not notice a prechecked box that says something like “Yes, please include me
on your mailing list and send me special offers, promotions, coupons, newslet-
ters, and free samples from you and your sponsors.” If you don’t uncheck this
box, you’ll start receiving a newsletter from the Web site’s sponsor after you
click the Submit button. So whenever you register for any online service, make
sure that you scroll down and get a look at the entire page; you never know
what may be hiding just below the bottom of your screen.
Daily newsletters or alerts from The Wall Street Journal (public.wsj.com/
home.html) or Ziff Davis Publications (news.zdnet.com) contain breaking
news. Weekly, biweekly, or monthly newsletters tend to focus on larger investor
issues and are more educational.
With more than 9,000 newsletters available, Newsletter Access (www.
newsletteraccess.com/investments/index.html), shown in Figure 2-4,
has an extensive searchable directory of investment newsletters. Browse
more than 250 listings and get independent investment advice so that you
can start to grow your hard earned savings again. If available, information
includes newsletter name, description, frequency, subscription price, organi-
zation, editor, publisher, address, e-mail, telephone and fax numbers, and
Web address.

As you can see from this section, you can get information in several flavors
by going to different online sources. Many of these sources publish news as it
develops. Trying to stay tuned to all these sources can lead to information
overload, so I suggest selecting two or three sources that agree with your
personality and lifestyle. For example, if you check your e-mailbox two or
three times a day, an investment newsletter with special alert editions may
be for you. If you like reading all the daily news at one time, an online news-
paper with a clipping service to personalize the news may be your cup of tea.
Practicing with Your New 
Investment Information
In the not-too-distant past, only large investment firms had access to the high-
quality financial information that’s available on the Internet today. Traditional
investment bankers use this financial information to pick investments that
look promising and then charge their clients substantial commissions to buy
or sell investments based on those recommendations. Now you can access
the same types of information sources and make your own recommendations,
which makes investing less expensive and enables you to take control of your
own portfolio. After all, no one is more concerned about your financial suc-
cess than you.
In previous sections in this chapter, I point you to various online resources
that you can use to find out about companies, industries, the economy, and
other areas that investors need to know about. However, at this early stage in
your online investing career, you may not feel confident enough to start
selecting your own investments. Don’t despair! You can practice your new
investment strategies in two ways and not risk any of your hard-earned sav-
ings. First, if you don’t have a clue about how to start investing, you can join
an investment club and get some one-on-one advice. Second, you can try out
your strategies with one or more online investment simulations.
Join the club! Become a member 
of an investment club
In an investment club, members pay a monthly amount to be invested. The
club makes the investments based on member recommendations. The mem-
bers incur a pro rata share of the gains or losses, meaning that each invest-
ment club member receives a portion of the investment club’s gains or losses
and is responsible for his or her share of the taxes on those gains or losses. 
43
Chapter 2: No Experience Required: Getting Started with Online Investing

In the past, investment clubs often didn’t do a lot of research. Members of
many clubs purchased only safe, conservative stocks; thus, members made
small profits. Over the last five years, however, members of investment clubs
have begun taking more risks, resulting in higher profits. Due to this phenom-
enon, the number of investment clubs is increasing at a tremendous rate.
You can find many investment clubs online. No prerequisites are necessary to
join or form an investment club, so investment clubs are great for absolute
beginners. Generally, investment clubs have three purposes:
 Finding out about investing
 Having fun
 Making money
The goal of most investment clubs is to help beginning investors become
smart investors — that is, to educate investors in a disciplined approach to
successful investing, portfolio management, and wealth building. The people
who belong to these investment clubs often believe that finding new Web
sites and investments, and meeting new people with the same interests, can
be very helpful and profitable. For more information about investment clubs,
check out the following Web sites:
 Chicks Laying Nest Eggs (www.chickslayingnesteggs.com/club/
club.html) is geared for women investors and offers general invest-
ment club resources and resources for registered investment clubs.
 InvestorGuide (www.investorguide.com/clubs.html) provides a list-
ing of U.S. investment clubs, sorted by state. Investors who don’t want
to leave their computers can also find a list of online investment clubs.
 The Motley Fool (www.fool.com/InvestmentClub/InvestmentClub
Introduction.htm) offers a short tutorial about investment clubs. Find
out how you can start or join an investment club, which resources
investment clubs require, and some of the potential pitfalls of being a
member of an investment club.
Getting into the game: Online 
investment simulations
Investment games enable you to invest in a virtual portfolio so that you can
test your new investment strategies or try out new theories without losing
any money. It’s a great way to get hands-on experience with portfolio manage-
ment. By playing the game, you can find out investment terms, gain confidence
in your decision-making, become familiar with financial markets, see how
others are faring, and have lots of fun. Your success is measured by how
many hypothetical dollars you make each month.
44
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

Online investment simulation games are easy to play, and many of the 
simulation-game Web sites provide helpful investor lessons and insights. You
don’t need any prior experience to enter the game. Complete the free regis-
tration and, in many cases, win prizes for your savvy investment strategies.
Here’s an overview of how these games work: After you register, decide how
much of your fantasy cash you want to invest. To purchase stock, just click a
tab that’s named something like Buy Order. To sell, click Sell Order. Enter the
quantity and the ticker symbol (the abbreviated name of a publicly owned
company that’s used when trading on an exchange) of your choice. The pro-
gram does the rest. When you click Update, the program assigns your portfo-
lio a rank. If your profits pile up faster and higher than other game-players’
profits do, you get a better ranking. Playing the stock market for fun in a 
no-money, no-risk game that can help you get started with understanding the
financial market and trading online. Here are some examples of online stock
simulation games:
 Fantasy Stock Market (www.fantasystockmarket.com) is a free, educa-
tional investment simulation game that enables participants to build
their $100,000 portfolio by trading stocks and mutual funds on the major
U.S. exchanges.
 Marketocracy.com (www.marketocracy.com) allows you to create your
own mutual fund with a virtual $1 million. Select your fund’s name,
ticker symbol, and philosophy. The net assets value of your fund will be
evaluated every quarter. You also need to stick by your goals and distri-
bution plans. Top funds are rewarded with more virtual cash and inter-
ested investors. Membership is free. If you want research, stock alerts,
access to stock picks, analyses, and news, you have to pay $60 for a
three-month subscription, $180 for a one-year subscription, or $300 for a
two-year subscription. A free 30-day trial is available.
 Virtual Stock Exchange (www.virtualstockexchange.com) is a free
stock simulation game that enables you to trade shares like a real bro-
kerage account. You can test your latest profit-making strategy with
stocks you’re thinking about purchasing. This Web site also provides
research reports, market news, and charting.

Making Your Money Work Harder
In This Chapter
 Using the Internet to simplify your financial planning
 Moving from saver to investor
 Setting your financial objectives and reaching them
 Bulletproofing your investing
You may not have a formal investment plan, but you probably do some
financial planning, even if it’s only noting the bills that need to be paid
on the back of your paycheck envelope. However, if you want to be a success-
ful online investor, you need to do a little more homework to get your finan-
cial ducks in a row.
This chapter shows you how to make your money work as hard as you do. I
explain what you need to do before you begin investing, as well as how the
Internet can help you get started. Along the way I spell out how you can
move from saver to investor, and I illustrate how you can use an online work-
sheet to determine your starting point and use an online calculator to com-
pute your personal net worth. From there, you discover how to determine
your investment objectives and figure out how much you need to earn to
meet those goals. I also provide guidelines for setting a ten-year goal and set-
ting aside emergency funds. And finally, I show you where to go online for
financial planning resources, how to determine your risk-tolerance level, and
how to start maximizing your personal wealth now.
Using the Internet to Make 
Financial Planning Easier
Many people find it difficult to shake off the notion that if they’re not wealthy,
they don’t need to do any financial planning. Stock market volatility, inflation,
changing interest rates, unemployment, illness, and hard times are part of life.
To do no financial planning or to let others (your spouse, employer, broker, or
financial advisor) do all your planning is to flirt with disaster. Remember that
no one cares more about your financial well-being than you do.

The Internet makes financial planning easier than ever before. The Web has
hundreds of online worksheets, calculators, and other tools that can easily
put you on the right track. This chapter shows how you can start maximizing
your personal wealth by
 Analyzing your current financial position: After all, you can’t get to
your financial finish line if you don’t know your starting point. The
Internet provides many online net-worth worksheets and calculators to
make this task easier.
 Finding out where your cash is going each month: Your financial well-
being doesn’t depend on how much you make; it depends on how much
you spend. If you don’t know how much you’re spending, the Internet
can help you gain an understanding of your spending habits and assist
you in creating a budget you can live with.
 Deciding your financial objectives: Do you want to purchase a house in
five years or to retire early? The Internet can help you achieve your goal
by helping you develop a workable plan.
 Building your financial base so that you can start accumulating real
wealth: This approach to investing offers a diversified system that pro-
vides financial growth and protection. Discover how you can build a
financial base to maximize your personal wealth.
The joys of compound interest
The most powerful investment returns are stable, compounded returns.
Regardless of what’s happening in the economy or stock market, you can
always count on the magic of compounding. Over time, a modest but steady
rate of compound interest can build into a sizable nest egg.
Table 3-1 provides examples of how much you need to save each month to
reach a specific financial goal. For example, assume that you need $10,000 for
your investment nest egg (retirement fund, house down-payment fund, col-
lege expenses fund, or some other large financial goal). If you save $147.05
per month for 5 years at a 5 percent rate of return, you’ll have the money you
need. The second part of Table 3-1 shows that if you put away only $139.68 a
month for 5 years at a 7 percent rate of return, you’ll have $10,000. That’s the
magic of compounding.

tools/planning and click the What Will It Take to Become A Millionaire? link
under Budgeting. Enter the required data and then click Calculate. The results
show how much you need to invest today to be a millionaire in the future.
The Internet provides many online calculators to assist you with calculating
compound interest. To use these calculators, all you need to know is the
amount you want to save, the average rate of interest you expect to receive,
frequency of compounding (monthly, weekly, and so on), and how long you
plan to save. The following Web sites can help you get started:
 AARP Webplace (www.aarp.org/financial-investsave/Articles/
a2002-10-08-compoundint.html), shown in Figure 3-1, provides 
information on types of interest and links to a variety of online interest
calculators.
 Dinkytown.net Compound Interest Calculator (www.dinkytown.net/
java/CompoundInterest.html) can show you how the different ways
in which interest is calculated affect your savings.

Moving Some of Your Savings 
to Investments
Saving and investing are different, although savings are often the source of
funds for investing. Savings are a set level of funds that you put aside regu-
larly, usually at a low interest rate. You can easily access savings, and often
they’re insured by a financial institution. 
Investment funds are the funds that you don’t have earmarked for the rent,
groceries, taxes, and so on. You place these funds in securities that can
increase or decrease in value. They may earn interest or dividends, but you
have no guarantee of increased value or future income. (Investment funds
should be free of any obligations. Good examples of investment fund sources
are inheritances, gifts, and disposable income.)
The beginning of personal wealth is the accumulation of capital that you can
use for investing. This capital often begins with savings and expands into
other types of more profitable investments. Savings are the beginning of your
capital accumulation. Families need a regular savings program that’s between
5 and 10 percent of take-home pay per month. Some people even manage to
put away 15 percent. Getting into a regular rhythm with saving is important.

Additionally, individuals and families need emergency funds. Folks with fluc-
tuating income, few job benefits, and little job security may need to have a
larger emergency fund. Families with two wage earners may need a smaller
emergency fund.
A general rule is to have three to six months of take-home pay in a savings
account (or a near-cash account similar to a market fund with check-writing
privileges) for emergencies. If you don’t have an emergency fund, you need 
to increase your savings. Payroll deduction plans that divert funds into a 
savings account or money market fund are often the most painless way to
achieve the best results. On the other hand, if you’ve been saving a surplus,
you may want to consider using these funds for investing.
Every successful investor starts with a financial plan. The plan includes clearly
stating your financial objectives, saving a certain amount of money each month,
developing investment asset allocation strategies, and so on. Here are a few
examples of Internet sites that can assist you in building your financial plan:
 Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) can help your financial planning
with online calculators, tools, and advice. Go to the home page and click
Planning. You’ll discover a step-by-step guide to retirement, estate plan-
ning, charitable giving, college, tax planning, and changing employment.
Other online planning tools include an investor profile, IRA analyzer, 
college planner, and more.
 GE Center for Financial Learning (www.financiallearning.com) pro-
vides online tutorials, articles, and tools about investing, how to develop
the right plan for your situation, and how you can become successful at
investing over time.
 Vanguard Online Planner (flagship2.vanguard.com/web/planret/
PlanningAdvicePublicOverview.html) has excellent online tools that
can assist you in creating a personal investment plan based on the infor-
mation you enter. Free of charge, Vanguard offers a five-step investment
plan to help you map out your financial strategies.
Maximizing Your Investments 
with Tax-Deferred Accounts
An individual retirement account (IRA) is one of the best ways you can accu-
mulate something to invest because making contributions and earnings is
often tax-free. An IRA must be established with a financial institution that has
received Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approval to offer IRAs. These finan-
cial institutions include banks, brokerages, federally insured credit unions,
and savings and loan associations. IRA accounts can be established at any
time. Contributions must be made by the IRA owner’s tax-filing deadline (usu-
ally April 15 of the following year). Tax-filing extensions do not apply.
51
Chapter 3: Making Your Money Work Harder

Traditional IRAs
When you invest in a Traditional IRA, you don’t have to pay taxes on the
money you earn in your account until you start withdrawing the funds during
retirement. You may also be able to deduct your annual contribution to a
Traditional IRA from your yearly income taxes. Qualifying for this benefit
depends on how much you earn.
Several rules affect withdrawals from Traditional IRAs. For example, you can’t
begin withdrawing funds without penalties until you reach 591⁄2 years of age. If
you withdraw funds before that time, you pay a hefty tax penalty. Additionally,
you must withdraw funds when you turn 701⁄2 years old (the time when you can
no longer contribute to a Traditional IRA). Keep in mind that you have to pay
taxes on the funds that you withdraw. Therefore, spreading your withdrawals
across as many years as possible before you turn 701⁄2 years old is a wise
choice. For example, if you withdraw a little at a time between the ages of 591⁄2
and 701⁄2, you can keep your taxes affordable. If you wait until you’re 701⁄2 years
old to withdraw all your funds, the tax liability is similar to paying taxes on a
large windfall or lottery win. 
Roth IRAs
Roth IRAs were created by Congress in 1997. With a Traditional IRA, earnings
accrue on a tax-deferred basis. With a Roth IRA, earnings accrue on a tax-free
basis. For most situations, a Roth IRA is a better deal for those individuals
who are eligible. 
As defined by the U.S. Congress, Table 3-2 shows the annual contribution
limits for Traditional and Roth IRAs. It’s important to note that contributions
levels are higher for individuals who are over 50 years old. This increased
contribution level was implemented to assist individuals who didn’t start
saving earlier to catch up with their wiser peers.

Roth IRA withdrawals are tax free if the account is held five or more years
and you’re 591⁄2 or older. Withdrawals also are tax-free if you become disabled,
if you’re purchasing a home for the first time, or if the account holder dies.
Roth IRA eligibility is based on adjusted gross income (AGI) and phases out
for individuals with AGIs of more than $95,000 and for couples who file joint
tax returns with combined AGIs of more than $150,000 in 2004.
Keep in mind that as long as you have earned income, you can contribute to a
Traditional IRA until you turn 701⁄2. Investors older than 701⁄2 cannot contribute
to a Traditional IRA, but can contribute to a Roth IRA. If you don’t have earned
income but are married and file a joint return, you still can contribute to an
IRA based on your working spouse’s income.

 Calcbuilder (www.calcbuilder.com/cgi-bin/calcs/IRA1.cgi)
offers an online calculator to help you determine which type of IRA
account provides you with the most retirement income.
Deciding How Much Risk You Can Take
Your investment decisions need to take into consideration your attitudes
about risk. The amount of risk you can tolerate often depends on your knowl-
edge of investments, your experience, and your personality. Each person has
his or her own style and needs. Knowing exactly what your risk-tolerance
level is can help you select investments that offer the highest return for the
investment’s level of risk.
The Internet provides many personal investment profiles — for example:
 Bank of Hawaii (www.boh.com/invtrust/invest/calculator/
index.asp) offers a seven-question worksheet to assist you in identify-
ing your investor profile and risk tolerance. (Remember, there are no
right or wrong answers.)
 Mutual of Omaha (www.mutualofomaha.com/individual_products/
investments/invprov.html) offers a short investor profile that can
assist you in learning about your risk-tolerance level.
54
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 
Why you should start now
The best argument for why you should start
investing is to do the math and compare the
results. For example, if a 25-year-old invests
about $100 a month (at a 12 percent return) until
age 65, the investment will be worth $1 million.
It’s much harder for someone older to make that
much money. To have a $1-million nest egg at
65, a 40-year-old needs to invest $600 a month
at a 12-percent return for 25 years (assuming
that all returns are reinvested and the invest-
ments escape taxes).

 Risk Tolerance Assessor (www.webcalcs.com/cgi-bin/calcs/prod/
risk.cgi?client=safecofunds) has a questionnaire that can help you
determine your personal comfort zone with regard to risk.
Determining How Much You Can Invest
Deciding how much you can invest isn’t guesswork. It requires some analysis
and setting up a budget. A budget is a blueprint that guides you through the
process of paying bills, purchasing needed items, putting money into savings,
and knowing how much you can invest. Where you can often run into problems
is not budgeting for predictable but occasional expenses. Occasional expenses
can include car repairs, annual life insurance premiums, and tuition.
Gaining a good understanding of how much money you can expect to earn
and understanding where your cash goes are the first steps to determining
how much you can invest. Make a budget using pen and paper, Internet tools,
or personal financial software such as MS Money (www.microsoft.com/
money) or Intuit’s Quicken (www.intuit.com/products_services).
Because the pen-and-paper method is too time-consuming, and personal 
software programs can be costly and difficult to learn, I recommend using
Internet tools. The Internet offers many online budgeting resources that are
free, easy to use, and quick.
Investing in Securities 
That Meet Your Goals
Investors often receive hot tips from neighbors, e-mail messages, and mes-
sage boards or chat rooms. However, studies indicate that chasing these
investments, even if the investments are top performers, rarely produces the
returns investors expect. Keep in mind that each security purchase is part of
your investment plan, which is tied to your long-term goals. Specifically, how
you choose to invest your capital (in mutual funds, stocks, bonds, Treasury
securities, money market funds, and other types of investments) depends on
the following considerations:
 Your required rate of return
 How much risk you can tolerate
 How long you can invest your capital
 Your personal tax liability
 Your need for quick access to your cash

Chapter 3: Making Your Money Work Harder

Checking Out What the 
Experts Are Doing
After factoring all the elements of this chapter into your investment plan, you
may want to find out which stocks are creating the biggest buzz on the
Internet and find out what the experts are doing. The reports that investment
analysts offer generally include
 A general description of the company and its industry: Most analysts
specialize in a certain industry or sector of the economy, and many visit
companies to see operations first-hand.
 The analyst’s thoughts about the company’s future: Wall Street analysts
are supposed to tell ordinary investors when to expect bad or good
things with a company. However, the recent dot-com crash shows how
shortsighted many experts can be.
 The target price or performance prediction for the stock in a year:
Often, different analysts make different price predictions based on their
analyses of the economy, the industry, and the firm’s capacity and past
performance.
 A recommendation to Buy, Sell, or Hold: All ranking methods aren’t the
same. Many analysts use numbers, but some companies use Buy as the
strongest recommendation. Other companies use Strong Buy as the top
recommendation. However, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), in 2000, less than 1 percent of brokerage house ana-
lysts made Sell or Strong Sell recommendations. Common sense dictates
that if you execute a security buy, you must sell a security to offset the
purchase. Therefore, due to the lack of Sell recommendations, many
investors interpret a Hold recommendation to mean Sell.
Analyzing the analysts
Research analysts influence today’s marketplace with their recommenda-
tions. Nationally televised interviews of a popular analyst’s recommendation
can temporarily cause the price of a stock to increase or decrease. These
price changes can happen even when the financial situation of the firm hasn’t
changed. Consequently, you must check out exactly who is making a recom-
mendation and what type of analyst he or she is:
 Sell-side analysts may work for the investment bank that underwrites the
securities they’re analyzing. Additionally, the firm that employs a sell-
side analyst may provide other financial services to the companies that
the analyst covers.
56
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 Buy-side analysts advise mutual fund managers, hedge fund managers,
investment advisors, and other institutional money managers who pur-
chase securities for their own accounts. As a general rule, these analysts
make money when they make good recommendations.
 Independent analysts usually aren’t associated with any brokerage or
firm that underwrites the securities they cover. They make money by
selling their recommendations in online investment columns sponsored
by large organizations or by writing newsletters that are sold on a sub-
scription basis.
Getting the opinions of others: 
Stock-picking communities
In the early days of online investing, online stock-picking communities were
overflowing with “pump and dump” schemes, wild corporate rumors, and
other nefarious activities. Now that the dot-com bubble has burst, things
have changed. Today, serious investors can frequent several Web sites if they
want to share their investment wisdom or learn about new investing strate-
gies to uncover stocks that are winners. The following are a few examples:
 ClearStation (clearstation.etrade.com) is a free investment analysis
and community Web site. ClearStation members can receive e-mailed
stock recommendations, customize and add annotations to their views
of graphs, create a Watch List, have an unlimited number of portfolios,
and participate in stock discussions. Currently, more than 200,000 mem-
bers are submitting portfolios. Find a “Clearhead” and follow his or her
trades and posts and subscribe to e-mail alerts for portfolio changes.
 Marketocracy.com (www.marketocracy.com) constantly analyzes and
ranks the stock-picking ability of its members using a complex algorithm
that incorporates long- and short-term performance, as well as an attri-
bution analysis that accounts for market, sector, style, and trading con-
tribution so that Marketocracy.com can isolate comparative returns.
Marketocracy.com believes that this process eliminates much of the per-
formance associated with “being in the right place at the right time” and
helps identify the truly best investors. Each month, Marketocracy.com
uses its ranking methodology to select 100 of its best investors. The top
100 investors are called the Master’s 100 (sometimes called the m100).
The m100 receive free premium subscriptions, posting privileges, and
invitations to special m100 retreats and can earn cash based on the
Master’s 100 fund’s management fee. Membership is free to run a virtual
fund. There are currently more than 65,000 funds.
 ValueInvestorsClub.com (www.valueinvestorsclub.com) accepts only
250 value investors. Membership is free; however, only a select few, based
on their investment ability, are allowed to post long and short investing
ideas. Applications are judged by an investment manager with one of the
57
Chapter 3: Making Your Money Work Harder

top long-term investment records in the United States. Each member, once
admitted, must post a minimum of two investment ideas per year at the
Value Investors Club site. Because the club’s goal is for members to share
only their best investment ideas, members may not submit more than six
ideas per year. A message board (open only to other club members)
allows members to post comments on each submitted investment idea.
Investment ideas are shared and discussed on a daily basis. If you want to
find out how to analyze value stocks, this site is a great starting place.
Each week, $5,000 goes to the member with the best analysis.
Judging who’s the real deal
As you study analyst reports, remember that many sources for potential con-
flicts of interests exist. In some situations, the analyst’s firm may be under-
writing the offering of the company that the analyst is covering. In investment
banking relationships, client companies of the analyst’s firm frequently prefer
favorable research reports because positive reports often attract new cus-
tomers. Other types of conflicts include the following:
 Positive analyst reports can generate brokerage commissions. In other
words, an analyst’s report indirectly helps the firm make money.
 Analysts may be pressured to release positive analyst reports.
Sometimes, an analyst’s compensation or bonuses are linked to the
number of investment deals or new investment clients the firm acquires
as a result of the analyst’s reports.
 Analysts may feel forced to release a positive analyst report to protect
their own investments. For example, an analyst may have directly
owned shares of the company’s stock before becoming the analyst for
the company. Owning shares indirectly may occur if the employer is a
significant shareholder of a company the analyst covers, and the analyst
owns shares in the employee stock ownership plan. In other words, the
well-being of the shares owned by the analyst’s employer may affect the
value of the analyst’s shares in the employee stock ownership plan.
Securities regulators require analysts to disclose certain kinds of conflicts of
interest. Usually, this information is noted at the end of written research ana-
lyst reports. For details on this issue, see Analyzing Analyst Recommendations
at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/analysts.htm.
Keep in mind that you can follow investment candidates for years cost-free.
The following are a few of the Internet’s best analyst Web sites to assist you
in starting your Wall Street research:
 BestCalls (www.bestcalls.com) helps investors conveniently track
event schedules for thousands of publicly traded companies and helps
investor relations professionals promote and disclose their investor
58
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

events. The BestCalls CallTracker service allows investors to receive
automated and personalized e-mail alerts of conference calls. Individual
investor subscriptions are $49.95 for one year or $89.95 for two years.
 Reuter’s Risk Alerts (www.investor.reuters.com) allows you to
access Reuter’s useful analyses with your free registration. On the left
side of the Web page appears the analysis of each stock, which is
divided into four sections (risk alerts, estimates, recommendations, and
research reports). If you don’t know the ticker symbol for the stock
you’re researching, you can enter the name of the company.
 StarMine (www.starmine.com) prides itself on providing independent,
objective ratings of securities analysts around the globe by measuring
their stock-picking performance and the accuracy of their earnings fore-
casts. StarMine helps professional investors extract more value from
outside research in less time by identifying the analysts that add the
most value, forecasting potential earnings surprises and shortfalls, and
alerting investors to the most important changes in analyst forecasts
and opinions. The free version of StarMine is geared toward individual
investors and rates only certain analysts.
A research analyst’s report may shine a little light on a hot investment 
candidate, or it may be flawed. Either way, investors need to check several
analytical sources and do their own research before investing. (For more
information about researching investment candidates, see Chapter 11.)
Tracking and Measuring Your Success
After selecting, analyzing, and purchasing securities, your work still isn’t
done. Managing your investment portfolio can help you squeeze every bit of
profit from your investments and realize your financial goals. You need to
find information on changing market conditions, study analytical techniques,
and update your financial plan regularly. The Internet provides many portfolio-
management tools that include all these features. (See Chapter 17 for more
details about online portfolio tracking.)
Calculating your returns or expected returns with pencil and paper is relatively
easy, assuming that no additional purchases or redemptions were made during
the period you’re calculating (other than the reinvestment of dividends, interest
payments, or capital gains distributions). To calculate your return, start with
the ending balance and subtract the beginning balance. Divide this number by
the beginning balance and then multiply by 100 to determine a percentage. This
percentage is your return. Here’s the formula:
Total Return = [(Ending Balance – Beginning Balance) ÷ Beginning
Balance] × 100
59
Chapter 3: Making Your Money Work Harder

For example, suppose that you invest $10,000 in stocks on January 1, 2002,
and on December 31, 2002, your account has a value of $12,174:
1. Start with the ending balance and deduct the beginning balance:
$12,174 – $10,000 = $2,174
2. Divide the result by the beginning balance:
$2,174 ÷ $10,000 = 0.21740
3. Multiply the result by 100:
0.2174 × 100 = 21.74
Your return is 21.74 percent.
A return of 21.74 percent in one year is pretty good (by anyone’s standard).
This rate means that for each dollar invested, you earned $0.22. To determine
whether this rate of return “beat the market,” you need to compare it to the
appropriate benchmark (a standard used for comparison). See Chapter 7 for
more information on where to find benchmarks and indices online.
Building Your Personalized 
Investment Plan
In this chapter, I discuss the beginnings of the investment process. Selecting
securities isn’t the first thing investors do; choosing investments is just one
of many elements in the process. To bulletproof your investing, you need to
complete the many tasks that I detail in this chapter. The following checklist
outlines how you can build a successful investment plan that meets your
individual needs and goals:
60
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 
Setting realistic expectations
When you start your investment program, don’t
expect to become a millionaire overnight. History
has shown that the market has many ups and
downs. However, when looking at the long 
term (five years or more), investors have been
rewarded for their patience. Additionally, riskier
investments held over the long term provide
higher rewards than low-risk investments. As you
can see from the following statistics, less risk
equals less return. For example, the 73-year aver-
age annual return (1926 to 1998) for U.S. Treasury
bills was 5.7 percent, the return for long-term cor-
porate bonds was 5.7 percent, and the return on
the S&P 500 Index was 11.2 percent.

 Determine where you stand. Gain a good understanding of what your
financial commitments are now and in the future. Make certain that you
have an emergency fund and a savings plan.
 Clearly state your financial goals. How much do you need? When do
you need it? How much risk can you tolerate? If you lost the principal of
an investment, could you mentally recover and invest again?
 Determine the appropriate allocation of your personal assets for your
age (young adult, middle-aged, retiree, and so on). Develop a regular
investing program and stick to it regardless of market volatility.
 Select the investments that meet your financial goals and risk-tolerance
level. How much time do you have (in years) to invest? Should you be 
an active trader and invest often during the day or a passive investor 
with a buy-and-hold policy? (See Chapter 4 for details on answering such
questions.)
 Analyze your investment candidates. Before you call your online
broker, make certain that you can tell a child in two minutes or less why
you want to own a particular investment. Determine how long you plan
to hold the security and decide at what price you will sell (and take your
profits or cut your losses).
 Select an online broker that suits your needs. Avoid mutual fund loads
(a sales charge added to the purchase or sale of a mutual fund) and high
fees. Use automatic investment plans, dividend reinvestment programs,
investment clubs, and other programs to reduce brokerage commissions.
(See Chapter 7 for more information.)
 Monitor your portfolio and reevaluate your goals on a regular basis.
Rank the performance of your investments and make the appropriate
changes. You can expect that changes in general market conditions, new
products that are introduced, and new technology will change how
established businesses operate. Use this information to gain an under-
standing of when to hold and when to fold.

I
n this chapter, I discuss different types of brokerages and provide helpful
insights about determining what category of brokerage is best for you.
Traditional brokerages are generally used by investors who are seeking recom-
mendations, advice, personalized service, help with calculating taxes, access
to IPOs (initial public offerings), and assistance for other more complex types
of financial transactions. Premium online brokerages are a hybrid of the tradi-
tional brokerage and an electronic brokerage, where they offer referral services
to qualified financial advisors, and branch offices, and investors can meet face-
to-face with representatives to discuss some aspect of their portfolios. Discount
online brokerages are designed for the “do-it-yourselfers” who desire barebone
brokerages and want to take command of their finances.
I then continue with a discussion of how all premium and discount online
brokerages aren’t equal. Some online brokerages are better suited for the
needs of certain types of investors than others. Next, I explore how to check
out prospective brokers and show you where to get trading services for less.
I provide a list of where to get on the Internet to see the latest ratings of
online brokerages, and I conclude with easy-to-understand instructions about
how you can open your trading account online in 15 minutes or by mail in
two to three weeks.

Is a Traditional Broker Best for You?
According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project (www.pewinternet.
org), one out of every ten Internet users has bought or sold stocks online.
Specifically, a recent study indicates that since September 2002, about 12 per-
cent of all Internet users have bought or sold stocks online. This represents a
40 percent growth from 10 million Americans who reported they had com-
pleted online stock trades as of March 2000 to 14 million Americans who
reported completing stock trades as of September 2002. The downturn of the
stock market in recent years has likely had an impact on the conservative
growth of online trading. In other words, the growth of online investing was
likely dampened by low (or in some cases nonexistent) stock returns.
Investors who don’t use the Internet generally want professional, customized
advice; they’re looking for a brokerage that provides excellent recommenda-
tions and has the ability to handle complex financial services for real estate
assets or investments in private companies or partnerships. In other words,
these investors want a traditional broker that makes his or her living by being
a financial consultant and knowing an investor’s risk-tolerance level. Following
are some of the offerings you can expect to find in a traditional brokerage:
 Recommendations and advice: Broker advice is supposed to be unbi-
ased and geared toward your best interests. However, brokers make
money from sales commissions, so the more you buy or sell, the 
more money they make.
 Quality service: The quality of service for both large and small account
holders can be the same. In other words, both types of customers can
get red carpet treatment or, in some cases, can be quickly forgotten.
 Help with calculating your taxes: As a value-added service, some tradi-
tional brokers will determine the amount of taxes owed by the investor.
 First choice in IPO offerings: Traditional brokerages can let their cus-
tomers know about new initial public offerings (IPOs) so that customers
can get in on the ground floor (the first stage) of a potential investment
opportunity.
 Access to other investment options: Many affluent investors need help
managing their real estate assets and investments in private companies
or partnerships.
 A little peace of mind: Traditional brokers are paid to watch for changes
in the market so that you don’t have to. Additionally, if something goes
wrong, the investor can always blame it on a bad broker recommendation.
 Branch offices: Some investors need to visit their brokers face to face 
to feel comfortable. Having a branch office in the neighborhood can
encourage investor trust.

Selecting a Premium Online Brokerage
In December 2001, there were 19.7 million active online investor accounts, a
slight increase from 2000. During the peak of the market in March 2000, there
were 12 to 15 million online brokerage accounts, and about a third of all trad-
ing on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ systems was attributed to
online investors. Since that time, according to Gomez (www.gomez.com), an
Internet research company, trading volume has plunged 40 percent, but
online brokerages are still going strong.
Traditional brokers don’t require their clients to be computer savvy or to go
online. However, as the Internet matures and online investing technology
improves, traditional brokers have noted that more and more clients are
drifting toward the Internet to make an occasional trade. Some traditional
brokerages note that they have more customers using the Web-based part of
the business than the traditional offline side of the brokerage. In other words,
the distinction between online and offline is getting smaller and smaller. To
illustrate this point, I include the following as a few examples of premium
online brokerages:
 Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) offers Schwab AdvisorSource. If your
portfolio is over $100,000, Schwab will assist you in finding an advisor to
analyze your present financial situation and aid you in determining how 
to construct your financial future. Services include 72 branch offices for
one-on-one visits with a broker.
 Fidelity (www.fidelity.com) offers Fidelity representatives who are
happy to review your personal investment goals and objectives and to
assist you with any Fidelity investments or related financial services.
 Merrill Lynch Direct (www.mldirect.ml.com) is a leading worldwide
financial management and advisory company with offices in 35 countries
and total client assets of about $1.5 trillion. In the United States, investors

Getting a little help from an online brokerage
Some investors are uncomfortable with online
investing. For these individuals, a hybrid solution
may be the answer: trading with a premium offline
broker but getting personalized advice online. For
example, A. G. Edwards (www.agedwards.com)
has more than 7,200 financial consultants and
offers AGe-connect, a free online service for A.G.
Edwards customers. AGe-connect is customized
to meet each client’s needs based on his or her
investing profile and interests. Some of the 
features offered include account information,
real-time quotes, news headlines, financial-
planning tools, interactive charts, research, and
account data downloads (which can be imported
into personal-finance software, such as Quicken
or MS Money).

can visit any one of Merrill Lynch’s over 600 branches to talk with a
broker about their accounts.
 TD Waterhouse (www.waterhouse.com) provides AdvisorDirect to 
customers who have portfolios of $100,000 or more. This is a free 
referral service to qualified independent financial advisors. The initial,
no-obligation meeting is free. Advisors typically charge an annual fee
based on the percentage of the assets under management.
Many premium online brokerages are reaching out to their customers by
offering free referral services to independent financial advisors. This addi-
tional service is designed to assist more affluent customers in realigning their
portfolios to achieve their goals, managing their investments or inheritances,
and planning for retirement, college savings, or other goals.
Selecting the Right Discount 
Online Brokerage
As a general rule, online investors who use discount brokerages aren’t seek-
ing the advice of a traditional broker they’ve known for the last ten years.
Most online investors want brokerages that are stable, provide excellent cus-
tomer service, and offer different types of choices. The following list shows
some of the criteria that investors use to judge discount online brokerages:
 Ease of use: All online investors want their Web-based brokerages to be
easy to use. Web sites need to be uncluttered and free of slow-to-down-
load graphics and useless tools.
 Prompt customer service: When online investors telephone customer 
service, being on hold for several minutes is unacceptable. Online investors
with large portfolios want more sophisticated financial services and advice.
Many are willing to meet with financial advisors for that human touch.
 Reliable responsiveness: System-wide brokerage crashes aren’t accept-
able. Quick and accurate trade executions are important for all investors.
 Investing options, products, and tools: Online access to IPO information,
options, and other financial products is a must. Many online investors
expect research, real-time quotes, and other market information.
 Low fees: Hidden costs are often associated with online brokerages.
These hidden costs can quickly wipe out your profits. Consequently, you
need to read the fine print before signing up for a new account.

Investigating a Brokerage 
Before You Invest
The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) provides account protec-
tion for brokerage accounts in a way that’s similar to how the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures bank accounts. Each customer’s account
is protected up to $500,000, and some brokerages have additional insurance. If
your brokerage firm goes belly-up, you’re covered. However, if you make poor
investment selections, you can lose all your money.
As an investor, you’re wise to look into the background of a brokerage firm
before investing. The Central Registration Depository (CRD) — a registration
and licensing database used by regulators throughout the securities industry
to collect data about securities firms and their brokers — is available at your
state securities agency or the National Association of Securities Dealers
(www.nasdr.com/2000.htm). Additionally, each month, the New York Stock
Exchange releases a disciplinary action list at www.nyse.com. At the home
page, search “disciplinary actions” to zero in on the names of brokers, years,
and types of actions taken by the Exchange Hearing Panel.
You can check several sources to find out whether the broker you’re consid-
ering is registered. The National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation
Web site (www.nasdr.com) has investor services that enable you to request
background information about your broker through NASD Regulation’s Public
Disclosure Program (called the NASDBrokerCheck). Your state securities 
regulator can tell you whether the broker you’re considering is registered,
and some state securities commissions provide cautionary lists at their Web
sites — for an example, see the Oklahoma Securities Commission site at www.
securities.state.ok.us.
Matching Your Needs to the 
Right Online Brokerage 
Since their inception, online brokerages have continued to evolve to meet the
demands of customers by improving the quality and reliability of online serv-
ices. Recently, many online discount brokerages added more online research,
providing consumers with access to a wider range of financial products. This
evolution means that some online discount brokerages are better in some
areas than in others. Therefore, considering what types of brokerages best
meet your investor type is important.

Chapter 4: Selecting an Online Broker That’s Right for You

For beginners
Some uncertain newcomers simply want to experience online investing for
themselves. Many beginning investors are uncertain about their investment
goals and which types of financial instruments are best for their unique needs.
These novice investors or beginning online investors frequently want low ini-
tial minimum balances and fees. Beginning investors require lots of offline and
online customer help and easy-to-use Web site navigation. The following are a
few examples of online brokerages that are especially helpful to beginning
investors:
 Ameritrade (www.ameritrade.com), shown in Figure 4-1, requires
$2,000 to open a trading account and $1,000 to open an IRA account.
Market and limit orders are $10.99. Ameritrade offers a trading demo
and investor education center called Investor Basics. Expect to pay a
$15 maintenance fee every quarter.
Note: Market orders are instructions for the broker to immediately 
buy or sell a security for the best available price. Limit orders are trading
orders that specify a certain price at which the broker is to execute 
the order. For more information, see Chapter 5.
 Harrisdirect (www.harrisdirect.com) is ideal for beginning online
investors because it doesn’t require any initial minimum deposit for trad-
ing or IRA accounts. The more you trade, the lower the cost of each trade.
For example, 1 to 17 market or limit orders cost $19.95, 18 to 59 trades
cost $14.95, and 60 or more trades cost $9.95. The brokerage offers access
to a wide variety of research resources. (Investors with $100,000 or more
have direct access to IPOs.) Customers can place trades via the Internet,
telephone, or wireless devices in addition to proprietary software.
 E*TRADE (www.etrade.com) is one of the top-ranked online brokerages.
You need $1,000 for the initial deposit. Market trades are $14.95 per trade
for up to 1,000 shares. Customers have unlimited access to IPO informa-
tion, real-time quotes, charts, baseline reports, market news, and more.
For mainstream investors
Mainstream investors are often defined as investors who make between 2 and
20 trades per year and have portfolios valued at between $25,000 and $75,000.
Mainstream investors frequently want an online brokerage that is easy to use
and has human customer assistance. Additionally, mainstream investors want
to be able to get to their money when and how they want it. Mainstream
investors aren’t frequently concerned about the split-second timing of trade
executions. Additionally, they’re often well-versed in finding other sources and
tools for financial data. The following sites are good for the mainstream
investor:
68
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 Ameritrade (www.ameritrade.com) provides great tools for monitor-
ing your portfolio and analyzing your next investment move. Many
people find this site easy to use and reliable when they need to make a
transaction.
 Ameritrade (www.ameritrade.com) provides great tools for monitoring
your portfolio and analyzing your next investment move. Reliable and
easy to use, Ameritrade can be counted on when you need to make a
transaction.
 Fidelity (www.fidelity.com) provides a newly updated, easy-to-use Web
site. Customer service is generally prompt and courteous. On the whole
(and thanks to Fidelity’s background in banking and finance), customers
can easily access their cash in any number of ways and without any diffi-
culty. The initial deposit to open an account is $2,500.
 Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) proved its worth to me when I was
in Europe and needed to transfer funds from one account to another.
The transaction was quick and error-free. Schwab recently lowered the
costs of its trades to $9.95 with 30 trades per quarter or a household bal-
ance of $1,000,000. The initial deposit to open an account is $10,000.
 TD Waterhouse (www.waterhouse.com) is ideal for investors who make
fewer than 20 trades per year. Customers have online access to IPO
information and proprietary research from Goldman, Sachs & Company,
a leading investment bank. The initial deposit is $1,000.

For active investors
Active investors are often defined as investors who make between five and ten
trades per week. These individuals may want to use brokerages that cater to
this type of consumer by providing special software, information streams,
and commission rates. Overall, active investors want responsive brokerages
with fast and cheap trading fees. These individuals frequently don’t care
about extensive products, tools, or customer service features. As a general
rule, the active investor wants an easy-to-use Web site that allows him or her
to navigate easily and make a split-second trade, such as the following:
 A.B. Watley (www.abwatley.com) offers NASDAQ Level II quotes (detailed
real-time quotes of the bid and ask prices for each individual market
maker), standard real-time quotes, and trades from $10. The initial deposit
is $35,000. Minimum monthly balance is $2,000 with a monthly mainte-
nance fee of $50. Investors are required to have an annual income of
$50,000 and a net worth of $150,000. The more frequently you trade, the
lower the cost for each trade. For example, you’ll pay $15.59 for up to your
first 49 trades per month, compared to $9.95 for 250 to 499 trades per
month.
 Ameritrade (www.ameritrade.com) charges $10.99 for market orders
and limit orders. The Ameritrade system is responsive and all trades are
quickly executed.
 BrownCo (www.brownco.com) offers inexpensive $5 market and limit
order trades but requires a $15,000 initial deposit and five years of
investing experience to open a trading account.
 Scottrade (www.scottrade.com) is a recipient of the J.D. Power &
Associates award for investor satisfaction with online trading services.
Scottrade offers trades that cost $7. You don’t pay any maintenance fees,
and you need only $500 to open a trading account. Additionally, you
don’t need a trading account (but you still have to register) to receive
free real-time streaming quotes and charts.
For affluent investors
Affluent investors often want lots of products and tools. Affluent investors fre-
quently use the Internet to monitor the performance of their portfolios, and
they expect proprietary customer service in the form of special, knowledge-
able customer service representatives. In some situations, wealthy investors
expect reduced margin rates. For these investors, system responsiveness and
easy Web site navigation aren’t issues. The following sites offer the features
that affluent investors are looking for:
70
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 Fidelity (www.fidelity.com) provides many online products and tools.
The site was recently revamped, and investors can now quickly find
what they want by clicking tabs at the top of a Web page. Affluent
investors can personalize the Web site and easily navigate to areas that
interest them the most. Clients are divided into three categories: bronze
($19.95 per trade), silver ($14.95 per trade for 36 trades per year and
$30,000 in assets, or $100,000 in assets, or 72+ trades per year), and gold
($8.00 per trade for 120+ trades per year and $30,000 in assets or
$1,000,000 in assets).
 Merrill Lynch Direct (www.mldirect.ml.com) provides a wide range of
customer services. Here you find proprietary research, portfolio monitor-
ing, online trades, cash management accounts, and so on. You can even
visit a branch office to discuss your account. Minimum initial deposit is
$2,000 for a trading account and $250 minimum deposit to open a retire-
ment account. Online trades of up to 1,000 shares are $29.95 each.
 Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) provides easy-to-understand online
tools and products. Knowledgeable personnel quickly answer telephone
calls and refer clients to customer service representatives and others.
Premium services, such as access to prescreened financial advisors, and
high-level research are available for investors with portfolios of $100,000
or more.
You can easily locate a broker via the World Wide Web. For a good alphabeti-
cal list of licensed brokers, see Yahoo! at dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_

Chapter 4: Selecting an Online Broker That’s Right for You
Which broker is best for you?
In the section “Matching Your Needs to the Right
Online Brokerage,” I discuss how each individual
investor has different needs, wants, and desires.
Some investors want quick response times, low
costs, and easy-to-navigate Web sites. Other
investors want lots of products, tools, and high-
quality customer service. The Internet offers many
tools for helping you select a broker. One of the
best is at SmartMoney at www.smartmoney.
com/brokers/yourselfer/index.cfm?
story=. This tool ranks characteristics — such
as quality of service, costs, access to mutual
funds, and so on — to help you determine which
online brokerage best suits your individual needs.

Getting Online Trading Services for Less
As I mention at the beginning of this chapter, no two brokerages are alike.
Individual brokerages may change their services and fees to keep pace with
their competitors. To find the online broker that best meets your needs,
you must investigate the prices, services, and features that various brokers
offer.
Make certain that your brokerage doesn’t charge you for services that are
free elsewhere. For example, suppose that an online brokerage charges a flat
fee of $15 for your trade. If the brokerage adds a postage and handling fee of
$4 for your transaction, your transaction actually costs $19. That’s 27 percent
higher than you expected. Other hidden fees may include
 Higher fees for accepting odd-lot orders (orders of less than 100 shares)
 Higher fees for certain types of orders (see Chapter 5)
 Fees for sending certificates (some firms charge $50 per certificate)
 Fees to close your account
 Fees to withdraw funds from your trading account
Table 4-1 illustrates some of the fees that you can expect to find with different
brokerages. Keep in mind that brokerages are very competitive and are con-
stantly changing their fee structures.

Trading online for $15 or less
The rapid growth of the Internet, technological advances, and more brokerage
evolution has led to low commissions for online trading. Generally, all Internet
brokers can handle any type of basic transaction with minimal human contact,
which lowers the cost of doing business and permits low commissions. Many
reputable online brokerages can complete your trade for $15 or less. Table 4-2
lists several brokerages that offer low-cost online trading.

Finding online brokers with no or 
low initial account minimums
One of the things that many investors may find prohibitive about online trad-
ing is the initial minimum deposit required for opening a cash account. This
requirement means that the broker already has your money when you request
a trade. However, this requirement is changing, just like everything else on the
Internet. Table 4-3 lists several online brokerages that offer cash accounts
with no minimum deposit or a low minimum deposit.

Commission structures change radically from firm to firm. One reason for
this wide range is that some Internet brokers include special or additional
features. When deciding which broker is best for you, factoring in some or all
of the features that I list in this section is probably wise. First, consider
whether each broker offers the following features in your cash account:
 Low minimum amount required to open an account
 Low monthly fees with minimum equity balance
 No additional charges for postage and handling
 A summary of cash balances
 A summary of order status
 A summary of your portfolio’s value
 A historical review of your trading activities
 No charges for retirement account maintenance
When comparing brokers, consider whether each broker offers the following
account features:
 Unlimited check-writing privileges
 Dividend collection and reinvestment
 Debit cards for ATM access
 Interest earned on cash balances
 Wire transfers accepted
 No IRA inactivity fees
You should ascertain which of the following types of investments the broker
enables you to trade:
75
Chapter 4: Selecting an Online Broker That’s Right for You

 Stocks (foreign or domestic)
 Options
 Bonds (corporate or agency)
 Treasury securities
 Zero-coupon bonds
 Certificates of deposit
 Precious metals
 Mutual funds
 Unit investment trusts
You need to determine whether the brokerage offers the following analytical
and research features:
 Real-time online quotes
 Reports on insider trading
 Economic forecasts
 Company profiles and breaking news
 Earnings forecasts
 End-of-the-day prices automatically sent to you
Adding new features to Web sites is a routine occurrence in the online broker-
age world, as are changes in the online brokerage’s internal database for
better and more personalized reporting. Therefore, even though an online
brokerage doesn’t have all the features you desire, that brokerage may offer
the missing items in the near future. For example, you probably won’t need to
contact customer service very often, but when you do, you want excellent
service. Frequently, this service means being able to talk immediately with a
sales representative. In response to this need, many online brokerages now
offer a Chat button. Click the button and a chat window opens in which you
can talk directly with a sales representative. E*TRADE (www.etrade.com) is
one example of an online brokerage that offers this feature, and many other
online brokerages are considering adding this feature to their Web sites.
Rating Online Brokers
Online brokerage rankings are often based on the trade execution process,
ease of use, customer confidence, on-site resources, relationship services,
commissions, and overall costs. The following Web sites offer ratings that can
help you determine which online brokerage meets your needs:
76
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 Consumer Search (www.consumersearch.com/www/personal_finance/
online_brokers/reviews.html) offers free reviews of online brokers
based on articles written by others. Some of the articles used for ratings
offered by Consumer Search are more than four years old. 
 Kiplinger.com Rates Online Brokerages (www.kiplinger.com) pre-
sents an October 2004 survey of the best online stock brokers, with
rankings for asset values, commissions, execution times, mutual fund
programs, broker research, and tax information. (This article is from the
Kiplinger archive and costs $2.95.) 
 SmartMoney.com (smartmoney.com/brokers/index.cfm?story=
2004-intro) provides free brokerage ratings. Brokerages are divided
into full-service, premium online discount, and discount brokerages. The
July 2004 comparison articles and tables are easy to read. 
Don’t assume that you always get what you pay for. The Keynote Web Broker
Trading Index (www.keynote.com/solutions/performance_indices/
broker_index/broker_trading.html) illustrates the average response
times and success rates for creating a standard stock-order transaction on
selected brokerage Web sites. The sites that appear in the Index were
selected based on publicly available market-share information published in
The Wall Street Journal and other reliable industry sources. Using the Keynote
Web Broker Trading Index, you can easily see that some high-priced online
brokerages aren’t as fast or as reliable as their lower-priced competitors.
Checking Out Hybrid Online 
Banks and Brokerages
The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 allowed banks and broker-
ages to offer a full menu of financial products and services. This deregulation,
among other things, means that your brokerage can offer you the same prod-
ucts and services as your bank, including having your accounts insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Combining your bank and bro-
kerage can reduce the amount of fees you have to pay and the time you spend
online monitoring your accounts. Kiplinger’s (www.kiplinger.com) has
coined a new name for these combination entities — bankerages. Bankerages
offer asset management accounts that combine your banking accounts and
brokerage accounts. You receive a monthly statement that reflects all the
activities of your bankerage accounts (which can even include an equity line
of credit with your bankerage). 
Banking with your brokerage has many advantages. For example, you can
easily transfer money from your brokerage account to your banking account,
savings, or money market fund. (I talk more about money market funds in
Chapters 6 and 12.) When it’s tax time, all the information you need is in one
easy-to-find location. 
77
Chapter 4: Selecting an Online Broker That’s Right for You

Another advantage of having all your financial asset information at one loca-
tion is that you don’t have to visit Web sites that are scattered around the
Internet to determine the status of your portfolio. The following lists several
of the attributes you should look at when evaluating a bankerage: 
 Account aggregation: This trait enables you to see simultaneously all
the different types of investments and accounts you have with one finan-
cial institution.
 Low brokerage charges: Some bankerages offer low-cost commissions
for sales personnel. Mutual fund management and brokerage fees
charged by bankerages are also low.
 Wide range of services: Some bankerages offer incredible amounts of
high-quality research. Other online bankerages provide cost-basis infor-
mation so that you can easily determine your taxable gains or losses.
 Bill-payment services: Some online bankerages provide free bill-payment
services. (For more about online bill-payment services, see Chapter 17.)
 Low banking fees: Banking fees charged by bankerages can vary widely.
Some online bankerages offer free or low-fee ATM costs. Some banker-
ages have sweep account programs that automatically transfer funds
above (or below) a certain amount to higher-interest-earning accounts
at the close of each business day.
 Good rates: Some bankerages offer higher yields on certificates of
deposit (CDs) than others. Additionally, some bankerages offer higher
rates on interest-bearing checking accounts than others.
The following are a few examples of bankerages:
 Fidelity (www.fidelity.com) states that applying online takes approxi-
mately 10 to 15 minutes. If necessary, you can save your application and
return within 30 days to complete it. Fidelity is a winner when it comes
to low banking fees, low brokerage fees for index mutual funds, and
research.
 NetBank (www.netbank.com) offers an online application. If you don’t
like online applications, you can always download its paper application.
Applicants need a U.S. Social Security number to apply for an account.
 Citibank (www.citibank.com) requirements to open an account include
U.S. citizenship with a U.S. address, a driver’s license or state ID, and a
second form of identification, such as a U.S. passport, credit card, or U.S.
military ID. All applicants must be at least 18 years old and provide a
valid Social Security number, mother’s maiden name, and employment
address. If you’re not a U.S. citizen, try calling 800-374-9700.
 Wells Fargo Bank (www.wellsfargo.com) allows you greater control of
your finances with just one password. With Wells Fargo OneLook, you
can securely manage both your Wells Fargo and non–Wells Fargo
accounts. You have online access to your bill-paying services, checking,
savings, credit card, mortgage, loans, and investment accounts.

Opening Your Online Brokerage Account
Internet brokerage firms are basically cash-and-carry enterprises. They all
require investors to open an account before trading — a process that takes
from several minutes to several weeks to complete. Account minimums 
vary from $0 to $100,000.
Investors can open an account in two ways. The first method of opening an
account is online. This quick approach takes about 15 minutes. The second
way to open a trading account is by mail. This process takes about two to
three weeks to complete. All Internet brokers require that you complete an
application form that includes your name, address, Social Security number,
work history, and a personal check, certified check, or money order for the
minimum amount needed to open an account. Some brokers accept wire
transfers or securities of equal value. Your online brokerage firm will send
you the application materials to complete and return.
Individuals are eligible to open a trading account or IRA account online if
they’re U.S. citizens or residents and have a valid U.S. address, are transfer-
ring the required minimum deposit into the new trading account, and accept
the terms of the online brokerage’s account agreement. (Check the broker’s
Web site for details.)

Be wary of new account incentives
Online brokerages offer numerous incentives to
attract new investors. For many online investors,
it may appear that this is the time to move to a
broker that has more of what you’re looking for.
Some of these incentives are true bargains, while
others aren’t as straightforward as they appear.
Many brokerage incentives feature offers that
are available only for a limited time and require
that you keep a minimum balance in your trading
account that’s much higher than what you may
have anticipated. Remember to read the small
print before signing your application.

n this chapter, I show you how to make more money by using simple order
techniques. You gain an understanding of day orders, limit orders, market
orders, stop and stop-limit orders, and so on. You discover why electronic
communications networks (ECNs) have revolutionized investing.
Next, you find out where to go for extended trading hours information. You
become aware of who is an active investor and how this type is different from
a day trader. You discover how mainstream full-service and discount online
brokerages have special software that can make your PC (or Mac) into a trad-
ing cockpit, and how you can see moving charts, breaking news headlines,
and streaming quotes all on one screen. You gain an understanding of how
active investors can personalize their desktop software and how online bro-
kerages are offering more Web site personalization.
I conclude the chapter with a discussion of wireless trading. I show you
which types of devices you can use for wireless trading and what types of
brokerage restrictions or additional costs you may encounter.
Understanding the Tax Consequences 
of Trading Securities
Investors receive two types of income: ordinary income and capital gains.
Ordinary income includes dividends and interest. Capital gains (or capital
losses) are when you sell capital assets for a profit (or loss). Assets can

include stocks, bonds, and real estate. Capital gains are better than ordinary
income because: 
 You can control the timing: You don’t have to pay taxes on your gains
until you sell the asset. This delay lets you control the timing of your
gain or loss so that you can maximize your after-tax profits.
 Long-term gains get special treatment: Long-term capital gains (from
investments held over a year) are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary
income. (Short-term capital gains, on the other hand, are taxed at the
same rate as ordinary income.)
Special rates for long-term capital gains
In May 2003, new tax laws gave investors a break by lessening the tax liability
of dividends and capital gains. For investors holding assets for more than a
year, the gain on the sale is taxed at a lower rate than regular income. For
investors who are in the top four tax brackets, the long-term rate is 15 per-
cent. Lower-income investors pay capital gains of 5 percent. Dividends and
interest, in most cases, are taxed at the same rate as short-term capital gains.
The investment tax changes are effective for tax years 2003 through 2008. In
2008, the 5 percent rate drops to zero. On January 1, 2009 the previous capi-
tal gain rates are scheduled to return.
Table 5-1 illustrates how investors who hold assets for less than a year must
pay taxes on their short-term capital gains at the same rate as their income
taxes. Table 5-1 also shows you how investors who hang on to investments
for one year (or longer) can pay significantly lower tax rates. Overall, Table
5-1 shows how taking taxes into consideration can dramatically enhance your
after-tax investment returns.

*ST= Short-term capital gains / LT= Long-term capital gains
Measuring capital gains
A capital gain is the difference between the amount realized in the sale and
your basis in the asset you sold. Your basis is based on your cost (usually 
the purchase price plus the brokerage commission) but can be adjusted as 
a result of different events. For example, if your stock splits while you own it,
the basis splits, too. (Most brokerage statements and online portfolio track-
ing programs can take care of the math for you.)
Example: You buy 100 shares of ABC at $35, paying $3,500 plus a broker-
age commission of $15. Your basis is $3,515. Later, you sell when the
stock is at $39. You receive $3,900 minus a brokerage commission of $15,
so your amount realized is $3,885. Your capital gain is $3,885 minus
$3,515, or $370.
Note: If your basis is greater than the amount realized, you have a capital
loss.
What about capital losses?
Uncle Sam gives investors a break by allowing them to deduct up to $3,000 
in net capital losses each year using the Form 1040 Schedule D. (If married
and filing separately, the deduction limit is $1,500.) This tax break can be
used to counterbalance capital gains. If you have no capital gains (or if the
capital losses are larger than the capital gains), you can deduct the capital
loss against your other income. If you lose more than $3,000 in any one year,
you can carry over your losses into the next year.
 Net short-term loss, no long-term action: You can deduct up to $3,000 
of the loss against ordinary income. If the loss exceeds $3,000, you can
83
Chapter 5: Getting Ahold of Trading Online

carry over the excess to the next year. Note: The carry-over is still con-
sidered a short-term loss. 
 No short-term action, long-term loss: You can deduct up to $3,000 of the
loss against ordinary income. If the loss exceeds $3,000, you can carry
over the excess to the next year. Note: The carryover is considered a
long-term loss.
 Net short-term loss, net long-term loss: You can deduct up to $3,000 of
the loss against ordinary income. The $3,000 deduction is applied against
your net short-term losses first. If you have an unused deduction amount,
the deduction carries over to the next year as a short-term loss. Any
unused long-term loss carries over to next year as a long-term loss. 
 Net short-term loss, net long-term gain: If the long-term gain exceeds the
short-term loss, then the gain is considered a long-term gain and taxed at
a favorable rate. For example, if you had a net short-term loss of $2,000
and a net long-term gain of $2,200, you would pay the long-term capital
gains tax rate on $200. On the other hand, if the short-term loss exceeds
the net long-term gain, the overall loss is considered short-term. This
allows you to deduct up to $3,000 against other income and to carry over
the excess to the next year. 
 Net short-term gain, net long-term loss: If the short-term gain is greater
than the long-term loss, the net gains is considered a short-term gain and
taxed at your ordinary income rate. If the net long-term loss is greater
than the short-term gain, the loss is considered long-term, and you’re
allowed to deduct up to $3,000 against other income and to carry over
any excess to the next year. 
The best time to take a capital loss is in a year with short-term capital gains
or no gains. This timing saves you having to pay taxes at your full ordinary
rate.
Increasing Profits with Simple Order
Specification Techniques
Traditional brokers recommend the order specifications for your stock trans-
actions and confirm that your transactions were completed. (An order is a
request to buy or sell a specified amount of a certain security or commodity
at a specified price or at the market price.) Specifying security execution
orders is one of the expert services that brokers use to justify their fees.
Order specifications define how your request is completed. One type of order
specification is called a day order. Day orders are good only on the day you
place the order.
84
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

Another type of order is the Good Till Canceled (GTC) order. The GTC order 
is open until it’s executed or canceled. For example, an investor wants to 
buy a certain company’s shares, but not until the shares are a few dollars
cheaper. The investor specifies a GTC order and determines when the order
will expire. If the company’s shares reach the predetermined limit (today,
tomorrow, next year, or next decade), the order is filled.
Trading online means that you’re now in charge of specifying your stock order.
Knowing how to designate the terms of your order can increase your chances
of execution at the price you want. As you look over your online order form,
you’ll notice different ways of specifying how the order should be executed. 
In the past, your traditional broker decided which approach was best. With
online trading, you select the method you feel is best.
Here are four of the more popular ways to specify your stock order:
 Limit orders: Orders in which buyers or sellers specify the price at which
they’re willing to buy or sell. For sell orders, the limit specified is the mini-
mum price at which the investor is willing to sell. For buy orders, the limit
is the maximum price that the investor is willing to pay.
 Market orders: Any order (buy or sell) to be executed immediately at
the best price available. In other words, the investor wants to buy or 
sell a stated number of shares at the best price at the time the order 
is placed.
 Stop orders: An order to buy at a price above or sell at a price below 
the current market. This type of order gives investors more control than
a market order, which buys or sells a security at any price. Stop orders
limit the investor’s loss (or locks in the investor’s profit).
 Stop-limit orders: After a security reaches the investor’s predetermined
price, the order is activated. The order can be executed only at the set
price or better, so the order may not be completed.
You may want to use a limit order when purchasing or selling odd lots (less
than 100 shares of any one stock). This type of order can increase your
chances of getting filled at your price. Odd lots rarely get the best price
because they must be bundled with other orders.
The Investing Online Resource Center offers many resources for beginning
online investors. One of my favorites is the handy online trading simulation
at www.investingonline.org/isc/index.html. This simulation is a ter-
rific risk-free way to find out what it’s like to invest online.

ECNs — It’s Not Your Grandfather’s
Market Anymore
Recent changes in SEC regulations and technology have transformed how
investors interact with the stock market. I explain these changes in the fol-
lowing sections, and I show you how these changes enable online investors
to make more money on their investments. In the following sections, you gain
an understanding of what happens after you click your mouse button to exe-
cute an online trade. You also discover how you can avoid hidden transaction
costs by using an electronic communications network (ECN) and how you
benefit from ECNs even if you never use one.
How ECNs work
In 1988, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began requiring
NASDAQ market makers to accept buy and sell orders of up to 1,000 shares
via an automated small-order execution system (SOES). This requirement
opened the door for the so-called “SOES bandits,” who later became known
as day traders. It also led to the development of the first electronic communi-
cations networks (ECNs), and in January 1997, the SEC approved the first
four ECNs. Today, nine ECNs exist.
Stocks are traded by specialists on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and
by market makers in the NASDAQ market. For example, the NASDAQ requires
at least two market makers for each listed stock. This requirement creates a
market in which the stock is bought and sold. On ECNs, computers replace
specialists and market makers. Anyone can purchase NASDAQ-traded equities
through a brokerage that uses an ECN. Investors buy stock through an online
broker, and if the broker’s computer finds a seller in an ECN, the investor’s
order is executed with no human intervention. (And because computers never
sleep, ECNs open the way for after-hours trading.)
To gain some insight into how ECNs work, compare how investors purchase
equities on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and ECNs.
Buying stock on the NYSE involves the following steps:
1. The broker sends a buy order to a specialist on the exchange floor.
2. The specialist looks for sellers on the trading floor or in an electronic
order book.
86
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

3. If the specialist finds enough sellers to match the offer price, the spe-
cialist completes the transaction.
Here are the steps for buying stock on the NASDAQ:
1. The broker consults a trading screen that lists how many shares vari-
ous market makers are offering to sell and at what price.
2. The broker picks the best price and sends an electronic message to
the market maker, who must sell the shares.
In contrast, buying stock on an ECN involves these steps:
1. The broker sends a buy order to an ECN.
2. The computer looks for matching sell orders on the ECN.
3. If the computer finds enough sellers to complete the trade, the trans-
action is executed. Otherwise, the order isn’t executed.
Understanding inside spreads
One of the first steps in understanding trading is to define the players. What
day traders really focus on are the activities of market makers. A market
maker represents an institution (such as Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch &
Co., Prudential Securities, and so on) that wants to make a market in a partic-
ular NASDAQ stock. The market maker is a specialist on an exchange or a
dealer in the over-the-counter market who buys and sells stocks, creating an
inventory for temporary holding. The market maker provides liquidity by
buying and selling at any time. However, the market maker isn’t under any
obligation to buy or sell at a price other than the published bid and ask
prices.
The downside of being a market maker is that you’re obligated to purchase
stocks when no one wants them. The upside of being a market maker is that
you get to pocket the profits of a spread. A spread is the difference between a
bid and ask price. For example, a stock with a bid and ask price of 15 × 151⁄4
has a spread of 1⁄4. The bid price is $15, and the sell price is $15.25. By selling
1,000 shares at $15.25, the market maker profits by $250.
Spreads are often just a few cents for each stock. However, these pennies
quickly become dollars because of high trading volume. Last year, NASDAQ
market makers earned $2 billion from spreads. Day traders have sliced into
some of these profits. Recent reports indicate that market maker spreads are
down by 30 percent.
87
Chapter 5: Getting Ahold of Trading Online

The existence of several kinds of spreads has caused some confusion. The
following list defines some of these spreads:
 Dealer spread: The quote of the individual market maker. A market
maker never earns the entire spread. The market maker needs to be
competitive on either the bid or offer side of the market. The dealer is
unlikely to be at the best price (the highest price if selling and the
lowest price if buying) on both sides of the market at the same time.
 Inside spread: The highest bid and lowest offer being quoted among all
the market makers competing in a stock. Because the quote is a com-
bined quote, it’s narrower than an individual dealer quote.
 Actual spreads paid: The narrowest measure of a spread, because it’s
based on actual trade prices. The actual spread paid is calculated by
measuring actual trade prices against the inside quotes at the time of
the trade.
Extended-Hours Trading
In the past, the NASDAQ and NYSE were open from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. EST.
Today, extended trading hours are the result of ECNs handling more and more
orders than ever before. ECNs are computers that can work 24 hours a day. All
trades placed during these sessions are represented exclusively on ECNs.
ECNs aren’t isolated trading islands; rather, they’re just like any participant 
in the NASDAQ market. Most, if not all, NASDAQ market participants, includ-
ing ECNs and market makers, are linked to a system called Select Net, which
automatically reports transactions. As long as ECNs and the overall NASDAQ
market are linked to Select Net, ECNs aren’t likely to fragment or reduce 
liquidity in the market. However, extended-hours trading does have some 
limitations:
 News stories may have a greater impact on stock prices.
 Some stocks will be very liquid (easily convertible to cash) during after-
hours trading, and some will not be liquid at all.
 Investors may encounter wider spreads between bids and offers than
during traditional market hours. Stock prices may be more volatile.
 Investors may be competing against professional traders with more
information and analysis.
88
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

Sources for extended-hours 
stock information
With unprecedented access to information about securities and trading,
investors now enjoy narrower spreads, lower execution costs, and faster exe-
cution speeds. For example, the average investor can access the following
extended-hours market information:
 NASDAQ (dynamic.nasdaq.com/dynamic/afterhourma.stm) offers
information on the ten most active stocks.
 CBS MarketWatch (cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/stockresearch/
screener/afterhours.asp?siteid=mktw) offers summaries of pre-
market trading. CBS MarketWatch also provides Instinet quotes for
actively traded stocks and companies that have released important
news.
Some online brokerages provide extended-hours quotes. For example,
account holders at Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) can go to the real-
time quote box on the stock trading Web page. When you enter the ticker
symbol of the equity that you’re interested in, add the letter e to the end of
the ticker symbol. (For example, type IBMe for the extended-hours trading
price of IBM.) The price quoted will be the extended-hours price.
Join the extended-hours club
After-hours trading is one way that an online brokerage can increase revenue.
As of this writing, the following six brokerages command 80 percent of all
online trading accounts. Each of the following online brokerages, listed with
their Web sites and the name of the ECNs they use, offers extended traded
hours:
 Ameritrade (www.ameritrade.com): Island 
 E*TRADE (www.etrade.com): Archipelago
 Fidelity (www.fidelity.com): REDIBook
 Harrisdirect (www.harrisdirect.com): REDIBook
 Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com): REDIBook
Different brokerages offer different extended trading hours, trade different
securities (for example, just NASDAQ or certain securities), and have differ-
ent rules about joining the club. Table 5-2 shows the rules for several major
online brokerages.

Online Trading and the Active Investor
Today, many mainstream full-service and online brokerages offer active and
hyperactive investors special software, amenities, and low trading fees.
Active investors are often defined as individuals who place at least 36 stock,
bond, or option trades per year and have $25,000 or more in assets. Some of
the special services these investors receive are
 Multiple order-entry screens that enable active investors to send many
trades with just one click of the mouse
 Low trading fees that are often a fraction of the brokerages’ normal rates
 Access to IPO information for investors with high balances in their trad-
ing accounts
 Access to knowledgeable representatives to discuss margin buying,
short selling, complex options strategies, and day-to-day operations of
various markets
90
Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

 Customizable software that makes the active investor’s workstation fit
his or her specific needs
 Special technology, such as real-time streaming quotes and Level II
NASDAQ quotes
Most investors are familiar with Level I quotes. These quotes are the
ones we’re all comfortable with: Bid, Ask, Last trade, Volume, and so on.
Level II NASDAQ quotes provide investors with a little more information.
For active traders, this information is sometimes considered essential
because Level II NASDAQ quotes reveal the order book for a certain
NASDAQ stock. In other words, Level II NASDAQ quotes show the best
Bid and Asking price of every market participant who is publicly posting
a quote. For more about Level II NASDAQ quotes, see Investopedia.com’s
clearly written explanation of electronic trading at www.investopedia.
com/university/electronictrading/default.asp.
Active investor trading platforms
Today, individual investors have access to new desktop software that can
convert your PC into an effective trading tool. Making your workstation into a
trading pit by using active trading technology from full-service and discount
online brokerages is truly wonderful, but it can’t compete with day-trading
software that works directly with an ECN.
In other words, you aren’t able to aim a transaction at a specific ECN to gain
that extra .125 points in 10 minutes. This feature is the one day traders count
on for their livelihoods. Active trading software is designed for gains of
between 3 percent and 10 percent over several days or weeks.
The following are a few examples of what mainstream online brokerages can
offer active investors:
 Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) offers the Street Smart Pro trading
platform. The Street Smart Pro trading platform leverages CyberTrader’s
trading technology (CyberTrader is owned by Charles Schwab) and 
combines NASDAQ Level II quotes, real-time streaming news, unlimited
watch lists, and real-time, streaming, interactive charts with account
management features, risk management tools, multichannel access, and
personal support. Street Smart Pro allows you to execute your trades
through SmartEx, Schwab’s proprietary order-routing technology, with-
out having to access another trading program. Commissions are as low
as $9.95. For more information and a demo of Street Smart Pro, see www.
schwabat.com/platforms/streetsmartpro/default.aspx.

speed keys, high/low ticker, market data ticker, and real-time news. The
Power E*TRADE Trading Desk is a streamlined one-page trading console
that lets you manage multiple stock and option orders from a single
trading screen, allows you to prepare multiple orders in advance for
rapid-fire trading, lets you create watch lists with customized quote
updates, and permits you fast access to open orders account balances
and trade records. Power E*TRADE Pro is E*TRADE’s desktop software

You might be a day trader if . . .
The SEC (www.sec.gov) sees pattern day traders as investors who trade four
or more times in five business days. If day-trading activities don’t exceed 6
percent of the customer’s total trading activity for the 5-day period, the clear-
ing firm is not required to designate such accounts as pattern day traders.
The 6 percent threshold is designed to allow clearing firms to exclude from
the definition of pattern day trader those customers whose day-trading activ-
ities comprise a small percentage of their overall trading activities.
Additionally, if the firm knows or has a reasonable basis to believe that the
customer is a pattern day trader (for example, if the firm provided training 
to the customer on day trading in anticipation of the customer opening an
account), the customer must be designated as a pattern day trader immedi-
ately, instead of delaying such determination for five business days.
The benefit of being classified as a pattern day trader is lower transaction
fees. The disadvantage of this classification is the requirement for a higher
trading account balance. Pattern day traders are required to keep a minimum

Going from Hardwired 
to Wireless Trading
Many online brokerages offer wireless information to customers. Wireless
information allows customers to get the information they want, when they
want it, and where they want it. Wireless information can include
 The ability to execute trades wherever you are
 Account access to check balances and positions
 Breaking news stories
 Real-time quotes and the ability to review the day’s trading
 Notification of price triggers and alerts
 Trade confirmations or notifications
 Options assignments for keeping current
 The ability to receive margin calls
Imagine that you’re driving to work when the radio broadcasts news that a
company you’re interested in has just dropped to $35 a share. You’re on your
way to the mandatory weekly meeting but want to catch this opportunity.
You take out your personal digital assistant (PDA) and log on to your broker-
age (pull off the road first!). You get a real-time quote and set up a limit order:
If the stock falls to $33, you’ll purchase 100 shares. You execute your order
and receive a confirmation. Total transaction time: less than a minute.

Part I: Online Investing Fundamentals 

The Internet revolutionized investing in the ’90s by enabling investors to con-
nect with the markets online. The next revolution for investors is the prolifera-
tion of wireless, mobile appliances that give you instant Internet connections
from the palm of your hand, anywhere and anytime.
Today, the fastest growing categories of consumer electronics are lightweight
PC laptops, cell phones, and PDAs — all unwired devices that provide easy
Internet and e-mail access. Not only can you send and receive messages and
trade stocks while you sit in traffic or on the beach, you can also zap data
between devices without a wire. What makes this unwired world possible is
highly complex digital and analog technologies on a single chip.
The implications for investors are huge now that wireless devices are avail-
able from the major brokerage firms. You don’t have to be wired in order to
be connected to the stock market anymore! You can be a wireless investor in
many ways. Here are a few examples of online brokerages that offer wireless
trading:
 Ameritrade (www.ameritrade.com) supports Web-enabled phone or
hand-held devices. There are no extra charges or restrictions. 
 E*TRADE Financial Wireless (www.etrade.com) supports AT&T
Wireless, Cingular, Nextel Online, Print PCS, Verizon Wireless,
VoiceStream, Omnisky, and Palm.net phone systems for your Palm V or
Palm VII hand-held devices. There are no extra charges or restrictions.
 Fidelity (www.fidelity.com) offers Fidelity Anywhere, which supports
wireless devices such as Web-enabled phones and personal digital assis-
tants. There are no extra charges or restrictions.
 Harrisdirect (www.harrisdirect.com), shown in Figure 5-2, supports
Web-enabled cell phones, cell phones with text messaging, RIM two-way
pagers, and alphanumeric pagers. Harrisdirect also supports PDAs such
as PalmPilots, Handspring, and Pocket PC hand-helds. There are no
extra charges for trades and no restrictions.
 Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) has developed PocketBroker, a
wireless investing service that enables U.S. clients to access account
information or place an equity order via PalmPilot, RIM wireless hand-
held pager, and Internet-ready cellular phones. There are no additional
charges for wireless trades.
 TD Waterhouse (www.waterhouse.com) supports your Web-ready
phone or Palm- or Windows-powered Pocket PC hand-held. These prod-
ucts require wireless Internet service from a carrier or wireless Internet
provider. There are no additional fees.

his chapter provides you with all the basic online tools for identifying

fund investment, including types of funds and fees. I include information about
what makes exchange-traded and index funds more popular than ever before. 
I offer suggestions about where to find mutual fund facts and figures online. 
I also describe several online screening tools that can help you choose the
mutual fund that best meets your needs. These mutual fund screens vary from

that includes the investment criteria you feel are important.) I conclude this
chapter by discussing how you can use new online tools to compare mutual
fund costs, returns, and risks.
Mutual Fund Basics
Over the years, the stock market has outperformed any other investment.
Unlike a mutual fund, however, individual investors frequently can’t purchase 
a large number of different securities to diversify their investment risk. Buying
shares in a mutual fund solves this problem. When you invest in a mutual fund,
the diversity of the portfolio reduces the risk of losing your total investment.
Selecting the right fund may be difficult, but you can find plenty of online help.

Assume that you have $1,000 to invest in a mutual fund. With your invest-
ment, you purchase a share of the total assets in the fund. If the share price
of the fund is $10 per share, you can purchase 100 shares. The price of each
share is the net asset value (NAV). The fund manager calculates the NAV of
the mutual fund by adding up the value of the securities in the fund and
dividing by the number of outstanding shares.
The NAV increases and decreases as the market fluctuates. The SEC requires
that the NAV of each mutual fund be calculated and published for investors at
the end of each business day. Here are a few examples of online quote
servers that provide mutual fund NAV information:
 Lipper (www.lipperweb.com), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reuters, is
a global provider of mutual fund information and analysis to fund com-
panies, financial intermediaries, and media organizations. Lipper clients
manage more than 95 percent of U.S. fund assets. Lipper tracks 125,000
funds worldwide through its offices in major financial capitals in North
America, Europe, and Asia. Research mutual funds and check out the
2004 Lipper Fund Awards for investment ideas.
 CNN/Money (money.cnn.com) is affiliated with Cable News Network
(CNN) and provides links to financial sites, investment articles, market
information, and online research sources. Market information shows the
current level, amount of change, and time of the last update for the Dow
Jones Industrial Averages, NASDAQ composite, S&P 500, Russell 2000,
NYSE Composite, Dow Transports, Dow Utilities, Amex Composite, and
S&P Futures. For mutual fund data, click “Get a Quote” and then enter
the ticker symbol for your mutual fund or stock. CNNfn provides charts
and company snapshots of selected firms.
With more than 80,000 funds worldwide to choose from, selecting a mutual
fund has become a complex process — meaning that online screening tools
are more important than ever before. When you select your investment crite-
ria, you need to consider several factors:
 How long do you plan to own the mutual fund?
 How much risk to your principal can you tolerate?
 Which mutual fund category meets your personal financial objectives?
Which funds you select depends on your answers to these questions. If you
need your money in a year and can’t afford much risk because, for example,
you plan to use the money to purchase a house, you want to consider a safe,
short-term bond fund. On the other hand, if this money is your retirement
fund that you don’t plan to tap into for ten years and you can stomach some
ups and downs, you should consider a growth stock fund.
100
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

Mutual funds basically come in five flavors. Within these five categories are
many different types of funds, so you can find a mutual fund that is tailored
to your individual needs. Here’s a brief description of the major types of
mutual funds:
 Equity funds: Mutual funds that primarily include stocks of publicly
traded companies. Investing in an equity mutual fund allows investors 
to quickly create a stock portfolio that matches all their financial objec-
tives. However, a fund can specialize in many different types of compa-
nies, which can make selecting the right equity fund (or equity funds)
more difficult.
Equity funds have a higher risk than money market or bond funds, but
they also can offer the highest returns. A stock fund’s net asset value
(NAV) can rise and fall quickly over the short term, but, historically,
stocks have performed better over the long term than other types of
investments. Not all equity (stock) funds are the same. For example,
some equity funds specialize in growth or technology stocks.
 Bond funds: Mutual funds that usually invest in the debt instruments of
corporations and governments. Investors in bond funds are primarily
seeking income with some protection of principal. Frequently, the only
way an average investor has access to an expensive bond is through a
bond mutual fund.
Usually, bond funds are conservative and target the payment of dividends.
Investors can choose among several types of bond funds. Investment-
grade bond funds usually have less risk than funds with stocks, but they
aren’t risk-free. These types of bond funds are usually good investment
choices for short-, medium-, and long-term investors who desire low risk.
Investment-grade bond funds focus on current income. For more informa-
tion on bonds, see Chapter 12.
 Municipal bond funds: Mutual funds that invest in local and state gov-
ernments. The dividends of municipal bond funds are usually free from
federal taxes.
 Hybrid funds: Mutual funds that invest in both stocks and bonds. Hybrid
funds are structured to achieve predetermined objectives such as rapid
growth, matching a market benchmark, or investing in one industry. To
sum up, hybrid funds use combinations of securities to meet their invest-
ment objectives.
 Money market funds: Mutual funds that invest in the short-term debts 
of corporations and the federal government. Money market funds often
invest in Treasury bills, commercial paper, banker’s acceptances, nego-
tiable certificates of deposit (CDs), and short-term debts of U.S. govern-
ment agencies such as Ginnie Mae (www.ginniemae.gov). Money market
funds provide less return and less risk than other types of mutual funds
and are good investments for short-term investors. The principal advan-
tage of these funds is their safety. Also, if you ever need to get to your
money fast, money market funds may be the type of fund for you.
101
Chapter 6: The Keys to Successful Internet Mutual Fund Investing

Before you start screening mutual fund candidates, you need to understand
some general information: the types of funds you can choose, the fees that
mutual fund companies charge, the types of risks associated with mutual
funds, and how to read a prospectus.
Discovering the differences between 
open-end and closed-end mutual funds
An open-end mutual fund has an unlimited number of shares. You can buy
these shares through either the mutual fund company or your broker. The
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that each mutual fund
company calculate the NAV (net asset value) of each fund every day at the
close of business.
A closed-end mutual fund is a hybrid: part mutual fund and part stock. A
closed-end mutual fund is a publicly traded investment company with a 
limited number of shares. According to the Investment Company Institute
(www.ici.org), in August 2004, the combined assets of the nation’s closed-
end funds were over $232 billion. As of June 30, 2004, there were 604 
closed-end funds. 
The total of number of June 2004 closed-end funds can generally be divided
into two categories. Bond closed-end funds totaled 458, and equity closed-end
funds totaled 146. Specifically, closed fund types include closed-end stock
funds (investments in common and preferred stocks), closed-end bond funds
(investments in a range of bonds), closed-end convertible bond funds (with
portfolios of bonds that can be converted to common stocks), closed-end
single country funds (specialize in stocks from one country or geographical
region), and so on.
One of the things to keep in mind when you purchase a closed-end fund is that
the investment company doesn’t stand ready to redeem its own shares from
shareholders, and it rarely issues new shares beyond its initial offering. That’s
why it’s a closed fund. You can buy or sell these shares only through a broker
on the major stock exchanges. The value of these shares isn’t calculated by
using the NAV methodology. Instead, shares are valued by using a method sim-
ilar to bonds and are traded at either a discount or a premium. Market prices
of publicly traded closed-end mutual fund shares are published daily.
The Closed-End Fund Center, located at www.closed-endfunds.com, is spon-
sored by the national trade association of the closed-end fund industry. This
Web site offers detailed investor education, a portfolio tracker, and data
about specific closed-end funds.
102
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

Minimizing fees
Loads are the fees with which mutual fund companies compensate brokers
who sell their fund. About half of all stock and bond funds have loads; money
market funds normally don’t have loads. Loads and other fees are important
because they’re deducted from your investment returns.
Loading it on
A front-end load is the most common type of fee that mutual fund companies
charge. Investors pay this fee when they purchase shares in the mutual fund.
No additional fees are charged for redeeming or selling your mutual fund
shares. By law, front-end loads can’t be greater than 8.5 percent. Loads aver-
age 5 percent for stock funds and 4 percent for bond funds.
The less common back-end load fee is charged when you sell or redeem the
shares. Back-end fees are usually based on time, starting at 5 percent during
the first year and declining a percentage point a year — by year five, no fees
are charged. However, back-end load funds often have Rule 12b-1 fees, which
are usually the amounts charged to investors for promoting the mutual fund.
Fees range from 0.25 percent to 0.30 percent but can be as high as 1.25 per-
cent. Rule 12b-1 fees are included in the fund’s expense ratio. 
A mutual fund’s expense ratio is the proportion of assets of a mutual fund
required to pay annual operating expenses and management fees. For exam-
ple, if a fund charges an annual fee of $0.50 per $100 of net assets, the expense
ratio will be .5 percent. The expense ratio is independent of any sales fees.
(For more information on expense ratios, see the section “Analyzing Mutual
Funds” toward the end of this chapter.)
If you have to pay a sales charge for purchasing your mutual fund, deduct
this amount from your return for the year. For example, if you pay a 5 percent
sales charge for your $1,000 investment in mutual funds, the amount invested
in the fund is $950. If the fund increases by 10 percent in one year, you have 
a $1,045 investment. Your true yield is $95, or 9.5 percent (95 ÷ 1,000) — not
the full 10 percent. On the other hand, if you purchase a no-load mutual fund,
your yield is 10 percent because you don’t pay the sales fee. Your original
$1,000 investment in mutual funds is now worth $1,100, which is $55 more
than the fund with the sales fee.
Share classes
Mutual funds can also be divided into share classes. These lettered share
classes indicate the following: 
 A shares have front-end loads.
 B shares have back-end loads.
103
Chapter 6: The Keys to Successful Internet Mutual Fund Investing

 Y shares are geared for institutional investors and do not have a front-
end load.
 Z shares are targeted for employees of the mutual fund.
Rule 12b-1 marketing fees increase manager fees and aren’t related to maxi-
mizing shareholder wealth. As an investor, you need to be on the lookout for
these expenses when you read the prospectus.
Generally, funds with back-end fees are more expensive than funds with front-
end fees due to the high Rule 12b-1 fees. However, if you’re willing to hold
your investment for five years or more (which, really, you ought to, if you’re
investing in stocks), you pay no load because back-end loads usually disap-
pear after five years.
Excluding the maximum fee for front-end loads of 8.5 percent, mutual funds
can’t charge more than 7.25 percent for the life of the investment. Overall,
load fees vary from 4.0 percent to 8.5 percent of the NAV for the shares 
purchased.
What does all this fee information mean? If you purchase 300 shares at $10
per share with an 8 percent front-end fee, you’re purchasing only $2,760
worth of shares. The other $240 goes to compensate the broker who sold 
you the fund. In other words, your investment needs to increase by $240 
just to break even.
Taking it off
Some funds have no loads, which means that they have no front-end or back-
end fees. These no-load funds generally don’t have a sales force, so you have
to contact the investment company to make a purchase. Nevertheless, no-
load funds do charge service fees, proving that there’s no such thing as a free
lunch. Mutual fund companies charge annual fees for their management serv-
ices, deducting these amounts before calculating the NAV.
Annual fees for the fund managers are about 0.50 percent of the fund’s net
assets. Other service fees include legal and auditing fees, the cost of prepar-
ing and distributing annual reports and proxy statements, director’s fees, 
and transaction expenses. When added to the management fee, a fund’s total
yearly expenses can range from 0.75 to 1.25 percent of fund assets.
A Fund for You, a Fund for Me
You can choose from a wide variety of mutual fund categories. As a matter of
fact, so many types of funds are available that you’re almost guaranteed to find
a fund that is an excellent fit for your personal financial objectives. If you’re
interested in participating in the stock market, an equity mutual fund may be
just right. The following summarizes a few of the types of equity funds available:
104
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 Aggressive growth funds: Aggressive growth funds tend to be invest-
ments in small, young companies and may involve the use of options
and futures to reap greater profits. Aggressive growth funds primarily
seek increases in capital gains. If the stock market is hot, these funds
often provide the biggest returns of all mutual funds, mostly due to the
capital gains of the stocks in the funds. They typically drop the most,
though, when the market is cold. Their volatility makes them a poor
choice for the short-term investor.
 Growth and income funds: Funds in the growth and income category
target a steady return with capital growth potential. They often invest in
companies that are growing, as well as in companies that are paying high
or increasing dividends. Growth and income funds are more diverse than
growth funds because they may include bonds, which makes growth 
and income funds less risky. The diversity also means that growth and
income funds reap fewer rewards if the stock market soars and lose less
if the stock market drops.
 Growth funds: Growth funds are similar to aggressive growth funds 
but have less risk. They may invest in larger, well-established firms with
a long track record of earnings that may continue to grow faster than
average. These funds also seek stocks with capital gain potential. In
addition to stocks, these funds generally include bonds and cash equiva-
lents. Growth funds are best for investors with medium- to long-term
objectives.
 Value funds: Value funds include stocks of companies that have low
price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Usually, value stocks are the opposite of
Wall Street darlings and may be underpriced. Frequently, value stocks
represent mature companies that have stopped growing, companies
with poor recent earnings records or troubles, or companies that use
their earnings to pay dividends. Value funds offer moderate and less
volatile investor returns than growth funds.
 International funds: International funds include a mix of stocks and
bonds from other nations or governments. These funds are subject to
several types of risks that domestic mutual funds don’t experience, 
such as political risk and exchange rate risk (losing money because of
changes in the currency exchange rate).
 Balanced funds: Balanced funds are a mix of stocks, bonds, and Treasury
bills, and possibly some foreign assets. Each fund has a different strategy
for determining its asset allocation mix.
 Dividend funds: Dividend funds are investments in common and pre-
ferred stocks offered by corporations that generate a large, steady
stream of dividend income. In Canada, the dividends are usually eligible
for the dividend tax credit, thereby increasing the after-tax yield to the
unit holder. This credit makes dividend funds attractive to Canadian
investors who prefer to pay the lower tax rates on dividend income than
the higher tax rates on interest income.
105
Chapter 6: The Keys to Successful Internet Mutual Fund Investing

You may be considering purchasing two or three mutual funds. Here’s a way
to simplify your accounting and reduce your costs at the same time. You can
invest in a fund of funds. A fund of funds is a fund that invests in other mutual
funds in the same fund family, instead of or in addition to investing directly 
in equity, fixed income or other types of investments. For example, T. Rowe
Price (www.troweprice.com) and the Vanguard Group (www.vanguard.com)
offer funds of funds that invest only in their own funds. The expense ratios
are waived. A fund of fundsis an inexpensive approach to diversifying your
portfolio and only paying for the underlying funds.

Simplifying Your Investing 
with Mutual Funds 
At the height of the stock market boom in 1999, a friend of mine complained
that he didn’t have enough time to do the necessary homework to invest. He
felt that investment opportunities were slipping by while his money was gath-
ering dust in a money market account. He could have solved (and simplified)
his problem by investing in an index fund or exchange-traded fund.
Discovering index funds
Index funds are sometimes called passively managed funds. Index fund man-
agers try to closely track the performance of a target market index. Index
funds buy and hold all, or a representative sample, of the securities in a par-
ticular index. The composition of the portfolio of the index fund is deter-
mined by the index it is trying to mirror. For example, a Standard & Poor’s
500 index fund will match the percentage of stocks held in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 index. In contrast, in an actively managed fund, a fund manager
tries to outperform similar funds or an appropriate market benchmark.
Actively managed fund managers use expensive research, market forecasts,

107
Chapter 6: The Keys to Successful Internet Mutual Fund Investing

and their own judgment and experience to buy and sell securities. This exper-
tise makes the operating costs of a managed fund higher than a passively
managed index fund.
The operating costs for passively managed index funds are often 0.20 per-
cent. In addition to their low cost, the appeal of index funds is twofold. First,
the index fund will match the returns of the index it mirrors. If the market
does well and the value of the index increases, the investor does well. The
second reason investors like index funds is that some indexes better reflect
their individual investing objectives. The downside of index funds is that
investors will never have the opportunity to significantly outperform the
market. For more information about index funds, see the following:
 IndexFunds.com (www.indexfunds.com), shown in Figure 6-2, is a help-
ful all-purpose online resource for index mutual funds. You’ll find a

 Vanguard (flagship2.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/FundsStocks
Overview) features the Vanguard 500 index fund, which has been
around for more than 25 years. You can read all about the benefits 
of indexes online.
Becoming aware of exchange-traded funds
Exchange-traded funds are passively managed funds that are traded on stock
exchanges. A share of an exchange-traded fund is a share of a unit investment
trust. Unit investment trusts are formed by investment companies with the
intention of acquiring a portfolio of shares to be passively managed over a
fixed period. The trust is then terminated.
According to The Wall Street Journal, as of September 2004, exchange-traded
funds had combined assets of $180.8 billion, up 20 percent from $151 billion
in December 2003. To create an exchange-traded fund (ETF), investment com-
panies gather stocks or fixed income securities into one basket and then sell
shares in the trust on a stock exchange. In other words, ETFs trade like
stocks and can’t be abused by market timers.
108

As of September 2004, there were 143 ETFs. ETFs always include securities
that are included in an index. ETFs come in several different types and are
based on broad market sector indexes and international indexes. The follow-
ing are a few examples:
 Spiders: Track the Standard & Poor’s Deposit Receipts (SPDR, pro-
nounced “spider”).
 Cubes: Track the NASDAQ 100 of big nonfinancial stocks using the ticker
symbol QQQ — hence the name cubes.
 Diamonds: Track the Dow Industrial Average using the ticker symbol
DIA — hence the name diamonds.
 Vipers: The Vanguard Group has launched Vanguard Index Participation
Equity Receipts, know as Vipers. Each Viper is a new class of shares of
one of the company’s well-known index funds. The underlying portfolios
are equal, though fees and other features are different from those of the
Vanguard funds.
ETFs are inexpensive to own. Expenses for an ETF are usually 0.4 percent,
compared with 1.4 percent for the average equity mutual fund — but you

have the expense of the broker. If you follow dollar-cost averaging, your bro-
kerage fees can quickly add up. On the other hand, you don’t have to worry
about a minimum investment. Other advantages of ETFs include
 The ability to buy and sell at any time during the trading day
 Instant exposure to stock portfolios of your choice: You can select an
ETF that meets your specific investor objectives.
 The ability to buy on margin: These purchases are generally subject to
the same terms that apply to common stocks. (For more information

Mutual Funds and Your 
Risk Tolerance Level
Table 6-1 provides a brief overview of the time period and risk-tolerance level
of the major mutual fund categories. Please note that this table takes into

consideration the different levels of risk for a money market fund and a
money market deposit account (MMDA). The primary source of difference
between these two securities is the lack of Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) insurance for money market funds. However, this doesn’t
mean that MMDAs, which are insured by the FDIC, don’t have any risk.

How to Screen Mutual Funds Online
The Internet provides a variety of mutual fund screening tools that sort thou-
sands of mutual funds by criteria that you select. For example, you may want
111
Chapter 6: The Keys to Successful Internet Mutual Fund Investing

one type of fund for your children’s education — something long term
because you don’t need the money for 10 to 20 years — and a different fund
for your retirement to help you reduce your current tax liabilities. With these
online screening tools, you can evaluate several funds that meet your finan-
cial needs.
Most of the stock-screening sites on the Internet are free. These database
searches are an inexpensive way to isolate mutual funds that meet your spe-
cial criteria. Some databases list funds incorrectly or have outdated informa-
tion. However, they’re useful for pruning a large list of candidates to a
manageable short list.
Each screening site uses different criteria to sort mutual funds. You have to
decide which criteria you care about and then use the site that offers the cri-
teria you want. Any way you look at it, the selection of the right mutual fund
is still up to you.
Here’s an overview of the features of two mutual fund screens that are better
for beginning online investors:
 MSN Money (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/finder/mffinder.
asp) offers the Easy Fund Finder, which lets you search a database of
more than 8,000 mutual funds for the one fund that meets your needs
and investment objectives. MSN Money also offers 11 prebuilt mutual
fund screens. Just click Power Searches for screens that include the cri-
teria that you feel are the most important when selecting a mutual fund.
Examples of the prebuilt screens include Safety first funds; Do-it-yourself
funds (this screen lets you experiment with your own pain threshold);
Foreign stock funds; High-yield bond funds; Hot, no-load funds; Large
blend funds; NAIC equity screen; NAIC fixed-income screen; Small cap
growth funds; Specialty technology funds; and Top-rated funds. You can
also design your own mutual fund screens.
 Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) offers a free, independent service
that evaluates more than 11,000 mutual funds. From Morningstar’s home
page, click Funds and then Fund Selector. The free screen lets you set the
criteria for fund type, cost and purchase options, ratings and risk, returns,
and portfolio. You can view five screens developed by Morningstar.com
analysts. The advanced search function is comprehensive; expect great
performance and historical data. However, you have to be a premium
member to use it — $12.95 per month, $115 per year, or $199 for two years
(after a 14-day free trial).
The following mutual fund screens are great for more experienced investors:
 Forbes Mutual Fund Tool (www.forbes.com/finance/screener/
Screener.jhtml) lets you screen the Lipper database of more than
112
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

11,000 mutual funds. You select the criteria that match your investment
objectives by using a collection of drop-down lists, radio buttons, and
text boxes. Just click the categories you’re interested in and then click
the Screen link to access the database and see which funds score best.
Don’t forget to use the glossary to define any terms you’re unfamiliar
with.
 Smart Money Interactive (www.smartmoney.com) has a do-it-yourself
mutual fund finder that searches a database of more than 12,000 mutual
funds using more than 60 different financial and valuation benchmarks.
View your results in three different formats. Save your favorite screens
for repeated use. Further analyze funds using SmartMoney.com’s fund
snapshots, advanced charting, and technical analysis tools. It also has
prebuilt mutual fund screens. There is a 14-day free trial. You’ll find
three levels of subscriptions: $5.95 per month for SmartMoney Select
features powered by 20-minutes-delayed quotes, $10.95 per month for
SmartMoney Select real-time quotes and investor tools, and $19.95 per
month for the SmartMoney Select real-time with XStream quotes and
NASDAQ Level II quotes, which doesn’t offer a free trial.
Locating and Reading the Prospectus
EDGAR Mutual Funds Reporting (www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/
prospectus.htm), shown in Figure 6-3, provides prospectuses for thousands
of different types of funds. If you know the name of the fund you’re interested
in, you can investigate the fund’s activities at this site. Target your search by
determining the range of dates you want, which filing forms (quarterly, annu-
ally, and so on) you want to read, and the name of the specific fund.
If you don’t know the exact name of the fund you want, refer to Morningstar
(www.morningstar.com), which provides a mutual fund search engine. Just
enter what you know of the mutual fund’s name. The search engine’s results
provide you with several mutual funds that have similar names. It’s likely that
the mutual fund you’re seeking will be one of the funds listed.
After you find the prospectus you want, download it to your computer so
that you can read it at your leisure. Here’s how you download a prospectus
that you’ve accessed via the EDGAR Mutual Funds Reporting Web site:
1. With the prospectus displayed in your Web browser, choose
File➪Save.
Your browser displays the Save As dialog box.
113
Chapter 6: The Keys to Successful Internet Mutual Fund Investing

2. Enter a filename for the prospectus and select the directory in which
you want to save the file.
3. Click Save.
Your browser saves the prospectus on your computer. If you have a dial-
up connection to the Internet, you can disconnect from your ISP.
4. Minimize your Internet browser.
5. Open your word-processing program.
6. Open the prospectus file.
You can now read the prospectus offline and at your leisure.
Checking the facts

Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 Investment objectives: The first paragraph of the prospectus describes
the fund’s investment objectives and lists the types of securities the
fund invests in. If the fund doesn’t meet your investment objectives, you
can stop reading and start evaluating another fund.
 Fees: The SEC requires all mutual funds to list all fees, costs, and
expenses in a table at the front of the prospectus.
 Additional expenses: Some funds charge for extra services such as
printed shareholder materials, toll-free telephone numbers with 24-hour
service, accumulation plans that reinvest your distributions (share-
holder profits), and related support and guidance.
 Performance: Year-to-year data for the last ten years (or less if the fund
isn’t that old) in condensed financial statements indicates the fund’s
performance. Statistics track the fund’s NAV, shareholder distributions,
and expenses. For funds that include stocks, the prospectus may also
include dividends and price information. Many funds provide graphs
that show how a $1,000 investment in the fund increased or decreased
over a ten-year period.
 Statement of additional information: This section of the prospectus
covers fund details and complex items, such as the biographies of the
fund’s directors, the fund’s objectives, and contracts for professional
services. These reports are free to the fund’s shareholders that request
them.
The SEC requires the prospectus to indicate what fees the fund charges for a
$1,000 investment with a 5 percent return redeemed at the end of one year,
three years, five years, and ten years. Keep in mind that both load and no-
load funds have management fees and operating expenses that are charged
to the fund.
Getting it right
Reading a mutual fund prospectus isn’t the most exciting thing you could be
doing on a Saturday night, but you’ll discover many useful facts and disclo-
sures required by federal law. The mutual fund’s prospectus may stimulate
many questions, but here are a few that you should get answers to before 
you invest:
 Is the fund’s performance steady? Over the last ten years (or life of the
fund if it’s younger), are one or two good years responsible for the
fund’s overall performance?
115
Chapter 6: The Keys to Successful Internet Mutual Fund Investing

 How does this mutual fund compare to similar funds in terms of per-
formance and expenses? Keep in mind that higher expenses result in
lower investor returns.
 What’s the standard deviation or risk level of the fund? How does it
compare to similar funds? (Remember, if the fund has a higher level of
risk, it should have a higher level of return. The higher return is your
just reward for taking additional risk.)
 What’s the fund turnover ratio like? The turnover ratio indicates how
actively the fund’s managers are trading securities. The higher the fund
turnover rate, the higher the brokerage’s charges. High transaction costs
can take a bite out of investor returns.
 Do any initial sales charges show up in the “how to purchase shares”
and “how to redeem shares” sections of the prospectus? Is there a
required minimum investment amount or a minimum amount for subse-
quent investments? Will you be charged a fee for switching from one
fund to another fund in the same fund family? Will you be charged a
redemption fee when you sell your shares?
It’s unlikely that the prospectus will have an up-to-the-minute listing of the
securities currently held by the mutual fund. Check out the fund’s current
holdings at Morningstar (www.morningstar.com), Smart Money (www.
smartmoney.com), or a similar mutual fund super-site.
Analyzing Mutual Funds 
As a general rule, the first palce to start analyzing a fund is by by comparing
its expense ratio to similar funds. All funds have fees and expenses, but the
amounts vary. In addition to sales and redemption fees, the mutual fund’s
prospectus indicates the fund’s management and administration expenses.
The fund’s investment advisor generally receives 0.5 to 1.0 percent of the
fund’s average daily net assets. Administrative expenses include legal, audit-
ing, and accounting costs, along with the fees for directors and the costs of
preparing the annual report and proxy statements. These administrative
expenses are added to the investment advisory fee. The total costs often
average between 0.75 percent and 1.25 percent of fund assets. Savvy mutual
fund investors are wary of funds with expense ratios that are more than 1.25
percent.
In 1980, the SEC passed Rule 12b-1, which allows mutual fund companies to
charge advertising and marketing expenses. These costs typically range from
0.25 percent to 0.30 percent and can be as high as 1.25 percent. Some mutual
116
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

funds charge these fees and others don’t, so read the mutual fund’s prospec-
tus carefully.
The Mutual Fund Education Alliance (www.mfea.com) is a not-for-profit trade
association of the no-load mutual fund industry. The Web site’s Mutual Fund
Investor’s Center is designed to serve investors who want to use mutual
funds to reach their financial goals. The site provides links to profiles on per-
formance data for no-load mutual funds, lists of funds with the lowest initial
minimum deposit, lists of funds with the lowest expenses, comparative
indexes, and other relevant mutual fund information.
Comparing costs and returns 
PersonalFund.com (personalfund.com) and the premier features of
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) allow you to investigate fund alterna-
tives that have similar characteristics but lower costs.
The returns of the mutual fund you select can be radically reduced by hidden
costs. When evaluating a mutual fund, consider the following:
 Returns: Keep in mind the power of compounding, which can be used
against you. For example, say that you select a fund that has a return of 
8 percent when a similar fund has a return of 10 percent. Over your life-
time, that two percent difference can be the difference between retiring
in luxury and living in fear that you will outlive your retirement funds.
 Costs: Predicting the cost of owning your mutual fund is easier than pre-
dicting future market activity and the performance of your mutual fund.
Keep in mind that mutual funds charge
• Management fees: Shareholders are charged management fees by
the company that manages the fund.
• Transaction fees: Shareholders are charged transaction costs when
fund managers buy or sell shares of the mutual fund. If the mutual
fund has a high rate of turnover, the fund’s returns are less than a
similar fund with low turnover.
• Taxes: Shareholders are charged taxes on distributions (dividends
and capital gains) from the fund. Fund distributions look good to
potential shareholders. Unfortunately, current shareholders have
to pay taxes at their ordinary tax rate on the short-term gains,
which reduces the return of the mutual fund.
At PersonalFund.com, you can personalize your analysis by using Personal
Fund.com’s questionnaire to indicate how much you’re investing, whether
117
Chapter 6: The Keys to Successful Internet Mutual Fund Investing

the account is taxable or nontaxable, how long you expect to hold the fund,
and your required rate of return (before costs). If the fund is in a taxable
account, enter your tax bracket for ordinary income and the tax bracket for
long-term capital gains. Click the Calculate Costs button to get an analysis of
the total cost of ownership.
PersonalFund.com can provide an analysis of your fund and suggestions for
three similar funds. All four funds are fully analyzed. Click the Go button to
determine whether it makes sense to sell your shares in your fund and
replace them with a different fund.
The new analysis looks at the trade-offs (out-of-pocket costs, taxes, commis-
sions, and loads) and future returns, shows you how much better the new
fund must do to justify making the switch, and gives you the opportunity to
change your assumptions and recalculate. A recent analysis, based on the
assumption that the Wilshire 5000 Index Portfolio (WFIVX) has a 0.15 percent
higher net return than Matrix Advisors Value (MAVFX), indicates that you
wouldn’t break even within ten years before taxes, nor would you break even
net of taxes. In other words, you wouldn’t receive any benefit from replacing
the MAVFX fund unless you plan to hold the new WFIVX fund for more than
ten years. That’s certainly something to think about!
Experienced mutual fund investors typically avoid funds with expense ratios
greater than 1.25 percent.
Some mutual fund companies may have low up-front fees but charge high
rates for managing fund operations. The prospectus details whether the
mutual fund charges these fees. I give you details on prospectuses in the 
section “Locating and Reading the Prospectus.”
Understanding mutual fund risks
Smart investors select opportunities based on their risk return. For example,
the promise of a big return may not be worth the level of risk. Conversely,
investing in a security with a low guaranteed return (such as a savings bond)
may not keep up with inflation. In this situation, you lose money because you
didn’t take enough risk.
Different investments have different types of risks. You can minimize your
risk by investing in different types of securities. RiskGrades (www.risk
grades.com) uses scores that are based on statistical analysis of historical
price fluctuations of stocks and bonds (and foreign exchange rates and com-
modity prices). Large price fluctuations are an indication of high uncertainty,
or risk. With your free registration, you can measure the risk of a single security
118
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

or your entire portfolio. For example, imagine two large cap mutual funds
that have the same costs and returns. The first fund has a risk grade of 72,
and the second fund has a risk grade of 57. All things being equal, you should
select the mutual fund that has less risk (or lower risk grade).
Mutual funds provide statements about their objectives and risk posture
(which is briefly explained in qualitative terms in the prospectus). Rather
than provide precise information to help you evaluate the riskiness of a
mutual fund, however, these statements typically offer vague, general expla-
nations of a fund’s approach to risk. For more precise, statistical evaluations
of a fund’s risks, you can turn to independent mutual fund rating services,
such as Morningstar (www.morningstar.com). 
Morningstar and other independent mutual fund rating services calculate
such statistics as the standard deviation of a fund’s return. I don’t want to
turn this chapter into an introductory statistics course, but I can tell you that
standard deviation helps you judge how volatile, or risky, a fund is. This sta-
tistic shows you how much a fund has deviated from its average return over
a period of time. Standard deviation offers a clear indicator of a fund’s consis-
tency over time. A fund’s standard deviation is a simple measure of a fund’s
highest and lowest returns over a specific time period. Just remember this
point: The higher the standard deviation, the higher the fund’s risk.
For example, if the 3-year return on a fund is 33 percent, that statistic may
mean that the fund earned 11 percent in the first year, 11 percent in the
second year, and 11 percent in the third year. On the other hand, the fund
may have earned 28 percent in the first year, 5 percent in the second year,
and 0 percent in the third year. If your financial plan requires an 11-percent
annual return, this fund isn’t for you!

Finding the Right Mix of Investments
Asset allocation is the specific amount of money that you spend for each type
of investment. In Wall Street–speak, the term describes how you diversify your
financial assets (stocks, bonds, and cash) by amounts that you determine.

Asset allocation also means trying to squeeze every bit of return out of each
asset type, given the level of risk. Overall, the right asset allocation approach
is the one that works best for you. When determining your asset allocation,
consider your age, the amount of time you can spend investing your money,
your financial goals, your risk-tolerance level, and the impact of taxes on
your investment decisions.
Table 7-1 shows all the ingredients for finding the combination of assets that
may be just right for you. The source of this guideline is Value Line
(www.valueline.com). The table shows Value Line’s definitions of nine
investor types. The types are categorized as conservative, moderate, and
aggressive. The investment time frame fills out the picture. The investment
period can be short-term, medium-term, or long-term.

Many mutual funds match the asset allocation shown in Table 7-1. You can
start with one mutual fund, or you can purchase a mutual fund for each allo-
cation. If you purchase several mutual funds, you can diversify your risk even
more. For example, to complete your portfolio, you may want to buy a money

market fund, a stock mutual fund, and a fixed-asset (bond) mutual fund. It’s
your money and your choice. See Table 7-2 for a discussion of the investor
type numbers #1 through #9 found in Table 7-1.
Table 7-2 shows how you can match mutual fund categories to your financial
objectives and risk-tolerance level. Refer to Table 7-1 to decide which of the
nine investor types most closely matches your personal financial plan and
risk-tolerance profile. For example, Investor Type #1 is a conservative investor
who is investing for the short term. Investor Type #9 is an aggressive investor
who is investing for the long term. For more detail about the investor types,
visit the Value Line site at www.valueline.com. Table 7-2 shows what cate-
gories of mutual funds are right for your investor type. The percentages listed

Using the Internet to Help You Choose
the Best Funds in Each Class
Past performance doesn’t guarantee future performance. However, investors
often use annualized returns to compare funds. The Internet offers tables of
fund comparisons for each month and for periods ranging from one month to
ten years or more. For example, Business Week (www.businessweek.com)
has a Mutual Funds Scoreboard that provides listings of the returns for the
best funds, the bond fund leaders, and the worst funds.
124
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

Comparing a fund to similar funds is a good way to examine a fund’s perfor-
mance. Organizations such as Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) have
mutual fund tables that make comparisons easy by grouping fund classes and
including the averages for each category. (See Chapter 6 for details about
fund classes.) A fund’s ability to consistently outperform similar funds is one
sign of good quality. In contrast, you should avoid funds that have consis-
tently underperformed for three years or more.
Make certain that the funds you compare are similar. You’ll find a big differ-
ence between, for example, an aggressive growth fund and a growth fund. To
verify your analyses, check the prospectus of each fund. The fund’s invest-
ment objectives are listed in the first paragraph. You may discover that the
fund that looked so attractive at first is really too risky for you.
Following a mutual fund checklist
As you select your first mutual fund, consider these factors:
 The fund manager: Often a fund is only as good as its management. If
the fund manager has shown great performance in the past, future per-
formance is likely to be above average. If the fund manager has been
replaced, past performance becomes less meaningful and may even be
worthless. A poor-performing fund that gets a new fund manager may
turn around and become a top performer.
 The stability of the fund’s philosophy: If the fund seems unclear about
its financial goals and is switching investment methods, it may be in
trouble.
 The size of the fund: Good fund candidates have at least $50 million
under management and should be large enough to keep up with institu-
tional investors. At the opposite end of the spectrum, funds with more
than $20 billion tend to have problems with being too large.
 The objectives of the fund: Some funds focus on specialty or sector
funds (gold funds or biotech funds) and often offer great returns.
However, they aren’t good funds for the online investor who wants to
own just one mutual fund. If you own just one specialty fund, you lose
the advantage of diversification.
 Fees: A debate has raged during the last ten years about which is better:
no-load or load mutual funds. All the studies indicate that paying a sales
commission doesn’t ensure a greater return. However, investing in a
fund with high fees and high returns is better than investing in a fund
with low fees and poor performance.
125
Chapter 7: Online Analysis, Buying, and Selling of Mutual Funds

 Purchase constraints: Although some funds require a minimum initial
investment of $5,000, many good funds don’t have this requirement. If
you enroll in a fund’s automatic investment program (AIP), the minimum
initial investment amount is usually waived. (For more on AIPs, see
“Starting Your Mutual Fund Account with as Little as $50,” later in this
chapter.) Additionally, many fund minimums are waived or substantially
reduced for IRA investments.
Reading an online mutual fund listing
As a general rule, mutual fund listings are slightly easier to read than stock list-
ings. (See Chapter 8 to find out about stock listings.) Different online sources
and newspapers list mutual funds differently. Mutual fund listings are designed
to provide investors with enough information to select, evaluate, and track the
performance of a mutual fund. As a general rule mutual fund listings come in
five flavors: daily listings, weekly listings, monthly performance tables, and
quarterly and year-end reports. 
 Daily listings: Provide a brief description of the fund type (for example,
B stands for back-load or N stands for no-load). Other abbreviations
include U for a U.S. dollar–denominated fund; NAVPS (net asset value 
per share) is the current value of one share; NAVPS $Chg (dollar change)
and NAVPS %Chg (percent change) are comparisons to yesterday’s value
of the same fund expressed in dollars or as a percentage. To sum it up,
daily listings are good for valuing each share of the fund and for deter-
mining how much it was worth yesterday. 
 Weekly listings: Include the same information as the daily listings and
then some. You’ll find the fund name, a few specifics about the fund, and
“Fri $Chg” and “Fri %Chg” columns, showing Friday’s change in NAVPS,
compared to Thursday for the same fund. The “52W high” and “52W
low” columns show the highest and lowest NAVPS reached last year. By
looking at the range between the funds’ high and low, investors can tell
the historical volatility of the fund. Additionally, you can see exactly
where the fund stands today in relation to these highest and lowest
NAVPS. You also receive a summary of the weekly NAVPS (the highest
and lowest NAVPS from the last week, the NAVPS as of last Friday, and
how that NAVPS compares to the week previous). Overall, weekly list-
ings are good for determining the high and low value of the fund for the
week, the closing value of the fund, and the change in this week’s value
compared to last week. 
 Monthly performance tables: Include the name of the fund and other
specifics, such as the fund’s net assets, the rate of return on the fund for
the month, the last six months, and the last year, and the average annual
126
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

rate of return for three, five, and ten years. Some performance tables
include the fund’s standard deviation (the higher the standard deviation,
the higher the level of risk) for the last three years, which indicates the
funds long-term volatility. Other data includes the fund’s expense ratio.
In summary, you can use monthly performance tables to help you in
your mutual fund selection process. For example, if you are a conserva-
tive investor, you can use a monthly performance table to assist you in
finding a stable fund with a low standard deviation. 
 Quarterly and year-end reports: Are useful once you whittle your mutual
fund investment candidates down to ten or less. The content and style of
these reports varies, but you’re able to get a better handle on who is man-
aging the fund, the fund’s objectives, and more. 
Assessing mutual fund performance
No hard-and-fast rules exist about how to assess a mutual fund. However, the
following list provides easy-to-use guidelines to assess the performance of
your mutual fund investment candidates. After your assessment, each fund
still require additional analysis. Only funds that meet all the following criteria
should be selected for further research. They’re likely to reduce your
chances of losing money without lowering your mutual fund returns.
 Tax liabilities and returns: All mutual fund performance is shown on a
pretax basis because different investors are in different tax brackets. If
you invest through taxable accounts (which are different from nontax-
able accounts that might include your IRA or other tax-exempt invest-
ments), you should compare only the after-tax returns of the funds
you’re analyzing. This comparison enables you to compare apples to
apples instead of apples to oranges.
 The impact of short-term performance: Ignore short-term performance.
Short-term returns are heavily influenced by fluctuations in the market
and are valueless.
 Consistent returns: Avoid funds that have inconsistent returns when
compared to unmanaged indexes. In other words, when you compare
your fund to the appropriate benchmark, take into consideration the
consistency of the two funds. If your fund is more volatile than the
benchmark, it may have more risk than you expected. For a quick list of
mutual fund benchmarks, see Lipper, Inc. (www.lipperweb.com); with
its affiliated companies, Lipper currently tracks the performance of
more than 32,000 funds worldwide with assets in excess of $6 trillion.
 Fund ranking when compared to like funds: Look for a fund whose per-
formance is ranked within the top 20 percent to 50 percent or better of
its type. Make certain that your analysis compares growth funds to
growth funds and value funds to value funds.
127
Chapter 7: Online Analysis, Buying, and Selling of Mutual Funds

 Fund ranking when compared to unmanaged indexes: The fund’s per-
formance and risk level should be better than an unmanaged index for
one-, three-, and five-year time periods. Compare the fund’s performance
(before mutual fund costs) to a similar index. A broad-based U.S. stock
fund should be compared to the S & P 500 (www.stockinfo.standard
poor.com) or the Wilshire 5000 Index. Small company funds should be
compared to the Russell 2000 Index.
 The fund’s price/earnings (P/E) ratios should be 15 to 25: P/E ratios
above 30 tend to be high-risk.
 The fund’s standard deviation: The higher the standard deviation, the
higher the risk. The fund’s Morningstar standard deviation for 3 years
should be 17 or lower. If you use the Value Line–calculated standard
deviation (which is different), the standard deviation for 3 years ought
to be 12 or lower.
 The fund’s risk value: Value Line rankings range from 1 (low risk) to 5
(high risk). If a fund’s Value Line risk rating is 1, it’s in the top 10 percent
of the safest funds. With the Morningstar rating system, a 5-star rating
indicates that the fund is within the top 10 percent of the safest funds.
The evaluation criteria in the preceding list are a good starting point for 
your analysis. As you become a more sophisticated investor, you’re likely 
to modify, delete, and add criteria. This customization ensures that your
mutual fund selections meet your individual risk-tolerance level and financial
objectives.
Using Scoreboards and Ratings
In this chapter, I present three different rating systems:
 The Wall Street Journal (public.wsj.com/home.html) and CBS
MarketWatch (cbs.marketwatch.com) use the Lipper Leaders system
(www.lipperweb.com) and divides each fund into five categories. The
Lipper Leader system ranks each category from one to five, with one
having the highest rank.
 Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) rates mutual funds from five to
one star, with five stars ranking the top performers. I discuss these rank-
ings in the section “The Morningstar rating system.”
 Value Line (www.valueline.com) scores mutual funds from 1 to 5, 
with 1 taking top billing. You find a list of these ratings in the preceding
section.
128
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

In the best of times, the same fund can be ranked a five-star Morningstar
winner and a number-one mutual fund by Value Line. Sometimes, a mutual
fund’s score can indicate a top performer by one mutual fund rating service
and a loser by another mutual fund rating service. Why the difference?
Some mutual fund scores are risk adjusted, and some are absolute. Risk-
adjusted scores punish mutual funds for inconsistent returns and reward
others for stability. For example, the risk-adjusted mutual funds rating can 
do the following: 
 Penalize a fund for radically changing from its previous performance.
Additionally, a fund can be penalized for exceeding its previous perfor-
mance. In other words, the fund can receive a lower rating because of
unexpected increases in returns. This rating penalty can be just as bad
as the penalty for an unexpected decrease in returns.
 Reward mediocre fund performers: A fund with consistently mediocre
returns can receive a higher rating because of its stability.
With all rating systems, a description of the type of ranking system used is
included in the description of how scores are calculated. Conservative
investors prefer to use risk-adjusted scores. Other investors prefer to use the
absolute numbers. The best approach is to have a clear understanding of the
differences in the ranking systems.
The analysis of mutual funds includes more research than selecting a fund by
its rating. Remember that the more informed you are, the better your decision-
making will be.
129
Chapter 7: Online Analysis, Buying, and Selling of Mutual Funds
Checking for overlaps in your mutual funds
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) offers
Web-based screening tools to assist investors in
researching “overlaps” in their portfolios. A
stock overlap is an overconcentration of a cer-
tain equity that can dampen your attempts at
diversification and can lead to investing mis-
takes. Subscribers to Morningstar automatically
receive the X-ray screening tools, which indicate
whether several mutual funds they hold include
the same stocks. The Premium Portfolio X-Ray
tool checks your portfolio for unexpected risks
caused by an overconcentration of individual
stocks. You can view stocks and mutual funds
both individually and within mutual funds to
determine the portfolio’s true asset allocation
and view the portfolio’s exposure to turbulence
in different regions of the world. You can analyze
both stocks and funds together, see your total
asset allocation, total expenses, total sector con-
centrations, and so on. For example, when I used
the Portfolio Instant X-Ray, I discovered that
about 4 percent of my portfolio is in bonds held
by mutual fund companies, but I didn’t have any
stock overlaps. Subscriptions for this premium
service are $12.95 per month, $115 per year, and
$199 for two years. See the Web site at
www.morningstar.com for details about
other products and services included in a 
premium subscription. A 14-day free trial is 
available.

The Ratings War
Many Web sites offer information on the ranking of mutual funds. Rankings
are useful because they help you digest important performance and risk sta-
tistics into one measure. For information on the ranking of mutual funds,
check out these Web sites:
 Barron’s (www.barrons.com)
 Business Week (www.businessweek.com)
 Forbes (www.forbes.com)
 The Wall Street Journal (public.wsj.com/home.html)
Three of the more popular online rating services are Morningstar, Lipper, and
Value Line. Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) and Lipper (www.lipper
leaders.com) are free services. Value Line (www.valueline.com) is a fee-
based service.
The Morningstar rating system
Morningstar is an independent, Chicago-based firm that has been evaluating
mutual funds and annuities since 1984. The organization currently evaluates
more than 13,000 mutual funds.
Morningstar uses historical data to develop its ratings. The unique feature of
the rating system is that it penalizes mutual funds for excess risk that doesn’t
result in excess returns. Morningstar rates funds for consistently giving the
highest returns and adjusts for risk as compared to funds in the same category.
Morningstar’s five-star system is as follows:
 Five Stars: In the top 10 percent of performance; produces substantially
above-average returns
 Four Stars: In the next 22.5 percent of performance; produces above-
average returns
 Three Stars: In the middle 35 percent of performance; produces average
returns
 Two Stars: In the lower 22.5 percent of performance; produces below-
average returns
 One Star: In the bottom 10 percent of performance; produces substan-
tially below-average returns
130
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

The Lipper Leader system 
The Lipper Leader system (www.lipperleaders.com) is a toolkit that uses
criteria of a fund’s success in meeting certain investor goals, such as preserv-
ing capital or building wealth through consistent, strong returns. The
strength of the Lipper Leader system is the use of these criteria in conjunc-
tion with one another.
The Lipper system uses 1 as the top score. That is, the highest 20 percent of
funds in each classification are named Lipper Leaders, the next 20 percent
receive a score of 2, the middle 20 percent are scored 3, the next 20 percent
are scored 4, and the lowest 20 percent are scored 5.
The Lipper Leader system ranks and divides each fund into five categories,
ranked from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the highest rank. The categories are as
follows:
 Total return: The fund provides a superior total return when compared
to a group of similar funds.
 Consistency of return: The fund provides higher consistency and risk-
adjusted returns when compared to a group of similar funds. Funds
receive high marks for year-to-year consistency relative to others in a
particular peer group.
 Preservation: The fund has demonstrated an outstanding ability to pre-
serve assets in a variety of markets when compared with its asset class-
equity, mixed equity, or fixed-income funds.
 Tax efficiency: The fund is successful at postponing taxes over a mea-
surement period relative to similar funds.
 Expense: The fund has effectively managed to keep its expenses low rel-
ative to its peers and within its load structure.
The Value Line rating system
Value Line uses a dual rating system that includes overall rank and measures
various performance criteria, including risk. Funds are ranked from 1 to 5,
with 1 as the highest rank (the best risk-adjusted performance) and the best
risk ranking (the least risky).
Value Line uses historical data to develop its ratings. The five-number system
is as follows:
 1: In the top 10 percent; highest overall performance and lowest risk
 2: In the next 20 percent; above-average performance and lower risk
131
Chapter 7: Online Analysis, Buying, and Selling of Mutual Funds

 3: In the middle 40 percent; average performance and average risk
 4: In the lower 20 percent; below-average performance and higher risk
 5: In the lowest 10 percent; lowest average performance and highest risk
Value Line’s Mutual Fund Survey for Windows (www.ec-server.value
line.com) is a data/software service that includes extensive capabilities for
viewing, sorting, screening, graphing, and preparing reports on more than
11,000 mutual funds. The service has a six-week trial subscription for $50 and
an annual subscription for $345 with monthly updates. Users can also access
weekly updates online by clicking Data Updates. The software is available on
CD-ROM for Windows-based computers. The CD-ROM provides access to
reports on mutual funds exactly as published in the Value Line Mutual Fund
Survey.
When using mutual fund ratings, you must keep two things in mind. First,
past performance doesn’t predict future performance. Second, comparing the
ranks of two different mutual fund categories is meaningless. For example,
you can’t compare the rank of a municipal-bond fund against an aggressive-
growth fund.
Buying Mutual Funds Online: 
Using an Online Broker
You have many choices in how you purchase mutual funds. In addition to
purchasing directly from the mutual fund company, you can purchase mutual
funds through registered representatives of banks, trust companies, stock-
brokers, discount brokers, and financial planners. To purchase mutual funds
via the Internet, go to an online broker’s Web site. (I list a few examples later
in this section.)
Register by completing the online application form. You have to provide the
same information you normally provide for opening an online brokerage
account. (For details, see Chapter 4.)
The Internet is constantly changing, so check out the online brokerage’s
latest rates, new special mutual fund purchase programs, and brokerage
statement download capabilities before sending in your application for a
trading account.
To have a fully functioning account, brokerages are required to have your sig-
nature on file. After they have your signature on file, you can buy or sell as
much as you want.
132
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

After you open your account, log on to the Internet, go to your brokerage
Web site, and enter orders by completing the online form. Access your
account at any time and monitor your investments by using online news or
quote services.
Some of the online brokers in the following list are often called mutual fund
shopping centers because of the wide variety of mutual funds they carry. For
example, you can find funds that have no transaction fees, no-load funds, and
front- or back-loaded funds.
 Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) transaction fees vary based on the
funds you select. The minimum deposit required to open an account is
$10,000.
 TD Waterhouse (www.waterhouse.com) requires a $1,000 initial
deposit. While selected mutual funds carry no transaction fees, other
mutual funds are $24.00 per trade.
 E*TRADE (www.etrade.com) offers some no-transaction-fee mutual
funds and charges $24.95 commission on other mutual fund trades.
E*TRADE has a unique feature — rebates on Rule 12b-1 fees. The mini-
mum deposit to open an account is $1,000.
Commission-Free Mutual Funds 
If you purchase a load fund (a mutual fund that includes a sales charge), it
costs the same amount whether you purchase it through a broker or directly
from the mutual fund company. However, you really don’t need to pay a load
to get a great mutual fund. One of the advantages of no-load mutual funds
(which I discuss in Chapter 6) is that you can purchase them directly from
the mutual fund company and skip paying a sales commission. In the past, if
you purchased a no-load fund through a broker, you were charged a broker-
age fee. Now, many discount brokerages and large mutual fund companies
offer no-load funds (and even some load funds) with no transaction fees.
(Brokers receive a portion of the fund’s annual expenses instead.)
The primary advantage of purchasing a mutual fund through your online
broker is convenience. You can purchase several mutual funds in the same
fund family and thus save time and effort because you don’t have to call sev-
eral mutual fund companies to open accounts and make your purchases. If
you’re unhappy with one of the mutual funds, you can swap it with another
mutual fund in the same family at no cost, subject to certain restrictions. At
the end of the month, you receive only one statement that covers all your
funds. Your online brokerage provides you with one statement for your taxes,
which simplifies the process of calculating the tax you owe on your profits.
133
Chapter 7: Online Analysis, Buying, and Selling of Mutual Funds

Purchasing several mutual funds from one firm can help you with your invest-
ment tracking. Many online brokerages allow you to download your broker-
age statement to personal finance programs such as MS Money and Quicken.
(For more information on downloading your brokerage statement and manag-
ing your portfolio, see Chapter 17.) For more information about good one-
stop shopping centers for purchasing your mutual funds, check out Table 7-3.

Starting Your Mutual Fund Account 
with as Little as $50
The initial minimum deposit for many mutual funds is often in the thousands
of dollars. Don’t let this stop you from investing in several mutual funds.
Many funds have automatic investment plans (AIPs) that can make the most
expensive mutual fund affordable. Start by reading prospectuses to find out
which mutual funds have AIPs.
In an AIP, a set amount of money is deducted from your checking or savings
account each month and invested in the mutual fund. This strategy is also
known as dollar-cost averaging. In other words, you buy more shares when
prices are down and fewer shares when prices are up. Over time, investors
usually profit from this approach because they’re not chasing the market.
(See Chapter 15 for more information about the benefits of dollar-cost 
averaging.)
A mutual fund with an automatic investment plan often allows you to invest
as little as $50 per month, after you meet the minimum investment. The
Internet provides information about which mutual funds offer AIPs. For no-
loaded mutual funds with AIP plans, see the Mutual Fund Education Alliance
located at www.mfea.com. At the Home Page, click Fund Quicklist, then Funds
for $50 or less. 
After you select several mutual funds with AIPs, ask for the funds’ prospec-
tuses and application forms. You can request the forms online, by telephone,
or by mail. Fill out the section marked Automatic Investments and complete
the form. You’re authorizing the mutual fund company to make regular elec-
tronic withdrawals from your checking account for the amount you specify.
Some funds have contribution minimums that are a low as $50 and maxi-
mums that are as high as $100,000 per month. You decide exactly how much
you want to invest each month. For example, Principal provides an online
brochure (www.principal.com/funds/mm1117.pdf) that explains how its
automatic investment plan works. The minimum initial investment is $50, and
monthly minimum subsequent investments are $50. (Minimum subsequent
payments for money market funds are $100 per month.) If you reinvest your
fund’s cash distribution, you enjoy the benefits of compounding, and your
capital gains can add up quickly.
135
Chapter 7: Online Analysis, Buying, and Selling of Mutual Funds

Buying Mutual Funds Online: 
No Broker Needed
Before you invest in a mutual fund, read the fund’s prospectus so that you
understand exactly what you’re investing in. Next, fill out the online account
application form for the mutual fund company. At companies like Vanguard
(www.vanguard.com), depending on the type of type of account you desire,
you can open an account online or print the application and mail it to the
mutual fund firm.
For specific details about opening an account, contact the fund company or
broker. In general, you need to complete the following steps to open a mutual
fund account online or offline:
1. Provide some basic information (your name, mailing address, e-mail
address, and so on — including your Social Security number).
2. Mark what type of account you want: individual, joint, or trust.
3. Indicate your fund selections and state how much you are investing.
4. Indicate the status of your citizenship (U.S. citizen, resident alien, or
nonresident alien). If you’re not a U.S. citizen, you have to include a
W-8BEN form.
A W-8 certificate is required of all non–U.S. citizen account holders for
nonresident tax reporting purposes in order to claim exemption from
backup withholding on interest, dividends, and gross proceeds in the
account. To request a W-8BEN, see the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov/
pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf.
5. Mark whether you want check-writing privileges.
6. Indicate whether you want direct or automatic deposits (when you sell
or if you receive a dividend) into a checking account or if you want a
paper check.
7. Print, sign, and send your completed account application if applying
by mail.
Don’t forget to include your check, made payable to the mutual fund.
8. Provide bank information to make electronic transfers if applying
online.
When you complete the online application, you’re asked to sign the
online form using a secure code as your signature.
136

If everything goes as planned, the mutual fund company sends (to your mail-
ing address) a confirmation number, along with your new account number.
Table 7-4 includes a brief listing of companies that allow you to purchase
mutual funds without a broker. All you have to do is contact the company
directly. Each company listed in Table 7-4 has account access, allows online

The Right Time to Sell 
Your Mutual Funds
If your fund becomes one of the worst performers, consider selling. However,
you need to look at more than just the fund’s rating. Consider these guide-
lines for determining when to sell a fund:
137
Chapter 7: Online Analysis, Buying, and Selling of Mutual Funds

 You may want to sell if you have overlapping stocks in your portfolio.
(For more about overlapping stocks, see the sidebar “Checking for over-
laps in your mutual funds.”) You can use the Morningstar Portfolio X-Ray
feature (portfolio.morningstar.com) to discover whether the two
growth mutual funds that you own are holding shares in the same com-
pany. To stay diversified, you may want to sell one of the mutual funds
and replace it with another mutual fund.
 Look at the performance of comparable mutual funds using Personal
Fund (www.personalfund.com). If a similar fund’s overall performance
is down 10 percent, your fund is down 16 percent, and your fund’s per-
formance consistently trails its peers, your fund may be a loser.
 If your fund drifts from its original investment objectives, it’s not meeting
your asset allocation goals. This underperformance can become espe-
cially problematic if the drifting fund spoils your efforts of diversifica-
tion and doesn’t meet your asset allocation goals. 
 Keep track of changes in your fund’s management. If the fund hires a
new money manager, that person may have a different investment 
strategy.
 You may want to sell if your mutual fund’s expenses have been creeping
up, if you inherited the fund, or if your broker sold you a fund with a
high 12b-1 fee. High fund fees reduce your returns and make the fund
less profitable than similar funds with lower expenses.
 In a volatile market, you may discover that you’re a more conservative
investor than you imagined. If you can’t sleep at night, sell your fund.
 You pay taxes on your capital gains. If one of your mutual funds posts neg-
ative returns, consider selling the losing fund to offset your tax liabilities.
 If the fund increases by three or four times its original size in a short
time period and its performance starts to decline, you may want to sell.
As the fund keeps growing and growing, the professional money man-
ager can’t invest in the securities he or she knows and loves best, so 
the fund may start to acquire poor or average-performing assets.
 Consider your needs. If you purchased the fund for a specific purpose
and your life circumstances change, you should sell the fund and pur-
chase one that meets your needs — even if the fund is doing well.

The Basics of Stocks

In This Chapter
 Getting your financial house in order to begin wealth building
 Matching your investment objectives to the right investments
 Understanding different types of stock quotes
 Finding online stock quotes
 Using robust online valuation tools
T
he focus of this chapter is stock selection. The savvy online investor
prospects all possible stock candidates, looking for companies that are
exceptional in some way and positioned to perform well in the future.
In this chapter, I discuss using the Internet to decide which types of securi-
ties are right for you. So that you can make wise investment decisions, I also
show you how to keep current with online news services, read a stock table,
and find the ticker symbols of securities online. I conclude this chapter by
showing how you can value bonds, stocks, and cash investments by using
robust online valuation tools developed by academics and specialists.
Understanding Stocks
When you buy shares of a company, you purchase part ownership in that
company. As a shareholder, you also expect to receive capital appreciation —
the difference between your purchase price and the market price of your
shares — on your investment. If the company prospers, your shares of stock
increase in value. If company performance declines, the market value of your
shares also decreases.
Shareholders are the owners of corporations. If you buy just one share in a
company, you are a shareholder. As a shareholder, you’re invited to the com-
pany’s annual meeting. Additionally, you have the right to vote on the mem-
bers of the Board of Directors and other company matters. 

The dividend a corporation pays is the amount of money, usually a portion 
of the profits, a board of directors distributes to the ordinary shareholders of
the corporation. For example, if a company has one million shares outstand-
ing, and it decides to distribute 3 million dollars to its shareholders, then the
dividend per share is $3 (3 million dollars divided by one million shares).
Some successful firms, such a Berkshire Hathaway, don’t pay dividends.
These companies usually plow dividend payout funds back into the company
to finance expansion, which increases the value of the company and the price
of shares stockholders own. In other words, if all goes as planned, the stock-
holders get capital appreciation instead of a dividend check. Some investors
in high tax brackets prefer this approach. They don’t have to pay taxes on
capital appreciation until they sell the stock. With dividends, investors have
to pay the taxes right away.
The annual return is the percentage difference of the stock price at the begin-
ning of the year from the stock price at the end of the year plus any dividends
paid. The price at which you can buy or sell a share of common stock can
change radically. As a matter of fact, stock prices are so volatile that accu-
rately predicting annual returns is impossible. (If we had this gift, we would
all be rich!)
Common stock returns can vary — for example, from a depressing –43.34 
percent in 1931 to a thrilling 53.99 percent in 1933. However, over 73 years,
investments in the stock market have consistently outperformed any other
type of investment. For example, the return on $1 invested in the S & P Index
from the year-end of 1925 through 1998 would be $2,350.89. A dollar invested
for the same 73 years in Treasury bonds would be worth $43.93.

Participating in the Market
Just like other investments, several categories of stocks are available to try.
Each stock type has characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks that you should
be aware of before you invest. The following sections offer a quick summary
to help you gain an understanding of these financial instruments.
Common stocks
When people think about investing, they tend to think primarily of common
stocks. After all, it’s difficult not to be bombarded daily with stock market
news and commentary. Additionally, American history is filled with stories
142
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

about how the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, Carnegies, and other turn-of-the-
century entrepreneurs made their fortunes on Wall Street with common
stocks.
Both new and old companies sell common stock to raise capital to fund oper-
ations and expand their businesses. Common stocks represent shares of own-
ership in a corporation. Shareholders have a right to dividends and can vote
on mergers, acquisitions, and other major issues affecting the corporation.
Additionally, shareholders have a voice in the election of the board of direc-
tors. Dividends are paid at the discretion of the board of directors. The liabili-
ties of being a shareholder are limited. Shareholders can’t lose any more than
the amount of their investments.
Preferred stocks
Preferred stocks are also equity stocks in a corporation. However, preferred
stockholders cannot cast their votes on issues regarding company manage-
ment. For this trade-off, the stockholder gets another benefit: a fixed dividend
amount. Preferred stock is sold at par value (face value). The par value of pre-
ferred stocks is usually $25, $35, or $100. The company assigns a fixed divi-
dend. Preferred stocks (sometimes called hybrids because they include the
features of both stocks and bonds) compete with bonds and other interest-
bearing financial instruments, which means that the amount of the dividend 
is affected by the current interest rate at the time that the preferred stock is
issued. In other words, to make a preferred stock issue attractive to investors,
higher dividends tend to be issued when interest rates are high. Lower divi-
dends are issued when interest rates are low. Preferred stockholders are paid
their dividends regularly, and the stock has no maturity date.
Picking the Right Stock 
for the Right Goal
Selecting your own stocks can be hard work. The exciting thing is that the
Internet has much of the information you need, and most of this information
is free. With the power of your computer, you can utilize Internet data to gain
real insight (as you can see in the next two chapters). As you start to deter-
mine which stocks you’re interested in, you should be aware of the different
types of stocks. Stocks have distinct characteristics, and as general economic
conditions change, they behave in special ways.
Write a short list of your financial goals and then investigate how different
types of stocks relate to those objectives. Different stocks have different
rates of return — some are better for young, aggressive investors; others are
143
Chapter 8: The Basics of Stocks and Rates of Return

better for retirees or for people in high tax brackets. Here are a few examples
of the different types of stocks that may match your investor objectives:
 Blue-chip stocks: Usually the most prestigious stocks on Wall Street,
these high-quality stocks have a long history of earnings and dividend
payments. These stocks are often good long-term investments.
 Cyclical stocks: The fortunes of these companies rise when business
conditions are good. When business conditions deteriorate, their earn-
ings and stock prices decline. These companies are likely to be manufac-
turers of automobiles, steel, cement, and machine tools.
 Seasonal stocks: Similar to cyclical stocks, these companies’ fortunes
change with the seasons. Good examples of seasonal companies are
retail corporations whose sales and profits increase at Christmastime.
 Defensive stocks: These stocks tend to be stable and relatively safe in
declining markets. Defensive stocks are from companies that provide
necessary services, such as electricity and gas, which everyone needs
regardless of the economic climate. Companies in this category also 
provide essentials such as drugs and food, so their sales remain stable
when the economy is depressed. (Note: Defensive stocks are not related
to the military.)
 Growth stocks: Growth companies are positioned for future growth and
capital appreciation. However, their market price can change rapidly.
Rather than pay dividends, growth companies typically spend their prof-
its on research and development to fuel future growth. These stocks are
good for aggressive, long-term investors who are willing to bet on the
future. If you’re in a high tax bracket, these stocks may be for you; low
dividends mean fewer taxes. But if expected earnings don’t match ana-
lyst predictions, expect a big decline in stock price.
 Income stocks: Purchased for their regular, high dividends, income
stocks usually pay bigger dividends than their peers do. Income stocks
are attractive to retirees who depend on their dividends for monthly
expenses. Income stocks are often utilities companies and similar firms
that pay higher dividends than comparable companies. These compa-
nies are often slow to expand because they spend most of their cash on
dividend payouts. During times of declining interest rates, bonds are
better investments.
 International stocks: Investors in these stocks often believe that U.S.
domestic stocks are overpriced. These investors are seeking bargains
overseas. However, international stocks include some risks that U.S.
stocks don’t have, such as trading in another currency, operating in a
different economy, being subject to a different government, and using
accounting standards that don’t follow U.S. generally accepted account-
ing principles. Public information may have to be translated, which
causes delays and sometimes miscommunication. All these elements
add cost and risk to foreign stocks.
144
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 Speculative stocks and initial public offerings: Speculative stocks are
easy to identify because they have price/earnings (P/E) ratios that are
frequently twice as high as other stocks. For example, the S & P 500
Index has a median P/E ratio of 23.2. Speculative companies have a high
probability of failure. However, if they succeed, the returns can be very
large. A speculative stock could have a P/E ratio of more than 75, in an
industry with an average P/E ratio of 50. A second type of speculative
stock is an initial public offering (IPO). This type of stock often has no
track record. A good example of speculative stock is Taser; (TASR) its
stock price is relatively high, and its revenues are small.
 Value stocks: Some Wall Street analysts consider these stocks to be 
bargains. These stocks have sound financial statements and earning
increases, but are priced less than stocks of similar companies in the
same industry.
What Does the S & P 500 
Have to Do with Anything?
You can measure how good or bad an investment is by comparing it to a
market index. For example, the Standard & Poor’s (S & P) 500 tracks a broad
group of large capitalization stocks that are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange and NASDAQ/AMEX. (I define the term large capitalization stocks,
or large cap stocks, later in this section.) You can see the S & P Web site at
www2.standardandpoors.com.
Each stock in the S & P 500 Index is weighted by the relative market value 
of its outstanding shares. Overall, the index represents the performance
obtained in the stock market for large capitalization stocks. This index pro-
vides performance information so that you can compare the stocks in your
portfolio to the market. If your returns are better than the market, you’re
doing well. If your returns are lower than the market, you need to reevaluate
your stock selections.
When you compare the performance of your stock to a market index, you 
can determine whether the stock outperformed the market, maintained the
market rate, or underperformed. As Table 8-1 shows, however, not all market
indexes are alike. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the most well-known
index, but it includes only 30 large, mature, consumer-oriented companies.
The Wilshire 5000 is the most comprehensive index of common stock prices
regularly published in the United States and may be the best indicator of
overall market performance. As you can see in Table 8-1, the S & P 500 tracks
the performance of large capitalization stocks. In other words, the S & P 500
isn’t the appropriate index for evaluating the performance of your small capi-
talization stock.

Table 8-2 helps to explain why the S & P 500 may not be the appropriate index
to compare to your small capitalization stock. Capitalization (or cap) is the
total number of shares outstanding multiplied by the current stock price of
those shares. For example, a firm with 1 million common shares outstanding
at $55 per share has capitalization of $55 million, which makes the company a
small cap firm. Table 8-2 shows a quick estimate of how the capitalization of
different companies sorts out.

Category

Micro cap
Less than $50 million
Small cap

Mid cap

Large cap

According to Standard & Poor’s, small capitalization stocks have outperformed
large capitalization stocks over time. Over certain short-term periods, however,
this overperformance may not hold true. From 1983 to 1990, small capitaliza-
tion stocks, as a group, underperformed larger capitalization firms. From 1991
to 1993, both small and mid-capitalization firms have outperformed large capi-
talization companies. During times of market volatility, small capitalization
stocks tend to fall faster and harder than their bigger siblings. For example,
between June 12 and August 23, 1996, NASDAQ was down 7.48 percent. During
146
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

the same time period, the MicroCap 50 was down 24.52 percent. Following the
“bursting of the bubble in 2000,” small capitalized stocks have outperformed
the market. 
Paying the Right Price
You can use several methods to determine the fair value of a stock. Throughout
the following sections, I discuss three of the more popular methods of deter-
mining the right price for a stock: 
 Fundamental analysis
 Technical analysis 
 Market timing
Valuing securities is important to your financial health. Stocks are more diffi-
cult to value than bonds. Bonds have a limited life and a stated payment rate
(for more on bonds, turn to Chapter 13). Common stocks don’t have a limited
life or an upper dollar limit on cash payments. This uncertainty makes stocks
harder to value than bonds. Common stock can be valued in a number of dif-
ferent ways, but overall, the value of a stock is the present value of all its
future dividends. However, common stockholders aren’t promised a certain
dividend each year. The dividend is based on the profitability of the company
and the board of directors’ decision to pay dividends to stockholders.
The second source of return for a stock is the increased market price of the
stock. If the company decides not to pay dividends and reinvests profits in
the firm, the company’s future profits and dividends should grow. This addi-
tional value should be reflected in a stock price increase in the future.
Fundamental analysis seeks to determine the intrinsic value of securities
based on underlying economic factors. It’s the most widely accepted method
for determining a stock’s true value, which you can then compare to current
prices to estimate current levels of mispricing. Fundamental analysts usually
forecast future sales growth, expenses, and earnings.
Getting down to fundamentals
Fundamental analysis focuses on the underlying economics of the company
being researched. Analysts try to forecast sales, earnings, and expenses, which
in turn are used to forecast the company’s stock price or returns. All U.S. busi-
ness schools support this methodology because fundamental analysis seeks to
paint the whole economic picture of the company being analyzed.
147
Chapter 8: The Basics of Stocks and Rates of Return

Fundamental analysis relies on forecasts of the economy, the industry, and
the company’s commercial prospects. Analysts use fundamental analysis to
determine the intrinsic value or fair value of a stock. The fair value is com-
pared to market values to determine whether the stock is underpriced or
overpriced. In other words, the objective of fundamental analysis is to locate
mispriced stocks or undervalued stocks. Fundamental analysis is the most
frequently used approach for common stock valuations.
If the stock has higher risk than usual (because of past volatility, political tur-
moil, or other factors), investors include a risk premium in the required rate
of return. This risk premium serves to compensate the investor for the higher
than normal risk.
After you crunch all the numbers, do a reality check. The fundamental analy-
sis methodology is limited because it often assumes that the investor holds
the stock until termination of the company. If you hold the stock for a short
time, you may not get all the expected returns. Additionally, companies,
accountants, investors and analysts can make errors in dividend projections
or may ignore relevant external factors, which can result in not valuing the
stock correctly. Before you log on to your broker, you need to review your
analysis and the data you collected. It’s your money and your investment
decision. What do you think is going to happen to this company in the future?
Using online tools to value stocks
You can visit the following Web sites for more about fundamental analysis
and valuing stocks:
 Global Value Investing with Stock Valuation (www.numeraire.com/
index.html) offers an article that illustrates why stock prices and stock
screens are different from stock valuation. You also find an online dis-
count cash flow valuator. The valuator uses models based on intrinsic
value for the valuation of common stocks and other investment assets.
That is, the model uses the discounted cash flow approach for determin-
ing fair market value. Results are shown in text, tabular, and graphical
formats.
 Stockworm (www.stockworm.com) was developed several years ago by
several academics who were interested in investing and the financial mar-
kets. It offers stock analysis, customizable technical charts, stock screen-
ers, and portfolio management strategies. Stockworm offers three levels of
subscriptions and a free two-week trial. Analyst membership is $7.95 per
month for stock valuations, comparisons to industry averages, and techni-
cal trading signals. A Manager membership is $14.95 per month for every-
thing in the Analyst level plus advanced stock screeners and portfolio
tracking. Autoinvestor is $29.95 per month and includes everything on 
the previous levels and is geared for investors who want the next level of
148

automating portfolio buy/sell recommendations. Investors configure rule-
based strategies for long or short selling (for example, buy a stock if it is
in the top 20 results of the screener) and receive daily alerts.
 ValuEngine.com (www.valuengine.com) was developed by Yale
University’s Dr. Zhiwu Chen and his team of experts. ValuEngine is a 
proprietary model for valuing stocks. ValuEngine products include the
stock valuation model (which determines the fair value of stocks), the
ValuEngine stock forecast model (which forecasts the value of stocks),
the ValuEngine portfolio forecast model (which predicts the likely return
of a portfolio), and the ValuEngine Portfolio Advisor Model (which sug-
gests ways to maximize the future gains of a portfolio). There are no
charges for stock valuations. Premium membership is $24.95 per month
with a free seven-day trial. Subscriptions include delayed quotes, portfo-
lio functions, portfolio optimization, advance screening, detailed stock
analyses and forecasting, multistock comparisons, research by analysts,
and benchmark portfolios.
 ValuePro (www.valuepro.net) was developed by finance professors 
to complete stock valuations based on discounted cash flow. The latest
improvements include the ability to download data. The financial valua-
tion software, which is $44.95, allows you to download data from the
ValuePro Web site to your computer and to use the ValuePro software 
to analyze your investments.
You can also use the ValuePro Online Stock Valuation Service at no
charge. The Online Valuation Service looks up valuation inputs from the
SEC EDGAR database and other free sources. The online valuation model
uses quarterly and annual income statements, balance sheets, and cash
flow statements to calculate the ratios. The calculations are based on
observed historical data. (You can see how yearly data is used for the
outcome.) The model also attempts to look up data regarding analyst
estimates about growth rates. The model then combines these inputs 
by using the discounted cash flow valuation method to come up with 
a baseline intrinsic value for a stock. You can alter the 19 variables to
update stale data and to fine-tune your long-term fundamentals.
Using the Net to calculate fair value
If you’re averse to math, check out the Value Point Analysis Stock Forum at
www.eduvest.com. The Value Point Analysis computer model was designed
in 1979 to evaluate a stock’s worth in terms of its fundamental economic,
financial factors and the general condition of the money market. The Value
Point Analysis Stock Forum, shown in Figure 8-1, includes a community of
investors who share information about their stock picks and their analyses
using the Web site’s valuation model. To use the model, click Value Point
Analysis Model at the home page. Just enter the factors used by the model.
For additional insight, you can post your results and get feedback from
others. All these features at a price you can’t beat — it’s free!

Chapter 8: The Basics of Stocks and Rates of Return

To determine the intrinsic value (and what some people feel is the real value)
of a stock, the Value Point Analysis Model uses 12 factors. Overall, the Value
Point Analysis Model, which was designed in 1979, is used to evaluate a
stock’s worth in terms of its fundamental economic underpinnings and the
general money market. The model uses the following factors:
1. Corporate name, ticker symbol, and exchange of a stock: This informa-
tion is used to identify the specific stock you’re analyzing.
2. Number of the corporation’s shares outstanding (in millions): This
number represents how many other common shareholders will be paid
dividends.
3. Long-term debt (in millions): Long-term debt is the amount of any loans
or outstanding bonds that mature in five years or more. Debts with
terms of one to four years are considered short- or midterm liabilities.
4. Current dividend payout ($ per share): This number is the annualized
amount of this year’s dividend. For example, imagine that you’re in the
middle of the second quarter. The first quarter dividend is $0.25. The
company pays dividends each quarter. The annualized current dividend
is $1.00. (In other words, 4 × $0.25 = $1.00.)

Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

5. Book value or net worth ($ per share): Many company reports have cal-
culated this number for you. This value is often listed at the bottom of
the balance sheet. The formula to calculate net worth is total assets less
total liabilities. For example, total assets of $100 million less total liabili-
ties of $75 million equal a net worth of $25 million. Net worth divided by
the number of outstanding shares equals the book value per share.
6. Projected earnings ($ per share): Many company reports include expert
forecasts of expected earnings. For example, if earnings for one year are
$1.00, and next year the earnings are $1.10, the growth rate is 10 percent.
You can use experts’ earnings forecasts or the amount you believe is
correct for your analyses. Remember that each quarter you may see
“earnings surprises,” and individual investors have often outsmarted the
so-called experts.
7. Projected average growth in earnings (percent): Without revenue
(sales), you have no profits (earnings), and corporate earnings are what
make stocks valuable. At the beginning of each company’s annual report
is a letter from the CEO. In this letter, the CEO usually states what he or
she expects sales to be for the next year. You may or may not agree with
this statement. Enter the percentage amount that, in your judgment and
based on your research, is correct.
8. Current earnings ($ per share): Current earnings are often called Earnings
per Share and are calculated for you at the bottom of the income state-
ment. In case you have to do your own math, take the net after-tax income
and divide it by the number of outstanding shares of common stock. For
example, $1.5 million net after-tax income divided by 1 million shares is
$1.50 per share.
9. Current sales price ($ per share): Check with an online quote server for
the current sales price of a share of stock.
10. Number of years the earning growth rate is expected to be sustained
(1, 1.5, 2 years, and so on): Some companies have variable growth rates,
and others have a steady increase that can go on for ten years or more.
You need to decide whether the company will sustain its growth rate
and for how long. This decision is a judgment call that investors have to
make.
11. Current yield of AAA Bonds (percent): Luckily, the Value Point Model
fills this number in for you.
12. Projected change of AAA Bonds (percent, 100 basis points = 1%): The
Value Point Analysis Model enters a default amount here. If you agree
with the amount, don’t change it.

The preceding minitable indicates that the Value Point–determined fair value
for the stock is $150.56. The model forecasts earnings of $8.80 and a pro-
jected P/E ratio of 17.11. The Value Point price is 0.93 times the stock’s cur-
rent price. The stock’s current P/E ratio is 19.83. The current yield is 4.94
percent, and the current price is $162. The model assigns a relative risk
factor of 0.86 to its estimate of the stock’s fair value.
In summary, this chart indicates that the stock’s intrinsic value is $150.56.
The stock is currently selling for $162.00. This amount is greater than $150.56,
which indicates that the stock is overpriced. If I were you, I wouldn’t even
think about buying this expensive stock. However, if you already own the
stock, it might be a good time to sell.
Analysis for value shopping
If you’re a bargain shopper, you understand how difficult it is to separate the
treasure from the trash. This search for value extends to investors who are
seeking securities that seem underpriced relative to the fair value or financial
prospects. Experts have a variety of opinions about how to decide whether a
stock is undervalued (and unloved) or just a loser.
T. Rowe Price (www.troweprice.com) has developed one approach to spot-
ting stocks that are selling at bargain-basement prices. At the T. Rowe Price
home page, click Individual Investors. Then select Investment Planning &
Tools➪Publications. Click the Insights Reports link, then Investment
Strategies, and finally the Value Investing link. You see several investment
strategies; find Spotting “True” Bargains. Table 8-3 shows a snapshot of this
methodology. This approach is one way of separating the winners from the
losers. T. Rowe Price suggests that investment candidates meet at least six of
the seven factors listed in Table 8-3. (For more about ratios, see Chapter 9).

The following list explains the terms used in Table 8-3:

by book value. If the current selling price of the stock is below this
amount, the stock is underpriced. Then again, the company may be on
the verge of bankruptcy, which may be why the stock price is depressed.
 Price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio) (2): Reflects how many years of current
earnings must be earned to purchase one share of stock. For example, if
annual earnings are $2 and the stock is selling at $30, the price/earnings
ratio is 15 (30 ÷ 2). Many investors believe that the higher the P/E ratio,
the better. If investors expect earnings to decrease, the P/E ratio will
decrease to below the industry average.
 Cash flow per share (3): Expresses the firm’s net income plus deprecia-
tion and amortization expenses, divided by the number of outstanding
shares.
Note: For more information on many of these terms, see Chapter 9.
Getting technical: Technical analysis
Technical analysis is the study of all the factors related to the supply and
demand of stocks. Unlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis doesn’t
look at underlying earnings potential of a company when evaluating a stock.
In contrast, technical analysis uses charts and computer programs to study
the stock’s trading volume and price movements in hopes of spotting a trend.
Overall, technical analysts don’t care about a company’s fair market or intrin-
sic value. According to Block and Hirt (1999), technical analysis is based on
several assumptions: 
 Market value is based solely by the interaction of supply and demand. 
 Stock market prices are likely to move in trends that persist for long
time periods. However, there may be some minor fluctuations. 
154
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 Reversals of trends are caused by changes in demand and supply. 
 Demand and supply shifts can be detected sooner (or later) in charts. 
 Chart patterns often repeat themselves. 
Technical analysis focuses on stock data analyses and stock market statis-
tics. Analysts generally utilize a series of mathematical measurements and
calculations designed to monitor market activity. Among other things, actual
daily, weekly, and monthly price fluctuations are analyzed. Technical analysts
are searching for early indicators of pattern changes to capitalize on. Trading
decisions are based on signals generated by charts, manual and online calcu-
lations, computer programs, or their combinations.

Technical analysis uses the Dow Theory to analyze individual stocks. However,
Dow developed this methodology to predict changes in the general market.
He didn’t expect his theory to be applied to individual stocks.

Chapter 8: The Basics of Stocks and Rates of Return

The Dow Theory maintains that three major market movements exist. The
first is the daily fluctuations that represent normal activity. The second is
intermediate or secondary movements that last about two weeks to a month
and point out the long-term trends of the market. The third is long primary
trends that indicate either a bull or a bear market.

Decision Point at decisionpoint.com/TAcourse/TAcourseMenu.html.
Technical analysis software
Technical analysis requires large amounts of information (usually historical
price and volume data) that you can manipulate with technical analysis soft-
ware programs. Some programs are designed for different types of securities
and for specific indicators and markets. Additionally, some programs are
designed for beginners, while others are for professionals. Here is a short list
of available programs:
 Equis MetaStock (www.equis.com) offers MetaStock Professional, which
analysts sometimes refer to as the granddaddy of technical analysis soft-
ware, for $1,695. (See the Web site for details.) The Web site includes
back issues of the Equis newsletter, as well as files of tips, system tests,
and custom formulas for use with the software.
 Insider TA (www.stockblocks.com) uses box charting to highlight each
trading period’s volume and high and low prices. Insider TA costs $129
for the Standard version and $229 for the Pro version. A downloadable
demo is available at the Web site.
 Stable Technical Graphs (www.winterra.com) is a Windows-based pro-
gram that analyzes stocks, bonds, commodities, mutual funds, indexes,
and options. Stable Technical Graphs costs $59.95 and offers a down-
loadable full product version for a 30-day trial.

The Tao of investing using the Dow Theory
Although technical analysis consists of many
approaches, the most well-known approach is
the Dow Theory. The Dow Theory is based on
The Wall Street Journal founder Charles H.
Dow’s methodology for identifying signals of
bull and bear markets. The theory suggests that
as soon as the market heads in one direction, it
stays that course until canceled (stopped) by
both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
and the Dow Jones Transportation Average
(DJTA). (It takes both averages to indicate that
the market has changed its course.)

 VectorVest (www.vectorvest.com) uses fundamental valuation and
technical analysis to rank more than 8,000 stocks each day. Stocks are
ranked for value, safety, and timing, and VectorVest gives a Buy, Sell, or
Hold recommendation on every stock, every day. Go to the Web site to
sample the program. Just enter the ticker symbol of the company you’re
analyzing. The special trial offer is for five weeks and costs $9.95.
Subscription prices vary.
Market timing
The underlying theory of market timing is that you purchase stocks when
prices are low and sell when prices are high. The market timing strategy is
based on reams of historical data that are used to discover patterns and rela-
tionships that affect investment returns. Market timing software uses this
data to detect or anticipate changes in market patterns. Market timers note
that the market can underperform for long periods of time. This low perfor-
mance can reduce returns for buy-and-hold investors who decide to go ahead
and sell before the next upswing. In contrast, market timers attempt to time
the purchase and sale of their securities to coincide with ideal market condi-
tions based on their predictions market cycles. 
The biggest problem with market timing is the need to predict when to get
into the market and when to get out of the market (in addition to ensuring
that the timing strategy will make enough increased returns to offset trading
costs). A buy-and-hold strategy makes certain that the investor is in the
market for the days with the biggest gains. Market timers may be out of the
market during these times. For more information about market timing, check
out FirstCapital Corporation (www.firstcap.com).

S
tock screening boils down to finding the answer to one fundamental
question: Which stock (among all stocks) should I buy right now? Of
course, finding the answer to this question requires asking many more spe-
cific questions about stocks — questions that are difficult to answer without
the help of computerized databases.
This chapter shows how you can use the Internet and PC-based stock screen-
ing tools to whittle down the universe of stocks to a manageable few candi-
dates. You can then analyze your short list of stocks for gems that may bring
you above-average returns. (I provide many online tools and sources for your
in-depth analysis in Chapter 11.) Interested in more than stocks? Well, I point
what online brokerages have to offer for screening stocks and other types of
securities. 
Finding the Best Stock Using the Net 
Screening is a process that permits investors to discover and distill useful
information from a larger set of information. The Internet provides many
screening tools that help you prospect stock issues. The goal of stock
screens is to point out which stocks are worth your research and analysis
time.

Some people believe that using a stock screen is like panning for gold. You
use your computer to screen (“pan”) for investment “nuggets” from a long list
of possibilities. The online investor sets the objectives of any single screen.
Different people get different results because no two people have exactly the
same selection criteria or investment philosophy.
Overall, the benefit of stock screens is that they enable you to generate your
own ideas — ideas that generate profits based on your investor savvy. Stock-
screening programs enable you to go beyond finding good stock investments
and assist you in finding the very best stocks.
To identify investment candidates, the stock screen uses your preset criteria,
such as growth (stocks that are expanding faster than the market or their
peers), value (stocks that have strong financial statements but are selling 
at prices below their peers), or income (stocks that provide higher than 
average dividends).
Depending upon the criteria you select, you may have to run several iterations
of the stock screen. For example, your first screen may result in several hun-
dred possibilities. Because you can’t investigate and analyze so many candi-
dates, you have to run a second screen of these results. This fine-tuning should
lead to a manageable list of investment candidates that you can research and
analyze — perhaps between 10 and 20 candidates. You can quickly pare down
this number by using common sense and your investor savvy.
When screening, identifying exactly what types of stocks you seek is impor-
tant. Consider writing down your investment objectives and the characteris-
tics of your ideal investment. Don’t forget to consider your performance
expectations and risk-tolerance level. (For more about setting realistic expec-
tations and determining how much risk you can take, see Chapter 3.)
Choosing the criteria for 
your first stock screen
Typically, you build a stock screen by accessing an online stock-screening
tool and filling out an online form. I offer examples of the variables used in
these forms later in this chapter, in the section “Important ratios for screen-
ing stocks.” The first stock screen that you develop may include quantifiable
variables that you believe are the most important — for example:
 Earnings growth: The percentage of change between current earnings
and earnings for the last quarter or last year.
 Recent earnings surprises: The difference between predicted and actual
earnings.
160
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 Price/earnings (P/E) ratio: The current price of the stock divided by the
earnings per share — that is, net income divided by the total number of
common shares outstanding. For example, value stocks have P/E ratios
below 10 or 12, and growth stocks have P/Es above 20.
 Dividends: The annual cash dividend paid by the company.
 Market capitalization: The number of outstanding shares multiplied by
the current stock price of those shares. Market capitalization is some-
times abbreviated as cap. This value is a measurement of the company’s
size. Firms with high market capitalization are called large cap, and com-
panies with a low market capitalization are called small cap.
Fine-tuning your stock screen
After you select your initial screening criteria, you click Submit, Sort, or a
similar command. A list of stock candidates appears. Often, this list includes
several hundred stocks. This number is still too large to research, so you
should narrow this list by selecting more variables.
You may have some special knowledge about the industry you work in. You
may have used certain products over the years and can use your knowledge
to your advantage. However, keep in mind that a good product doesn’t neces-
sarily mean a good company. You may want to filter out companies that you
just don’t understand. You might also want to filter out companies about
which you lack information. Without at least some basic information, you
can’t perform a complete analysis.
Using your stock screen results
After you complete your second stock screen and sort the data, you should
have a list of 10 to 20 companies. Start a file for each firm and begin to gather
data for your analysis. At this point, you might discover that some companies
aren’t worth additional research — a finding that further reduces your short
list. For example, the company may have filed for bankruptcy, or it may be
targeted for federal investigation. Maybe the company recently paid a large
fine for shady dealings, or the executive management was recently indicted
for fraud, misconduct, or some other crime.
Important ratios for screening stocks
Every industry has its own language, and the financial industry is no excep-
tion. In the following sections, I define the key terms that the finance industry
uses for stock-screening variables.
161
Chapter 9: Internet Stock Screening

Figure 9-1 shows MSN Money Central’s (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/
finder/deluxestockscreen.aspx?query=Righteous+Rockets&btnQryFr
m=Go) Power Search for Righteous Rockets. Righteous Rockets are defined as
companies that appear undervalued, are profitable, and have relatively low
debt, thus making them “righteous.” Additionally, they’re fast growing and
have begun to see significant stock price appreciation — making them “rock-
ets.” The ticker symbol and name of the company is on the left. The criteria
used for this particular stock screen are Market Capitalization, Return on
Equity, Price Sales/Ratio, Debt to Equity Ratio, and Revenue Growth This Year
Compared to Last Year.
The following are definitions of the criteria most often used in screens. I define
these terms so that you can better understand what’s included in prebuilt
screens. When you get comfortable with using prebuilt screens, you can use
these definitions to set parameters to build your own customized screens.
Beta
Beta is the measurement of market risk. The beta is the relationship between
investment returns and market returns. Risk-free Treasury securities have a
beta of 0.0. If the beta is negative, the company is inversely correlated to the
market — that is, if the market goes up, the company’s stock tends to go
down. If a stock’s volatility is equal to the market, the beta is 1.0. In this case,
if the stock market increases 10 percent, the stock price increases 10 percent.
Betas greater than 1.0 indicate that the company is more volatile than the
market. For example, if the stock is 50 percent more volatile than the market,
the beta is 1.5.
Book value
Book value is the original cost, less depreciation of the company’s assets and
outstanding liabilities. (Depreciation is the means by which an asset’s value is
expensed over its useful life for federal income tax purposes.)
Cash flow to share price
The ratio of cash flow to share price is the company’s net income plus depre-
ciation (expenses not paid in cash) divided by the number of shares out-
standing. For companies that are building their infrastructures (such as cable
companies or new cellular companies) and therefore don’t yet have earnings,
this ratio may be a better measure of value than earnings per share (EPS).
Current ratio
Current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. A current ratio of
1.00 or greater means that the company can pay all current obligations with-
out using future earnings.
162
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

Debt to equity ratio
To determine the debt to equity ratio, divide the company’s total amount of
long-term debt by the total amount of equity. (Equity is defined as the residual
claim by stockholders of company assets, after creditors and preferred stock-
holders have been paid.) This ratio measures the percentage of debt the com-
pany is carrying. Many firms average a debt level of 50 percent. Debt to equity
ratios greater than 50 percent may indicate trouble. That is, if sales decline,
the firm may not be able to pay the interest payments due on its debt.
Dividend yield
Dividend yield is the amount of the dividend divided by the most current
stock price. You can use dividends as a valuation indicator by comparing
them to the company’s own historical dividend yield. If a stock is selling at a
historically low yield, it may be overvalued. Companies that don’t pay a divi-
dend have a dividend yield of zero.
Dividends
Dividends are a portion of a company’s net income paid to stockholders as a
return on their investment. The company’s board of directors can declare or
suspend dividends. A primary benefit of dividends is that once paid, they’re

Chapter 9: Internet Stock Screening

cash that can be banked and can provide a return (in the form of bank inter-
est) when stocks are weak. A limitation of dividends is that they’re taxed as
ordinary income. For an individual investor in a high tax bracket, this can
increase their usual tax bill. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
Earnings are one of the stock’s more important features. After all, the price
you pay for a stock is based on the future earnings of the company. The con-
sistency and growth of a company’s past earnings indicate the likelihood of
stock price appreciation and future dividends. Earnings per share is often
referred to as EPS.
Market capitalization
Market capitalization is the total value of the firm. It’s calculated by multiply-
ing the number of outstanding shares times the current stock price of those
shares. Market capitalization is sometimes called market value.
P/E ratio
You calculate the price-to-earnings ratio by dividing the price of the stock by
the current earnings per share. A low P/E ratio indicates that the company
may be undervalued. A high P/E ratio indicates that the company may be
overvalued.
Price-to-book value ratio
Price-to-book value ratio is tangible assets less liabilities, and the price-to-
book value is the current price of the stock divided by the book value. If the
company has old assets, this ratio may be high. If the company is a new start-
up with fixed assets that haven’t been depreciated, this ratio may be very
low. Therefore, you need to compare this ratio to industry standards and
other information about the company.
Return on equity (ROE)
Return on equity (ROE) is usually equity earnings as a proportion of net
worth. You divide the most recent year’s net income by shareholders’ 
equity (shareholders’ equity is assets minus liabilities) to calculate ROE.
Shares outstanding
The term shares outstanding refers to the total number of shares for a com-
pany’s stock. To determine the firm’s outstanding shares, you need the most
recent data. The shares outstanding can be calculated by taking issued shares
on the balance sheet and subtracting treasury stock. Treasury stock is stock
issued but not outstanding by virtue of being held (after it is repurchased) by
the firm.

Starting with Quick Online Stock Screens
Web-based stock screens can require between 2 and 80 variables.
Computerized stock databases can include anywhere from 1,000 stocks to
more than 13,000 stocks. Additionally, computerized stock databases are
updated daily, weekly, or monthly. The best stock screen is the one that
includes your personal investment criteria.
Some stock screeners are very comprehensive and offer excellent results.
Unfortunately, these screens are often the hardest to use. Here are a few
examples of bare-bones stock screeners that offer good results for little
effort:
 CBS MarketWatch.com (cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/stock
research/screener/) is a free intraday stock screen designed to
screen for stocks by using as many or as few parameters as you wish 
to define. All parameters default to None. From 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. EST, 
you can complete after-hours stock screening.

Watching out for investment risks
No one invests in securities to lose money.
However, each security has its own fine print.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC,
at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs.shtml)
provides educational materials on how the
securities industry works, how you can avoid
making investing mistakes, and fraud. To view
PDF files, you can download Adobe Acrobat
Reader for free. The following are examples of
some of the things to watch for:
 The higher the return, the greater the risk.
You may lose some or all of your investment.
 Some investments can’t be easily sold or
converted to cash. For example, you may
have a hard time selling a municipal bond
before it matures.
 If you want to sell an investment quickly,
you may have to pay some penalties or
transaction charges.
 Investments in new companies or compa-
nies that don’t have a long history may
involve greater risk.
 Securities, like mutual funds, aren’t insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion (FDIC).
 The securities you own may change due to
corporate reorganizations, mergers, or
third-party actions. You may be asked to sell
your current shares, or you may be offered
new shares due to this activity. Make cer-
tain that you understand the complexities of
this investment decision before you act.
 Past performance of a security is no guar-
antee of future performance.

 NASDAQ SharpScreen (nasdaq.sharpscreen.com) offers a quick,
printable tutorial for its stock screen. SharpScreen screens more than
6,000 stocks. You can select stocks by business sector, type, and
exchange. Ten additional criteria are available to whittle down your
number of investment candidates.
 Yahoo! Finance (screen.yahoo.com/stocks.html) provides a stock
screen that is easy to use. You also find preset screens that indicate
high-volume stocks, stocks with the greatest sales revenue, largest
market gap, strong forecasted growth, and more.
Using Those Terrific Prebuilt 
Stock Screens
The Internet provides many prebuilt stock screens that use preselected crite-
ria. Some of these screens are very advanced and can make your research
work easier because they already include the investment criteria that you
feel are most important. I describe a few examples in the following list:
 BusinessWeek Online (prosearch.businessweek.com/business
week/general_free_search.html?mode=advanced) offers a quick-
search stock screener and a more advanced stock screener. If you’re
uncertain about a number, just enter “as high as possible” or “as low 
as possible.”
 MSN Money (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/finder/welcome.
asp) offers the Power Search Finder, which identifies stocks that best
match your investing strategy. The 30 prebuilt stock screens are divided
into technical screens (patterns of price or volume) and fundamental
screens (using profits, sales, and other business factors). Screens are
based on criteria favored by MSN Money Investor editors and well-
known professionals.

Advanced Techniques for 
Building Stock Screens 
This section outlines several ways to set up stock screens that may be benefi-
cial for your information mining. I offer a few examples of ways you can build
stock screens to discover specific categories of stocks. I use the categories of
growth stocks, income stocks, and value stocks for these examples.
Screening for growth stocks
Growth stocks expand at rates faster than their counterparts. They have 
different degrees of risk and are a way of betting on the future. Your stock
screen for growth stocks may consider the following criteria:
 Basic growth: Any stocks that have an earnings growth of 15 percent or
more in one year.
 Long-term growth: Any stocks that grew 15 percent or more in one year
over the past five years. (Companies must have historical EPS records of
over five years.)
 Earnings for growth: Stocks that have a price-to-earnings ratio that is
equal to or less than the growth rate of the stock plus its dividend yield.
167
Chapter 9: Internet Stock Screening

 Aggressive growth companies with low P/E ratios: Stocks with annual
earnings growth of more than 24 percent and P/E ratios of less than 15.
(P/E ratios of less than 15 are preferable, but rare in the current market.)
Screening for income stocks
Income stocks tend to be stodgy, boring, slow-growth companies that are
steady income producers. You may want to include dividend yield in your
stock screen for income stocks. For example, you may screen for any stocks
with a dividend yield that’s at least equal to the S & P 500 and that never 
falls below 4 percent. (This criterion rules out growth stocks that don’t pay
dividends.)
Screening for value stocks
Value stocks are companies that have strong financial statements and good
earnings but are traded at stock prices that are less than their industry
peers. Some criteria that you may want to include in your stock screen for
value stocks include the following:
 Book value: Stocks for which the book value of the company is less than
80 percent of the average S & P 500 stock.
 Debt/equity ratio: Stocks for companies with a debt/equity ratio of 50
percent or less.
 P/E ratio: Stocks for which the average of the company’s five-year earn-
ings is not less than 70 percent of the average P/E ratio of the S & P 500.
Don’t include stocks with a P/E ratio greater than 12. (A low P/E ratio
may indicate that the stock is selling at a bargain price.)
 Underpriced stocks: Three criteria exist for this section of the value
stock screen:
• Small cap stocks with quick ratios (current assets less inventory
divided by current liabilities) greater than 1.0 and return on assets
(ROA) greater than 0.0
• A price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) that is half of that industry’s
average
• A price-to-book value ratio of 80 percent or less, and a price-to-
sales ratio of 33 percent or less

Screening for Investment Bargains
Investors are always searching for a competitive edge that will enable them 
to beat the market. (Beating the market is usually defined as selecting stocks
that outperform — that is, provide greater returns than — the S & P 500
Index.) The following sections describe several stock screen variables that
you may want to factor into your stock selection strategy. However, keep
your risk-tolerance level in mind. After all, you do want to sleep at night.
Stocks selling at below book value
Some stock screens enable you to sort for stocks that have a current selling
price below book value. Book value is defined as the depreciated value of a
company’s assets (original cost less accumulated depreciation) less the out-
standing liabilities.
Purchasing stocks at below book value may be a bargain-hunter’s dream but
requires additional research on your part. A company’s total assets are often
the accounting values of assets purchased over time — in other words, the
historical price of an asset less depreciation. For example, the firm may have
fully depreciated a 20-year-old building. The sales value of the building may 
be in the millions, but the value listed on the balance sheet may be zero. (This
difference causes the book value to be understated.) Or the building may have
environmental problems (because of improper industrial waste disposal, for
example) that will cost the owners millions to clean up. In this case, the book
value is overstated.
Before purchasing the stock, the prudent investor determines why a company
is selling at below book value. Check out the following good online sources for
this type of data: The company’s annual, quarterly, and other miscellaneous
reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.
gov), and Reuters Investor (www.investor.reuters.com) offers company
profiles and financial highlights.
Try different approaches to your research. For example, you may be able to
discover some interesting facts about the company if it was a failed merger 
or acquisition candidate. If a large corporation or an investment bank didn’t
want to buy the company, you may want to follow suit.
Securities selling below liquidation value
Your bargain hunting may guide you to screening for stocks that are selling
below their liquidation value. Liquidation value of a company is defined as the
169
Chapter 9: Internet Stock Screening

dollar sum that could be realized if an asset were sold independently of the
going concern. (Assets are listed in company annual reports. A good Internet
source for these reports is Dun & Bradstreet at www.dnb.com.) For example,
suppose that no market demand exists for the company’s barrel staves and
buggy whips, and the company discontinues those product lines. The machin-
ery used to manufacture those products still bears value. The appraised value
of the manufacturing equipment is determined as a separate collection. The
values of the firm’s ongoing or discontinued operations are not factored into
this price.
Stocks selling at below liquidation value may be valuable, but you should
consider the priority of claims if the company is forced into bankruptcy.
Claims against company assets are paid in the following order: (1) secured
creditors; (2) expenses incurred for administration and bankruptcy costs; (3)
expenses incurred after filing bankruptcy; (4) salaries and commissions (not
to exceed a set amount) that were earned within three months of filing bank-
ruptcy; (5) federal, state, and local taxes; (6) unsecured creditors; (7) pre-
ferred stock; and finally, (8) you, the common stockholder.
Stocks with low P/E ratios
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the current price of a stock divided by the
earnings for one share of stock and is the value that the investment commu-
nity places on $1 of the company’s earnings. For example, if the current price
of the stock is $60 and the earning per share (for the last 12 months) is $3,
the P/E ratio is 20 ($60/$3).
Note: In Wall Street–speak, the earnings per share (EPS) for the last 12 months
when used in the preceding formula is often called the trailing P/E ratio. You’re
likely to see the trailing P/E ratio listed as a variable in the online stock screens.
P/E ratios vary by industry, so unless you find out the industry average, you
can’t determine whether a stock has a low P/E ratio. Luckily, Reuters Investor
(www.investor.reuters.com) and the Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com)
provide this information for free. At Reuters Investor, enter the ticker symbol
or name of the company you’re researching. In the left margin, click Ratios. 
At the public Wall Street Journal, enter the ticker symbol or company name 
in the quote box at the top of the page. Click Valuations and Ratios in the left
margin. When analyzing a P/E ratio, you want to look at the trend of the com-
pany’s P/E ratio over the last five to seven years. Companies that the invest-
ment community expects to grow will have higher P/E ratios than others in
the same industry.
Bargain hunters may want to set the variables in their stock screens for low
P/E ratios because a company with a P/E ratio of 20 is a more expensive stock
than one with a P/E ratio of 10. However, companies with low P/E ratios may
170
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

be cheap for good reason. For example, one way to analyze the P/E ratio is to
compare it to the company’s growth rate. The company’s P/E ratio and
growth rate should be equal. The stock price is the present value of all the
future earnings. Therefore, if the P/E ratio is low, the company may be
plagued by slow growth.
What a low P/E ratio is or what it indicates may be difficult to determine. For
example, the company may have a low P/E ratio because investors are bailing
out, which can drive the stock price down and make the stock appear inexpen-
sive. Say that a $60 stock drops to $30 per share. The P/E ratio will be reduced
to 10 ($30/$3). The stock is now half-priced, but it may not be a good purchase
if the company is headed toward bankruptcy or has a major problem.
Companies reporting deficits
You may want to set up your stock screen to determine which companies in 
a certain cyclical industry are reporting deficits (losses). Cyclical stocks are
dependent on external environmental factors, such as the national economy,
housing sales, and consumer confidence. You can check out these good online
sources of industry information: Lexis-Nexis (www.lexis-nexis.com) and
STAT-USA (www.stat-usa.gov). Cyclical stocks have peaks (high points) and
valleys (low points) in their revenues, profits, and stock prices. These peaks
and valleys can mean that some cyclical companies with strong foundations
may be experiencing flat earnings or deficits due to their business cycles.
Be certain that you understand the company’s business operations. High
fliers can crash and burn. For example, you may want to avoid companies
that have no earnings or whose stock prices are based on planned new 
products, corporate restructuring, or strategic partnering.
The trick with cyclical stocks is to purchase the stock when it’s in a valley in
the cycle and sell when it’s near the peak. A good indicator that the upward
part of the cycle may be about to begin is when the P/E ratio is high and the
EPS (earnings per share) is low. Other external environmental factors may
indicate that the stock is approaching its peak. For example, a sudden drop 
in housing starts might indicate that your shares in a furniture company are
near their peak and it’s time to sell.
Prospective turnaround candidates
Using stock screen variables to locate companies that are laggards in sales,
earnings, and profits is one way to locate turnaround candidates. The value
of investing in turnarounds is that the stock may increase two or three times
as the company becomes successful.

Chapter 9: Internet Stock Screening

Early-stage companies often have ups and downs, but mature companies that
have problems frequently don’t get a second chance to improve their funda-
mentals. These fallen angels often have problems with inconsistent product
quality, slow response to changing market conditions, high operating costs,
low employee involvement, poor customer service, and inadequate methods
of allocating resources. Often, management is negative, risk-averse, and
bureaucratic. All these factors prevent the company from becoming competi-
tive. The result is that analysts and investors are waiting for a turnaround
that never appears.
The preceding situation highlights how timing is everything when investing
in troubled companies. The company has to survive long enough to get well.
For troubled companies, a larger, more mature company that owns real estate
and has cash on hand is superior to a small company with limited resources
and rented office space. After all, the company needs to be solvent in order
to make a comeback.
Don’t be fooled by quick profits when the company starts slashing budgets
and implementing a recovery plan. These short-term gains will likely disap-
pear as customers become wary of doing business with the troubled com-
pany. The comeback road is bumpy. Many companies get off to false starts
and then stumble.
With all these screens, you may think it odd that mutual funds and bonds are
forgotten investments. Many online brokerages offer stock, bond, and mutual
fund screens to their customers. The more flexible the screener, the better it
is. Flexible screeners allow you to set the parameters for the investment can-
didates that meet your individual investor profile. Table 9-1 illustrates the
characteristics of a few screeners offered by several online brokerages.

Using a screen provided by your online brokerage can save you time and
effort. If you’re in the market for several different types of securities, online
brokerages are a good place for one-stop shopping. However, if you want to
create your own screens (or customize prebuilt screens) and save them for
later, you may want to try some of the screens I discussed earlier in this
chapter.
At Bloomberg.com (www.bloomberg.com), you can analyze more than 18,000
funds at its Fund Center. At the home page, click Charts and Analysis and then
Fund Center. If you know the ticker symbol for the fund you’re researching, you
can discover its rank. You can also rank funds by sector and discover the top
ten ranking funds. Click a fund for a detailed profile. You can also sort funds
by clicking their headings, such as NAV.

I
n the past, only large financial institutions had access to high-quality
financial data. Clients didn’t have anywhere else to go for stock advice,
which meant that bankers and stockbrokers charged customers hefty com-
missions for their research and recommendations. Much of this data is now
available on the Internet. Some of the databases are free, and some are fee-
based. Databases that charge fees require subscription fees — payment by
month, by database, or by document.
Even with free or low-cost information, researching stocks is still hard work.
Doing so requires good judgment, the ability to fit all the bits and pieces of
information together, and excellent decision-making skills. If you’re thinking
about investing in stocks, you need to research the following information:
 Companies: Profiles, management, financial health, insider trading,
potential mergers, and acquisitions
 Industries: Industrial markets, industrial standards, and trends
 Economic indicators: The national, regional, and local economics
 Other factors: New legislation, technological breakthroughs, and new
stock offerings

Often, the best starting point for researching the stock of a certain company is
its annual report. The best place to find annual reports is on the Internet. This
chapter shows you how to locate annual reports by using a search engine, spe-
cial company locator sites, investor super-sites, and EDGAR — the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s online database.
Publicly traded companies are required to file quarterly reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov). These reports provide
updates of the company’s activities since it filed its annual report. If the com-
pany is going through a momentous change (such as a merger or acquisi-
tion), it’s required to file more often.
You can find important information about a company in its annual report, 
but annual reports require careful reading. This chapter shows you how to
download an annual report and analyze any publicly traded company. After
all, reading a company’s annual report is a little like kicking the tires of a 
used car. You want to make certain that you get what you think you’re
buying.
Finding Financial Statements Online
If you’re a stockholder, you automatically receive the company’s annual
report. Annual reports are also free for the asking to anyone else. All you
have to do is call the firm’s investor relations department and request a 
copy.

Part II: Finding the Right Investments 
Accuracy in annual reports
According to a report by the Huron Consulting
Group (www.huronconsultinggroup.com)
titled the 2003 Annual Review of Financial
Reporting Matters, 206 companies restated their
annual filings with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2003, up from 183
in 2002, 140 in 2001, and 98 in 2000. In most cases,
these corrections wiped out the profits that
investors relied on when determining the value
of the company’s stock. Additionally, lax stan-
dards and complicated transactions make
understanding annual reports harder than ever
before. The company books for American busi-
nesses are sometimes so complicated that even
experienced forensic accountants find them dif-
ficult to understand. As difficult as these reports
are, taking the time to understand the nature and
economic foundation of a company — before
you invest in it — is very important.

For online investors, getting annual reports is even easier. The Internet pro-
vides four sources for annual reports:
 Annual report Web sites: These Web sites are designed for investors,
shareholders, and money managers who want instant access to com-
pany annual reports. Many sites include additional company quarterlies,
fact books, and press releases.
 Company Web sites: Many companies have sites on the Internet that
include their annual reports. You can use special corporate linking sites
and commercial search engines to find these company sites.
 Investor compilation sites: These Internet investor super-sites often
include annual reports, company news, earnings forecasts, and other
useful information.
 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings: The SEC does a
good job of making electronically filed company reports available online
to the public.
In the following sections, I show you how to find annual reports by using
these sources.
Accessing Web Sites That Specialize 
in Annual Reports
The Internet features Web sites that focus on the individual investor’s need
for company information. These sites deliver annual reports in a variety of
ways. For example, you can order hard copies of the original reports, immedi-
ately access online annual reports, or view annual reports in their original
formats using free Internet plug-ins. Here are a few examples of these investor
information services:
 Annual Report Gallery (www.reportgallery.com) offers over 3,000
annual reports that cover the majority of Fortune 500 companies. The
Web site is easy to use. Investors are able to look for a company through
five search criteria: alphabetically, by company name, by ticker symbol,
by sector, or by industry. Once a company is found, it can be viewed in
either HTML (Hypertext Markup Language — the language of the
Internet) or PDF (Portable Document Format) format.
 Investor Relations Information Network (www.irin.com), shown in
Figure 10-1, offers more than 11,600 free company historical and current
annual reports in their original formats. Annual reports may include pho-
tographs, graphs, and text. You use the Adobe Acrobat Reader program to
read the information, which comes to you in the form of PDF files. (With
177
Chapter 10: Using Company Information to Make Investment Decisions

Acrobat Reader, you can read PDF files on Windows, Macintosh, DOS, and
UNIX operating systems. You can download a free copy of Acrobat Reader
from the Adobe Web site at www.adobe.com or by clicking a link on the
IRIN Web site.) To find an annual report, just enter the first few letters of
the ticker symbol or company name.
 Public Register’s Annual Report Service (www.prars.com) is free and
provides hard-copy annual reports from more than 3,600 companies.
This service saves investors time by allowing them to order up to eight
reports at one time. Search criteria for finding an annual report may
include any or all of the following items: industry, ticker symbol, state of
business, exchange, or all companies beginning with a certain letter.
 The Wall Street Journal Online (wsjie.ar.wilink.com/asp/wsj3_
search_eng.asp) offers a free annual report service provided by World
Investor Link and The Wall Street Journal Interactive. The annual report
service provides investors with quick access online and hard copies of
annual reports from select companies. You have several search options,
such as selecting a company by using an alphabetical listing, selecting a
company by industry, or selecting a company by its name.

Using Web Sites That Link 
to Company Home Pages
Numerous publicly traded companies have Web sites on the Internet. Many
commercial search engines and special business Web site locators provide
links to the home pages of large businesses. These sites often include the
company’s annual reports as part of the firm’s public relations and investor
services. For example, the Web100 (metamoney.com/w100), shown in 
Figure 10-2, provides links to the 100 largest U.S. and international busi-
nesses on the Internet. You can sort the database by company name or by

Chapter 10: Using Company Information to Make Investment Decisions

Researching a Company’s SEC Filing
In the United States, publicly traded companies are required to file business
and financial information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
These reports are entered into a government-sponsored database called
EDGAR (www.sec.gov), which stands for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis,
and Retrieval. The SEC’s EDGAR service provides downloadable data that can
be accessed by individual investors. You also can save SEC reports on a disk
and read them at a later time. One disadvantage of this free service is that
financial data can’t be downloaded to your spreadsheet program.
When you search the EDGAR database, you’re asked for the report number of
the document you want. The reports are numbered in the following manner:
 10-K reports: Annual reports that include shareholder information cov-
ering the firm’s fiscal year
 10-Q reports: Quarterly reports that include shareholder information for
the firm’s last quarter
 8-K reports: Interim reports covering an odd period due to a merger,
acquisition, or other event
 S-1 registration: Forms required for businesses that want to offer stock
to the public; often used for initial public offerings
 S-3 registration: Registration of a secondary offering; necessary form to
offer stock to the public after an initial public offering
 14-A form: Information about voting matters and candidates seeking
election to the board of directors; also called a proxy
Annual reports may include more than 50 pages and often exceed 100 pages.
For example, the 10-K annual reports include descriptions of the business,
business properties, legal proceedings, stockholder voting matters, selected
financial data, management’s discussion of the firm’s financial condition and
results of operations, financial statements and supplementary data, changes
in accounting procedures and financial disclosures, insider transactions,
executive compensation, and leasing agreements.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and investors
On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act went into effect. Although the Act
was adopted in response to accounting and corporate governance scandals
at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other large public companies, its ramifica-
tions extend to smaller public companies as well.
180
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

The Act mandates a number of reforms to enhance corporate responsibility,
to improve financial disclosures, and to combat corporate and accounting
fraud. It also created a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
to oversee the activities of auditing professionals. The following are a few
highlights of the Act that might interest investors:
 CEO and CFO certifications are required for periodic reports.
 Annual reports must be filed within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year.
 Accelerated filing of insider transaction reports is required.
 Companies are required to adopt codes of ethics for senior financial 
officers.
 Real-time disclosure of material information is now required.
 Companies must disclose off-balance sheet transactions.
 Companies are prohibited from making loans to directors or executive
officers.
 Insider trades are prohibited during pension plan blackouts.
 Stricter conflict-of-interest rules have been put into place.
 New securities fraud offenses are punishable by 25 years of imprison-
ment and a fine.
 SEC enforcement authority is enhanced.
The full text of the Act is available at www.law.uc.edu/CCL/SOact/soact.

Oxley Act at www.sec.gov/spotlight/sarbanes-oxley.htm.

Many free and fee-based SEC search engines are available online. Free search
engines provide users with easy, basic access to SEC EDGAR filings. You can
search the databases for the information that you require in a number of
ways. For example, you may want to research the most recent SEC filings, 
or look up documents by company or fund name, filings by industry type or
ticker symbol, or some other way. You can then view documents on-screen,
clicking a table of contents to move to various sections of a document. Fee-
based SEC search engines provide more search tools, such as
 10-K Wizard (www.10kwizard.com) provides fee-based services. The
service allows investors unlimited searches of real-time SEC EDGAR fil-
ings, insider trading data, and unlimited access to personal alerting. You
can download data in Rich Text Format and tables as MS Excel spread-
sheets. Prices of subscriptions vary. Call 800-365-4608 (toll free) for

Chapter 10: Using Company Information to Make Investment Decisions

Dissecting the Annual Report
Despite their glossiness, annual reports often present many unglamorous but
truthful statements about a company. Sometimes the truth is stretched to
hide potential problems. Therefore, annual reports require your careful and
unemotional reading. Don’t read the small print while you’re wearing rose-
colored glasses.
In general, annual reports consist of nine sections:
 Letter to the shareholders
 Company overview
 Ten-year summary of financial figures
 Management discussion and analysis of operations
 Independent auditor’s report
 Financial statements
 Subsidiaries, brands, and addresses
 List of directors and officers
 Stock price history
As you start analyzing annual reports, you’re likely to notice that each com-
pany has its own style and approach. Additionally, writing the annual report
is often an ongoing company project and not something that happens just at
the end of the fiscal year. As you read the annual report, you may notice that
some sections are clear and straightforward, while other sections may be
almost indecipherable and require your close attention. Several sections may
be lengthy, and others provide just a brief overview. These inconsistencies
are normal because different company departments and individuals write dif-
ferent sections of the annual report.
The following guidelines can help you find your way through the various sec-
tions in an annual report:
 Reading the letter to the shareholders: Although you usually find the
letter to the shareholders within the first couple of pages of the annual
report, save reading this letter for last and then compare it to the facts
you uncover about the company. Is the CEO being truthful with the
shareholders? What is the CEO’s view of the company’s operations?
What does this letter tell you about the character of the CEO?
184
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 Viewing the company overview: After the letter to the shareholders,
the annual report usually presents an overview of the company, which
includes a description of the company’s products and its channels of
distribution.
 Figuring out the ten-year summary of financial figures: Companies
often provide selected financial data. The ten-year summary of financial
figures should indicate the steady growth of the company, if there was
steady growth.
 Analyzing the management discussion and analysis of operations: The
management discussion, which is one of the more significant sections of
the annual report, usually focuses on corporate operations. This section
addresses such issues as how technology has impacted the company,
how the company copes with competition, and what management
expects to accomplish in the next year.
 Scrutinizing the independent auditor’s report: Toward the back of the
annual report, you generally find an opinion letter with a title like Report
of Independent Auditor or The CPA Opinion Letter. Keep in mind that the
company pays the auditor — a fact that may sometimes lead to a biased
annual report. (During the savings-and-loan crisis, for example, the annual
reports of many thrifts didn’t reveal their shaky financial situations.)
The first part of the auditor’s opinion is standard. The key words to look
for are “In our opinion, the financial position stated in the annual report
has been fairly stated in all material aspects and in conformity with gen-
erally accepted accounting principles,” or something to this effect. If this
statement isn’t used, a problem may exist.
 Examining financial statements: Many companies belong to conglomer-
ates that operate in numerous industries and countries. In such cases, it
isn’t possible to compare company performance to any industry aver-
age. The only way you can judge whether the company’s performance is
improving or declining is by comparing current financial ratios to the
firm’s previous ratios.
Often, the notes to the financial statements are the most revealing part
of a financial statement. Notes define accounting policies and disclose
any pending litigation and environmental issues.
 Finding out about subsidiaries, brands, and addresses: Knowing what
the company owns and where the company operates is important. This
knowledge can help investors evaluate the political risk of their invest-
ments. For example, during the time of South Africa’s apartheid, many
individuals boycotted Eastman-Kodak. They protested how Kodak prod-
ucts were used in South Africa. In this age of social conscience investing,
you might not want to own stock in a company that supports initiatives
and products that you disagree with or believe are unsuitable.
185
Chapter 10: Using Company Information to Make Investment Decisions

 Perusing the list of directors and officers: The board of directors listing
usually appears on the last page of the annual report. Few reports pro-
vide details about the experience and professional backgrounds of these
individuals. (Director biographies are usually included on the company’s
proxies to assist you in voting for new or incumbent candidates for the
board of directors.) If you feel that this information is intentionally
deleted, you can call the company’s investor relations department and
ask for a background biography of each director.
 Investigating the stock price history: Evaluating the company’s stock
price history may provide you with some useful insights. For example, is
the current stock price the highest in the history of the company?
When analyzing the financial statements and developing ratios, you should
note the following information:
 Growth in sales: Are sales increasing or decreasing?
 Growth in profits: Are profits growing as fast as sales? Are high interest
payments eating away at profits?
 Profits: Have earnings per share increased every year? (If not, why not?
There may be a logical answer. For example, an aluminum company’s
profits may not rise every year because the commodity price of aluminum
fluctuates.)
 Research and development spending: Does the company spend the
same amount on research and development as similar firms?
 Inventory: Is a change in accounting procedures causing inventories to
go up or down?
 Debt: Are debts increasing?
 Assets: Are most of the company’s assets leased?
 Litigations: Are there any pending litigations (lawsuits)?
 Pension plan: Is the pension plan in bad shape?
 Changes in procedures: Is the company using accounting changes that
may inflate earnings?
The Internet provides many resources that can assist you in reading and
understanding company annual reports. Here are a few examples:
 IBM Financial Guide (www.ibm.com/investor/index_investor
resources.phtml) provides information about how to analyze financial
statements. According to IBM, financial statements and their accompa-
nying notes attempt to explain a company’s financial performance and
186
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

recent financial history. Financial statements are used to evaluate a com-
pany’s overall performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, antici-
pate future successes or problems, and ultimately help decide whether
the company is a good investment opportunity.
 Investopedia (www.investopedia.com/university/fundamental
analysis) offers Intro to Fundamental Analysis. According to the authors
at Investopedia, the massive amount of numbers in a publicly traded
company’s financial statement can confuse and intimidate investors. 
On the other hand, if investors know how to read financial statements,
they can find valuable information.
 The National Association of Investors Corporation (NAIC) (www.
better-investing.org) is a nonprofit educational organization that
supports individual investors and investment clubs. Your online pre-
mium membership provides content and tools to assist you in analyzing
annual reports. Individual memberships include 12 monthly issues of
Better Investing magazine, stock selection or mutual fund handbook, 
a stock or mutual fund kit trial CD-ROM, online premium services or
mutual fund resource center, and other membership benefits. Individual
stock memberships are $50 per year. Individual mutual fund member-
ships are $50 per year. Individual stock and mutual fund memberships
are $80 per year.
Analyzing a Financial Statement
Companies often use their annual reports to attract new investors; you can
guess that these reports contain some marketing fluff and exaggerations.
Most of this embellishment is self-evident. Analyzing a company with a calcu-
lator, paper, and pencil will take you about an hour, and the results of this
examination can help you make sound investment decisions.
Buying stock in a company without reading the annual report is like buying 
a used car without seeing it. Here’s a checklist of the information you need 
to consider while you review a company’s annual report:
 Profitability: How much money did the company make last year?
 Survivability: How is the company coping with competition?
 Growth: Is the company expanding? How fast is this expansion?
 Stability: Is the company subject to radical changes from year to year?
 Dividends (if any): Is dividend growth constant? How does it compare
to the industry averages?
187
Chapter 10: Using Company Information to Make Investment Decisions

 Problems: Does the company have any pending lawsuits? Do any other
problems exist? 
 Risks: Is the company subject to any environmental, political, or
exchange rate risks?
 Other factors: Is the management team experienced? Does the company
need more executive talent?
You Don’t Have to Be a Math 
Whiz to Calculate Ratios
You may want to calculate several ratios that you can then compare to the
company’s previous ratios and to industry averages. Industry averages pro-
vide a benchmark for your analysis. Here are some of the ratios that provide
investor insights:
 Last closing stock price (price per share)
 P/E ratio (current price per share divided by annualized earnings per
share)
 Dividend yield (annual dividend divided by price)
 Return on equity ratio (net income available to common stockholders
divided by common equity)
 Debt to equity ratio (total debt divided by common equity)
 Percentage change in EPS (earnings per share) from the last quarter
(current EPS divided by last quarter’s EPS less 1.00)
 Earnings growth rate (net income from this year divided by last year’s
net income less 1.00)
Company solvency ratios include:
 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities)
 Debt ratio (total debt divided by total assets)
Several software programs can assist you in using the financial data in annual
reports to calculate financial ratios — for example,
 Spreadware (www.spreadware.com) provides Business Financial
Analysis for Windows and Macintosh. This easy-to-use software per-
forms financial statement analysis, cash flow forecasting and analysis,
188
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

and ratio analysis. The financial statement analysis includes cash-flow
analysis, easy-to-use standard data entry, and the popular Z-Score
model, which helps predict the likelihood of a business going bankrupt.
The Business Financial Analysis software costs $99.
 SPREDGAR V4 (www.spredgar.com), shown in Figure 10-4, is a Microsoft
Excel add-in that can convert the text of SEC database reports to your

Utilizing Prepared Online Ratio Analysis
Many organizations provide online annual reports that include ratio analyses,
performance statistics, accounting notes, and other relevant information. You
can download, print, and save all these reports. Much of the downloaded
data is ready for your spreadsheet program and your analytic skills; however,
you may need to reformat some data, and some data just can’t be changed
into a spreadsheet.
Here are several online sources of prepared ratio analysis and company 
information:
 Reuters Investor (investor.reuters.com) has a database of more than
40,000 companies and is constantly updated with new companies and new
corporate information. After your free registration, enter the company
name or ticker symbol you want to analyze and then click Go. In the left
margin, under Financials, click Ratios for a ratio comparison by company,
by industry sector, and against the S & P 500. Click Financial Statements
for the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and so on for analytical informa-
tion about a company.
 Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) offers free company analytic
data from third-party sources, such as Reuters and EDGAR Online. Enter
the company name or ticker symbol of the firm you’re researching and
then click Go. In the left margin, under Company, click Key Statistics to
view the firm’s latest ratios. To see how the company stacks up against
competitors, click Competitors for a direct competitor comparison.
Click Industry to see how the firm is holding up. While on this Web page,
click Sector to see how the company is performing compared to its
sector.
 Zacks (www.zacks.com) offers a quick look at a company’s financials. At
the home page, enter the ticker symbol for the company you’re research-
ing. In the drop-down list next to the ticker symbol, select Financials and
then click Go. In a flash, you receive all the company’s fundamental ratios.
Understanding Bankruptcy
There is no single measure for corporate financial health. However, over-
whelming debt is often the cause of a firm going bankrupt. Companies with a
high debt burden are allowed fewer mistakes than similar companies with
more net worth. 
190

High debt warning signs
The following are a few warning signs that you should look for when analyz-
ing your investment candidates:
 Squeezed by short-term debt: Read the footnotes of the annual report
to determine when the company has to repay any short-term debt, dis-
cover the interest rate they’re paying, and compare this information to
its profit margin. Keep in mind that more than one company has failed
because it couldn’t get an extension on its short-term loan.
 Debt/equity ratio: Companies with inflated accounts receivable or inven-
tory need money to support those assets. When the debt to equity ratio
is 1.0, the firm is supporting an equal amount of debt and equity. If the
debt ratio is less than 0.5, then the firm is considered to be a low debt
firm. Therefore, any company with a debt/equity ratio greater than 0.5
can be considered a bankruptcy candidate.
 Debt/income ratio: If the firm is borrowing money to produce goods or
services at a rate that is lower than their profits, then debt can be a
good thing. Here, debt is divided by the earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization. (If you can’t find this number, you can
try dividing the debt by the operating income.) Most analysts believe a
ratio of between 7 and 8 is sufficient. Bankruptcy candidates often have
double-digit debt to income ratios.
 Interest coverage ratio: If the company is borrowing money to make
money, that’s business. If a company can’t make its interest payments,
that’s bankruptcy. The interest coverage ratio is the operating income
divided by that last 12 month’s worth of interest payments. A healthy
company will have an interest coverage ratio of 4 or more. However,
some highly leveraged companies maintain interest coverage ratios of
about 1.5. Bankruptcy candidates have interest coverage ratios that are
frequently 1.0 or less.

htm. For a long time, researchers attempted to identify a ratio or set of ratios
that provided an early warning of a business going bankrupt. Finally, in the
1960s, Edward Altman combined five ratios into what has become known as
the Altman Z-Score, the best-known predictor of bankruptcy. The Altman Z-
Score calculates and then combines five financial ratios, assigning each a dif-
ferent weighting. If the total Z-Score is 1.81 or less, the business has a very
good chance of going bankrupt in the coming year. If the total Z-Score is 3.00
or better, it has little danger of bankruptcy. Use the free online Z-Score calcu-
lator and see whether any of your investment candidates are heading for
bankruptcy.

Chapter 10: Using Company Information to Make Investment Decisions

Checking out insider trading
Insider ownership has an affect on a variety of corporate activities and
events. Managers can change their holdings just prior to an event and then
reverse their trades immediately after the event. The net effect from one year
to the next is not reported. Additionally, executives can postpone purchase
of shares if a significant stock price decrease is expected (and postpone sales
if a significant stock price increase is anticipated).
For example, the SEC claims that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay broke the law
by selling $70 million worth of shares in 2001 when he knew that Enron was
failing. Because the shares were sold when the company wasn’t on the open
market, insider trading rules weren’t applicable. Lay claims that his long-term
stock plan was in effect when he later sold $20 million on the open market.
(Stock sales plans are used by executives to insulate them from allegations
that a sale or purchase was triggered by insider knowledge.) The SEC con-
tends that Lay amended his sales plan because he knew that Enron was dete-
riorating due to billions in hidden debt. According to regulators, the use of
insider knowledge invalidated Lay’s sales plan and exposed him to civil
charges.
Scholars are unable to document significant insider sales prior to bankruptcy
filings. However, many experts agree that there is an incentive to sell in antic-
ipation of a drop in the firm’s stock price even if the firm doesn’t file bank-
ruptcy. The 1988 case of insider trading and stock manipulation against
investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert shows the extreme effects of
insider trading. In an agreement with prosecutors, Drexel pled guilty to multi-
ple counts of stock manipulation and insider trading and paid $650 million in
fines and penalties. Michael Milken, head of Drexel’s junk bond department,
was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $1 billion in 1990 on a wide
variety of securities law violations. Milken was released after serving less
than two years in prison. Drexel went bankrupt.
The following are some Web sources that can assist you in targeting bank-
ruptcy candidates:

In This Chapter
 Turning your hunches into investment strategies
 Getting hard data on the economy 
 Locating company and industry information online 
 Researching the background of corporate officers 
 Uncovering delayed and real-time prices with Level I and Level II stock quotes
You may use an online stock screen (see Chapter 9) to whittle down the
number of common stock investment candidates you’re considering. 
Or you may select a few companies because you know something about the
products they sell. Maybe you work in the industry or have used the com-
pany’s products or services over a long period of time.
After you find a few investment candidates, you can use online sources to
download the annual reports of the companies that you find interesting (see
Chapter 10). You read the financial statements, and you calculate the ratios
that are important to investors. You might think that you’re done, but you
need to do a little more research before you contact your online broker.
The next step involves digging deeper to understand the economic environ-
ment in which your investment candidate operates. In this chapter, I help you
locate the online sources that provide you with further background research
into companies that are of interest to you. You can discover where a com-
pany stands in its industry and what type of marketing techniques it’s using
to maintain and increase revenues. I show you where to find out what the
experts are saying about your stock pick and where to go online to find ana-
lysts’ earnings estimates. I also point out where you can get historical stock
price information and the latest stock quotes. After you have all these hard
facts, you can make your investment decision.

Many investors don’t have the confidence to select their own stocks. This
chapter shows how you can conduct your own online research to find win-
ning investments. Many of the sources I list in this chapter are the same
sources that full-service brokers use in their stock analyses.
In some situations, investors don’t have the six to eight hours per week needed
to be their own financial advisors. If you’re planning to hire a financial advisor,
you still need to have a good understanding of what’s going on so that you can
determine whether you’re receiving good or bad advice. After all, no one cares
more about your money than you.
Turning Your Hunches into 
Investment Strategies
Every online investor has his or her own research system for investigating
investment candidates. What makes any system work is that it’s repeatable,
and it ensures that you don’t make investment decisions based on emotional
factors. The following guidelines can assist you in turning your hunches into
investment strategies. You begin by gathering all the facts:
1. Find the candidates that you want to research.
Get familiar with the basics of stocks and their rates of return by reading
Chapter 8. Match your hunches about stocks that are positioned to be
top performers to your investor profile.
2. Trim your list of candidates.
Use a stock screen or some other method to identify investment candi-
dates. (See Chapter 9 for details.) Locate the online annual reports for
your short list of stock candidates by using the techniques I outline in
Chapter 10. Conduct your analysis to reduce the list to between six and
ten companies.
3. Find out more about each company.
Use the resources in this chapter to delve into the background of the
companies on your short list. You may want to use the following outline
to organize your advanced analysis of investment candidates. Divide
your analysis into the following four sections. The good news is that 
the Internet has tons of this type of information, and most of it is free.
Economic Analysis: Take a look at the economic environment of the
nation (gross national product [GNP], inflation, interest rates, and other
economic variables). Look at the company’s current and past profits.
• News: Read the company’s press releases and keep current with
breaking news. Try to connect isolated news articles to spot
trends.
196
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

• Economics: Note how changes in the national, regional, and local
economies affect the company. Will a rising dollar lower corporate
returns? What are the Wall Street economists saying?
• Market: What’s happening in the stock market? Are prices and
trading volume increasing? Are insiders purchasing stock?
Industry Analysis: Analyze the company’s current ratios and the ratios
from the last three years. Compare the company’s performance to its
industry (see Chapter 10). Note the company’s chief competitors and
the relative power of suppliers and customers. Determine whether the
industry is undergoing any structural changes or is changing due to 
general economic trends.
• Industry breaking news: Read news articles and industry trade
journals to spot patterns that may indicate technological break-
throughs or new products. Does the industry have problems with
oversupply, and if so, how does this situation affect the profits of
the company you’re researching?
• Industry research: Look for any regulatory concerns, international
aspects, potential for entry by competitors, and the likelihood of
customers using substitute products.
Company Analysis: Using the online resources listed in this chapter,
evaluate the demand for the company’s products or services. Gauge
management’s ability to accurately forecast sales and profits. Include
analyst’s forecasts for future earnings and determine whether the sales
forecast is reasonable in relationship to the industry and economic 
environment.
• Analysts’ evaluations: Most publicly traded companies have Wall
Street analysts who often provide opinions about the firm. Study
what the analysts are saying about the company. What they say
may provide you with leads for additional research.
• Management analysis: Perform background checks of corporate
officers by using the resources in this chapter.
Valuation Analysis: Using the resources in this chapter, discover the
company’s forecast of future earnings. Using the stock valuation tools
listed in Chapter 8 and the resources in this chapter, determine the 
right price for the company’s stock.
• Earnings estimates: Keep current with the earnings estimates of
professionals. Are the estimates going up or down?
• Historical prices: Sometimes you can tell where a company is
going by seeing where it has been. Evaluating a company’s past
stock prices may provide you with new insights.
197
Chapter 11: Digging Deeper: Advanced Stock Analysis

4. Decide whether the company is a low-priced, high-quality stock or a
loser.
When you put all the facts together, you gain a good understanding of
what causes the company’s stock price to rise or fall. Additionally, you
know what’s normal for the company.
5. Ask yourself, “What if?”
For example, what if sales drop by 10 percent? What if the material the
company uses to manufacture its product becomes scarce — would this
scarcity cause the cost of goods to increase? Would such a change
reduce profits so much that the company couldn’t pay its interest
expense? Would the company be forced into bankruptcy?
6. To complete your investment strategy, determine how risky the 
stock is.
Could you lose your entire investment? If so, you need to add a risk pre-
mium to your required rate of return. This risk premium compensates
you for the additional risk of your investment. Should the return be 10
times your investment, or maybe even 50 times your initial investment?
Making this decision can be difficult because everyone defines risk dif-
ferently, and everyone has a different risk-tolerance level.
Conquering Uncertainty 
with Online Research
You can use the Internet to get background company information by access-
ing one of the many free and fee-based databases and digging up all kinds of
facts and opinions about a company. Some of this information can provide
you with new insights, ideas, and leads about additional research. Overall,
this information can provide you with an understanding of how a company
works within the economy, how it copes with the competition, and how it
ranks within its industry. This information is often critical to your investment
decision.
With millions of Web pages on the Internet, finding exactly what you’re look-
ing for can be a challenge. However, uncovering one small fact can make the
difference between purchasing a mediocre stock and buying a stock that can
bring you exceptional returns. As you surf the Internet, you may encounter
sites that discuss stocks, markets, and online trading. In the following sec-
tions, I help you locate the right online sources to assist you in finding the
background information you need to complete your company research.

Polson Enterprises (www.virtualpet.com/industry/howto/search.
htm#steps) provides an easy-to-understand program about how to research
an industry or specific company. The Web site includes links to related Web
sites, answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), and other guidance.
Gaining new investor insights 
with breaking news
Daily news and press releases can assist you in keeping current with your
investments or investment candidates. These sources often provide the first
glimpse of why a stock price is rapidly increasing or falling like a stone. One
of the advantages to these online sources is that they have archives that you
can search to check past company events that made news.
Here are a few Internet resources for finding press releases and breaking
news:
 Bloomberg.com (www.bloomberg.com) includes newswire articles,
edited columns, audio clips about current market performance, and
other information about stocks, bonds, markets, and industry. The site
is well organized and provides access to current market statistics, busi-
ness and financial news, major newspaper stories, Bloomberg columns,

people, the world of finance has company profiles. Company profiles include 
all the events that make a company what it is today. You can keep all of a com-
pany’s pertinent facts handy by obtaining a company profile. Company profiles
are often designed for investors and highlight investor-related information.

Gathering Business Economic 
and Related Data
Many individuals try to predict economic trends, but few (if any) are success-
ful. However, having a good understanding of current economic conditions
and where they’re headed is vital to your comprehension of a company in its
201

broader context. After all, many companies are sensitive to changes in the
economy. The Internet has many sources for economic information.
The following is a list of the major economic indicators that can affect the
value of the shares you own in a certain company. Some investors look at four
or five of the major economic indicators to determine whether the market is
about to change. If the targeted factors indicate a change, some investors
begin a more in-depth analysis. Other investors are concerned about certain
industries and look only at the indicators that affect that economic sector or
industry. To sum it up, whatever your researching approach, the following list
provides a quick and easy way to find the online data you need.
Business economic indicators
 Chicago Fed National Activity Index (www.chicagofed.org/economic_

Checking out analyst evaluations
Often, stock prices move because analysts recommend or criticize a com-
pany. Although these opinions are “informed,” they’re still opinions and
shouldn’t overshadow your own good judgment. For example, assume that
an analyst suggests buying a stock and forecasts the price to increase to a
record high. Over the year, the stock reaches the mark, and then the analyst
places a hold on the stock. (A hold is a suggestion to investors that they nei-
ther sell nor buy the stock.) This hold may look like an unfavorable mark
against the stock, but the stock performed just as expected and is currently a
good investment.
The Internet now has many analyst reports by individual Wall Street analysts
and groups of Wall Street analysts who study a particular stock. However, many
of these firms participate in the financing of the companies they analyze.
Consequently, you rarely see a “sell” recommendation. Additionally, you may
see that analysts’ opinions vary. Feel free to disagree with their conclusions,
but know what the professionals are saying about a company that interests you.
Here are several examples of sites where you can check out analysts’ 
evaluations:
 Datamonitor’s CommentWire (www.commentwire.com) offers expert
opinions and analysis service. Get intriguing insights about the key stories
of the day, written by a global network of more than 200 business experts.
 MSN Money (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/home.asp) includes
analyst ratings, strategy labs, articles, and more.
 Standard & Poor’s (www2.standardandpoors.com) offers compre-
hensive ratings, lists of newly released ratings, ratings news, presale
reports, ratings inquiries, and more. Standard & Poor’s is one of the few
SEC-recognized rating services and provides independent financial
analyses on stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other financial products.
 BusinessWeek Personal Investing (www.businessweek.com/investor/

earnings surprises, recommendations, and the company’s annual balance
sheet and income statement.

Chapter 11: Digging Deeper: Advanced Stock Analysis

Following upgrades and downgrades
Earnings announcements and analysts’ upgrades or downgrades are hot news
for individual investors. Being the first to act on an upgrade or downgrade
can give you the edge you’re seeking. For example, many short-term traders
see upgrades and downgrades as a way to make a quick profit by selling short
if there is an unexpected downgrade. (Selling short is when an investor sells
borrowed stock in anticipation of a price decline. The investor’s expectation
is that the stock will be repurchased, to replace the borrowed shares, at a
lower price in the future.) Long-term investors couple downgrades and
upgrades with historical stock prices to stay one step ahead of the market.
These investors are on the lookout for stock splits, acquisitions, takeovers,
mergers, and reorganizations. Many investors find it very profitable to get
into the action before these activities are made known to the public. The fol-
lowing are two online sources for upgrades and downgrades:
 Briefing.com (www.briefing.com) has three levels of subscriptions.
The Silver level of service is free of charge and provides upgrade and
downgrade information that is updated three times per day. You can
sort this data alphabetically or by broker. Other information includes
Briefing.com’s view of the overall market, analysis, e-mail services, after-
hours updates, weekly wrap, economic calendar, splits calendar, IPO 
calendar, stock quotes, the ability to track up to 30 stocks, bond analy-
sis, daily columns, and long-term views. For more content, sign up for

 MSN Money (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/calendar/ratings/
current.asp) provides free upgrade, downgrade, and initial recommenda-
tion information from Briefing.com. You can see upgrade and downgrade
data from the previous day and back seven days.
Zeroing In on Earnings 
Savvy investors often refer to the Investor Relations page of a company’s Web
site to determine when the company will have corporate events, such as earn-
ings calls and industry presentations. Earnings conference calls or Webcasts
have become prime communications events for corporations. These activi-
ties are actually telephone conversations between the chief executive officer
(CEO), the chief financial officer (CFO), and the director of investor relations.
210
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

If your computer has a speaker, you can listen to live conference calls that
companies stage for analysts and institutional investors. In the past, these
calls were only for the privileged. Today, individual investors can listen to
the calls over the Internet (or by telephone) but can’t participate. Frequently,
RealPlayer (www.real.com) or Windows Media Player (www.microsoft.com/
windows/windowsmedia/default.aspx) is used to access the Webcasts.
Usually, you can download RealPlayer and Media Player programs at the site
of the Webcast conference call for no charge.
Webcast conference calls are used to assist analysts in sorting out current
earnings and can assist them in forecasting quarterly earnings. These Webcast
conference calls can help individual investors make quicker and better invest-
ment decisions. The following are a few examples of where you can find online
conference call sources:
 BestCalls (www.bestcalls.com) helps investors track event schedules
for thousands of publicly traded companies and assists investor rela-
tions professionals with promoting and disclosing their investor events.
BestCalls’ CallTracker service allows investors to receive automated and
personalized e-mail alerts of conference calls.
 Earnings.com (www.earnings.com) is designed for investors who are
seeking financial information directly from publicly traded companies.
With your free registration, you have unlimited access to multimedia
research, analysts’ recommendations, and earnings calls. Additionally,
you can personalize your own earnings calendar to track earnings dates,
conference calls, upgrades or downgrades, stock splits, and economic
indicators. The free service includes wireless alerts and PDA (personal
digital assistant) synchronization so that you can stay connected even if
you’re away from your computer.
 Yahoo! Finance (biz.yahoo.com/cc) offers a conference call calendar.
Additionally, this free service provides live or archived conferences that
Yahoo! hosts.
Tracking down earnings estimates
The price you pay for a stock is based on its future income stream. If earnings
estimates indicate that the earnings per share ratio is dropping, the stock
price you pay today may be too high for the true value of the stock.
211
Chapter 11: Digging Deeper: Advanced Stock Analysis

Following are some Internet sources for earnings estimates:
 CBS MarketWatch: Analyst Rating Revisions (cbs.marketwatch.com/
tools/stockresearch/updown/default.asp) is updated throughout

pany, the broker, the new and old ratings, and comments. Access requires

Forecasting earnings and 
the stock market level
An investor who could accurately forecast a company’s earnings, general
market conditions, national economic activity, or interest rates would make
extraordinary returns. Over the years, intrepid investors have studied these
factors and determined that the most important factors in separating the 
winners from the losers are profitability and the general stock market level.
However, academics who have studied past earnings have discovered that
historical earning trends aren’t predictors of future earnings. This informa-
tion only confirms what investors already know: Past performance doesn’t
guarantee future returns.
You can forecast the general stock market level with several methods, but not
one of them is consistently reliable. For example, the short-term interest ratio
theory (the short interest rate for the month divided by the mean daily volume
for the same period) theorizes that a very high short-term interest ratio of
2.00 indicates a bull market (up), and a short-term interest ratio of .80 indi-
cates a mildly bearish market (down). When first introduced, this approach
was a good way to predict the direction of the market. But over time, this
theory hasn’t worked well for investors.

Researching the Background 
of Corporate Officers 
Because of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, corporations are taking more responsibility
for the actions of their corporate officers. Consequently, when companies hire
individuals for top management positions, they frequently vet their candidates
in an effort to avoid the potential of fraud and scandal. Vetting in this situation
usually means going beyond checking a candidate’s educational credentials,
work history, and criminal record. A thorough investigation can include
 Checking the candidate’s credit history, history of driving violations,
and other violations that indicate a lack of responsibility.
 Conducting face-to-face interviews with former colleagues, business
partners, and spouses.
 Determining whether a disparity exists between the executive’s salary
and his or her lifestyle.
Corporate officers should not be unindicted coconspirators of fraud cases,
have personal bankruptcies, or show evidence of gambling or drinking prob-
lems. If you’re suspicious of corporate officers or are a cautious investor, you
might want to check out a few things before you invest. The Internet offers
many online sources that can assist you in your investigations:
 Board Analyst (www.boardanalyst.com) has free registration. You can
search Board Analyst’s company and CEO database by using a variety of
keywords. You can sort the results by company name, ticker symbol,
CEO name, or market capitalization. Free searches are limited to S & P
companies only. Higher-level content requires your subscription or is
available on a pay-per-view basis.
 BoardSeat (www.boardseat.com/articles.asp) requires your free
registration. At this site, you can discover the minimum qualifications
for board members, see what the responsibilities of board members are,
and find out how an advisory board can assist a company.
 Corporate Governance (www.corpgov.net) aims to enhance the return
on capital through increased accountability. Discover research reports
on corporate governance. If you’re looking for links to corporate gover-
nance or related Web sites, this site is the place. Corporate Governance
includes an extensive subject-based directory.
 Executive PayWatch (www.paywatch.org), shown in Figure 11-4, is
sponsored by the AFL-CIO and geared to assist you in comparing your
retirement plan with the average CEO’s. Additionally, you can see how
CEO pay has been growing while corporate profits and stocks decline.
Overall, if you want to investigate corporate excess, this Web site is a
good starting place.

Understanding Stock Prices 
Determining the correct time to purchase a security can be difficult. Knowing
the past sales price of an investment can help you judge today’s price. In
other words, seeing where a company has been is always important in order
to get a feeling about where it’s going. Here are a few Internet sources for his-
torical prices:
 BigCharts (bigcharts.marketwatch.com/historical/) provides
graphs of historical stock prices. The BigCharts tool enables you to look
up a security’s exact closing price. Type in the ticker symbol and a his-
torical date. The closing price is listed, and a minigraph charts the closing
price and the daily closing prices for one full month before and after the
date you’re researching.

Understanding Level I stock quotes
Deciding on the proper time to purchase a security is often difficult. Some
experts believe that for the first 30 minutes of trading, many investors are
buying and selling securities based on yesterday’s news. Consequently, it
takes nearly an hour of trading before the market starts moving up or down
based on today’s trading. If the price drops immediately after you purchase,
then you may feel that you missed a better buying opportunity. If the price
spikes just before you purchase, you may feel that you paid too much for
your investment. The bottom line for investors is to purchase a security that
is priced below its intrinsic value (see Chapter 8 for details). 
The media attention on frequent investors and active traders has created
some confusion about what types of stock quotes investors have access to
and what type of quotes are needed for successful trading. Most newspapers
and many Internet sites, such as The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition
(public.wsj.com/home.html) and Barron’s (www.barrons.com), have Level I
listings of the day’s stock activities. Table 11-1 shows the information in a typ-
ical listing from The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition. (The values in the
table are hypothetical.) The stock detailed is for a fictional company called
Zoogle (ZGL). Zoogle designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a wide
range of computing products, including desktop and portable computers.

Tools of the trade
If you’re an active investor and plan to use Level
II NASDAQ quotes as part of your trading strategy,
you need to take an inventory of your computer
hardware and software and possibly make a few
upgrades. For example, you need a good quality
monitor, Windows 2000 or XP, and Microsoft
Internet Explorer Version 6 or higher. Your PC
should have a 1 GHz (or higher) Pentium proces-
sor with 1024MB (or higher) of RAM, a 100GB
hard drive, network card, modem, and video
card. Dial-up connections are too slow for active
traders, so you need a cable modem or DSL
(Direct Service Line) phone line connection for
all your trades.

Discovering Level II stock quotes
Level II NASDAQ stock quotes provide investors with more information than
Level I quotes by revealing the best bid and offer prices of every publicly
posted market participant for a particular stock. This level is a more compli-
cated way of looking at the market. Mainstream buy-and-hold investors don’t
need Level II quotes. Active investors may require this data to make informed
decisions. Day traders must have Level II NASDAQ quotes to shave a few
points and make their profits.
217
Chapter 11: Digging Deeper: Advanced Stock Analysis

In addition to showing all the Level I data, Level II quotes show the market
participants. Level II NASDAQ quotes rank their bids from best to worst, high-
est to lowest, and number of shares to be traded. Offers are also listed from
best to worst and from lowest to highest.
The Level II quotes indicate market makers by using four-letter identification
codes. Key market makers are companies like Goldman Sachs (GSCO),
Morgan Stanley (MSCO), and Herzog (HRZG), but these are only three of the
more than 500 market maker firms. To discover specific market makers, see
www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader/symboldirectory/symbol.stm. Click
Transaction Services➪NASDAQ Broker/Dealers. Write down the name of the
NASDAQ broker/dealer you’re researching. 
Return to the Symbol Directory page (at the previously-listed URL), enter the
name of the broker/dealer you’re researching, search by clicking on name,
“starts with” and “market participants”. Next click the Execute Search button.
You’re given the name, symbol, and contact information for the market maker.
You have the option of printing or saving this information to a file.
The different types of market participants are color coded, as are the back-
ground colors for data. In other words, color changes indicate the best bid
and ask quotes. For example, yellow signifies the highest bid or lowest ask
quote (Inside Market), green indicates the next best quote (1st Outer), dark
blue signifies the second best quote (2nd Outer), and so on.
Finding ticker symbols and 
stock prices online
A ticker symbol is the letter code representing the company’s name in the list-
ing for a publicly traded security. For example, if you want to find the current
price for a share of Cisco’s stock, look for the company’s ticker symbol — CSCO.
Ticker symbols for companies traded on the NYSE have one to three letters;
stocks traded on NASDAQ have four or five letters.
In the past, the average investor had to wait for newspapers to discover stock
prices. Today, delayed, real-time, and streaming quotes are available on the
Internet. In fact, during the last few years, the number of Web sites offering wire-
less quotes has proliferated. Here are a few examples of online quote servers:
Free delayed stock quotes
Free delayed stock quotes are often best for buy-and-hold investors. The fore-
most advantage is that they’re free and easy to use. The second advantage is
that delayed stock quotes are often the best way to carefully track your
investment strategy and to plan your next move.

B
onds are similar to stocks because you make money in two ways. The
first way is capital appreciation; the bond increases in value if interest
rates decline, which means that you can sell the bond at a premium. That is,
you can sell the bond for more money than you paid for it. (The profit you
make is called capital gains.) The second way to make money is the periodic
interest payment that you receive during the bond term.
Bonds are often called fixed-income investments. They represent debts or
IOUs from the issuer. The amount of the loan is the principal; the compensa-
tion given to the investor is called interest payments. In this chapter, I show
you how the Internet provides information about Treasury, federal agency,
municipal, and corporate bond auctions and offerings; historical and current
yield rates; education; and tax information.
Bonds can be virtually risk-free and guaranteed by the U.S. government, or
they can be speculative high-flyers that can crash and go into default. You
may decide that these investments aren’t for you, but if you own a mutual
fund, you might already be invested in the bond market.

Generic Features of Bonds
Bonds are simply defined as long-term promissory notes from an issuer.
Issuers tend to be large organizations, like the federal government and its
agencies, and state and local governments. Bonds are contracts that state
the interest payment (coupon rate) to be paid to the investor, the par value
(principal or face value of the bond), and when the par value will be repaid
to the investor. Overall, bonds provide the investor with security and a fixed
income under a legal contract.
Bondholders want to minimize the business, market, and political risks of
investing. From the date of issue, the bond’s rate of interest payments (the
coupon rate) and maturity date don’t change. The price of the bond (the par
or face value of the bond when it’s issued) can vary during the bond term,
depending on changes in interest rates. Generally, if interest rates increase,
the bond’s value falls. On the other hand, if interest rates decline, the value of
the bond increases.
A different type of bond contract is a variable-rate note or floating-rate note. A
few corporate bonds have floating rates. The coupon rate is fixed for a short
period of time and then varies with a specific short-term rate (such as a
Treasury bill). With floating-rate notes, the investor’s interest payments,
rather than the price of the bond, go up and down.
Corporate and municipal bonds are usually purchased through a broker.
Treasury securities (bills, notes, and bonds) can be purchased directly from
the government, without a broker.
The most popular bonds are often long-term debt that matures in ten or more
years. A bond is a commitment by a public or private entity to pay the bond-
holder certain interest payments at specific times and the principal (the original
investment) at the end of a specified time period.
Bonds have clearly stated terms and maturity dates. These terms can be as
short as 13 weeks or as long as 30 years. Sometimes you can’t recover your
investment until the bond matures. If you have to sell the bond before it
matures, you might have a difficult time finding a buyer. The broker’s com-
mission takes some of your return, and you lose the sizable return you were
going to receive on your original investment.
Bonds have their own terminology that you need to understand:
 Par value: Refers to the face value of the bond and the amount returned
to the bondholder at maturity. Most corporate bonds have a par value of
$1,000; many federal, state, and local bonds have par values of $5,000 or
$10,000.
222
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 Coupon interest rate: Indicates what percentage of the par value of the
bond is paid out annually in the form of interest.
 Maturity: Indicates the length of time until the bond issuer returns the
face value to the bondholder and terminates the bond.
 Current yield: Refers to the ratio of the annual interest payment to the
bond’s current selling price. For example, assume that the bond has an
11 percent coupon rate, a par value of $1,000, and a market value of
$700. It has a current yield of 15.71 percent ([0.11 × $1,000] ÷ $700).
 Yield to maturity: Indicates how much you would pay today for the
future benefits of the bond. Yield to maturity is the investor’s required
rate of return used as the discount rate to arrive at the current value of a
bond. (The current value of a bond is determined by the present value of
future interest payments and the repayment of the principal at maturity.)
Special benefits and exposures
As evidence that there are no guarantees with bonds, the 1994 bond market
experienced worldwide losses of around $1.5 trillion. (Among other things,
this loss was attributed to the Peso Crisis in Mexico.) Since that time, the
market has radically changed. It’s no longer the sleepy market it was before
derivatives and similar financial instruments were introduced. However, if
you know what you’re doing, bonds can provide a fixed cash flow over time.
A fixed cash flow from bonds is important if you’re planning a comfortable
retirement.
The benefit of a fixed cash flow isn’t cost-free. Bond returns are usually lower
than other investments because of the risk and return trade-off. (High risk
brings high returns, and low risk brings low returns.) Bonds are contracts for
a certain amount of interest payments along with repayments of the principal
at the end of a specified period. The investor can make financial plans based
on these contracts. Stocks have no guarantees (or limits) on dividend pay-
ments and the sales price. A stock’s dividends and value can skyrocket or
plummet.
Table 12-1 shows the risk and return trade-offs of different types of bonds
compared to different types of stocks over the last 50, 20, 10, and 5 years.
For instance, a comparison of the annualized returns of stocks to corporate
bonds for the last five years indicates that investing in stocks would have
delivered more than twice the returns of bonds (a return of 24.1 percent
versus a return of 8.7 percent), and stock investments provided three times
the return of Treasury securities (a return of 24.1 percent versus a return of
6.2 percent).

Using the Internet to find 
new bond offerings
Because bond issuers are anxious to get new bonds sold, new bond issues
generally provide a slightly better yield than comparable issues of existing
bonds offered on the secondary market.
Here are several useful online sources for information about new bond offerings:
 Smith Barney Municipal Bond Inventory (www.smithbarney.com/
products_services/fixed_income/municipal_bonds/munical.html)
shows the firm’s searchable municipal bond inventory. You can discover
a free listing of new municipal free issues and bond issues that Smith
Barney is involved in or intends to bid on its own, or that are part of
a syndicate. (A syndicate is a group of investment bankers that jointly
share in the underwriting, distribution, selling, and management of a
new issue.) The bonds listed at the Web site are updated weekly, but
are subject to prior sale (and may not be available). Use of this service
requires your free guest registration.
 The Bond Buyer (www.bondbuyer.com) covers the municipal bond
market in minute detail. The online publication provides daily municipal
bond news, analysis, and commentary. Five bureaus and 30 reporters
cover the bond market geographically and topically. This online edition of
The Bond Buyer covers new municipal bond offerings, city and state offi-
cials involved in issuing debt, underwriters and underwriting, brokerages,
and bond lawyers. The online subscription-based service has a free two-
week trial. The subscription rate is $1,997 per year. (A printed version of
The Bond Buyer is also available.)
 Bondpage.com (www.bondpage.com) allows you to search for new bond
issues by CUSIP number (see the following tip), yield, maturity, coupon,
and price. Search thousands of new issues for corporate and municipal
bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs). You can research current and
historical market information, news, economic statistics, and interest rate
quotes to make more well-informed decisions. Check out bond quotes
and offerings for corporate, municipal, Treasury, agency, and zero-coupon
bonds. The online content is free but requires your registration.
CUSIP numbers are unique nine-digit numbers assigned to each series of
securities. The Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures
(CUSIP), established under the auspices of the American Bankers
Association, developed this uniform method of identifying securities.
225
Chapter 12: Going with Fixed-Income Securities: Which Type of Bond Is for You?

Locating those elusive bond quotes
The primary market of a bond is the price an investor pays for a newly issued
bond. Bonds are then traded on the secondary market at rates that are usually
different from their initial prices. Bond prices and interest rates are inversely
related. For example, if interest rates go down, the value of a bond with a high
interest rate increases. If you want to purchase bonds, knowing the price you’re
paying is wise. The following are several bond-quote Web sites that you might
find useful:
 Bloomberg.com (www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html)
offers commentary on interest rates, economic news, and bond pricing
data. If you want to know the latest rates, this is the place.
 Briefing.com (www.briefing.com) offers its Platinum subscribers
($24.95 per month) bond quotes, charts, and key bond market data on

yield curves and analyses of bond trends.
 BondsOnline (www.bondsonline.com) offers clear information about
how to search for a bond. Use the bond search and quote center for
Treasury, corporate, municipal, and zero bonds. You can also search
for CDs. The center includes indexes, global securities, and historical
prices.
Finding bond indexes and 
historical data online
Bond indexes are designed to represent either the average yield to maturity or
the average price on a portfolio of bonds that have certain similar characteris-
tics. Historical data can also provide bond performance insights. The Internet
offers several sources for these averages and historical data, including these
examples:
 Chicago Board of Trade (cbotdataexchange.if5.com/Markets.aspx)
provides quotes and charts of a wide variety of Treasury, agency, and
municipal bonds. Plus, you gain access to the Municipal Bond Index,
market commentary, financial product news, and other information.

Risks and stability
Moody’s Investors Service (www.moodys.com), Standard & Poor’s Corporation
(www.standardandpoors.com), and Fitch Investor Services, L.P. (www.fitch
ibca.com) are generally believed to be the best-known and most prominent
credit-rating agencies. These companies assess the risk of bonds by studying
all the bond’s information and then assigning the bond a rank that reflects
the issuer’s ability to meet the promised principal and interest payments.
This rating might change during the life of the bond, and a change in the
rating can dramatically change the value of the bond.
All the credit-rating companies rate bonds in descending alphabetical order
from A to C, but each company uses a somewhat different letter scheme.
For a comparison of the leading bond rating agencies’ alphabetic grading 
systems, see Bond Markets at www.bondmarkets.com/publications/
bondbasics.htm.
Ratings aren’t absolute measures of quality. Each rating considers factors
such as the issuer’s past earnings record and future earnings expectations,
the financial condition of the issuer, the nature of the issuer’s business, the
backing for a particular issue, and the rating agency’s appraisals of the
issuer’s management.
The rating agencies warn investors that a bond’s rating isn’t a “buy” recommen-
dation. However, because of the risk-reward ratio, bonds with higher ratings
offer lower yields, whereas bonds with lower ratings — which represent riskier
investments — offer higher yields.
How Small Investors Can Make 
Money with Fixed-Income 
Investments and Bonds
In addition to bonds, banks and savings and loan associations have devel-
oped new ways of keeping customer assets in their financial institutions.
They often offer a variety of investment plans that provide higher returns
than traditional fixed-rate savings accounts. For example, many savings
and loan associations allow their customers to invest in commercial paper
228
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

(uninsured promissory notes to large business entities) instead of certificates
of deposit (an insured type of time deposit).
Small investors seeking greater returns may want to consider the following
types of fixed-income and bond investments:
 Fixed-rate certificates: In the past, federal regulations required a mini-
mum deposit amount of $1,000 with maturities of at least four years for
fixed-rate certificates of deposit (CDs). Financial institutions now set their
own minimum amounts (which often range between $100 and $500) for
time periods including three months, six months, one year, two years,
and five years.
Banks impose hefty penalties for early withdrawals. These fees can wipe
out any gains you may have made.
 Small-saver certificates: Deposits don’t require any minimum amount
according to federal banking laws, but many banks have established a
minimum requirement of deposits of $100 to $500. Maturities are generally
30 months, and the interest paid is slightly below the 30-month Treasury
yield. Expect high penalties for early withdrawals.
 Six-month money market certificates: These certificates are for investors
with more cash ($10,000 minimum) than time. Yields are higher than
those for short-term money market certificates. The interest rate paid is
generally slightly higher than the six-month Treasury bill rate. Like the
saver certificate, the interest rate ceiling of a six-month money market
certificate is a floating interest rate until you purchase the certificate.
After you purchase the certificate, the rate is locked until the certificate
matures. When the certificate matures, you’re free to reinvest (rollover)
your investment. 
 Short-term bond funds: By purchasing short-term, no-load bond funds,
investors can earn higher-than-passbook returns and still have lots of
liquidity. Some bond funds even have limited check-writing privileges.
(Writing a check is certainly more convenient and inexpensive than plac-
ing a sell order.)
With short-term bond funds, small investors tend to pay more for bonds
than professional bond fund managers (who keenly watch every move-
ment of the bond market). Bond funds come in two flavors: tax-free and
taxable. If you’re in a high-income bracket, tax-free bonds might be to
your advantage. However, all these benefits aren’t cost-free. Investors
will incur an annual fund management fee that averages 0.2 percent.
(That is, $200 for every $100,000 invested in the fund.)

access the bank via the Internet, an online ser-
vice such as AOL, or a dial-up network with MS
Money, Quicken, or another personal finance

You can also search for the best savings rates
nationwide, search for the best local annual per-
centage rate, and check out Today’s Averages.
Today’s Averages shows the best rates for today,
last week, and six months ago for money market
accounts (MMAs). You can usually open an
MMA account at a financial institution. MMAs
usually pay higher returns than regular savings
accounts. Your deposit is invested into safe,
short-term debt instruments, such as 
 General-purpose funds (certificates of
deposit, Treasury securities, and short-term
corporate IOUs) 
 Government funds (U.S. Treasury securities)
 Tax-exempt funds (short-term municipal
bonds, which are federally tax-exempt and
sometimes state tax-exempt)
Note that MMAs aren’t insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 

When to Choose a Money Market 
Deposit Account (MMDA)
MMAs are different from Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs). Your
online bank can provide you with information about a money market deposit
account (MMDA) and the specific returns you can expect. An MMDA is a
good place to keep your emergency fund and to park funds temporarily.
(Emergency funds, as I explain in Chapter 3, are generally three to six months
of take-home pay that you put in a savings account — or a near-cash account
for emergencies. (If you don’t have an emergency fund, you need to increase
your savings.) An MMDA is a savings account with several unique features. 
Your MMDA account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC). The minimum balance to open an account might be high. However, as
long as you maintain the minimum balance, you earn the money market rate
of interest (currently, about 4.5 percent) If the balance falls below the required
minimum balance, you earn the current negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW)
account interest rate, and you might incur a service charge (usually about $5).

The Four Basic Types of Bonds
Many organizations issue bonds, but the following types of organizations
issue most bonds:
 The federal government (Treasury securities)
 Federal government agencies (agency bonds)
 State and local government agencies (municipal bonds)
 Corporations (corporate bonds)
232
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

Uncle Sam’s bonds: Treasury securities
Treasury securities are U.S. government securities called Treasury bills,
notes, and bonds. These securities are a major source of government funds
and a key investment for many consumers. The U.S. government is highly
unlikely to default on its Treasury securities, but if it does, your dollar is also
probably worthless, so your investment is, essentially, risk-free.
The disadvantage of the risk-free rate of Treasury securities is that it’s gener-
ally considered the bottom of the yield pile — the lowest yield you can get.
As the level of risk gets greater, the reward also increases. You can expect a
better yield (but more risk) from corporate bonds with similar maturities.
The Treasury Direct program (www.treasurydirect.com) program enables
investors to participate in regularly scheduled auctions. (For details about
opening an account, see Chapter 13.) You can search for new issues that meet
your investment criteria and manage your Treasury and savings bonds in
one account. The minimum investments are $10,000 for bills, $5,000 for notes
maturing in less than five years, and $1,000 for securities that mature in five
or more years. 
Your interest payments are paid into your Treasury Direct account, as is a
security’s par value at maturity. Treasury bills are sold for less than face value.
The discount represents the interest the investor earns. Interest income on
Treasuries is usually exempt from state and local taxes, but is subject to fed-
eral taxes.

Savings bonds: The easiest way to save
At some time in the near future, savings bonds will be available only in a
paperless format at Treasury Direct (www.treasurydirect.gov). For many
people, not having to deal with paper-based savings bonds will make their
lives easier. Investors can purchase savings bonds by deducting funds from
their checking accounts or by automatic payroll deduction via the Internet.
Managing bonds via the Internet will be easier than it is now.
Income from U.S. savings bonds is exempt from state and local income tax.
You can also defer paying federal income tax on the interest until you cash in
the bond or until it stops earning interest in 30 years. If you use savings bonds
to pay for education, they may provide you with additional tax savings.

Federal government agency bonds
Agency bonds are similar to Treasury bonds but have marginally higher risk
and higher returns. They can be sold for $1,000 to $25,000 and sometimes
more. Federal agencies issue bonds to support housing (either with direct
loans or the purchase of existing mortgages); export and import activities
with loans, credit guarantees, and insurance; the postal service; and the
activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Not all government agency bonds are equal. The full faith and credit of the
U.S. government guarantees many issues. Although government agency
bonds aren’t a direct obligation of the U.S. government, they offer little, if

Valley Authority) don’t have this guarantee.

The beauty of tax-free municipal bonds
Towns, cities, and regional and local agencies issue municipal bonds. Municipal
bonds usually have lower interest rates than comparably rated corporate bonds
and Treasury securities. The minimum amount required for investment in
municipal bonds is $5,000, and municipal bonds are sometimes issued at a dis-
count. This discount compensates investors for the additional risk that these
bonds may have due to the financial difficulties of some local governments.
235
Chapter 12: Going with Fixed-Income Securities: Which Type of Bond Is for You?

The most important feature of municipal bonds is their tax-exempt feature.
In subsequent judgments based on the 1819 McCullough v. Maryland ruling,
the federal, state, and local governments don’t possess the power to tax
each other. Consequently, municipal bonds can’t be subject to federal tax.
Additionally, income from state and local municipal bonds can’t be taxed if
purchased within the geographic area. For example, Virginia residents don’t
pay state taxes on Virginia bonds. However, residents of California are subject
to state income taxes on their Virginia bonds. This tax-exempt feature makes
municipal bonds very attractive to investors in high tax brackets. You treat
capital gains on such bonds as normal income.
Three primary types of municipal bonds exist, each with its own special 
features:
 General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the
issuing agency. For municipal bonds, full faith and credit also means the
taxing power of the issuing municipality.
 Revenue bonds are backed by the funds from a designated tax or the
revenues from a specific project, authority, or agency. These bonds aren’t
backed by the full faith and credit (or the taxing power) of the issuing

agency. In other words, revenue bonds are only as good (and as credit-
worthy) as the ventures they support.
 Industrial development bonds (IDBs) are used to finance the pur-
chase or construction of industrial facilities that are to be leased to 
businesses. Leasing fees of the facilities are used to meet construction
expenses and the repayment requirements of the bonds. Often, these
bonds provide inexpensive financing to firms choosing to locate in the
geographical area of the issuer. Examples of IDBs are bonds for the con-
struction of piers and wharves. Municipalities can also issue short-term
securities called tax-exempt commercial paper and variable-rate demand
obligations.

Floating with corporate bonds
Corporate bonds are a major source of corporate borrowing. When corpora-
tions make corporate bonds, they “float a bond issue.” Such bond issues take
the form of either debentures (which are unsecured corporate bonds backed
by the general credit of the corporation) or asset-backed bonds (which are
backed by specific corporate assets like property or equipment). Income
from these bonds is taxable. However, top-rated corporate bonds are often
almost risk-free and have a higher return than Treasury securities. Corporate
bonds are generally considered safer than stocks because
 The bonds state exactly how much the corporation will pay the bond-
holder. Shareholders are entitled to cash dividends, but payment and
the amount of the dividend is at the discretion of the corporation.
 Bondholders are creditors. Bondholders receive payment before the
corporation can distribute any cash dividends to shareholders, which
means that bondholders have greater protection in getting at least some
return on their investment. (In bankruptcy, bondholders are paid from
corporate assets before common stockholders.)

Some risk of default always exists. In the 1980s, many companies used junk
bonds to finance highly leveraged takeovers of rival companies. Their bonds
were rated non-investment grade and speculative by the bond-rating agen-
cies. Because of the additional risk, these bonds paid above-average interest
rates. For some bondholders, these bonds were a windfall. For bondholders
who invested in the corporate bonds of companies that failed, their bonds
went into default and became worthless junk.
Some professional money managers are required by law to purchase 
investment-grade securities so that they can’t purchase junk bonds. These
organizations generally limit their corporate bond purchases to issues rated
B or higher by Moody’s Investors.
Using the Internet to screen bonds
The Internet provides many online tools to help you make bond selections.
Some Web sites include search engines that sort through thousands of bond
offerings looking for bonds that meet your criteria. These services are free
but are often accompanied by a sales pitch. The Internet provides many tools
and resources for analyzing bonds.
 BondVillage (www.bondvillage.com) offers bvPerspectives, which
shows a bird’s-eye view of the bond market by providing a graphical
overview of the retail bond market. The graphics and underlying tabu-
lated data show how the yields of typical bonds vary with credit rating,
issue maturity, and the investor’s time frame. Bond Village also provides
bvBondSelector, a proprietary bond analytical engine. This bond screener
analyzes thousands of bond issues to identify the best bond investment
ideas, as measured by superior prices and yields in comparison to typical
bonds of the same maturity and with comparable or even lower credit
ratings. Bond Village includes quotes and investor education. With your
registration, you receive use of bvPerspectives and bvBondSelector at
no charge. You have the choice of two levels of subscriptions. bvInvestor
is $30 per month (or $330 per year) for the membership access and pre-
mium features. bvProfessional is $150 per month (or $1,650 per year)
for full access and premium features. Each subscription level has a free
two-week trial.
 Yahoo! Finance (bonds.yahoo.com) offers bond rates, historical yields,
commentary, and market news. Investor tools include a bond calculator
for computing a bond’s price and yield. The bond screener allows you to
search for corporate, municipal, Treasury, and zero bonds. (Bond screener
data is provided by ValuBond.) The advantage of the Yahoo! bond screener
is that you select the bond criteria that match your investment profile.

Two Alternate Types of Bonds
Two other types of bonds might be of interest to online investors: zero-coupon
bonds and Eurobonds. I describe these alternative bond types in the follow-
ing sections.
Zero-coupon bonds
Zero-coupon bonds offer no interest payments but are put on the market at
prices substantially below their face values. The return to the investor is the
difference between the investor’s cost and the face value received at the end
of the life of the bond.
If you don’t rely on interest payment income, zero-coupon bonds may be the
way to go for your nontaxable retirement plan (such as an individual retire-
ment account, Keogh plan, or other nontaxable pension fund). The Internal
Revenue Service taxes zero-coupon bonds as if investors received regular
interest payments. This tax is based on amortizing the built-in gain over the
life of the bond. In other words, for taxable accounts, investors have to pay
taxes on income they haven’t received, but for nontaxable accounts, they’re
a great investment choice.
Some brokerages offer Treasury strips. Large companies purchase 30-year
Treasury securities and clip the interest-bearing coupons. The brokers then sell
these Treasury coupons like zero-coupon bonds. You purchase the Treasury
strip at a discount (say $4,300) and redeem the coupon at face value ($5,000).
Treasury strips are like zero-coupon bonds because no interest is paid during
the maturity term.
If you’re looking for more information about zero-coupon bonds, the Internet
provides many educational articles — for example:
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (www.newyorkfed.org/about
thefed/fedpoint/fed42.html) has an overview of zero-coupon bonds
and strips, as well as a short history of Treasury zero-coupon bonds.
 The Bond Market Association (www.investinginbonds.com/info/
zeroes.htm) provides useful examples of how zero-coupon bonds can
increase returns and eliminate reinvestment risk.
 Kiplinger.com (www.kiplinger.com/basics/investing/bonds/
zeros.html) offers an overview of zero-coupon bonds. Kiplinger.com
points out innovative ways to purchase zero-coupon bonds and shows
how to lessen your tax burden when you cash out.

Eurobonds
Investments in foreign securities typically involve many government restric-
tions. Eurobonds are bonds offered outside the country of the borrower and
usually outside the country in whose currency the securities are denomi-
nated. For example, a Eurobond may be issued by an American corporation,
denominated in German deutsche marks, and sold in Japan and Switzerland.
For additional information about Eurobonds, try BradyNet Pro (www.brady

your investor’s account at Treasury Direct (the master record of the securi-
ties you own that is maintained by the federal government). Finally, I offer a
hot strategy that can protect you from interest rate risk. 

The Math of Bonds
The bond market is dominated by institutional investors (insurance compa-
nies, pension funds, and mutual funds) that account for 80 to 85 percent of 
all trading. Individual investors tend to purchase municipal and corporate
bonds because of their lower denominations (around $1,000) and tax-exempt
features. However, the impact of individual investors can also be felt through
the purchases of mutual funds that specialize in bonds.
The following section shows the valuation process of bonds and the relation-
ship of interest rate changes to the value of bonds. I provide several easy-to-
use approaches that take the mystery out of determining your bond yield.
Calculating bond values
A bond issued by a corporation is called a debt instrument. The bond states
how the debt holder (investor) is repaid. Generally, these terms are normal
debt arrangements. The borrower makes interest payments and then pays
the principal at a predetermined date. Several issues make bonds compli-
cated, such as provisions to convert the bonds to common stocks at a prede-
termined stock value, or terms that allow the bond issuer to retire the bond
before maturity.
Treasury securities and government agency and municipal bonds are valued
in the same way as corporate bonds. However, this valuation doesn’t show
the entire picture. Treasury securities are subject to federal taxes but are
exempt from state and local taxes. Government agency securities are gener-
ally taxable for federal, state, and local purposes, but some exceptions exist.
Municipal bonds are generally tax-free (from federal, state, and local taxes).
Therefore, when you value corporate bonds, the calculated rate of return is
somewhat overstated because it doesn’t consider the impact of taxes.
The value of the bond is based on the investor’s assessment of the bond’s
value. The receipt of future interest payments, the repayment of principal,
and the credit rating or riskiness of the bond usually temper these assess-
ments. You aren’t obligated to hold a bond until maturity, and bonds are
traded freely in the marketplace.
Calculating the value of a bond involves determining the present value of the
interest payments and the eventual recovery of the principal. Present value
means discounting the future cash flow to calculate how much you’re willing
to pay today for these future receipts.
At times, calculating the yield on bonds can seem more complicated than it
really is. For example, if you purchase a one-year Treasury bill for $9,500, and
244
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

redeem it in 12 months at full face value ($10,000), your gain is $500 (subject
to federal income tax but exempt from state and local taxes). To determine
your yield if your holding period is one year, use the following formula:
(Face Value – Price) ÷ Price = Annual Return
($10,000 – $9,500) ÷ $9,500 = 0.0526, or 5.26%
See the section “The easy way to value your bond returns,” later in this chap-
ter, where I show you how to calculate the yield for a bond that has a matu-
rity term greater than one year.
Creating yield curves
A yield curve is a diagram that illustrates the relationship of bond yields to
maturities on a specific day. You can use yield curves to decide which type 
of bond is best for your financial objectives. Bond yields and maturities 
are posted daily at the Bloomberg.com Web site (www.bloomberg.com/
markets/rates/index.html), shown in Figure 13-1.

com shows
the current

yield curve
of U.S.

245
Chapter 13: Valuing, Buying, and Selling Bonds Online

Figure 13-1 indicates the current and previous yields for U.S. Treasury bills,
notes and bonds. The horizontal axis plots the maturities of Treasury securi-
ties from left to right starting with the maturity of 3-months to 30 years. The
yield of each security is plotted on the vertical axis. The dots are connects to
make a current and a previous yield curve. 
When analyzing the yield curve in Figure 13-1, keep in mind that short-term
yields are controlled by the Federal Reserve. Long-term yields of Treasuries
are controlled by the market. Figure 13-1 illustrates that there is very little 
difference between the current and previous yield curves. Look at the bar
chart below the yield curve in Figure 13-1. This chart indicates that the yield
on 6-month Treasury bills has decreased and the yield on 3-year Treasury
notes slightly increased. See the curve descriptions in the following list to
find out what yield curves can indicate:
 If the short-term rates are higher than the long-term rates, the yield
curve becomes inverted, or has a downward swing to it, which tells you
that this situation tends to be bearish for the market. In this situation,
monetary policy is likely to be tight, and the Federal Reserve is pushing
up short-term rates.
 If the short-term rates are lower than the long-term rates, the yield curve
is positive, or has an upward swing to it, which usually indicates that
investors are willing to tie up their money in long-term commitments 
to reap higher rewards.
 If the short-term rates and the long-term rates are the same (or nearly
the same), the yield curve appears to be flat, like a line.
You can create you own yield curve on a piece of graph paper or with your
MS Excel software program. Using Figure 13-1 as you example, on the horizon-
tal axis, plot the maturities of Treasury securities from left to right starting
with the shortest maturity to the longest maturity. Then, on the vertical axis,
plot the yield of each Treasury security. Next, connect the dots to make a
yield curve. Creating your own yield curves allows you to analyze the data
that interests you the most. 
The Internet provides many sources for yield curves. Here are a few exam-
ples of what you can find on the Internet:
 SmartMoney.com (www.smartmoney.com/onebond/index.cfm?
story=yieldcurve) provides a 12-part guide to purchasing bonds. 
“The Living Yield Curve” discusses how to plot today’s yields and 
chart the curve. Curves are then analyzed for additional insights.
 CNN Money (money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter) offers bonds and
rates. You find easy to read yield curves, prices, and yields, in addition
to breaking news about the bond market. 
246
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 The Federal Reserve Board (www.federalreserve.gov/rnd.htm) pro-
vides all the statistics and historical data you need to plot yield curves.
Dataset include daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual statistics.
The yield curve approach also works for other types of bonds, such as gov-
ernment agency, municipal, or corporate bonds. Remember that you only
need to include bonds with the same level of risk, such as all AA-rated corpo-
rate bonds. Note: A strong feature for a bond issue is the rating received by
Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s Ratings. The ratings generally range from AAA
to D, with AAA being the highest quality. Corporations may have to pay an
additional 1⁄4 point if a bond issue is rated A and not AA. For more information
about bond ratings, see Chapter 12.
The easy way to value your bond returns
Bonds are often quoted at prices that differ from their stated (or par) values,
a situation that can be troublesome for investors who want to determine the
yield of the bond. You can calculate the yield value of a bond in many ways.
In my opinion, the approximate yield to maturity method provides the easiest
way to determine a bond’s current yield.
To calculate the approximate yield to maturity (YTM), you need the following
information:
 Annual interest payment (I)
 Principal payment, or par value (P)
 Price of the bond (B)
 Number of years to maturity (M)
Using these values, calculate the approximate YTM by using the following 
formula:
YTM = [I + ((P – B) ÷ M)] ÷ [(0.6 × B) + (0.4 × P)]
For example, what is the yield to maturity on a 12-year, 7 percent annual
coupon, $1,000 par value bond that sells at a discount for $942.21? Here are
the calculations:
YTM = [70 + (($1,000 – $942.21) ÷ 12)] ÷ [(0.6 × $942.21) + (0.4 × $1,000)]
YTM = [70 + (57.79 ÷ 12)] ÷ [565.33 + 400]
YTM = [70 + 4.82] ÷ 965.33
247
Chapter 13: Valuing, Buying, and Selling Bonds Online

YTM = 74.82 ÷ 965.33
YTM = 0.0775
YTM = 7.75%
If your required rate of return is 8 percent, you should not purchase the bond
because the approximate yield to maturity (7.75 percent) doesn’t meet your
financial requirements (an 8 percent return). Conversely, if the bond has a
return that is equal to or greater than 8 percent, the bond meets your objec-
tives and is a “buy” candidate.
Note: If the value of the bond is discounted (that is, sells below its par 
value — in this case, below $1,000), the yield to maturity (YTM) is greater
than the 7 percent coupon rate.
Let the Internet do the math
When you invest in bonds, calculating the worth of the bond today, in the
past, or in the near future is often helpful. Additionally, you might want to 
use a bond calculator to determine whether investing in a tax-free municipal
bond provides a better return than investing in a taxable investment. The 
following are a few examples of online calculators that can assist you with 
the math:
 FICALC (www.ficalc.com) is a free, online, fixed-income calculator. At
the home page, just click Use Calculator. Select the security market by
choosing from a list (U.S. Treasury Securities, U.S. Agency Securities, U.S.
Municipal Securities, U.S. Corporate Securities, and so on). Click Select
Market and then select the security type. For example, if you selected 
U.S. Treasuries, you then select from Bills, Notes — Fixed Coupon, and
Bonds — Fixed Coupon. Make your selection and click Select Structure.
Enter bond-specific data such as the price of the security, issue date,
maturity, and settlement dates. (If you plan to sell before maturity, enter
your personal sell date also.) To determine the yield on your proposed
investment, click Calculate.
 Key Bank (www.key.com/templates/t-ca3.jhtml?nodeID=H-3.32)
offers 11 online bond calculators so that you can analyze your bonds in
any way you desire.
 Smith Barney Access: Taxable Equivalent Yield Calculators (www.

municipal bonds can benefit you by calculating your taxable equivalent
yield and your municipal equivalent yield.

Trading Bonds Online
All of the big five online brokerages — Ameritrade (www.ameritrade.com),
Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com), E*TRADE (www.etrade.com), Fidelity
(www.fidelity.com), and TD Waterhouse (www.waterhouse.com) — trade
bonds online. Many online bond brokerages are designed for professional
bond traders. However, a few are beginning to cater to the needs of individual
investors.
Often, investors can increase the performance of their bonds by purchasing
the right securities at the lowest price by viewing a wider selection of the
fixed-income investment candidates. Some online bond brokerages specialize
in certain types of fixed-income products. Other online bond brokerages pro-
vide access to thousands of securities in all the major fixed product areas,
such as bank certificates of deposit, Treasury securities, government agency,
municipal, and corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities.
Examples of online bond brokerages include the following:
 Bondpage.com (www.bondpage.com) trades thousands of different types
of fixed-rate securities. Although you pay no initial minimum deposit
amount, you must have the amount of your purchase in your account
before the firm will execute your trade. A flat $50 transaction fee applies
to trades of fewer than 100 bonds. No transaction fee applies to trades of
100 bonds or more, but the firm may act as principal in the transaction.
 FMSBonds.com (www.fmsbonds.com) is an all-in-one site for municipal
bond investors. You can discover investor education about bonds,
market yields, and analyzing your portfolio. You can view its bond offer-
ings and check out its daily featured bonds. If you don’t find anything to

Nice and Simple: Savings Bonds
The only way many people can save money is by purchasing savings bonds.
The United States Treasury Department offers three main types of savings
bonds:
 Series EE: Series EE savings bonds (now called Patriot Bonds) are backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States. Series EE savings bonds
that you buy today earn market-based rates for 30 years. However, you
can cash in the bonds at any time after six months from the purchase
date. At this time, newly issued EE bonds pay 3.25 percent.
You pay half the face value of a Series EE bond at the time of purchase,
and you receive the face value when the bond matures. The interest rate
isn’t fixed so the maturity term is variable. The minimum denomination
is $50 and the maximum denomination is $10,000. Interest rates for
Series EE bonds are 90 percent the average rate on five-year Treasury
securities.
 Series HH: Series HH bonds pay interest directly to your account at a
financial institution every six months. These bonds have fixed interest
rates for ten years and earn interest for up to 20 years. Series HH bonds
are available in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000.
As of August 31, 2004, the U.S. government pulled the plug on Series H
and Series HH bonds. As of September 1, 2004, investors were no longer
able to reinvest HH bonds and Series H bonds or exchange Series EE or
E bonds. Not being able to reinvest can create an enormous tax bill for
investors. Go to www.savingsbond.gov to determine your tax bill and
discover what you can do to lessen your tax liability. 
250
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

 Series I: Series I bonds are inflation-indexed savings bonds. The U.S. gov-
ernment adjusts the amount of the I bond semiannually to keep up with
inflation and to protect the purchasing power of the bondholder. The first
part is the 1.1 percent that applies to the 30-year life of the bond. The
second component is a variable that is annually set and is currently at
2.57 percent. The variable component is designed to reflect the Consumer
Price Index and the buying power of investors who own the bond. It’s
interesting to note that the current yield on T-bills is significantly less than
that of I bonds. As of this date, newly issued I bonds pay 3.67 percent.
Check for old bonds in your safe-deposit box or among the papers of elderly
relatives. More than $2.3 billion in savings bonds have never been redeemed.
Hanging on to your old bonds may seem like a good idea, but they no longer
pay interest after specified periods.
You can get additional information about savings bonds from the following
Internet sources:
 The Bureau of the Public Debt (www.publicdebt.Treas.gov/sav/
savbene.htm) provides information on the benefits of savings bonds
and covers interest rates and maturity periods.
 SavingsBonds.com (www.savingsbonds.com/infocenter.cfm) offers
free, easy-to-understand information about buying, redeeming, and valu-
ing your savings bonds. You can even create an online savings bond
portfolio.
The good and the bad about savings bonds
The returns on savings bonds are so low that they’ll never make you rich. In
fact, returns are so low that large pension funds and other big investors don’t
purchase savings bonds. However, for many individuals, savings bonds are the
best approach for saving money. Savings bonds offer the following advantages:
 You can save automatically: Employers who sponsor savings bond pro-
grams can automatically deduct an amount that you designate from your
paychecks. For many people, this program is a painless way to save
money.
 You can diversify your risk: If you already have investments in stocks
and bonds, you may want to invest in savings bonds, which add a no-
risk element to your portfolio.
 Your investment is safe: In exchange for a low return, savings bonds
offer absolute safety of principal — they’re no-risk investments because
they are as safe as the money in your pocket.

Chapter 13: Valuing, Buying, and Selling Bonds Online

 You don’t pay any sales commissions: Savings bonds don’t require the
services of a broker to help you purchase them, thus you pay no sales
commissions.
 Your minimum investment is low: The minimum investment in savings
bonds is $25, and employer-sponsored plans can make the per week
minimum even lower.
 You pay low taxes, if any: The difference between the purchase price
and the redemption value of EE bonds, and the payments made on HH
bonds, comes in the form of interest. This interest income is subject to
federal income tax, but not state or local income taxes. You can defer
paying federal income tax on the interest until you cash in the bonds.
 You gain education tax benefits: For EE bonds purchased after 1989 and
cashed to pay tuition and post-secondary education fees, the interest
earned isn’t subject to federal income taxes.
Calculating the value of 
your savings bonds
Savings bonds have always been easy to purchase and are popular gifts for
new parents and grandchildren. But as easy as these financial instruments
are to buy, they’re equally difficult to value. This difficulty can be especially
troublesome if you need to cash in a bond before it matures. Additionally,
bondholders may have problems keeping an accurate inventory of the sav-
ings bonds they have on hand.
Recognizing this problem, the federal government developed two nifty
approaches to the problem. The first is an online Savings Bond Redemption
Calculator at www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sav/savcalc.htm. This online
calculator, provided by the U.S. government, can assist you in quickly under-
standing the value of your savings bonds.
The second approach is a downloadable software program called the Savings
Bond Wizard, located at the Bureau of the Public Debt at www.publicdebt.
treas.gov/sav/savwizar.htm. The easy-to-use software program, shown in
Figure 13-2, is free. All you have to do is click the appropriate link. The Savings
Bond Wizard’s features enable you to calculate interest amounts, import and
export files created in Excel spreadsheets, track cash or exchanged bonds,
and display the rate each bond is earning, and it provides specialized reports
and includes an easy inventory builder feature. Beginning with Wizard IV, you
receive all available update values. With Savings Bond Wizard, bondholders
can print copies of their bond inventories. (After a flood or fire, this inventory
is an invaluable record of the bondholder’s investment.)

Just Uncle Sam, Treasury 
Securities, and You
The federal government sells Treasury securities to the public to pay off
maturing debt and to raise the cash needed to operate the federal govern-
ment. These securities are sold at 150 auctions throughout the year. There
are three types of Treasury securities. All Treasury securities have a mini-
mum purchase price of $1,000, and additional purchase increments of $1,000.
The chief difference between Treasury securities is the life of the obligation:
 Treasury bills (T-bills) mature in three months, six months, or one year.
Treasury bills are purchased at a discount, so interest is actually paid.
You write a check for $10,000, and the government refunds the discount
(which equals the interest rate determined at auction). In other words,
your return is the difference between the purchase price and the matu-
rity value.
 Treasury notes are considered intermediate-term securities and mature
in two to ten years. They provide state and local tax-exempt interest
payments to note holders.

 Treasury bonds are long-term securities that mature in more than ten
years from the issue date. You can usually buy bonds for a price close to
their par value. Interest paid to bondholders is exempt from state and
local taxes. Note: The U.S. Treasury has ceased issuing 30-year bonds. 
In the past, the 30-year bond rate was often used as a benchmark for
long-term rates and as a standard in many different types of financial 
calculations.
The U.S. Treasury sells two kinds of notes and bonds, fixed-principal and 
inflation-indexed. Both pay interest every six months, but the principal value
of inflation-indexed securities is adjusted to reflect inflation as measured by
the Consumer Price Index. With inflation-indexed notes and bonds, the U.S.
Treasury calculates your semiannual interest payments and maturity pay-
ment based on the inflation-adjusted principal value of your security.
Buying Treasury Securities 
via the Internet
Treasury securities may not look very lucrative if you’re used to double-digit
returns, but they’re excellent investments for investors who can’t tolerate
risk. In other words, if you’re a conservative investor, U.S. Treasury securities
may be your type of investment. You can buy and sell U.S. Treasuries through
investment professionals, commercial banks, or online brokerages. If you 
purchase Treasury securities using a broker, they’re issued in a commercial
book-entry form, which means that the securities are held in the name of
your broker or dealer. The broker then maintains records of each individual
investor’s Treasury securities.
Do-it-yourself investors can now purchase Treasury securities over the
Internet or by telephone. The Internet purchase program is called Buy Direct.
You simply submit a noncompetitive bid (which I explain later in this chapter)
via the Internet (or by calling 800-722-2678). The price of the security is deb-
ited from the account you previously designated to receive Treasury Direct
payments. (This is called a Treasury Direct account. I show you how to open
your own account later in this chapter.) Tender forms and payments may also
be submitted electronically through your financial institution or government
securities broker or dealer.
Opening Treasury Direct accounts
Treasury Direct is a book-entry system that is managed by the federal govern-
ment. You can open two types of Treasury Direct accounts. The first Treasury
Direct account is for savings bonds. To open a savings bond Treasury Direct
account, you must be 18 years of age or older, provide your Social Security
254
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

number, driver’s license or state ID number and expiration date, birth date,
bank routing and account number, e-mail address, postal address, and tele-
phone number. A U.S. mailing address is required. If you don’t have a driver’s
license, just enter none in the online form. Keep in mind that there are no 
fees for opening a Treasury Direct account.
As of this date, two types of Treasury Direct accounts exist. The first account 
is a Treasury Direct account for Treasury securities. The second account is 
a Treasury Direct account for savings bonds. With a Treasury Direct account,
you can purchase Treasury bills, notes, and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protection
Securities). To open an account, download, complete, and mail in an applica-
tion form. Don’t worry about money when opening an account; there is no min-
imum initial deposit. Once you open your account, the minimum purchase
amount for Treasury bills, notes, and TIPS is $1,000. 
Opening your savings bond Treasury 
Direct account for as little as $25
You use the second type of Treasury Direct account to purchase savings
bonds. You can open a Savings Bond Treasury Direct account without mailing
in a printed and signed form. The minimum purchase amount for a Savings
Bond Treasury Direct account is $25. To open an account, follow these steps:
1. Go to Treasury Direct at www.treasurydirect.gov.
2. Click Individual/Personal. 
3. Click My Accounts. 
4. Click Open an Account. 
It takes about one minute to verify your Savings Bond Treasury Direct
account information. Once you complete your Treasury Direct application,
you’re asked to create a password. After you create your password, you’re
asked to provide three reminder security questions in case you forget your
password. You can change your answers to your authentication questions 
or even change the authentication questions.
Within five minutes after you submit your password and authentication ques-
tions, you receive your savings bond Treasury Direct account number via
e-mail. At this point, if you have money in the account you designated on
your application form, you can immediately log in to your Treasury Direct
account and start purchasing savings bonds.
Buying your first savings bond online 
Using Buy Direct, you can purchase a savings bond for $25. If you want to, you
can purchase savings bonds one at a time or schedule purchase dates that
255
Chapter 13: Valuing, Buying, and Selling Bonds Online

you determine are best for you. If you want a regular savings plan, you may
want to schedule weekly or monthly purchases with a designated start date
and end date.
Once you enter your buying information, Buy Direct provides a Purchase
Review. Check for any errors or mistakes. By clicking the Submit button, you
authorize the Bureau of the Public Debt to debit your account at the financial
institution you specified. You certify that all the information on the form is
correct and that you’re authorized to make the transaction. Click Submit, and
you purchase your first electronic savings bond online.
Redeeming your savings bonds online
Series EE and I bonds mature in 30 years. At that time, the bond will automat-
ically be redeemed and the proceeds used to purchase a zero percent certifi-
cate of indebtedness (called a zero percent C of I) in your Primary Treasury
Direct account. Proceeds of gifts that have matured will be held in the Gift
Box as gift proceeds.
If you want to redeem your Series EE or I bonds after five years, no penalties
apply. There is a three-month penalty (that is, you don’t receive interest for 
a three-month period) if you cash an EE or I bond within the first five years
from its issue date.
Redeeming EE, and I bonds by using Treasury Direct is very simple. In Current
Holdings, select the savings bonds you want to redeem and click Submit at 
the bottom of the screen. The Current Holding Detail screen for the security
selected appears. Click Redeem at the bottom of the screen. At the redemp-
tion request screen, indicate whether you want full or partial redemption and
where you want the redemption proceeds to be deposited. Treasury Direct
makes payments using the direct deposit method to any U.S. financial institu-
tion account or to your zero percent C of I, whichever account you designate.
Treasury bills, notes, and TIPS 
Treasury Direct accounts
To open a Treasury Bills, Notes, and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protection
Securities) Treasury Direct account, you must complete a paper form. The
New Account Request form (PD F 5182) is available at wwws.publicdebt.
treas.gov/NC/FoRMSHome?FormType=TDF.
Download the application form, fill it out online or print it and fill in the blanks,
and then mail the completed form to your local Federal Reserve Bank. (You
need Adobe Acrobat Reader to display and print the form. You can download
the free Acrobat Reader program from www.adobe.com.)
256
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

You can open a Treasury Direct account without submitting a minimum
deposit. When you mail the application form to open an account, don’t send
any cash; it’s free. For the address of the nearest Federal Reserve Bank, go 
to www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sav/savfrb.htm, type your zip code, and
then press the Locate button.
Treasury Direct sets up an account, and you can purchase securities later,
when you choose. After you’ve established an account (and Treasury Direct
has confirmed your deposit arrangements), you can purchase securities and
maintain your account either by the traditional paper-and-mail method or
online.
If you purchase Treasury securities directly from the federal government,
they’re issued in a book-entry form that is held in the Bureau of the Public
Debt’s Treasury Direct system (www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sec/
sectrdir.htm). The securities are issued to your individual account.
You can see your account balance online at www.publicdebt.treas.gov/
sec/sectdes.htm. Just go to the Virtual Lobby by clicking Continue, typing
your Treasury Direct account number, and then clicking Enter the Lobby.
Your Treasury Direct Account can be less than $100,000, but expect mainte-
nance charges of $25 per year for each $100,000 in your account. Treasury
Direct provides information about how to open and maintain a Treasury
Direct Investor Account at www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sec/secacct.htm.
You may want to consider accumulating cash in a money market account (for
any purpose other than education). The interest rate paid is often as good as
or better than an investment in Treasuries, and you have much more liquidity.
(You don’t have to wait three months to five years to get your money back.)
How to buy Treasuries online
To discover when you can buy Treasuries, refer to the calendar of upcoming
auction dates at the Bureau of the Public Debt (www.publicdebt.treas.
gov/of/ofannpr.htm), which provides a constantly updated three-month
calendar of tentative auction dates so that you can plan ahead. Official auc-
tion dates are announced about seven days before the securities are offered. 
Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are sold through competitive and noncom-
petitive bidding:
 Noncompetitive bid: You agree to accept a rate determined by the auc-
tion, and in return you’re guaranteed that your bid successfully results
in purchasing the security you desire. Most individual investors submit
noncompetitive bids. Noncompetitive bids from individual investors
can’t exceed $5 million for the same offering of Treasury notes or bonds.
257
Chapter 13: Valuing, Buying, and Selling Bonds Online

 Competitive bid: For a bill auction, the investor submits an offer — or
tender — specifying a discount rate to two decimal places (for example
5.12 percent). For a note or bond auction, the investor submits a tender
specifying a yield to three decimal places (for example, 5.123 percent).
Common fractions may not be used. If the bid falls within the range
accepted at the auction, the investor is awarded the security. If the bid 
is at the high rate or yield, the investor may not be awarded the full
amount bid. Most financial institutions (banks, insurance companies,
brokerages, and so on) submit competitive bids.
Don’t let the jargon of Treasury securities make purchasing seem more com-
plex than it really is. A noncompetitive bid is similar to a market order (you
definitely get the security, but you don’t know what price you receive),
whereas a competitive bid is similar to a limit order (you know what price
you get, but you don’t know whether you definitely get the security).
With Buy Direct, you can make a noncompetitive purchase of Treasuries
during the hours of 8:00 am to 12 midnight EST, Monday through Friday,
excluding Federal holidays. Most investors submit their bids prior to noon
EST on the day the security is auctioned. Most individual investors purchase
Treasuries by making noncompetitive bids. Buy Direct only allows you to
make noncompetitive bids for Treasuries via the telephone or the Internet by
completing the following steps: 
1. If you use a telephone, dial 800-722-2678 and wait for the prompt.
Press I to indicate that you want to invest or reinvest. 
2. If you use the Web, indicate that you want to invest and enter your
Treasury Direct account number and your Social Security number (or
employer identification number). 
3. Choose the security you want to purchase. 
4. Choose the amount of money you want to invest. 
The minimum is $1,000, and the maximum is $5 million for any one bill,
note, or TIPS. Bids must be made in multiples of $1,000. 
5. On the Internet, select the security’s issue date. 
Telephone users don’t have this option; you’ll automatically receive
your chosen security at the next available issue date. 
6. If you purchase a Treasury bill, choose the number of times you want
to reinvest the security. 
You can reinvest between zero and eight times for a 13-week Treasury
bill and zero to four times for a 26-week Treasury bill. 
7. When the transaction is complete, the system automatically provides
you with a confirmation number. Keep this number for your records. 
258
Part II: Finding the Right Investments 

When the U.S. government issues your Treasuries to you, Buy Direct will
deduct the purchase price from the bank account you specified when you
opened your Treasury Direct account. 
By mail Treasuries can be purchased by noncompetitive and competitive
bids using Form PD F 5381, which is available at wwws.publicdebt.treas.
gov/NC/FoRMSHome?FormType=TDF. Just fill it out and send it in. On the PD F
5381 Form, you must decide whether you want to send in a competitive or a
noncompetitive bid, both of which are explained previously in this section. If
you submit this form and don’t already have an account, Treasury Direct
establishes an account for you and then processes your bid for securities.
Selling your Treasury securities
The good news is that you can sell your Treasury securities before they
mature, with or without a broker. The bad news is that both approaches cost
you extra money.
 Let the federal government sell your Treasury securities. If you want
to sell one or many Treasuries that you’re holding in your Treasury
Direct account before they mature, complete the Sell Direct Request
form (PD F 5179-1). Send the completed, signed, and certified form to
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Investment Division for Sell Direct, 
230 LaSalle Street, Chicago, IL 60604.
Sell Direct, shown in Figure 13-3, gets quotes from different dealers, and
you get the best price offered. The fee is $34 for each security sold. The
proceeds from the sale of the Treasury security are deposited directly to
your savings or checking account, less the transaction fee. You receive 
a sale confirmation, the appropriate IRS 1099 form, and a Statement of
Account showing your new balance. For more information, see www.
publicdebt.treas.gov/sec/secselld.htm.
 Sell your Treasury securities through a broker. In a secondary market
for Treasury securities, investors can sell Treasury securities before
they mature through a brokerage. For instance, assume that you pur-
chased a six-month Treasury bill. Three months later, you decide to sell.
Other investors will purchase the Treasury bill at a slightly higher price
than what you paid because it’s closer to maturity. Brokerage fees vary
for these services, so shop around for the best price.
You can also purchase Treasury securities in the secondary market — that is,
through your full-service or online brokerage — if you want to have securities
(money) come due on a specific date to meet a financial objective.

Fraud alert! Some fraudsters employ scams that involve the renting or leasing
of U.S. Treasury securities. Usually, the securities offered don’t exist (the offer
is for bearer securities in an amount that exceeds the amount that remains out-
standing on the bearer form for a particular security) or are not owned by the
party making the offer (the securities don’t exist or are owned by someone else
who isn’t aware of this transaction). If someone approaches you with one of
these offers, ask the individual to produce the securities or otherwise prove
ownership. He or she will be unable to do so, offering excuses like, “They’re
frozen at my bank,” “A wealthy philanthropist has assigned them to me to
assign to others for infrastructure or humanitarian purposes in third-world
countries and wishes to remain anonymous,” or “Bank secrecy laws of this
country (often Great Britain, Greece, or South Africa) prevent such a verifica-
tion.” In an effort to fool you, the scam artist might additionally misuse Public
Debt forms or CUSIP numbers as evidence of ownership and/or claim that the
scam has been certified by a well-known or official organization.
Increasing Your Profits with 
a Treasuries Ladder
One way to lessen your risk to changes in interest rates and to manage your
cash flow is to create a Treasuries ladder. Each rung of the Treasuries ladder
consists of a different bond maturity. For example, the first rung of the ladder
may include Treasuries that mature in one year. The second rung can include
Treasuries that mature in two years, and so on for ten years.
Bond ladders are the fixed-income equivalents to dollar-cost averaging with
stocks or mutual funds. With a bond ladder, a part of your portfolio matures
each year, and you reinvest it regardless of what happens to yields. This
approach reduces exposure to interest rate fluctuations and requires low
maintenance on your part.
Here’s how it works. Imagine that you have $20,000 to invest in Treasuries:
Year Zero: You buy at auction the following combination of securities:
eight 1-year bills, eight 2-year notes, two 5-year notes, and two 10-year
notes, each with a face value of $1,000.
Year One: You let a year go by, and your bills mature. You use the pro-
ceeds at the next auction to buy two 10-year notes, two 5-year notes,
two 2-year notes, and two 1-year bills.
Year Two: You let another year go by. Your bill and the 2-year notes you
bought in Year Zero mature. You use the proceeds at the next auction to
buy two 10-year notes, two 5-year notes, four 2-year notes, and two 1-
year bills.
261
Chapter 13: Valuing, Buying, and Selling Bonds Online

Year Three: Can you see how your bond ladder is shaping up? Another
year goes by, four securities mature, and you use the proceeds to buy
two 5-year notes and two 10-year notes.
Year Four: As the fourth year closes, four securities mature, and you use
the proceeds to buy two 5-year notes and two 10-year notes. Your bond
ladder is now complete. From this point on, only two bonds will mature
per year. When these bonds mature, you can use the proceeds to buy
two new 10-year notes.

n this chapter, I explain how international investing can assist you in
diversifying your portfolio beyond the usual alternatives. You discover
how you can find indexes that indicate those economies that aren’t moving in
the same direction as the United States’ and how you can use this informa-
tion to reduce the risk of your personal portfolio. When you decide which
market meets your investment criteria, check out the country’s political,
market, and inflation risks at the Web sites that I suggest in this chapter.
I also describe the many ways in which you can make foreign investments.
You may be surprised to discover that, even though you should be a special-
ist in foreign securities to invest directly in an international company in its
foreign market, even beginning investors can invest in foreign markets by
purchasing American Depository Receipts (ADRs). This chapter explains how
ADRs, which represent foreign equities, have the look of domestic stocks and
can be purchased online through your electronic brokerage. You can even
purchase ADRs online without a broker.
This chapter also explores how you can make indirect purchases of interna-
tional equities by buying international mutual funds or by purchasing shares
of multinational corporations. Keep in mind that international investments
are subject to their own unique kinds of risk. This chapter explains how polit-
ical risk, currency risk, and other types of risks can quickly reduce your prof-
its or even wipe out your initial investment.

Taking Advantage of International
Opportunities
According to JPMorgan’s U.S. Investors: Equity Capital Flows Abroad, 4Q03 and
CY03 report, in the fourth quarter of 2003, U.S. investors owned $1.944 trillion
in foreign shares and ADRs. During this time period, the total amount of U.S.
investor holdings in domestic and foreign shares was valued at $15.5 trillion.
The average foreign component of U.S. equity portfolios was about 12.5 per-
cent. According to the Federal Reserve, this number was a record high for
U.S. investors.
Non-U.S. equity performance versus the S & P 500 drove investors to invest
overseas. Additionally, the hope of a global economic recovery spurred
investors to go bargain hunting abroad. Coupling these factors to the recent
decline in the U.S. dollar has made foreign markets more attractive. I’ve heard
some U.S. investors complain that if they didn’t invest overseas, they wouldn’t
have any profits at all.
One of the benefits of international investing is that it offers an opportunity to
diversify your portfolio. Diversification is defined as the lack of concentration in
any one item. In other words, a portfolio composed of many different securities
is diversified. Diversification can mean spreading your personal assets among
different types of investments (such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds) so
that returns don’t depend on the performance of any one type of investment.
Diversification can also include diversifying your assets among different sec-
tors, such as technology and consumer products. In addition, you can diversify
your portfolio by investing in international companies, either directly or indi-
rectly, as I explain in this chapter. 
The advantage of international diversification is that foreign markets often
don’t move in the same direction as U.S. markets at any point in time.
Consequently, a portfolio containing stocks from many countries may 
have less volatility than a portfolio of just domestic stocks. Additionally, 
the returns on your foreign securities could be higher than those of your
domestic investments.
However, investing in foreign securities isn’t a surefire way to avoid invest-
ment risk. In the market crash of 1987, about 19 of 23 foreign markets declined
more than 20 percent. (A crash is usually defined as a decline of 33 percent.)
This decline was considered unusual because of the low degree of correlation
between the historical returns of different countries.
In general, the benefits of international investing are
 More investment opportunities: Studying the market indexes of 
foreign markets may provide you with insight about new investment 
opportunities.
266
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

 Greater diversification safety: Not investing all your personal assets in
one type of security or industry sector may bulletproof your portfolio,
insulating you from domestic market volatility.
 Uncovering new world-class companies: The emergence of high-quality
foreign companies is one of the many drivers of the demand for interna-
tional investing. In many cases, these companies can provide higher-
than-usual investor returns.
 Higher overall returns: Global markets frequently don’t move in the
same direction as the U.S. market. If the U.S. market is down, a foreign
market may be up.
You might want to consider investing 10 percent of your portfolio in foreign
securities. Then use dollar-cost averaging (see Chapter 15 for details) to
increase your international holdings to a risk level that allows you to sleep at
night. Keep in mind that international investing has its own unique risks.
Getting Started with Online International
Quotes and Indexes
Stock indexes or averages are sets of stocks that are grouped to make a com-
posite index. Stocks are selected and given a weighting relative to the other
stocks in the group. Comparing stock indexes from different countries around
the world is a good place to start your search for international investment
candidates. By looking at the price and percentage change of an index, you
can gain a good idea of which markets are moving in which direction. You can
use this information to compare markets and spot investment opportunities.
Keep in mind how stocks are ranked in the different indexes. For example, 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted average. The higher the
sales price of a particular stock, the greater the impact on the average. In
contrast, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is a value-weighted index. Each
company is weighted in the index by its own total market value as a percent-
age of the total market value of all the firms in the index. In this case, the
higher the number of shares outstanding, the bigger the impact on the index.
For example, if two companies have stock selling at the same price but one
company has more outstanding shares, the company with the most outstand-

Gathering International 
News and Research
The political environment of your international investment is important. The
Internet can assist you in monitoring and researching your current invest-
ments and investment candidates. For example, you can track breaking 
international news stories through all the online major news organizations,
including Google News (news.google.com), ABC News (abcnews.go.com),
CNN/Money (money.cnn.com), MSN Money (moneycentral.msn.com/

mentary reviews current financial events and explains how they could
impact the near future. You can research industry, country, and com-
pany profiles.
Online Trading Abroad
If you’re traveling internationally, don’t stop monitoring your online invest-
ment accounts. Additionally, you may be able to trade stocks online with
your current online brokerage while you’re traveling abroad. (If you haven’t
selected an online brokerage, see Chapter 4.) Before you hit the road, how-
ever, you have to do some preparation. You need to do three things:
1. Make certain that your Internet service provider (ISP) has an interna-
tional connection or counterpart.
Recently, when I traveled to Europe, the “international” part of my 
ISP was in a dispute with its U.S. partner, and I had to sign up with
another ISP.
271
Chapter 14: Going International Online

2. Purchase and install an international modem card for your laptop
computer.
3. Get telephone adapters (just like the electrical adapters you’ll bring
along) for each country you plan to visit.
Test each foreign city’s local dialup number from your home. Using your
travel itinerary as a guide, write down the names of the cities and countries
you plan to visit. Refer to your ISP for the local dialup telephone number for
each city. Dial the number and make certain the connection to your laptop
computer works. If anything doesn’t work, fixing the problem is easier done
before you leave home.
If, for some reason, you can’t get your online connection to work, you may
want to consider opening an account while abroad. For example, consider
the European counterpart to a U.S. online brokerage, such as E*TRADE and
TD Waterhouse.
E*TRADE UK is a different operation than E*TRADE. E*TRADE UK (uk.
etrade.com), which specializes in U.K. and other European securities, 
trades in pounds sterling instead of in American dollars.
Investing in Emerging Markets
A foreign country with an emerging market is making an effort to improve 
its national economy and productive capacity. However, emerging markets
might be neither poor nor small. For example, China is defined as an emerging
market. Other examples include Chile, Jordan, Korea, Thailand, and Zimbabwe.
These emerging countries may have the potential of risk reduction for U.S.
investors because the factors that affect the economic welfare of the emerging
market are often different from key factors in the United States.
In you’re interested in researching foreign emerging markets, check out the
following sites:
 ISI Emerging Markets (www.securities.com) offers hard-to-get infor-
mation on more than 55 emerging markets. You find news articles, finan-
cial statements, company information, industry analyses, equity quotes,
macroeconomic statistics, and market-specific information that are

 Emerging Markets Online (www.emerging-markets.com) offers in-
depth management studies, consulting, and an industry database.

gence. Industry reports can be parsed by region. Research reports aver-
age 200 pages in length and include detailed charts, graphics, figures,
and tables. Prices vary from around $1,095 for a print version to almost
$1,200 for a PDF version.

try, category, and size of investment) so that your trash-to-treasure ratio is
better than average. You also find useful links to additional information.
Problems with Investing Directly 
in Foreign Companies
The most obvious, but least likely, approach to participating in foreign invest-
ments is by directly purchasing shares of a firm in its own foreign market
through a foreign online broker or overseas branch of an American online
brokerage. This approach may be the source of numerous problems for an
inexperienced online international investor. These problems can be summa-
rized into three areas: administrative, tax, and information gathering.
Administration troubles
Administration rules in foreign countries sometimes differ from the rules 
in the United States. For example, in the Swiss and Mexican stock markets,
investors must settle their accounts one day after a transaction. London 
has a two-week settlement procedure. And in France, you may have several
different settlement dates depending upon the securities you purchase.
Additionally, transaction costs (fees and commissions) may be higher than 
in the United States. For example, mutual funds with foreign equities usually
have higher fees and expenses, in addition to difficulties with stock delivery
and capital transfers, than funds that invest in stocks of U.S. companies.
Tax problems
Some foreign countries levy withholding taxes of 15 to 30 percent on divi-
dends or interest paid to nonresidents. You may need to hire a tax accoun-
tant to secure an exemption or rebate on part of the foreign withholding tax.
This time-consuming, costly paper shuffling may reduce your net returns.
273
Chapter 14: Going International Online

Information difficulties
The SEC closely regulates U.S. equities. For example, American companies
have to send the SEC reports of their activities every 90 days. If something
extraordinary happens during this 90-day period, the publicly traded firm has
to send in a report explaining what’s happening. Additionally, all financial
reports have to meet established accounting standards, and publicly traded
companies must provide investors with audited annual reports.
Foreign investment standards may not be this rigorous. Additionally, you may
encounter language problems. Even with English-speaking countries, you may
be in for a few surprises. For example, British financial statements are upside-
down when compared to U.S. statements. Fixed assets are listed first, and
current assets are listed last; U.S. financial statements list current assets first
and fixed assets last.
Buying ADRs Is an Easy Solution
Only the most sophisticated money managers tackle the problems associated
with investing directly in a firm in its own foreign market. (However, with the
consolidation of many of the world’s exchanges, this pattern may change in
the near future.) The solution for individual investors is to purchase shares 
in foreign firms in the United States through American Depository Receipts
(ADRs). ADRs enable American investors to acquire and trade foreign securi-
ties denominated in U.S. dollars without concern for the differing administra-
tion procedures, such as settlement time, that usually accompany trading in
foreign markets.
ADRs were first introduced in 1927 in response to a law passed in Britain.
Two banks are generally involved in maintaining and listing ADRs on a U.S.
exchange:
 An investment bank establishes an ADR by arranging to buy the shares
on a foreign market and issuing the ADRs on the U.S. markets.
 A depository bank, such as the Bank of New York (www.bankofny.com),
handles the issuance and cancellation of ADR certificates backed by
shares based on investor orders, as well as other services provided to
an issuer of ADRs, but isn’t involved in the selling of ADRs.
ADRs are U.S. dollar–denominated, negotiable instruments issued in the
United States by a depository bank representing ownership in foreign securi-
ties. ADRs are generally listed with the letter a after the firm’s name. You can
274
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

find ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange (www.nyse.com) and NASDAQ
(www.nasdaq.com). You can trade ADRs online just like any other type of
security. Dividends are paid in dollars, and annual company reports are in
English. Online brokerage commission rates are usually the same as for any
other type of security.
You can purchase ADRs without a broker. For details, see NetstockDirect at
www.netstockdirect.com. At the home page, click Stock Plans, select
International Company for the type of company you want to invest in, and
click Find Plans. The next page shows almost 400 ADRs you can purchase
without paying a brokerage commission.
The risks of international investments
For the most part, ADRs look and feel pretty much like any other stock.
However, although investing in ADRs may be convenient, it isn’t risk-free.
Keep in mind the risk/return trade-off. Generally, the higher risks associated
with ADRs include country or political risk, as well as changes in currency
valuations.
Country and political risk
Many foreign governments operate in unstable environments. Some countries
may be subject to civil wars or revolutions. The danger of nationalization
(when the government takes control of a company you’ve invested in) can
limit the capital flows to foreign investors. Countries that can’t meet their 
foreign debt obligations are subject to political problems. Other questions 
to consider: Is inflation under control? Are there any trade barriers? Do 
rulers succeed one another without civil war or revolution?
Exchange rate risk
If the currency exchange rate changes for your investments, you may earn
less or more than you expect. If the value of the U.S. dollar weakens relative
to the foreign currency, the foreign currency increases in value. If the U.S.
dollar gets stronger, the foreign investment decreases in value. One way to
avoid this situation is to purchase financial futures that guarantee you a
return if the value of the foreign currency decreases relative to the U.S. dollar.
Currency devaluation may be the biggest risk for international investing.
Investing in a foreign equity from a country that has a strong currency is
better than investing in a foreign equity that has promises of big gains but 
an unstable economy or a high likelihood of political upheaval.

The Internet can assist you in researching the company profiles of foreign
companies and provide lists of companies that offer ADRs. Here are several
examples of what you can find online:

Indirect Foreign Investing 
Is a Great Approach
ADRs are a great approach to directly purchasing foreign investments, but
they have one drawback: Many ADRs aren’t available for the majority of 
276
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

foreign corporations. If you’re like many individual investors who want to
participate in foreign markets, check out international mutual funds. The
advantage of mutual funds is the ability to vary your foreign investments 
and professional management so that you don’t have to hassle with the 
many administrative and legal barriers to online international investing.
As with all investments, you want to look beyond this quarter’s earnings.
Check the company’s profits relative to competitors and to industry stan-
dards. Find out whether the company’s market share is dominant and 
growing.
Diversification through foreign funds
You can choose from many types of foreign funds to achieve the type of diver-
sification, as well as professional management, that you want. Foreign fund
managers are veterans in investing overseas and are prepared to handle the
administrative problems that you, as an individual investor, don’t have the
time or expertise to deal with. Keep in mind that these managers can’t guaran-
tee you supernormal returns, but they can assist you in avoiding investing
blunders or costly mistakes.
Foreign mutual funds, like domestic mutual funds, can be either closed-end
or open-end funds, as well as load or no-load. For information about the limi-
tations and regulations surrounding the different types of funds, see Chapter 6.
Keep in mind that like open-end funds, the portfolios of international closed-
end mutual funds can be equities, bonds, convertibles, or any combination of
these securities. The holdings of the closed-end mutual funds can be geared
toward income, capital gains, or a combination of these goals. For example,
Korea Fund specializes in the stocks of Korean companies. In contrast, ASA
Limited, another international closed-end mutual fund, specializes in the
stocks of South African companies involved in gold mining.
Over the years, the mutual fund industry has made investing in foreign funds
easy for American investors by establishing funds whose policies mandate
investing in the five specific areas that are listed below. Additionally, mutual
fund companies may select foreign companies that are growing quickly or are
value stocks, which money managers hope will rebound.
 Regional funds focus on a certain geographic area. Frequently, these
areas are Europe, Latin America, and the Pacific Basin. The prices of
these funds tend to be more volatile than funds that cover a broader
area and are more diversified.
 Single-country funds are limited to just one country. The fund may
include stocks, bonds, and other types of investments. Because of their
narrow focus, these funds tend to be risky.
277
Chapter 14: Going International Online

 Emerging-market funds invest in countries that are moving from an agri-
cultural to an industrial economy or from a government-controlled econ-
omy to a free enterprise economy. These funds frequently offer more
risk than funds from developed countries.
 Global funds are often a mix of U.S. and foreign equities and are usually
geared toward long-term growth.
 International funds concentrate on equities that are outside the United
States and don’t include any domestic securities.
Global funds invest in companies wherever they’re located, including the
United States. International funds focus solely on companies outside the
United States. If you don’t have lots of U.S. investments, a global fund may 
be the way to go. On the other hand, if you already have many U.S. stocks or
mutual funds, you may discover that an international fund better meets your
requirements for diversification. 
Buying shares in multinational companies
Many large U.S. corporations are multinational companies with assets and
operations spread throughout the world. Purchasing shares in these compa-
nies is an easy way to indirectly participate in the international marketplace.
However, some analysts warn that investing in multinationals doesn’t provide
the investment benefits that individual investors are seeking because the
stock prices of multinational companies tend to move in the same direction
as their own country’s financial markets.
Investing in international securities is a long-term commitment. Plan on at
least a five-year time horizon for your investment. International markets can
be more volatile than U.S. markets. Therefore, a long-term commitment and
the self-discipline to stay the course are essential to your financial well-being.
Finding International 
Mutual Funds Online
Investments in international mutual funds enable investors to diversify their
portfolios beyond the usual choices. Foreign markets are often influenced by
different factors from those that affect domestic markets. Investing in interna-
tional mutual funds is one way investors can take advantage of international
opportunities without having to become specialists in international securities.

IPOs, DPOs, and DRIPs
In This Chapter
 Evaluating initial public offerings (IPOs)

 Bypassing broker fees to buy shares directly from the company (DPPs) 
 Using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) to increase your personal wealth
E
veryone has heard stories about someone who got rich by purchasing
the right stock at the right time. Looking back at these stories, the type
of stock these individuals usually purchased was an initial public offering —
called an IPO for short. In this chapter, I show how you can evaluate these
types of stocks, determine what their limitations are, locate online sources of
IPO news and research, and know which brokers specialize in IPOs or the
mutual funds that include this type of financial asset.
An even grander opportunity is a direct public offering, or DPO. Even more
speculative than IPOs, shares in these companies are comparable to invest-
ments by venture capitalists. In this chapter, I explain the limitations of DPOs,
how to purchase DPOs, and where to find online DPO research and informa-
tion. For frugal investors that don’t want to pay brokerage commissions, I
show you how you can use direct purchase plans (DPPs) to purchase shares
directly from the companies that interest you, in addition to how you can
participate in dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs).

Looking for Investment 
Opportunities: IPOs
The much-anticipated IPO of Google, likely the most popular search engine
on the Internet, celebrated the return of individual investors to the IPO
market. Moreover, the excitement surrounding the Google IPO topped off a
five-year recovery of the IPO market. For example, IPOs increased in 2004 
by 30 percent and raised over $43 billion. To the surprise of many experts
and individual investors, IPOs for the Internet, energy, and cyclical products
and services had the strongest returns. Overall, the 2004 IPO market com-
memorated four consecutive years of positive IPO returns. This is a real feat
because none of the major indices, such as the S & P 500 or the Dow Jones
Industrial Averages, can claim the same success.
When a company sells stock that trades publicly for the first time, that event
is called an initial public offering (IPO). The United States market averages
between 250 and 275 IPOs per year. These IPO company issuers sell shares 
to an underwriter. The underwriter, in turn, resells shares to investors at a
prearranged offering price. Underwriters often underprice issues by 5 to 10
percent to ensure adequate demand. Generally, shares begin trading immedi-
ately on a stock exchange or over the counter through the NASDAQ stock
market. About one week after issue, due to market efficiency, the excess
returns due to the initial discount disappearing. This scenario indicates that
the best time to purchase an IPO is on initial distribution from the underwrit-
ing syndicate (which includes investment bankers, dealers, and brokers).
Every year, development companies and companies just starting to generate
revenues seek additional capital for business expansions. Investors purchase
shares so that they can reap the short-term rewards of price swings or share 
in the long-term prosperity of getting in early on a new investment opportunity.
The investment in an IPO is speculative. These companies often have no
proven strategies for success and no track record of marketing success or
corporate earnings. Many of these companies crash and burn, and only a few
endure to become big-time financial success stories. Keep in mind that for
every Intel or Microsoft, 50 companies go bankrupt. (Studies show that about
50 percent of IPO firms are in business five years after their initial offerings.)
In other words, the success rate of IPOs is one out of every two.
Understanding the basics of IPOs, performing fundamental research, and
knowing how to be an early shareholder can increase your chances of suc-
cess. Ameritrade (www.ameritrade.com/education/html/encyclopedia/
tutorial1/t1_s10.html) provides education about the basics of IPOs.

Getting the scoop on IPOs
The following guidelines may help you select a winner out of the thousands
of companies that have initial public offerings each year:
 Read the prospectus.
Read the preliminary prospectus to find out about the company’s
expected growth. The red herring (a preliminary prospectus that pro-
vides information but isn’t an offer to sell the security and doesn’t
include any offering prices) includes a description of the issuer’s busi-
ness, the names and addresses of key corporate officers, the ownership
amounts of the key officers, any litigation problems, the company’s cur-
rent capitalization, and how the company plans to use the new funds
from the offering.
 Perform fundamental analysis.
Evaluate the company’s financial performance by using fundamental
analysis, just like you would for any other stock. 
Fundamental analysis is a form of security valuation that seeks to deter-
mine the intrinsic value of a stock based on the stock’s underlying eco-
nomics. You then compare the intrinsic value and the asking price. 
For more details about how to perform a fundamental analysis, see
Chapter 11.
 Check out the company’s management.
Examine the backgrounds of the firm’s senior managers. What is their
executive management experience and education? Do they have work
experience in their current jobs?
 Read the mission statement.
Investigate the firm’s strategy. Is it realistic? How large is the company’s
market? Who is the competition? If the company plans to gain less than
25 percent of the total market, the firm may not be a long-term success.
 Investigate the planned use of funds.
Determine why raising a certain amount of capital is so critical to the
company’s success. If the money is used to pay debt, the company
might be headed for problems; using the money for expansion is a 
positive sign.
 Compare IPO prices.
Compare expected IPO prices in the red herring with the final prospec-
tus. If the price is higher in the later prospectus, the underwriters are
enthusiastic about the offering. Lower prices indicate a lack of interest
by the investment community.

 Determine whether it’s your kind of company.
Decide whether you want to own stock in the company you’re research-
ing. Maybe it’s a great financial opportunity, but you have reservations
about the product or service. (For example, do you really want to be
part owner in a company that kills frogs?)
 Estimate your planned holding period.
Decide how long you plan to keep the shares. If the IPO is going to be
successful, it will be a better long-term investment than short-term
investment because IPO stock prices tend to move up or down with the
stock market.

IPOs, the mechanics of IPO offerings, the underwriting process, and IPOs 
in the real world.
Understanding the limitations of IPOs
If your goal is to create massive wealth or to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle,
making the most of your money takes time and vigilance. You always need 
to be on the lookout for new opportunities and new ways to invest your sav-
ings. To many online investors, an IPO may seem like the perfect way to get 
in on the ground floor of a great opportunity for high-flying returns. If the IPO
you select is going to be a good investment, then with luck, it could pay off
over the long term. Your investment will grow as the company expands and
becomes profitable. But a high level of risk exists. IPOs are speculative invest-
ments. Many promising firms go bust. You need to consider the limitations of
IPOs. For example:
 Many IPOs lose much of their value after the first day of trading.
 Many positive-looking IPOs are offered only to the “best” clients of
large brokerage firms, pension plans, and institutions. However, you
can always gain access to an IPO when it starts trading on the secondary
market. (The stock begins trading on the secondary market when an
investor purchases it from the investment-banking firm in the primary
market and begins to sell it on a stock exchange.) The performances of
these stocks are similar to the performances of small cap stocks and 
are very volatile.
 After three to six months, IPOs may underperform some small cap
stocks. The source of this problem may be employees selling their
shares and forcing the stock price to decline.
 After three to six months, the popularity of a strong IPO often fades.

Locating IPO online super-sites
Over the last several years, the number of IPO super-sites has decreased.
Many of the remaining Web sites now charge for access to content. Some of
the content on one Web site may be identical to another IPO super-site.
However, the subscription rate for one Web site may be three to four times
higher than for another. Therefore, it’s important to shop for the IPO super-
site that provides the content that best matches your interests and your
pocketbook.
The following IPO super-sites are good examples of what you can find on the
Internet. Each IPO super-site offers online investors convenient one-stop
shopping and is loaded with a wide variety of amenities. Investors frequently
discover that much of the cutting-edge IPO information they find is geared
toward their unique investor strategies. Therefore, checking out and sub-
scribing to an IPO super-site, such as one of the following, may well be worth
your time and money.
 EDGAR Online’s IPO Express (ipoportal.edgar-online.com/ipo/

A sure-fire way of owning IPOs
Most IPOs go to large institutional buyers, such
as banks, pension funds, and mutual funds.
Frequently, traditional brokerages receive a few
shares for affluent or active investors. To get on
the preferred customer list, an IPO investor might
need more than $100,000 invested in his or her
trading account. Some brokerages require bal-
ances as high as $1 million. One way for the do-
it-yourself online investor to catch a potential IPO
winner is to tap into the up-to-the-minute IPO
information that’s available on the Internet. A fail-
safe approach to getting in on the IPO of your
choice is to purchase shares in a mutual fund
that has already purchased shares of the IPO.
Several large mutual funds include IPOs.
However, participation in IPOs shouldn’t be the
only reason you purchase a mutual fund. Before
making your investment decision, you still need
to carefully read the fund’s prospectus and com-
pare it with other mutual funds and your overall
financial objectives.

Google auctions its IPO
In 2004, search engine behemoth Google com-
pleted its highly anticipated IPO. Traditionally,
when companies go public, only large financial
institutions and affluent investors have access to
new shares. Google wanted to give everyone a
chance to purchase shares and decided to auc-
tion shares to individual investors. Unfortunately,
due to individual investors being wary of the IPO
market and the complex auction process, the
Google shares didn’t sell well. In the end, the IPO
was done more or less the old-fashioned way:
That is, pricing shares at a 30-percent discount
to their original price range as demanded by sev-
eral large institutional investors such as Fidelity.
During this time period, media attention about the
IPO, discounted pricing, and positive analyst
reports resulted in Google shares being bid up to
100 percent of their initial price. For Google, auc-
tioning the IPO meant not receiving the full
amount of capitalization it expected and more
shares going to big institutional investors than it
intended.

Chapter 15: Looking for the Next Big Thing: IPOs, DPOs, and DRIPs

Be Your Own Broker with Direct 
Public Offerings (DPOs)
Historically, small companies have had a difficult time finding capital to
expand their businesses. Traditional lenders are frequently unwilling to take
risks with untried companies. Venture capitalists negotiate tough deals that
often force company founders out of key management roles. And traditional
IPOs require a minimum of $15 million in annual revenue.
If you take an initial public offering (IPO) and cut out the underwriter, what
you have left is a direct public offering (DPO). Direct public offerings (DPOs)
are defined as the direct sale of shares in a company to individual investors.
DPOs have been around for more than 20 years. For example, Ben & Jerry’s
used a DPO to raise capital for the ice cream company. However, the offering
was limited to investors from its home state of Vermont.
In October 1995, the SEC fueled DPOs with a ruling that makes electronic
delivery of a prospectus acceptable. Consequently, companies can raise
needed capital by selling their shares directly to the public via the Internet.
These DPOs have the following advantages for small companies:
 Cost and time savings: The company saves thousands of dollars in
underwriting expenses.
 Regulation of Internet IPOs: Issuers can file faster, turnaround times are
quicker, filing is less expensive, the sales process carries fewer restric-
tions, and issuers can announce planned offerings.
 Management remains focused: Management isn’t drawn away from the
company’s day-to-day business needs and customers.
 Investors can get in really early: Investors have access to venture 
capital types of investments.
 No broker commissions: Investors don’t have to pay high broker 
commissions.
Recognizing the limitations of DPOs
Many companies are offering DPOs instead of initial public offerings (IPOs).
For many online investors, a DPO is the best way to get in on the ground floor
and share in a company’s success. Investors can purchase shares directly
from the companies that they want to be part owners of. However, DPOs 
have some limitations:
290
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

 Blue sky laws: Issuing companies must be registered with the SEC and 
in the states in which they offer securities, but new legislation allows
companies to use the Internet to present direct public offerings. This
new legislation is inconsistent with regulations passed in 1911. The 1911
rule requires issuers to register in the states in which they offer stocks,
but the Internet has no boundaries and thus offers worldwide distribu-
tion of stock offerings. Does this mean that issuers have to register in
each state that uses the Internet? Some issuers register in all 50 states
before offering shares. However, one state, Pennsylvania, only requires
companies to clearly indicate where they’re registered and who may
purchase securities.
 Fraud and abuse: Stock issues are highly regulated, but the Internet is
an unregulated environment. The enforcement of registration issues on
the Internet is keeping the SEC more than busy. The result may be fraud-
ulent solicitations on the Internet.
Buying DPOs
DPO issues often open in a blaze of glory due to strong public interest. Then
the share prices settle down to a consistent trading range. During the stock’s
initial period of volatility, the stock price may double or triple. Cashing in at
this point can be very profitable and may compensate you for earlier invest-
ment mistakes.
DPOs are speculative and definitely for aggressive investors. In other words,
if you can’t afford to lose all your investment, you shouldn’t be in this market.
That said, even the most aggressive investors should invest only between 5
and 10 percent of their total portfolio in this type of financial asset.
To purchase shares, obtain a subscription agreement for the DPO. The sub-
scription agreements are usually included in the last page of the prospectus.
If you can’t find the form, request one by e-mail or through the U.S. mail. Send
the completed agreement and a check for the appropriate amount to the
company. The company sends a confirmation letter within five days and the
stock certificate within 30 days. (I suggest making a duplicate copy of your
check and subscription agreement for your records and sending the originals
by registered mail.)
The following list offers some additional sources of DPO information:

managers; for individuals who are considering starting businesses, SCOR
Report asks the questions they should answer before quitting their day

jobs. Investors can use this information to determine whether a DPO has
covered all the bases and is a viable investment candidate.
 Direct Public Offering (www.gopublictoday.com/financing/
financing-types-dpo.php) is a Web site sponsored by registered
investment advisors. You can find a short but informative tutorial 
about DPOs here.
 Mellon Investor Services (www.chasemellon.com) offers InvestDirect
Search, an easy-to-use search engine that allows you to search through a
list of several thousand plans. With InvestDirect, you can search for and
compare DPOs or DRIPs (direct reinvestment plans) and link to com-
pany Web sites. You can review plan brochures, prospectuses, and link
to research Web sites. The best part of InvestDirect is that you can use
InvestDirect Wizard and immediately enroll in a plan. The minimum ini-
tial price per plan varies. At the home page, click For Investors and then

Small, unproven firms carry very high risks. You should do lots of homework
before you invest in companies that big banks avoid.
Buying Stock in a Direct 
Purchase Plan (DPP)
In the past, utilities were the main companies with direct purchase plans
(DPPs). In 1996, 150 companies sold their stock directly to the public. In 1997,
more than 300 companies offered DPPs. At this time, more than 3,500 compa-
nies sell their stock directly to the public.
About one million individuals purchase stocks directly. Minimum invest-
ments can be as small as $50 a month. Some of the DPPs include dividend
reinvestment plans (DRIPs), tax-deferred IRA investments, and loans against
stock holdings. A few companies even sell shares below market price.
DPPs are different from DPOs because the stock being offered is from estab-
lished publicly traded companies with long track records of performance.
Where most people get confused is in defining the difference between DPPs
and dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs). DRIPs allow existing shareholders
to purchase additional shares without a broker. Direct Stock Purchase Plans
(DPPs) differ from DRIPs because you don’t already have to be a shareholder
to purchase shares.
292
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

Sometimes, direct purchase plans (DPPs) are called no-load stock plans.
These plans allow you to join direct purchase plans (which include dividend
reinvestment features) without first purchasing shares through a broker.
Some corporations with DPPs sell shares only to corporate customers, and
others are open to all investors. The Internet provides many sources for DPP
information and education:
 American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (www.investpower.com)
allows you to search over 3,500 DPP plans by entering the ticker symbol
or company name. You can search an alphabetical listing of direct pur-
chase plans and employee stock purchase plans, check out plans ranked
by investment amount, and research a company’s financial and market
performance. You can purchase fractional shares to determine the dollar
amount you want to invest. To purchase shares, you determine the
dollar amount of funds you want deducted from your checking account
as a lump sum or automatic monthly deduction. The site offers online
retrieval of your account information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Fees
for purchasing DPPs through American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
start at $2.60.
 MyStockFund (www.mystockfund.com) integrates dollar-cost averaging
(see the sidebar “The benefits of dollar-cost averaging,” later in this
chapter, for more information) and dividend reinvestment programs
(DRIPs) into an easy-to-use online plan that encourages individual
investors to build wealth over time. Three cost-effective plans are avail-
able. The basic plan is $5.98 per month and includes two purchases. The
Flex plan is $59.99 per year and offers unlimited purchases for $1.99 per
purchase. The Diversified plan is $39.99 per year and offers unlimited
purchased for 99 cents each.
 NetstockDirect (www.netstockdirect.com), shown in Figure 15-1, allows
investors to purchase common stock without a broker. You can research
nearly 1,400 companies, buy fractions of stocks by investing a specified
dollar amount, invest as often you want, and enroll online. Search stock
plans by company name or symbol. Find stock plans for Forbes 500 and
Fortune 500 companies, stocks that are available for an initial investment
of $100 or less, and plans with no purchase fees. Invest directly in mutual
funds as a single investment amount, or set up an automatic monthly
investment plan. Learn about different mutual funds by reading the online
prospectus, linking to market information, or ordering materials for U.S.
mail delivery. Each plan has its own requirements, such as a minimum
purchase amount or initial minimum deposit, in addition to possible
enrollment fees, automatic investment fees, optional cash purchase 
fees, commissions on sales, and so on.
293
Chapter 15: Looking for the Next Big Thing: IPOs, DPOs, and DRIPs

Ford, IBM, British Telecommunications, and many other companies have
direct purchase plans (DPPs). All you have to do is contact the firm via the
Internet, telephone, or U.S. mail. Direct your request to the Investor Relations
Department and ask whether the company has a direct purchase plan and, if
so, ask for an application. Complete the application form and include a check
for your initial investment. Make a copy of these items for your records. Send
the signed application and check to the company by registered mail.
In more than half of the DPPs, the minimum investment is $250 or less and 
as little as $10 thereafter. The plans are designed for long-term investors 
who plan to hold their shares for at least three to five years. Processing your
order is slower than going through a broker; it usually takes about a week.
You can make subsequent stock purchases with cash payments and rein-
vested dividends.
Purchasing DPPs is proof that there’s no such thing as a free lunch; these so-
called no-load stocks aren’t cost-free. You still have to pay a few fees. You
often pay a one-time enrollment fee of $5 to $15, a per-transaction fee of up to
$10 plus $0.01 to $0.10 per share, and higher fees when you sell. Some plans
294
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 
The benefits of dollar-cost averaging 
Like many mutual funds, DDPs and DRIPs offer
automatic investment plans (AIPs) that allow
you to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.
Dollar-cost averaging is a method of putting
equal dollar amounts into an investment at reg-
ular intervals, regardless of that investment’s
performance. Dollar-cost averaging buys more
shares when prices are low and less shares
when prices are high. The result is that you pur-
chase more shares at low prices than shares at
high prices. In other words, dollar-cost averag-
ing guarantees that you follow the investor’s
maxim of “buy low and sell high.” 
Let’s say, for example, that you regularly invest
$100 a month in your DPP plan. In January, the
price is $10 per share, including any miscella-
neous fees, so you buy 10 shares. By February,
the price has increased to $12 a share, so your
$100 buys 8.33 shares. In March, the price rises
to 15 per share, and your $100 buys 6.67 shares.
You now own 25 shares, and your $300 invest-
ment is now worth $375.
Of course, if you had invested all your $300 in
January when the shares were at their lowest,
your investment would be worth $450 when
shares hit their highest price of $15 in March.
What would have happen if the market declined?
Let’s say that you purchased 20 shares at $15 in
January for a total of $300. If prices slide to $10 in
March, your investment would be worth $200, a
loss of $100. What if the share prices were
reversed, and you used dollar-cost averaging?
Your investment would be worth $250 in March.
This $50 loss is much less than the $100 loss you
would have experienced if you invested your
$300 in January. 
To sum it up, dollar-cost averaging doesn’t guar-
antee that you’ll make more money, and it’s not
a guarantee that you won’t lose money, but it
does ensure that you don’t buy only at the top or
only at the bottom of the market.

charge an annual account management fee. To reinvest your dividend, you
may have to pay up to $5 per quarter.
When comparing the fees of some DPPs with the low rates that online bro-
kers charge (between $10 and $30 per transaction), you don’t appear to be
saving much by buying shares directly from the company. However, the SEC
is continuing to relax its regulations about DPPs. Soon, companies will be
able to advertise their programs at their Web sites. As the market for DPPs
heats up, fees are likely to decrease, and you may be able to charge your DPP
purchase to your credit card via the Internet.
A great place to start is with ShareBuilder (www.sharebuilder.com), shown
in Figure 15-2. ShareBuilder specializes in dollar-based automatic investment
accounts for small investors who want to avoid high brokerage fees. For
example, popular investments such as Microsoft and Cisco don’t have direct
stock purchase plans, so ShareBuilder creates its own direct stock plans for
these companies and similar companies. For automatic purchases, costs are
$4 per recurring transaction, or you can pay $12 per month and purchase as
many stocks as you like for a diversified portfolio. Additionally, ShareBuilder
offers real-time trades for $15.95 per transaction.

Profiting with Dividend Reinvestment
Plans (DRIPs)
Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) are sometimes called shareholder invest-
ment programs (SIPs). These plans are an easy, low-cost way to purchase
stocks and reinvest your dividend income. About 1,000 companies and
closed-end mutual funds sponsor DRIPs.
Most plans require you to purchase your first share through a broker, the
National Association of Investors Corporation (NAIC) buying club, or some
other method. A share purchased in a DRIP is like any other stock share. You
have voting rights and stock splits, and your uninvested dividends are taxed
when you sell your shares.
Shares must be registered in your name. You can purchase subsequent
shares directly from the company, often at discounted prices and with no
broker commissions. Most plans allow investors to make voluntary payments

to the DRIP to purchase more shares. In other words, the advantages of
DRIPs include the following:
 No brokerage commissions and few fees for purchasing stock through
the DRIP.
 Frequent discounts of 3 to 5 percent off the current stock price.
 Optional cash payment plans (OCPs). Usually after the first dividend has
been reinvested, the investor can send voluntary cash payments directly
to the company to purchase more shares. Amounts can be as small as
$10 to $25. (This option enables investors to own fractions of stocks.)
For example, General Electric allows OCPs of $10 to $10,000 every
month.
Many of the nation’s premier corporations have DRIPs, including most of the
companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The InvestorGuide page on
DRIPs and DPPs (www.investorguide.com/dripslist.html) has a public
directory with links to the corporate home pages of many companies that
have dividend reinvestment plans. For more information, contact each com-
pany you’re interested in and ask for a DRIP prospectus. At the corporate
home page, you can e-mail your request. If the company doesn’t have a Web
site, use the IRIN Annual Report Resource Center (www.irin.com) to locate
the corporation’s address and telephone number.
Additional features of DRIPs
One of the benefits of DRIPs is their (often free) certificate safekeeping serv-
ice. This service eliminates the need to pay for a safe-deposit box and the
possibility of your stock certificates becoming lost or stolen.
DRIPs often have gift-giving programs. For example, Texaco lets you open an
investor services plan in another person’s name, and the company provides
you with a gift certificate to give to the recipient.
Not all DRIPs are alike
Each company has its own plan. With some firms, you can pay for additional
shares with cash; some allow partial redemption of shares, and some have
termination fees. However, the plan may purchase shares only once a month,
and if you want to sell your shares, completing the transaction may take five
to ten days.
297
Chapter 15: Looking for the Next Big Thing: IPOs, DPOs, and DRIPs

Some plans allow you to buy shares one at a time. However, some companies
have a minimum purchase amount. For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb
requires a minimum purchase of 50 shares. Bristol-Myers Squibb also charges
a fee of 4 percent of the dollar amount of dividends being reinvested (a maxi-
mum of $5 per share). In general, plans differ from one another in the follow-
ing ways:
 Some companies allow (and some companies don’t) the reinvestment of
preferred dividends for common shares.
 Some companies allow partial reinvestment of dividends.
 The amount of optional cash payments (OCPs) varies from company to
company.
 Fees for participating in the DRIP vary from company to company.
How to get your first DRIP share
Sometimes, getting started is the hardest part of investing. You have many
ways of getting your first share for a DRIP. Here are some different
approaches — one of these methods may be right for you:
 Join a special investment club. First Share Buying Club can assist you
in getting your first share so that you can participate in a DRIP. Annual
membership in First Share is $30 per year. Referral requests for current
Portfolio Builder Companies (www.firstshare.com/Portfolio_
Builder_Companies.htm) are $5 per request; referral requests for all
other companies in the First Share program are $10 per request. Selling
members are usually charged a handling fee to cover their expenses (a
typical fee is $7.50) in addition to the price of the share.
For individuals who don’t want to join the club, you can buy one share
in one company for a flat fee of $20. If you want to purchase more than
one share, becoming a member is more cost-effective. You can request
any number of shares in any number of companies. For more informa-
tion, call 800-683-0743.
 Share the cost with a friend. You can use a buddy system to reduce the
cost of purchasing your first share. You and a friend pay the brokerage
to purchase two shares. Have both shares registered to one person and
join the company’s DRIP. After you’ve joined, transfer one share to your
friend and split the cost of the fees.
 Join the NAIC. The National Association of Investors Corporation
(NAIC) enrolls people in any of more than 100 DRIPs via its Low Cost
Investment Plan. The NAIC enrolls its members in a company for a $7
per company fee. Membership in the NAIC is $50 for individuals. See the
NAIC Web site at www.better-investing.org or telephone
801-583-6242 for details.
298
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

 Use a deep-discount online broker: Sometimes, the simplest way to pur-
chase your first share is to go through a deep-discount broker. Online
brokerage costs vary from $7 to $40. To participate in the DRIP, the stock
must be registered in your name.
Selecting the right DRIP
DRIPs have many advantages, but you shouldn’t let one characteristic be
your sole criterion for purchasing a stock. Regardless of how attractive the
DRIP is, you still need to make certain that the stock fits in with your overall
investment strategy. In other words, don’t select a stock just because it has a
DRIP. Check out these sites for more information about dividend reinvest-
ment plans:
 DRIP Central (www.dripcentral.com) offers DRIP information for
beginning investors. The Web site provides links to useful online arti-
cles, newsletters, directories, and other DRIP Web sites.
 DRIP Investor (www.dripinvestor.com) offers suggested books, an
investor glossary, and DRIP information. Subscriptions for the monthly
Internet newsletter are $42 for six months and $69 for one year with a
free one-month trial period.
 NAIC Low Cost Plan Overview (www.better-investing.org/about/
lowcost/faq.html) offers a terrific plan to get your first share without
going through a broker. For a one-time setup charge of $7 plus the price
of one share of stock in any of the participating companies listed, you
can get started with a new holding in your personal portfolio. However,
transactions take between 8 to 12 weeks for investing in monthly compa-
nies. Companies investing quarterly require even more time.

n this chapter, I explain how purchasing stock options can assist online
investors to make money in a bear or bull market. Here, you find the
basics of online investing in stock options, as well as discover which Internet
sites provide guidance, news, quotes, online tools, and software to help you
leverage your investment dollar. You can uncover which exchanges list stock
options and also gain an understanding of the online brokerages that special-
ize in these types of transactions as well as the commissions that they
charged.
Trading Stock Options
Suppose that a well-known novelist decides to let Hollywood make a movie
based on one of her books. The novelist receives a payment from a Hollywood
producer for the option of deciding within a specified time to make the movie.
If the Hollywood producer decides to go ahead and make the movie, the novel-
ist sells him the screen rights. If the Hollywood producer changes his mind,
the novelist keeps the option payment and her novel.

Trading stock options is a similar transaction. Options are contracts between
a buyer and a seller. These contracts represent the right of the investor to
buy or sell shares of the stock that the shares represent, called the underlying
stock. Contracts are usually for 100 shares and don’t oblige the investor to
purchase or sell shares of the underlying stock.
Types of option contracts
An option is a contract between a buyer and a seller. An option contract that
gives the owner (holder) the right, if exercised, to buy or sell a security or
index at a specific price, called the strike price, within a specific time period.
Option contracts are generally available for one to nine months, although
some longer-term options are available on selected securities. Each contract
usually equals 100 shares of stock. Calls and puts are two types of options,
and I explain them in the following sections.
Why buy stock options? Stock options enable investors to position them-
selves for a big market move even when they don’t know which way stock
prices will move. For example, the cost of the premium (the amount paid for
the option contract) is often less than what the investors would lose if they
purchased shares that later suffered a steep price decrease.
Stock options enable large and small investors to leverage (the wherewithal
to control large amounts of a financial asset with a somewhat small amount
of capital.) their investment dollars. For example, a stock might increase by
only 25 percent, but the investor receives a 100-percent return on his or her
cash investment in the stock option contract. However, if the stock experi-
ences a decrease or remains at the same price, the investor suffers a 100-
percent loss of the premium paid for the stock option contract.
Short rallies exist even in a down market. With options, investors can exer-
cise an option during one of these peaks to gain short-term profits. If the rally
doesn’t materialize, the only loss the investor suffers is the cost of the pre-
mium paid for the options contract.
Some large corporations, such as insurance companies, want to reduce their
exposure to the market. They sell their options to offset losses incurred by
their current stock holdings. Individual investors can limit the exposure of
their personal portfolios (especially in a volatile market) in the same way.
Exercising your stock option
All stock options have exercising dates that are stated upon the option’s
introduction to the market. During this time, the same stock option can be
302
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

bought and sold many times. To exercise the stock option, you can do one of
three things:
 Buy or sell the underlying shares of stock (exercise the option). Shares
purchased can be held for long-term gains. Shares sold realize an imme-
diate capital gain.
 Sell the option on the open market. Profits from the sale of your option
are automatically credited to your trading account and are taxable.
 Let the option expire. If the option expires, it loses all value.
Call options
A call is defined as the right to buy a specific number of shares at a specified
price by a fixed date. If the stock is above the agreed-upon price by the fixed
date, the investor wins — he bought the stock for less than what it’s worth
that day on the market. For example, you believe that IBM is underpriced.
You purchase a 3-month call at $100 when the stock is selling at $90. The call
options selling price is $3 per share, which is the premium. You purchase ten
contracts (of 100 shares). You now control 1,000 shares. The total amount of
the premium is $3,000 — that is
$3 (the option selling price) × 10 (contracts) × 100 (shares) = $3,000
One month later, IBM’s shares are selling for $110. You can now either
 Exercise your option by purchasing 1,000 shares at $100 and then sell
the shares at $110 for a profit of $10,000 less commission (the premium).
Before taxes, you would net $7,000.
 Sell your call option, which is worth approximately $10,000.
Using call options has two advantages. First, you need less cash to control a
large number of shares. As you can see in the preceding example, the pur-
chase of the option was $3,000, and the cost of purchase of the shares is
$90,000. Second, if the IBM stock price severely drops, an investor who owns
the shares loses more than an investor who owns only the option.
Put options
A put option contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell
100 shares of common stock at the strike price on or before the date of expi-
ration. For example, thinking that IBM is way overpriced, you buy 10 IBM
303
Chapter 16: Taking the Option: Alternative Investing

February puts at $2 per contract. That is, you buy 10 contracts, and each
contract represents 100 shares of stock, so you control 1,000 shares. Here is
the game plan:
 IBM is the stock.
 February is the month when your option expires.
Options always expire the third Friday of the month.
 $100 is the strike price.
 $2 is the price you paid per contract.
Well, actually, $2 is the price per share that you control — so buying 10
of these puts (1,000 shares total) costs you $2,000 plus commission.
As the owner of this put, you have the right (but not the obligation) to sell 
up to 1,000 shares of IBM at a price of $100 per share anytime between the
February day when you buy and the third Friday of February. Most people
wouldn’t do this because it’s complicated. Selling the contracts that you’ve
bought is easier (just as you would sell stock) and often just as profitable.
Suppose that you pegged IBM correctly, and its price drops sharply. Say the
value of your put increases from $2 to $10. You sell at $10 and make a huge
profit.
In the event that you’re wrong and IBM keeps going up, your option expires
worthless. All you lose, however, is the $2,000 that you initially invested (and
any brokerage fees). The appeal of options is that you have unlimited upside
potential. You can make five or ten times your initial investment, but you can
never lose more than what you initially invested.

 SchaeffersResearch.com (www.schaeffersresearch.com/
streetools/market_tools/hedge_calculator.aspx) provides 
a Portfolio Protection Analyzer. This hedging calculator estimates 
the value of your portfolio if it declines 5, 10, 15, or 20 percent. Then 
it suggests the amount of puts that you should purchase to protect 
your portfolio.
Determining Stock Option Values
The value of the stock option is derived from an actual stock or equity. 
The price movement of the underlying stock makes the value of the option
increase or decrease. This price movement is the intrinsic value, or fair value,
of the stock. (See Chapter 8 for more information on determining the fair
value of stocks.)
In addition to their intrinsic values, options also have time values, which
reflect what the holder is willing to pay for an option in anticipation of a
stock price increase before the expiration date. Most options are for nine
months, and the option can be bought or sold many times during this time
period. As an option gets closer to the expiration date, the value of the
option can decrease, increase, or remain unchanged, depending upon the
current value of the underlying stock. Just before the expiration date, the
time value becomes zero.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE; www.cboe.com) provides many
materials for novices to check out, including an excellent introduction to
options, profitable trading strategies, answers to frequently asked questions,
a glossary of option terms, and a schedule of educational events and semi-
nars for beginning investors. To access these materials, go to the CBOE home
page and click Learning Center. 
Investors often use stock options to hedge their bets or to gamble on the
future. Investors need to know four things to make a good investment decision:
 Name of the underlying stock: The name of the underlying stock or
equity. The name could be a company that your analysis shows might
soon rapidly increase — a company stock that you want to purchase but
can’t afford. You might want to select stock options for a company in
which you already own stock to protect your portfolio from a market-
driven decline in price.
 Strike or exercise price: The stated price per share for which the under-
lying security can be purchased (in the case of a call) or sold (in the
case of a put) when you exercise the option contract. Option contracts
are usually for 100 shares. The higher the exercise price, the lower the
value of the call option. (See the section “Types of option contracts” for
more on calls and puts.)
308
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

 Expiration date: Option contracts are for three, six, or nine months (or
remaining fractions thereof) on three calendar cycles. Cycle 1 is January/
April/July/October; Cycle 2 is February/May/August/November; and
Cycle 3 is March/June/September/December. As the option approaches
the expiration date, the value of the option decreases. Options usually
expire at midnight EST on the third Friday of the expiration month.
 The premium paid for the option, plus the broker’s commission: The
price of the option contract is the premium. All things being equal, the
longer the time period of the option, the higher the premium. The com-
mission is the amount that you, as the investor, pay the brokerage for
executing the transaction of purchasing the option contract.
optionsXpress (www.optionsxpress.com/paper_trading.asp) offers vir-
tual trading, which is a practical method of gaining experience with options
trading without risking any of your precious capital. All your trades are
tracked on paper only. Virtual trading is useful because you make decisions
and experience the results of those decisions in real time. Virtual trading is
available to individuals who open an optionsXpress trading account. No mini-
mum amount is required to open a cash account; there is a $2,000 minimum
to maintain a margin account.
Taking a closer look at options
Using the business school approved intrinsic value method, a stock option’s
value is equal to the difference between the option strike price and the fair
market value of the stock. For example, suppose that you’re granted an option
to purchase 100 shares of the company’s stock for $10 each. The stock sells
for $54. The intrinsic value of the option is $44 because $54 – $10 = $44. The
intrinsic value is a positive number, so the option is in-the-money. However,
this formula doesn’t consider brokerage fees or interest fees on a margin loan
from your broker, which can reduce the actual gain you realize.
Keep in mind that the intrinsic value method also doesn’t consider that option
holders have the right to use their options at some time in the future, which
can result in a greater profit or loss if the trading price of the underlying stock
falls.
myStockOptions.com (www.mystockoptions.com), with your free registra-
tion, provides step-by-step instructions that help you to determine exactly
how much money you’ll take home (after taxes) if you exercise your stock
option today. Use the Quick Take Calculator by entering the number of shares
in your stock option grant, the exercise price, and the company’s current
stock price and then click Calculate. What makes this calculator unique is that

it applies taxes to your transaction. You can even use the myStockOptions
modeling tool to perform a what-if analysis. For example, enter a percentage
increase or decrease under the What If Company Stock Price to determine an
ideal selling price.
Discovering what your options are worth
The first step in understanding what your options are worth is to be able to
understand an option premium table. Premiums (prices) for options that are
traded on stock exchanges are published daily in newspapers and online.

Use this guide to help you understand some of the key elements in Table 16-1:
1. Identification of stock: This is the ticker symbol for the underlying
stock.
2. Stock closing price: This is the closing value of the stock on the New
York Stock Exchange.
310
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

3. Option strike price: The strike price is the stated price per share that
the underlying stock can be purchased for (called) or sold (for a put) if
the option contract is exercised. Option strike prices usually move by
increments of $2.50 or $5. In this example, the strike price moves in $5
increments.
4. Option closing prices: This is the closing value of the option contract.
5. Option expiration months: This shows the termination date of an
option contract. Remember that U.S. listed option contracts expire on
the third Friday of the expiration month.
In Table 16-1, XYZ July $115 calls closed at 31⁄2 ($350) per contract. XYZ stock
closed at $112bf3/8. Therefore these options were out-of-the-money because
the closing price didn’t reach the $115 or greater.
Puts are the opposite of calls. Table 16-1 shows how a put must be greater
than $1123⁄8 to be in-the-money. The July $120 puts closed at 83⁄4 ($875) per con-
tract. Therefore, in this example, these puts are in-the-money because $120 is
greater than the closing price of $1123⁄8.
Online brokerages and options
Not all electronic brokerages trade stock options. The sales commissions for
option transactions vary from broker to broker. Some online brokerages
charge a flat rate plus $1.50 to $2.50 per contract. Others just charge a flat
fee. See Table 16-2 for a few examples of online brokerage commissions for
options transactions.

Online brokerages that specialize in options trading frequently offer investors
unique tools for research and analyses. For example, optionsXpress is an
online brokerage that doesn’t require a minimum initial deposit for opening a
trading account. The commission fees are $1.50 per contract. The minimum
number of contracts you can trade at one time is ten — or if you trade less
than ten contracts, you’ll pay $14.95.
The CBOE offers a listing of options brokerages at www.cboe.com/resources/
brokercontacts.aspx. The brokerages aren’t endorsed by the CBOE and
will require your investigation. Many of the listed option brokerages don’t
have Web sites, so you’ll have to contact some brokerages by phone.
Optionetics (www.optionetics.com/broker/review.asp) provides useful
reviews of top options brokers. You can compare brokers by site design, user
friendliness, options usefulness, option trading cost, and so on. You can also
find useful information about what you need to know about your broker, such
as questions you should ask your broker.
Software Tools for Options Trading
Option analysis software tools measure the probability of profit and identify
profit goals and stop-loss points while often providing prebuilt strategies or
allowing simulations of investor strategies. As an investor, you’ll find all this
information valuable. Each year, software developers spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars developing these software tools and often sell the prod-
uct for a few dollars.

Checking Out the Latest Strategies 
More experienced options investors are likely to be interested in the latest
strategies for different types of markets. Often discovering a new strategy 
can help you increase the amount of your profits (or decrease the amount 
of your losses).
 Chicago Board of Trade (www.cbot.com) offers many regularly sched-
uled Webinars, tutorials, and trading strategies that can assist you in
becoming an educated options investor. Note: Don’t forget to check out
the strategies archive.
 optionsXpress (www.optionsxpress.com) offers Strategy Scan, which is 
a valuable tool that allows you to develop an investment approach based
on your option of the market. Through a series of drop-down menus, you
enter your bullish or bearish opinion of a stock, your investment time
frame, your experience, and investment (risk) amount. After you enter
Strategy Scan, it shows you up to three opportunities with potential profit
and loss amounts for each action, and a ready-made link to preview each
trade. To get started, you need a trading account, but opening an account
online takes only about ten minutes, and no minimum initial amounts are
required to open an account.
 Options Industry Council (www.888options.com/learning/

Your Portfolio

 Keeping up with online news
 Using proven strategies for improving your investment performance
P
ortfolio management is not busywork: Knowing how much you own in
cash, stocks, bonds, and other investments is important. Without port-
folio management, how can you determine whether your returns are meeting
your financial requirements? Are you missing opportunities by not buying or
selling securities at the right time?
In this chapter, I cover three Internet-based approaches to managing your
portfolio:
 Purchase prebuilt portfolios. This strategy allows you to diversify your
portfolio and avoid high brokerage and administration fees.
 Use free and fee-based Web portfolio tracking tools. You can customize
these tools, which often provide e-mail alerts on price changes and end-
of-the-day quotes. Over the last two years, these tools have become more
sophisticated, and they can now even track all your credit cards, bank
accounts, and investments at one Web site.
 Take advantage of PC-based tools that are free, offer free trials, or
cost only a few dollars. These programs use your Internet connection to
automatically update portfolio quotes. (If you already have MS Money or
Quicken, you can use the portfolio feature and update price quotes in
just a few clicks, as I explain in this chapter.)
Also in this chapter, I describe the difficulties of measuring portfolio perfor-
mance and risk.

Why Manage Your Investments?
The gyrations of the market over the last five years have dampened many
investors’ hopes of easy riches. According to The New York Times, investing
isn’t the popular hobby it once was; personal finance magazine subscrip-
tions are down; and the number of investment clubs has declined from a 
peak of 37,000 clubs in 1998 to 21,000 as of June 2004. In a recent survey of
1,100 people who own stocks and mutual funds, the National Association 
of Investors Corporation (www.better-investing.org) discovered that
investors believe that stocks are worth buying but are uneasy over the
volatility of stock ownership. This apprehension is not unfounded. Stocks
slumped for most of 2004, falling by as much as 4 percent. However, by the
end of October 2004, stocks rebounded, and the S & P 500 completed the year
with an increase of 8.99 percent.
Monitoring your portfolio in a volatile market is very important. You can
select the best investments, but if you don’t have a way to track your gains
and losses, you can lose time and money. Good record keeping is invaluable
for calculating your taxes, preparing for retirement, estate planning, and
taking advantage of opportunities to increase your personal wealth.
Sources on the Internet can assist you in keeping careful records of every
stock, mutual fund, bond, and money market security that you own. Setup
time can be as little as ten minutes. You can update and monitor your portfo-
lio once a week or once a month. Your investments can be in one portfolio
(for example, your retirement fund) or many (say, your retirement fund, an
emergency fund, and your children’s college fund). You can also track invest-
ments that you wish you owned or that you’re considering for investment.
The Internet offers programs that automatically update your portfolio with
daily price changes and then re-tally your portfolio’s value to reflect those
changes. Many portfolio management programs can
 Help you determine how much you own in cash, stocks, and bonds
 Show you how these investments line up with your asset allocation 
targets
 Indicate what returns (capital gains or losses) you’re receiving
 Compare returns with your financial requirements
 Alert you that securities are at the prices at which you want to buy (or
sell)
316
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

Tracking the Right Information
If you own more than one investment, you probably want to compare the per-
formances of your investments. The more investments you have, the harder
this task is. Many novice investors find it difficult to determine whether
they’re making money, losing money, or just breaking even. To determine
how your investments are performing, you need to look at the following data:
 52-week high and low: The highest and lowest selling prices in the pre-
vious 365 days
 Dividend: The annual per-share amount of cash payments made to
stockholders of the corporations
 Dividend yield percent: The total amount of the dividend paid in the
last 12 months divided by the closing price (the price at which the last
trade of the day was made)
 Growth rate: How much the dividend increases from one fiscal year to
the next
 P/E ratio: The price/earnings ratio of the closing price to the last 12
months’ earnings per share
 Volume: The number of shares traded in one day
 High, low, close: Highest selling price of the day, lowest selling price of
the day, and closing selling price
 Net change: The difference between the day’s closing price and the pre-
vious day’s closing price
You can compare these amounts and ratios with the performance of your
other investments, the firm’s previous performance, the industry, and the
market indexes (for example, the S & P 500).
If you own several securities, how do you keep track of all this data? Once
again, the Internet provides an answer. The Internet has hundreds of Web-
and PC-based portfolio management programs that are just waiting to assist
you. Some of them are free, others are fee-based, and some are automatically
set up for you by your online broker.
Mobile portfolio management is a reality at CBS MarketWatch (cbs.market
watch.com/mobile/default.asp?siteID=mktw) for registered users. You
can receive price and volume alerts, or news alerts for your Portfolio on your
mobile phone, Palm VII, or Pocket PC. At the CBS MarketWatch Web site, you
can customize alerts by indicating exactly what you want and when you want
it delivered.

Chapter 17: The Internet and Managing Your Portfolio

Balancing Your Portfolio with Web-
Based Asset Allocation Tools 
When building your portfolio, remember that diversification is the key to
ensuring that the volatility of the market doesn’t affect your returns. In other
words, you want to make certain that your portfolio is not overwhelmed 
if the price of one asset plummets. When seeking to diversify your portfolio, 
I suggest that you try one or several of the following approaches:
 Invest in different asset types. Asset types include mutual funds,
stocks, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and other types of financial
instruments.
 Invest in diverse sectors and industries. Investing in different stock sec-
tors and industries can protect your portfolio from economic changes,
unanticipated technological innovations that can make your investment
obsolete, and unfavorable regulatory changes.
 Invest in numerous geographic locations. If the value of the U.S. dollar
weakens, international investment can be a new source of profitability.
Companies located on one geographic area can be devastated because
of natural disasters.
 Invest in assorted company sizes. It’s often difficult to diversify by
investing only in large companies. Investing in medium-size companies
can provide consistent returns. Small companies can rapidly expand,
but then just as quickly go bankrupt. 
Many Web sites can assist you in determining how you should allocate your
assets. Some of these Web sites include questionnaires that can help you
determine how much risk you can take — and still sleep at night.
Fidelity (www.fidelity.com) offers an online worksheet to assist you in
diversifying your annuity assets. The Annuity Asset Allocation Worksheet is
geared to help you determine what the optimum asset allocation is for you
based on your tolerance for risk. The worksheet takes about ten minutes to
complete. At the home page, click the Retirement & Guidance tab and then
click the Guidance Tools link. Click the Go To Fidelity Portfolio Analysis link
and then click Additional Resources. Click the Calculators, Planners, and
Worksheets link; then scroll down to the Annuity Asset Allocation Worksheet.
Other portfolio tools, such as Portfolio Review, are available only for Fidelity
clients.
NETirement.com (www.netirement.com/calcs/pnaapie.htm#TableTop)
offers an online calculator that indicates the asset allocation you should use
based on the level of risk that you can tolerate. The calculator starts a portfo-
lio that has the highest minimum return over 30 years with a 5 percent com-
fort level. (Ninety-five percent of the time, its average returns will be higher.)
318
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

Click More Risk or Less Risk to see how different asset allocations affect the
amount of your returns. This online calculator is useful for assessing how
much risk you’ll have to take to receive a predetermined amount of return.
Using the Internet to Uncover 
the Risk in Your Portfolio
Over time and without your intervention, the characteristics of your portfolio
will change. Ignoring these changes can be dangerous to your financial
health. There are no set guidelines for how often you should review, analyze,
and rebalance your portfolio. Some individuals check the risk of their portfo-
lio on a weekly or even a daily basis. I suggest that the more volatile the
market, the more often you should analyze your portfolio’s risk exposure.
As part of your portfolio management, you’ll need to watch for unexpected
changes that can affect your portfolio’s long-term objectives and plan for
short-term volatility. If your portfolio is not performing to your expectations,
don’t panic or ignore the problem. Find out what’s driving your portfolio’s
performance. It may be that you’re taking on more risk than you originally
anticipated.
Online portfolio risk analysis measures the risk exposure of your assets to
market risk. For individual investors, this analysis is often the first time they
can determine whether their investment return is equal or better than their
risk exposure. In the past, only financial institution had access to this type of
analysis. The following are a few examples of the online financial institutional
strength tools that can make certain that you don’t take on more risk than is
necessary.
RiskGrades
RiskGrades (www.riskgrades.com) offers free tools to determine your risk
tolerance and to measure the risk of your assets. Assets are assigned a risk
score from 0 for cash to 10,000 for highly risky stocks. The My Portfolio
screen allows you to view the risk statistics of your portfolio. You can view
your results as a table or graph. You can also print your results. RiskGrades
provides definitions at the bottom of the page so that you don’t get confused.
Click the statistic or story icon within each asset class.
RiskGrades allows you to analyze your investment style against benchmark
indices, perform a risk ranking of your portfolio, and create a risk versus
return chart to determine whether you’re being fairly compensated for the
amount of risk you’re taking.
319
Chapter 17: The Internet and Managing Your Portfolio

RiskGrades offers What If analyses so that you can try out different strategies
to your portfolio. For example, if you buy or sell assets, what are the tax con-
sequences? RiskGrades offers risk event analyses, price acceptability testing,
a helpful risk map of the market, and an asset selector function. You can also
find online tutorials about understanding risk and a risk profile quiz.
FinPortfolio
FinPortfolio (www.finportfolio.com) is the Cadillac of online portfolio
analysis tools. You find information about how to plan a portfolio that
matches your investment goal and discover how to use online portfolio analy-
ses to optimize your portfolio’s returns and minimize risk. Two levels of serv-
ice are available for individual investors. Basic service is a set of easy-to-use
planning and analysis modules that provide interactive guidance and support
through the financial planning and investment decision-making process. You
can track up to 50 stocks or funds in one portfolio and perform analysis on up
to 5 stocks or funds at no charge. You can import portfolio data from other
financial Web sites and screen investment candidates, research assets based
on risk and return, and perform risk analysis. The premium service extends
the basic service by offering additional online portfolio management related
services, including the ability to track up to 100 stocks or funds in up to 5
portfolios, perform analyses of 30 stocks or funds across multiple portfolios,
and create up to 5 multiple-goal financial plans. Premium subscriptions are
$100 per quarter or $300 per year.
Morningstar
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) has one of the better online portfolio
management programs for mutual funds. First, set up the free portfolio at the
Web site. 
If you want Premium Portfolio X-Rays, you have to become a member.
Membership is $12.95 per month (or $115 per year). X-Ray Reports includes
information on fees and expenses for each of your mutual funds, indicates
how all your assets (cash, stocks, bonds, and others) are allocated in your
personal portfolio, and shows the fundamental statistics for each of your
holdings (P/E ratio, price-to-book ratio, and earnings growth). With Premium
Portfolio X-Rays, you can check for your Stock Stats. This feature of the port-
folio management program looks into the equities you own individually and
those held by your mutual funds, and then tallies the total percentage that is
invested in each company. For example, assume that 10 percent of your port-
folio is invested in individual shares of Cisco, and you have two mutual funds
that recently invested in Cisco. The total percentage of Cisco holding in your
portfolio is now 17 percent. That’s stock overlap. Stock overlap can defeat
your attempt at reducing investing risk with diversification. In this situation,
320
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

you might consider replacing the number of shares you own in Cisco with an
equal amount of shares (that meet your investor requirements) in a different
industry.
To determine your portfolio’s asset allocations, Premium Portfolio X-Rays
looks into the holdings of your mutual funds and then analyzes the total of 
all your portfolio’s assets. For example, assume that your entire portfolio is
invested in equities and mutual funds. Using this X-Ray feature, you might
discover that about 4 percent of your portfolio is in bonds held by mutual
fund companies. Overall, Premium Portfolio X-Rays enable you to gain better
control of your personal finances.
Keeping the Winners and Selling the
Losers: Measuring Performance
Measuring portfolio performance is often difficult. For example, suppose that
you invest $2,000 in a mutual fund that returns 15 percent in the first quarter
of the year. In each of the next three quarters, you invest $2,000, but the fund
doesn’t provide any returns during those months. Your return on the first
$2,000 is 15 percent. Your return on $6,000 for following nine months is zero.
The fund reports an annual gain of 15 percent, not counting dividends and
gains distributions. However, these percentages don’t mean that you should
measure performance on a short-term basis. Market prices vary and returns
fluctuate for many reasons. What really counts is the true rate of return,
which can’t be measured from quarter to quarter.
Another problem in measuring portfolio performance is risk. Risk is defined
as the variability of returns. In other words, the more the returns vary, the
greater the risk. One of the disadvantages of using standard deviation (a mea-
surement of the variability of historical returns around the average return) 
is that it considers good variability. Good variability means that returns are
exceeding expectations — an event that increases the stock’s volatility and
standard deviation. The stock is now considered more risky because returns
are higher than expected. What this shows is that standard deviation isn’t
always a good way to judge risk. In other words, standard deviation is just 
a measurement of volatility. Risk enters the picture only if volatility is below
the investor’s return target.
You have many ways to measure the performance of your portfolio. One way
to measure performance is to use benchmarks — that is, compare the perfor-
mance of your various investments with top performances and indices. For
example, you can rank them by
 P/E ratio: Divide your stocks into capitalization groups (small-cap, mid-
cap, and large-cap) and rank each group by P/E ratio. Compare your
321
Chapter 17: The Internet and Managing Your Portfolio

investments with top-performing stocks in each capitalization group
daily and weekly. (For more information about capitalization groups, 
see Chapter 7.)
 Yield: Divide your fixed-income investments (bonds and Treasury secu-
rities) by quality rating and then rank each group by yield. Compare
your investments with the top-performing bonds in each asset allocation
class.
Your Portfolio Management Options
Managing the performance of your investment portfolio is as important as
selecting the right investments. Market conditions can change at a moment’s
notice. Your continuous monitoring of your portfolio can ensure that you
reach your investment objectives by staying on track. You can use a variety
of tools to assist you in analyzing your portfolio and the market environment.
The following is a list of several of the portfolio management options that you
can use to evaluate your portfolio:
 Online purchasing of prepackaged portfolios: Called portfolio invest-
ment programs, these investments allow investors to own basket of secu-
rities that are tailored to meet their individual requirements.
 Web-based portfolio management programs: Investor super-sites,
Internet portals, and large news organizations generally sponsor online
portfolio management programs for free (or free with your subscrip-
tion). These programs usually don’t require any software downloading,
and they constantly update your portfolio. However, these programs
don’t offer many features, such as customized graphs or charts, funda-
mental analysis, or tax-planning tools.
 PC-based portfolio management programs: These programs present
portfolio tracking as a feature of a personal software program, such as
Quicken (www.intuit.com) or MS Money (www.microsoft.com/money).
PC-based portfolio management involves tracking with a software pro-
gram downloaded from the Internet. These programs can be very inex-
pensive or even free. PC-based portfolio tracking programs usually have
more choices and functions than Web-based portfolio management pro-
grams. However, you must download the proprietary software, and you
might have to import (transfer data from one source to another) stock
quotes.
 Portfolio management with your online broker: Portfolio management
with your online broker is automatic. Your online broker knows what you
traded, so the brokerage can automatically update your portfolio. This
choice is a terrific way to track distributions from mutual funds and stock
splits. Overall, the advantages of using your broker’s portfolio manage-
ment system are that you don’t have to manually add transactions, and
your portfolio always reflects the current value of your investments.
322
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

You don’t have to limit your portfolio tracking to just one approach. For
example, you might use an online tool to determine your percentage rate of
return for the current year and use your PC portfolio software to track your
annualized returns. When traveling, you may want to use your online broker-
age’s portfolio services to verify the completion of investment transactions,
dividend reinvestments, or stock splits.
In the following sections, I offer examples that detail the features and func-
tions of various types of portfolio management programs.
Purchasing Portfolio Investment
Programs
Online do-it-yourselfers can now purchase prepackaged portfolios and bas-
kets of securities that are geared for their unique needs. Both beginning and
advanced investors can easily understand the portfolio investment pro-
grams, which tend to be a low-cost way for you to own hundreds of stocks.
The primary difference between prebuilt portfolios and mutual funds is that
with prebuilt portfolios, you know exactly what you own because you’re the
manager.
In other words, there’s no lag time between purchasing the shares and receiv-
ing the information from the fund managers. If you’re an advanced investor
with unique investing needs, prepackaged portfolios can be more desirable
to you than a mutual fund because you can custom tailor the prepackaged
portfolio to meet your particular requirements. For new investors, a prepack-
aged portfolio can be a way to control a number of individual shares and
avoid errors of investing in just a few individual stocks.
Here are two sites that offer prebuilt portfolios:
 FOLIOfn.com (www.foliofn.com) offers more than 120 prebuilt portfo-
lios. Each prebuilt portfolio averages 50 securities; 2,500 stocks are
available. Additionally, trades are free with some limitations. For exam-
ple, trades are executed twice a day at the market price. You can rebal-
ance a prebuilt portfolio at no charge, but individual trades cost $14.95.
If you’re not sure where to start, use the FOLIO Wizard to identify your
investor profile and which Ready-to-Go Folio might be right for you.
FOLIOfn.com hasn’t set a minimum investment requirement.
There are three folio plans. The 1-Folio Plan includes up to 200 commis-
sion-free trades every month, 50 (1 folio of up to 50 securities), one-click
diversification, and automatic rebalancing for $19.95 per month or $199
per year. The 2-Folio Plan includes up to 400 commission-free trades
every month, 100 (2 folios of up to 50 securities each) one-click diversifi-
cation, and automatic rebalancing for $29.95 per month or $299 per year.
323
Chapter 17: The Internet and Managing Your Portfolio

The 3-Folio Plan includes up to 600 commission-free trades every month,
150 (3 folios of up to 50 securities each) one-click diversification, and
automatic rebalancing for $39.95 per month or $399 per year. You pay an
annual $25 IRA fee. You can also take advantage of a free 30-day trial.
FOLIOfn.com has partnered with Reuters (www.reuters.com) to offer
members a way to purchase portfolio derived from the Reuters Select
screens. After you subscribe to FOLIOfn.com, add the Reuters Select
Folio service for an additional $99 per year to get started. You can select
eight Reuters Select Folios, including Consensus Choices, Favorite Value
Plays, and Growth.
 Merrill Lynch HOLDRs (www.holdrs.com) — Holding Company
Depositary Receipts — are baskets of securities that can be broken into
their component stocks. You buy HOLDRS just like a stock. With each
HOLDR, you get ownership in 20 or more stocks, but you pay only a single
commission. And the annual fees on HOLDRS are inexpensive — only
eight cents per HOLDR. Assuming that you bought 100 shares of a HOLDR
with a market price of $100, the annual fee on your $10,000 investment
would be $8 (or 0.08, expressed as a percentage). And it can get even
better: The annual fee is waived to the extent that dividends and cash 
distributions on the underlying stocks are not enough to cover the fee.
To cancel your HOLDRs, just instruct your broker to deliver your
HOLDRs to the HOLDRs trustee and pay a cancellation fee of $10 per
round-lot of 100 HOLDRs. This converts your HOLDRs to individual
stocks. Canceling your HOLDRs isn’t a capital gains event, so you don’t
have to pay taxes.
Overall, HOLDRs allow you to diversify your investments and give you
personal control of your investments. HOLDRs offer you tax benefits, liq-
uidity, and flexibility — and no management fee. However, you do pay a
small annual custody fee that’s taken against dividends and distribu-
tions when HOLDRs are issued.
Using Web-Based Portfolio 
Management Programs
Many Web sites provide online portfolio tracking services. Some of these serv-
ices are free, and others are fee-based. The aim of Web-based portfolio man-
agement tools is to help you make better investment decisions and thus
increase your capital gains. Each Web-based portfolio management program
offers something different. In the following sections, I describe just a few
examples.
Don’t let the fascination of having your portfolio online tempt you into over-
trading (buying or selling) your investments.
324
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

Investor compilation or super-sites provide, among other things, free and fee-
based portfolio tracking. Some investor supersites require your free registra-
tion and are supported by advertisers. Other compilation sites provide
different levels of services, costing up to $8 to $10 per month.
The benefit of tracking your portfolio at one of these sites is access to the
vast repositories of investor information, data, and tools that they offer. If
you want to research or analyze something in connection with your portfolio,
you don’t have to go to several investor sites to get the job done, which can
save you time and money if you need to make a quick investment decision. In
the following sections, I profile several of these investor compilation sites.
B4Utrade.com (b4utrade.com) offers (among other things) a real-time
streaming portfolio tracker that gives you the ability to view your portfolio 
in the same way as the professionals. All the quotes are updated live without
you having to refresh your screen. You can create up to 10 portfolios of 50
stocks each and either watch the expanded quotes or track your gains and
losses, all streaming in real time. Monthly subscriptions are $25 (or $250 per
year). There is a free 30-day trial.
MSN Money (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/home.asp) offers two
types of portfolio management programs. The basic program doesn’t require
a download to get a quick view of your investments. The MSN Money Deluxe
program, however, requires you to download a program that includes cus-
tomizable portfolio management, instant analyses, charts, stock and fund
screens, and more. This flexible portfolio tracker can bring together all your
personal accounts on one page under one security key. The MSN Money
Deluxe Portfolio Manager allows you to
 Customize your portfolio view. Choose and arrange columns, sorting
the information so that the information that is the most important to
you is listed first. Your Deluxe Portfolio Manager page provides quotes,
information about insider trading, a current valuation of your portfolio,
today’s events, portfolio tracker alerts, valuation ratios, analysts’ rat-
ings, and technical rankings.
 Conduct research and analyses. For example, the portfolio and each
stock are rated on a scale of Strong Sell to Strong Buy, based on the rec-
ommendations of analysts who follow the company. Over- and underval-
uation are based on the price/sales ratio, with individual statistics on
different fundamental factors.
 Access your credit card, bank, and investment accounts. You can view
the history of your transactions for up to 90 days. Assign categories to
your transactions and then use the MSN Financial Tools to look at how
you’re spending your money. If you want, you can even create a budget.
In the Investment Accounts section of the program, you find the follow-
ing: current quotes, dollar and percentage changes on your account
values, alerts, and news on your holdings.

The MSN Money Web site also provides a listing of financial institutions that
can provide MSN Money with your account balances and other account
details. To sign up for this expanded service, go to the My Accounts section
of MSN Money and follow the easy-to-understand instructions. The process
takes about 10 minutes, requires a Microsoft password account (you can get
one while signing up), and the information you use to sign in to your financial
institution’s Web site. (In the later section “Personal finance software pro-
grams,” you see how you can combine this feature with your MS Money per-
sonal finance software program.)
Reuters (www.reuters.com) offers a reliable portfolio tracker and Watchlist
tool with your free registration. Enter your portfolio data (ticker symbol,
price, number of shares purchased, and commissions). Analyze your portfo-
lio by selecting from the viewpoint of performance, valuation, fundamentals,
and today’s action. The color-coded performance view is an immediate eye-
opener about the health of your portfolio. One of the great advantages of the
Reuters Portfolio Tracker is the ability to click a stock’s ticker symbol and
view the financial institution quality company research, stock information,
news, and charts. At the home page, click Investing, then look in the left
margin. 
StockSelector (www.stockselector.com), in my opinion, lets you view your
portfolio “every which way for Sunday.” You can look at today’s change, port-
folio value, today’s news, today’s discussion, earnings summary, analyst sum-
mary, valuation summary, technical summary, fundamentals, and so on.
Additionally, you can see how capital gains can impact your profits. The port-
folio tracker is free with your online registration.
The Wall Street Journal (online.wsj.com/public/us) offers easy access to
your portfolio. Click the top-right corner of almost any page of the Interactive
Edition to access the portfolio program. You can establish five portfolios with
as many as 30 securities in each one. Delayed stock prices constantly update
the portfolio, which also shows percentage change and gain/loss information.
 The grid displays an issue-by-issue breakdown of your investments.
Total value (along with your portfolio’s current gain/loss and percentage
of change) is included at the top of the grid, along with the current value
of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. You can download investment
information to your favorite spreadsheet program.
 If news is available for any company in your portfolio, a flag appears
next to the company’s name. To access the news, click the flag. Links 
to detailed quotes and mutual fund snapshots are also available. These
links provide additional performance and background information.
Annual subscriptions cost $59.

Following Online News with 
Portfolio Tracking
With online portfolio tracking tools, investors can see exactly how their
investments are prospering. Many large news organizations provide portfolio-
tracking services that can make your portfolio tracking very convenient if
you already use one or more of these news sources. The portfolio tracking
functions of online news organizations generally require the security’s ticker
symbol, quantity you purchased, purchase price, and date of purchase. In
return, your portfolio tracker shows today’s delayed market price, today’s
change, market value of your shares, the value of your investment, your gain
or loss, and the percentage of the return. The following sections profile a few
examples of online news organizations’ portfolio trackers.
Business news
Many online business news organizations provide portfolio tracking. Getting
your investment news and tracking your investments at the same site is like
one-stop shopping and can be a real timesaver. You can read the news and
check on your securities at the same time. Check out the following sites:
 CBS MarketWatch (cbs.marketwatch.com) offers (with your free regis-
tration) a program that enables you to create an unlimited number of
portfolios and to track up to 200 ticker symbols for options, mutual
funds, and stocks on all the major exchanges in each portfolio. You can
also customize price and value views to display the data you want to see
first. Prices are automatically updated every five minutes.
 FT.com (www.ft.com) is a handy online portfolio tracker if you’re trad-
ing in a variety of currencies. You can track 24 currencies on a number
of exchanges. The Financial Times allows you to analyze your alloca-
tions, as well as link to financial data and news. A convenient online 
currency converter tallies up your international gains or losses. The
portfolio tracker is free with your registration.
 New York Times (www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html)
lets you set up or see the status of your portfolio (with your free regis-
tration). Go to the Business Section and click Stock Portfolio. To set up
your portfolio, just enter the securities that you own or want to own by
inputting the ticker symbol, amount of shares, commission paid, and
date of purchase. The portfolio program does the rest. PC Quote (www.
pcquote.com) provides the quotes, and The New York Times provides
the free service.
327
Chapter 17: The Internet and Managing Your Portfolio

Portal portfolio management
Portals are Web sites that are designed to be the Internet user’s first window
onto the Web — the first page that comes up when the user accesses the
Web. Often, you can personalize portals so that you can access news, sports,
current portfolio data, or interest rate information before moving on to other
sites. In the following sections, I profile two examples of portals with free
portfolio tracking.
Yahoo! portfolio management
Yahoo! features a personalized portfolio program (finance.yahoo.com). To
use the free portfolio, you need to set up an account with My Yahoo!. Click
the Log In link that appears on the Portfolio line and then click Create an
Account. Click the Edit link that appears and enter a portfolio name. Add the
ticker symbols of your investments, separated by commas where indicated.
You can also enter indexes like the S & P 500 (SPX) for comparison purposes.
You can use the same ticker symbol to record separate purchases. Enter or
edit the number of shares or purchase prices by clicking the Enter More Info
button at the bottom of the page.
Quotes are delayed by 15 minutes for NASDAQ and 20 minutes for other
exchanges. Portfolio management information includes company ticker
symbol, price at the last trade, amount of price change at last trade, trading
volume, number of shares held, the total value of the issue, dollar and per-
centage of change between the purchase price and the current value, amount
paid per share, dollar capital gain or loss, and percentage of capital gain or
loss.
The program provides charts, news, research, SEC (Securities and Exchange
Commission) filings data, and related information. Recent headlines that link
to news stories about your portfolio investments appear at the bottom of the
page. You can get your information by signing in on any computer (and use
the sign-out feature to make certain that others can’t pry).
You can select a nontable version of the portfolio’s data, choose to have all
portfolio data downloaded to a spreadsheet, and retrieve detailed quotes for
each investment. You can customize the portfolio by deciding to sort infor-
mation alphabetically, use a small font, or display the portfolio by using
detailed quote information rather than basic quote data.
Detailed quote information includes last trade (date and time), change (dol-
lars and percent), previous closing price, volume, the day’s price range, 
52-week range, and bid, ask, and open prices. Also included are ex-dividend
dates, earnings per share, P/E ratio, last dividend per share amount, and
yield. Charts of the security’s price for the last three months, year, two 
years, five years, and maximum number of years are available.
328
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

You can view your portfolio in a floating window, which lets you track your
portfolio even when you leave My Yahoo!. Just click the stacked pages icon in
the top-right corner of the portfolio module. If you get tired of seeing your
portfolio, click the X to close the floating window.
Excite
Excite (my.excite.com/myexcite/my.jsp) is a portal that lets you cus-
tomize more than any other portal Web site (after you enter your zip code
and e-mail address). You can choose your favorite links, decide how the page
looks, pick which news stories will be listed first, set select reminders, and
more. You can select stocks to track and create multiple portfolios.
The first portfolio view shows only the ticker symbol, current price, and per-
centage of change since the last closing price. The portfolio tracker provides
alerts, information on the most active stocks, and a market update. The full
portfolio screen shows the ticker symbol, current price, today’s change, per-
centage of change, volume, shares you own, gains or losses, and links to com-
pany news and chats. If you need to look up a company’s ticker symbol or
find a delayed quote, Excite includes the service.
Portfolio management alerts
Many Web-based portfolio management programs offer registered users free
daily updates on their portfolios. Investors can receive news, alerts, and clos-
ing prices on all the securities listed in their online portfolios. Investors usu-
ally enter their preferred e-mail address and complete a confirmation process.
Many programs allow investors to set the criteria for specified alerts. For
example, if the price change of a certain security changes by more than 5 per-
cent in a day, an alert is automatically launched to notify the investor of the
change. The following are a few examples of portfolio alerts:
 Marketocracy (www.marketocracy.com) believes there is no one soli-
tary path to success in the stock market. The common destination is to
learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the market environment.
To that end, Marketocacy offers Marketscope Newsletter, stock alerts,
weekly insights, and daily stock information. There is a free 30-day trial.
The subscription price for this premium level research is $60 for three
months or $180 for one year.
 MSN Money Deluxe (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/home.asp) is
a free downloadable program that takes a few minutes to download with
a 56 Kbps modem. At the Investor home page, click on Portfolio in the
header. You can save personalized views of your portfolio, use the MSN
Stock List to track symbols, import stock screener results to a watch
329
Chapter 17: The Internet and Managing Your Portfolio

account in your portfolio, see an analysis of your portfolio and easily
add new symbols to your account. Among other things, the MS Money
Deluxe launches e-mail alerts delivered to MSN Messenger, Windows
Messenger, e-mail, or your mobile device. Alerts can be based on stock
or mutual fund ticker symbols to notify you of changes in price, volume,
and more.
 SmartMoney.com (www.smartmoney.com) offers intraday stock alerts.
Get notified as soon as your stock hits your specified price target,
volume target net change, and more. You can add, edit, and remove
alerts for immediate use. You can even set up multiple alerts each. For
example, you can be notified when your stock goes up or down 10 per-
cent and when it hits a 52-week high. There is a free two-week trial.
Subscriptions start at $5.95 per month for delayed quotes ($59.95 per
year) and $10.95 per month for real-time quotes ($109.00 per year).
 Stock Alerts (www.stockalerts.com) offers custom alters for a variety
of events and periodic reports on stocks and portfolios. Delivery is to
desktop e-mail, pagers, cell phones, and any other e-mail capable Short
Message Service (SMS) device. Messages are in HTML (HyperText
Markup Language) or plain-text formats. There are three subscription
levels. The free subscription is one report or watch, one portfolio, a
maximum of ten lots per portfolio, total of two deliveries per day, a total
of three destinations for messages per day, and ten messages archived
to the Web. The mini-subscription is $29.95 per year and includes five
watches or reports, one portfolio, 25 maximum delivers per day, 50
delivers per day, three destinations, and 15 recent messages archived on
the Web. The full subscription is $84 per year and includes 20 watches
or reports, three portfolios, 50 lots per portfolio, a maximum of 50 deliv-
eries per day, five destinations for messages, and 50 recent messages
archived on the Web.
Using PC-Based Portfolio 
Management Software
If you want more analysis, including graphs of your investments’ perfor-
mance, tax data, and price and volume alerts, consider a PC-based portfolio
manager (a software program that operates on your PC). For example, you
can select MS Money or Quicken (which you perhaps already use for your
online banking), shareware, or free Internet programs. In the following sec-
tions, I describe a few examples of PC-based portfolio management programs.
330
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 

Personal finance software programs
Personal finance software programs often offer much more than what you
pay for. These programs provide a way to access online banking, organize
your personal finances, understand what you have and what you owe, and
organize your financial accounts for the tax collector. Additionally, portfolio
management programs track and analyze your portfolio’s performance. Most
personal finance software programs automatically use your portfolio’s gains
and losses for your net-worth calculations. With many personal finance pro-
grams, if you’re connected to the Internet, you can automatically update
securities prices. In the following sections, I describe the two most popular
personal finance software programs: MS Money and Quicken.
The National Association of Investors Corporation (NAIC) portfolio manage-
ment program and other portfolio management programs enable investors 
to sort investments by type of industry or company size and then print the
reports. In this way, investors can make comparisons within their own portfo-
lios. In other words, it’s a convenient way to sort out the winners and losers.
A limitation of some personal finance software programs is that they don’t
include this feature. Additionally, personal finance software programs often
have trouble with dividend reinvestment plans.
MS Money
MS Money (www.microsoft.com/money/default.mspx) is a personal
finance software program that can help you stay organized by tracking activi-
ties in your savings and checking accounts, and doing your banking and bill
paying online. You can use Money to manage your investments by download-
ing quotes and brokerage statements from the Internet, plan your retirement,
and more. Four types of MS Money products are available, but only two of the
products include the full menu of portfolio management tools: MS Money
Premium ($79.95) and MS Money Small Business ($89.95).
MS Money tracks your portfolio’s investment positions, updating the price or
quantity held without entering all purchase and sales data. You get a detailed
analysis of your investments by risk, performance, and asset allocation. The
portfolio management program tracks stocks, CDs, and bond capital gains
throughout the year. The asset allocation feature analyzes the allocation of
the assets in your current portfolio and suggests ways to improve it, based
on the historic returns for the investment classes that you hold. Portfolio
management features include
 Portfolio manager: You can directly download account information from
banks and brokerages nationwide. You can access your account informa-
tion 24/7.
331
Chapter 17: The Internet and Managing Your Portfolio

 Portfolio tracking: MS Money includes features that many online free
portfolio trackers lack. For example, you can track stock splits in the
transaction list, as well as in the portfolio and transaction report.
Additionally, there is a 401(k) manager and automatic Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) Schedule D reporting (of capital gains and losses).
 Capital gains estimator and capital gains tracking: The capital gains
estimator calculates your capital gains taxes and alerts you of taxes
owed if a specific investment is sold. You also discover capital gains
tracking and optimization features.
 Asset allocation and investing alerts: MS Money provides timely market
information, as well as an Investing Advisor FYI module featuring recent
alerts. These alerts can give you a quick snapshot of what’s happening
with your stocks and can notify you of any significant news so that you
can stay on top of your portfolio.
Quicken
Quicken (quicken.intuit.com) is similar to MS Money in that both personal
financial programs offer you the option of downloading your checking, sav-
ings, and investment data directly from your bank or brokerages. Additionally,
when it comes to managing your portfolio and tracking your investments,
both MS Money and Quicken provide high quality, personalized tools. The
Quicken Premier ($79.95) personal finance software program
 Can help you track tricky financial transactions, such as stock splits and
corporate takeovers
 Offers a portfolio analyzer, a capital gains estimator, and the ability to
customize your portfolio data
 Lets you download up to five years of stock quotes for trend analysis
and recordkeeping
332
Part III: Expanding Your Investment Opportunities 
Have portfolio, will travel
In the past, if you were traveling, you couldn’t
access your desktop MS Money program to
determine your exact financial position. Now
you can get anywhere, anytime access to your
MS Money data via CNBC on MSN Money
(www.moneycentral.com). After you orga-
nize your finances on MS Money, use MSN
Money to extend the power of your software —
access your data from any computer with an
Internet connection. In other words, you can
now synchronize with MSN Money to access
your MS Money data on the Internet while
you’re away from home.

Quicken offers tax-preparation and planning tools. Quicken can help you cal-
culate your capital gains taxes (not an easy task with today’s tax laws), and it
easily integrates with Intuit’s TurboTax software programs, a feature that
users truly appreciate at tax time. Quicken also features Online Investment
Tracking, which connects individuals to financial institutions for online bank-
ing, online bill paying, and online investment tracking.
Portfolio management software programs
Several hundred portfolio management programs are available for your
investment tracking. The programs vary in price from free to $800. Many of
the freeware and shareware portfolio management programs include an
amazing amount of features, but are somewhat cumbersome to use.
Some brokers give free portfolio management programs to customers who
open an account. Financial data providers frequently give free portfolio man-
agement programs with a subscription to their services. Other portfolio 
management programs are components of larger investment analysis 
applications.
To discover what works for you, try some of the free demonstrations or trials
that vendors offer. They require no obligations, and after sampling several
programs, you can get a good idea of which features you need. Here are some
examples of PC-based portfolio management programs:
 Portfolio Systems Inc. (www.scscompany.com) comes in three flavors:
• Portfolio Gains ($145) is geared for individual investors and allows
data export to TurboTax, provides unlimited quotes and portfolio
updates, has complete privacy, allows an unlimited number of
accounts, tracks stock and options trades, and provides an
account summary view.
• Option Money ($345) is designed for active stock and option
traders. Investors can track their option strategies, check out
account statistics, and view their option and stock positions.
Additionally, Option Money supports an interface between
investors and their brokerages.
• Portfolio Director ($795) includes all the previous features and con-
solidates reports, easily manages multiple accounts, and offers an
aggregate portfolio view. A free 30-day trial period is available. To
use real-time quotes with Option Money or Portfolio Director, you
have to subscribe to either the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(www.cboe.com) for $19.95 per month for unlimited quotes plus
exchange fees, or PCQuote.com (www.pcquote.com) for $19.95 
per month for unlimited real-time equity and option quotes plus
exchange fees.

vides many easy-to-read graphs, charts, and reports that you can print.
Update prices by clicking Internet. Retrieve the latest quotes from AOL,
CompuServe, or many international Internet sites. Fund Manager
imports from Prodigy, MSN, Quicken, and other sources, tracking your
investment performance quickly and easily. The program runs under
Windows 95/98/NT/2000/Me/XP. There are three versions of the pro-
gram. You can try all three for free. The Personal version is $59, the
Professional version is $195, and the Advisor version is $395.

income, and reinvestment) for a variety of investments. It also automati-
cally updates prices from online services. You can print reports that
record the full history of your portfolio or for a specified time period,
including industry and company size breakdowns and return calcula-
tions. The program generates more than 35 reports and graphs, keeps
tax records, indicates diversification, compares portfolio performance 
to the market, and automatically notifies you if a price alert has been
reached. The program runs on PCs with Windows 95/98/2000/Me/XP. A

on how to spot the green flags for buying.

Chapter 18
Ten Warnings About Cyberfraud
In This Chapter
 Recognizing potential online investment scams
 Requiring real financial disclosures
 Unmasking dishonest brokers by asking the right questions
 Knowing where to complain online if you receive an unscrupulous investment offer
T
he Securities and Exchange Commission receives hundreds of complaints of
online investment fraud every day despite many consumer warnings and a
federal crackdown. Don’t get taken for a ride on the Information Superhighway.
In the past, swindlers used the U.S. mail and telemarketing boiler rooms to
exploit unsuspecting investors. Cyber scam artists have now taken online
investor fraud to a more sophisticated level with look-alike portals of legiti-
mate brokerages complete with hyperlinks to fabricated press releases and
fake news stories that look almost like the real thing.
Investigating investments is difficult. The terms of the deal might be hard to
understand, and the investment literature and salespeople might omit key
facts. However, you can observe warning signs of potential scams, schemes,
and deceptions. Doing so involves a little effort, homework, and investigating,
but isn’t that what investing is all about?
In this chapter, I provide ten warnings (and then some) about online invest-
ment information and offers that may be too good to be true. I provide guide-
lines for checking out brokers and investments, as well as tips for identifying
a pyramid scheme. I show you how to read financial disclosures to get the
facts, and I explain how to complain online.

Don’t Believe Everything You Read
Every investor dreams of being an early stockowner in a Microsoft or Intel
Corp. Dishonest brokers and stock promoters prey upon this greed and offer
unsuspecting investors low-priced stocks in companies with new products or
technologies (like the self-chilling soda can). Many fraudulent Internet mes-
sages are about general stock-picking advice or mention other investment
possibilities. However, some messages tout specific stocks, moneymaking ven-
tures, and service providers. Just remember one simple rule: Don’t believe
anything you read until you’ve done some of your own research first.
The following are ten examples of online investment scams that you should
be wary of.
Multilevel marketing plans 
and pyramid schemes
Pyramid schemes, sometimes called multilevel marketing plans, are sure
ways to lose money. Individuals are often contacted via e-mail messages and
encouraged to recruit six friends; those six people recruit six more friends —
and so on, in a relentless search for new recruits. New recruits are expected
to purchase a minimum amount of the pyramid’s products. If everyone coop-
erates, then by level 15, the scheme needs 7.6 billion participants — more than
the Earth’s population.
Profits from these schemes don’t come from selling products or distributor-
ships but from recruiting new participants. The endless recruiting of more
participants eventually leads to an oversupply of sellers. Investors are left
with garages full of products and the loss of their investment.
Three elements characterize pyramid schemes:
 A reliance on funds from new investors (recruits) to pay returns, com-
missions, or bonuses to old investors.
 The need for an inexhaustible supply of new recruits.
 The promise of earning profits without providing goods or services.
A good example of a pyramid scheme is located in the United Kingdom and
online. The enterprise is called a “gifting scheme” and was still available online
as of February 2005. Unfortunately, because it doesn’t’ appear to breach any
current U.K. legislation on pyramid schemes or multilevel marketing and
doesn’t involve any trading of products for services, it has wriggled through
a legal loophole and (at this time) can’t be shut down by U.K. authorities.
340
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Here’s how the scam specifically works: If eight individuals invest £3,000 and
then progress through the levels of the network, they can each expect to
receive £24,000 when they reach the top level. However, to reach that top
level, 64 people have to each invest £3,000. Each of those 64 investors also
expects to collect her £24,000. However, that means that another 512 investors
need to participate. The next level requires 4,096 participants, then 32,768 par-
ticipants, and then 262,144 participants.
To sum it up, each investor needs eight investors in the scheme in order to
get her money back and to make a return. In most cases, the supply of poten-
tial investors dries up, leaving the majority of investors with nothing to show
for their investment. 
Financial chain letters and Ponzi schemes
Financial chain letters can sneak around your spam-blocking software because
they’re usually sent by people you know. Generally, the e-mail message states
that you’re missing out on a big investment opportunity. If you forward the
message to a dozen of your friends, you’ll be allowed to see the details of this
once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity and reap big returns.
Most financial chain letter promoters claim that if you participate, your name
will eventually be at the top of millions of lists and you’ll receive millions of
dollars. You may be asked to send ten dollars to each of the first ten people
whose names are at the top of the list. Next you’re instructed to delete the
name at the top of the list and add your name to the bottom of the list. Money
is made solely by getting other new recruits to join the chain. Most people
receive nothing for their “investment.” Anyone can break the chain and deprive
you of your possible “gains.” Even if the financial chain isn’t broken, about
95 percent of financial chain letter participants don’t ever receive anything in
return for their “investment.”
According to the U.S. Postal Service, financial chain letters are a form of Ponzi
scheme and are illegal. Ponzi schemes are named after a 19th-century clerk,
Charles Ponzi, who conned investors out of $10 million by promising returns
as high as 40 percent. Ponzi schemes are a close cousin to pyramid schemes
because they rely on new recruits. What makes the two approaches different
is that with a Ponzi scheme, any profits go to one person. In contrast, in a
pyramid scheme, any profits go to early investors that have reached a certain
level.
If you’ve been targeted to receive a financial chain letter or if you believe you
have been solicited for a Ponzi scheme, notify your Internet service provider
or the Federal Trade Commission at spam@uce.gov.

Chapter 18: Ten Warnings About Cyberfraud

Cons based on bogus research 
reports and newsletters
The Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com) has a circulation of 1.8 million, and
USA TODAY (www.usatoday.com) has a circulation of 1.6 million. In contrast,
more than 70 million adults log on to the Internet each day. By using mass
e-mailing programs, fraudsters can quickly and inexpensively reach more
people than these publications can. In other words, with one keystroke, fraud-
sters can reach thousands, even millions, of potential online investors. This
type of e-mailing strategy is called spam. Spam is junk e-mail, and creating it
is easy. Often, you may receive unsolicited e-mail newsletters that tout stocks
expected to double or triple in value over a very short time. If you look closely
enough, you might find a disclaimer, usually included in the very small print
at the bottom of the newsletter. The following are several examples of poten-
tial disclaimers:
 The publisher of the report isn’t a registered investment advisor or
broker dealer. The report isn’t an offer to buy or sell securities.
 The owners of the report may already own shares of the stock described
in the publication and may immediately sell all or a portion of these shares
into the open market at or about the time that the report is published.
 Investing in the profiled company is high-risk and use of the report is for
reading purposes only. If the reader decides to act as an investor, it’s at
that investor’s sole risk.
 Statements in the report are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
terms may include such words as expect, believe, may, will, intend, or
similar terms.
Some so-called research reports are nothing more than paid advertisements
for certain stocks. The authors of these supposedly legitimate newsletters
don’t disclose conflicts of interest or biases in their reporting. For example,
in December 2000, a stock guru misled prospective investors in companies
highlighted on his Web site by failing to disclose that the companies had paid
his firm a fee to publish favorable research analyses of their firms. 
In October 1999, the SEC conducted their first nationwide sweep against
these so-called research reports that touted stocks on the Internet but didn’t
disclose that they were being paid to make the promotions. The SEC filed
fraud charges against 44 people and firms, following up in February 2000
with charges against another nine people and four companies.

Phishing for your personal information
Phishing (pronounced “fishing”) is a type of brand spoofing. That is, the Web
page of a legitimate Web site — such as your bank, PayPal, Best Buy, and so
on — is recreated by a fraudster. An e-mail message is sent to you in an attempt
to fool you into revealing your personal financial information or password data.
Sometimes, to gain your personal financial information, “Phishers” will use
 Social engineering: Phishing sometimes uses social engineering to gain
your confidence. Social engineering is when unscrupulous individuals
exploit the weaknesses in people to gain confidential information, such
as passwords that will compromise information system security. Social
engineering is as a low-tech way that Internet users can have their iden-
tities stolen.
 High-tech lures: The term phishing is used to describe how fraudsters
use sophisticated lures to deceive everyday Internet users. Experts note
that about 5 percent of all recipients respond to phishing exploits.
Industry experts state that about 95 percent of all phishing exploits originate
from a spoofed (forged) Internet address. About five new phishing exploits
are reported each month. This is how it works:
 The bait: You receive an e-mail message from your bank stating that,
due to a security break-in, they need to verify your password and ID
number.
 The hook: You follow the link to the phisher’s Web page. The spoofed
Web page has a similar URL and looks just like the page you usually use.
 Reeling you in: A pop-up appears, requesting that you sign on using
your personal password and user ID.
The pop-up is often a dead giveaway that something is wrong. It’s important
to report suspicious activity to the FTC. Another way to check whether some-
thing is wrong, in case a pop-up doesn’t appear, is to compare the current URL
to the URL you usually use. If the URLs are different, you’re being scammed. If
you get spam that is phishing for information and you want to help stop this
type of activity, forward it to spam@uce.gov.

Nigerian e-mail letter investment scam
Over the last 18 months, I have received 147 variations (that’s almost three
e-mail messages a month) of the Nigerian investment scam. I call these e-mail
messages Nigerian, but recently many of these bogus business opportunities
or advanced fee scams have originated from Iraq, Zimbabwe, London, Hong
Kong, and South Africa. Often, these e-mail messages promise that I’ll receive
millions in return for helping a VIP collect money trapped in a Central Bank.
The plea for help assures me that the investment is 100-percent safe. Each
version of the e-mail appeal is slightly different, but the scam remains the
same: I’m guaranteed 20 percent of all recovered funds. In some instances, the
fraudster will ask for enormous amounts of money for fees, taxes, traveling
expenses, and so on. I’m then asked to provide the name, address, and account
number of my bank. For those investors who fall for the scam, the con artist
uses this information to rob the investors’ accounts. See the Federal Trade
Commission’s Consumer Web site located at www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/
pubs/alerts/nigeralrt.htm, which offers a short history and details
about this scam.
If you’re interested in more information about these scams, including copies
of some of the initial letters and the extensive official documents that are
sent to victims, download the Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud report from the
U.S. State Department (www.state.gov/www/regions/africa/naffpub.pdf).

Investment hoaxes designed 
to get your cash
Many individuals have used the Internet as a medium for investment hoaxes.
The following are two real-life examples of how a bogus press release allowed
unscrupulous individuals to make thousands of dollars in illegal profits:
 A bogus press release stated that Uniprime Capital claimed to have docu-
mentation from the government of Spain indicating that the Plasma Plus
was a breakthrough treatment for the virus that causes AIDS. The stock
was touted online in several investment chat rooms as undervalued. In a
few days, more than 5 million shares were traded, and the stock skyrock-
eted by 800 percent. The investment hoax cost investors about $20 million.
 In a similar story, an individual issued a negative press release about
Emulex, a fiber-optic company. In the press release, the fraudster claimed
that the CEO had quit and that the company was restating its quarterly
earnings. In an effort to cover his tracks, the fraudster — who lived in
El Segundo, California — went to a hotel room in Las Vegas to make his
online stock trades on the day of the hoax. The stock dropped by 62 per-
cent, and the con artist made $241,000 by short-selling the stock.

Bogus IRA-approved investment schemes
Many Americans are seeking ways to profitably invest their retirement
nest eggs. Fraudsters are aware of this demand and have devised online
schemes that may scramble the dreams of many investors with so-called IRA-
approved or otherwise endorsed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) investments.
Fraudsters frequently contact investors through bogus e-mail newsletters or
Web sites to offer huge returns that will ensure investors an easy retirement.
Investments include high tech (including wireless cable television and spe-
cialized mobile radio) to exotic livestock (ostrich farming, anyone?) to real
estate investment pools.
Con artists use the “IRS approved” statement to evade the consumer protection
requirements of state and federal securities laws by claiming the investments
are unregulated general partnerships and limited liability companies. Keep in
mind, there is no such thing as an “IRA-approved” or “IRA-sanctioned” invest-
ment. These investments are designed to fly below the regulatory agencies’
radars and are a guaranteed way to lose most or all of the money that you
invest.
Guaranteed high returns frauds
Many fraudsters provide online ads that guarantee “the potential to make a
six- or seven-figure annual income.” The Securities and Exchange Commission
(www.sec.gov) has started a campaign to warn online investors about this type
of stock market scam by creating a sting Web site — that is, a Web site that’s
designed to shock online investors into being more cautious with their hard-
earned cash. In the first two days, the SEC’s sting Web site drew 125,000 hits by
advertising fake offers, drawing interest in March 2002 with a press release that
praises the biological defense firm McWhortle Enterprises (www.mcwhortle.
com). The site features bogus testimonials and analysis reports regarding
McWhortle. Clicking an Invest Now tab transports potential victims to a Web
page, which states, “If you responded to an investment idea like this . . . You
could get scammed!” The text goes on to explain how the Web site incorpo-
rates the telltale signs of online investment fraud, including information
about how to tell that the corporation is a fake. Look for these signs:
 Promises little or no risk with the reward of fast, high profits:
Believing extravagant claims of quick wealth is a dangerous practice.
Often, returns are based on pro formas (the hypothetical performance)
of the company — not on actual returns.
 Doesn’t offer any track record and has no legitimate products (being a
fictitious company, it has neither): Before you consider spending any
money, do some homework. For example, you can — and should — ensure
that a company is a registered corporation and find its location and the
names of its corporate officers.
345
Chapter 18: Ten Warnings About Cyberfraud

 Offers a lucky few investors an opportunity to get in on the ground
floor of “pre-IPO investing”: Pre-IPO investing is the investment stage
that carries the most risk for any venture. Consequently, this investment
cannot be risk-free.
 Requests that each investor supplies a credit-card number and a
Social Security number online for identification purposes: With these
two numbers, the fraudsters can steal a potential investor’s identity and
ruin his or her credit rating.
Get rich quick with investment seminars
One of the newer online scams is the fake investment seminar. Investors are
encouraged via e-mail messages to enroll in expensive seminars to become
day traders or to learn how to trade options, commodities, or futures. Often,
unlicensed practitioners teach the seminars. These unlicensed practitioners
are unlikely to disclose conflicts of interest. For example, attendees may be
required to open a trading account at a specific brokerage (usually a firm that
isn’t as inexpensive or reliable as a top-rated brokerage). Attendees must also
pay hidden costs, such as buying a particular brand of software from the invest-
ment seminar company and using an expensive interface for real-time data.
(Software for these courses can be in the thousands of dollars.) Unfortunately,
naive investors often believe that if they follow the recommendations they
learn in the course, they can earn 250 percent (or more) back on the money
they spent for the course. Seminar leaders foster this belief by touting false
testimonials about how past attendees are now using the fail-safe trading
system and making hundreds of dollars per day.
Pump-and-dump schemes
Pump-and-dump schemes are swindles in which greedy people manipulate the
stock prices so that they can make illegal gains. Frequently, pump-and-dump
schemes target elderly investors. For example, fraudsters purchase shares in
small companies with low stock prices and then use high-pressure telemar-
keters to hype the stock to unsuspecting would-be investors. The fraudsters
pocket the money as the stock’s price rises, leaving investors with virtually
worthless shares.
Fraudsters are using the Internet to perpetuate pump-and-dump schemes.
Pairgain, a California company, was touted by scam artists on Internet message
boards as being poised for a takeover by an Israeli company. The “takeover”
announcement was hyperlinked to a bogus news release made to look like a
legitimate financial reporting service had written it. This scenario is a classic
pump-and-dump scam; fraudsters artificially drive up the stock price and
unload it on unsuspecting investors who believe the stock is on the rise.
346
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Cyber smears are also common. For example, a fraudster borrows 100 shares
of a certain company’s stock from a broker and immediately sells them at $10
a share. Then the fraudster starts an illegal negative message board campaign
with fabricated news stories. The stock price drops to $8 a share. The fraud-
ster purchases 100 shares at $8 a share and returns them to the broker. He
then pockets the $2 a share difference, less interest. The Investing Simulator
Center, located at www.investingonline.org/isc/index.html, offers an
interactive “Don’t Get Burned” simulator to assist you in test-driving what
can happen when you take phony research reports seriously.

If an Offer Seems Too Good 
to Be True, It Usually Is
As the popularity of the Internet grows, millions of people flock to the new
Global Village. Inevitably, individuals with criminal intent follow the crowd. 
Online investor fraud often starts when you receive an e-mail message describ-
ing an appealing offer. Remember that offers that seem too good to be true
usually are. Here are a few of the warning signs to help you identify potential
scams:
 Exceptional profits: Usually, the profits are large enough to get your
interest but not large enough to make you suspicious.
 Low risk, high return: All investments involve some risk. If a fraudster
advertises a no-risk investment, a red flag should immediately go up that
something is wrong. Don’t invest if you don’t know exactly what the
risks are. (Remember, fraudsters don’t honor money-back guarantees.)
 Urgency: Fraudsters usually offer a reason why you must invest as quickly
as possible. They may tell you that delays mean losses of big profits or
that they’re limiting the offer to just a few individuals. Fraudsters often
play on new technological advances that create a brief market that you
must get into right away. However, if you feel that the posting is valid, wait
before you respond. Others won’t be shy about posting their opinions.
 High-pressure tactics: Fraudsters often act like they’re doing you a favor
by letting you get in on the investment opportunity. Don’t be afraid to
ask questions publicly. Post a follow-up message. If the original post is
valid, the person who sent it will be happy to post a public response.
347
Chapter 18: Ten Warnings About Cyberfraud

Although you can find plenty of helpful investment-related postings online
(after all, that’s what this book is all about), the Internet, like other places,
has its share of fraudsters. The National Association of Securities Dealers
Web site is at www.nasd.com. At the home page, click Investor Alerts on the
left side of the page. Next you find alerts that can give you the timely informa-
tion you need to protect your money and to avoid scams and investment
problems. 
Checking It Out Before You 
Put Your Money Down
If you’re an online investment victim, the chances of getting your money
back are slim. Even in cases in which government agencies recover money,
the consumer usually gets back less than 10 cents on the dollar. The best
defense is to thoroughly investigate an online investment before you put your
money down.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) inspects investment swindles and pro-
vides summaries that document recent allegations of corporate fraud and
misconduct in relation to securities investors. Here are some suggestions
about how to investigate that “once-in-a-lifetime offer”:
 Check with your city or state consumer protection agency for informa-
tion about a firm you’re considering for investment: Additionally, a
consumer protection agency can direct you to other organizations that
might have information about the investment.
 Contact regulators: Regulatory organizations include the Federal Trade
Commission (www.ftc.gov), the Securities and Exchange Commission
(www.sec.gov), and the National Association of Securities Dealers
(www.nasdr.com).
For the name and contact information of your securities regulator, go to
the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) Web
site at www.nasaa.org/QuickLinks/ContactYourRegulator.cfm.
 Write or telephone law enforcement agencies: Fraud is illegal in all
50 states. You can contact your local public prosecutor, your state’s
attorney general, or your state’s securities administrator (or all three).
348
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

The Better Business Bureau Web site (www.bbb.org) provides helpful reliabil-
ity reports on firms. You need to read reliability reports before you purchase
the firm’s securities. Each report indicates how long the firm has been in busi-
ness, how long the Better Business Bureau has known about the company,
complaint patterns (if any), and whether any government agencies — for
example, the FTC or the state attorney general — have taken any enforce-
ment actions against the company in the last three years.
Understanding What Real Financial
Disclosures Include
If you’re considering investing in a company, you may want to download and
print a copy of the investment offer. If the sales literature doesn’t include a
prospectus with financial statements, ask for one. If you’re told that the com-
pany doesn’t have a prospectus, request a written financial disclosure about
the company. All in all, you should have the following information:
 Offering circular: Sales literature that presents the investment.
 Prospectus: A formal written statement that discloses the terms of a
public offering of a security or a mutual fund. The prospectus is required
to divulge both positive and negative information to investors about the
proposed offering.
 Annual report: A written report that includes a statement by the chief
executive officer, a narrative about last year’s performance, and a fore-
cast for next year’s performance. Financial statements include a bal-
ance sheet, income statement, a statement of cash flows, and retained
earnings.
 Audited financial statements: Financial statements audited by a certi-
fied public accounting firm.
The SEC, located at www.sec.gov, doesn’t require companies seeking less than
$1 million to be registered, but it does require these firms to file a Form D.
Form D doesn’t include an audited financial statement, but it does state the
names and addresses of the owners and promoters of the firm. Other infor-
mation is limited. If a Form D isn’t available, the SEC suggests that you call its
Investor Education and Assistance Department at 202-942-7040.

Chapter 18: Ten Warnings About Cyberfraud

Telltale Signs of Dishonest Brokers
Dishonest brokers often ask their victims a steady stream of questions designed
to derail honest investors from asking the right questions. In contrast, honest
brokers encourage you to ask questions, provide you with additional educa-
tional materials, and make certain that you understand the risks involved in
your investment decision. And if you decide not to spend your money, they’re
untroubled by your investment decision.
The National Futures Association has collected 16 questions that are turn-offs
for dishonest brokers (www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/money/swindles/
swindles.txt). In the following list, I’ve tailored those questions to meet the
needs of online investors:
 Where did you get my name? The dishonest broker may answer, “from
a select list of investors,” but your name was probably obtained from a
Usenet newsgroup question that you asked, from a bulk e-mail response,
or from a mailing list subscription. 
 What risks are involved in the investment? All investments except U.S.
Treasury securities have some default risk. (U.S. Treasury securities are
considered risk-free. The Federal government backs these securities just
as it does the legal tender — that is, the money in your pocket. The gov-
ernment isn’t likely to fail, so the securities — and your money — are
risk-free.) Some investments have more risk than others do. A salesperson
who really has a sure thing won’t be on the telephone talking with you.
 Can you send me a written explanation of the investment, so I can
consider it at my leisure? This question provides two turn-offs to dis-
honest brokers. First, swindlers are reluctant to put in writing anything
that may become evidence in a fraud trial. Second, swindlers are impa-
tient; they want your money right now.
 Would you explain your investment proposal to my attorney, financial
planner, investment advisor, or banker? You know the investment is a
scam if the salesperson says something like, “Normally, I would be glad
to, but . . .” or “Unfortunately, we don’t have enough time,” or “Can’t you
make your own decisions?”
 Can you give me references and the names of your principal investors
and officers? Swindlers often change their names so that you can’t check
their histories. Make certain that the reference list contains the names of
well-known banks and reputable brokerage firms that you can easily con-
tact. The Investor Protection Trust page (www.investorprotection.org)
includes links to various resources that you can use to check out a broker
or other financial professional.
350
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Which exchanges are the securities traded on? Can I have copies of
the prospectus, the risk disclosure statement, or the audited financial
statements? For legitimate, registered investments, these documents are
normal. A legitimate investment may or may not be traded on an exchange.
However, fraudulent investments never are. 
 What regulatory agency is the investment subject to? Tell the broker
that you want to check the investment’s good standing with its regula-
tory agency before going forward. The possibility of having to talk to a
representative of a regulatory agency is a real turn-off to a swindler.
 How long has your company been in business, and what is your track
record? Can I meet another representative of your firm? If the broker
or the investment doesn’t seem to have a past, the deal may be a scam.
Many swindlers have been running scams for years and aren’t anxious to
talk about it.
 When and where can I meet you to further discuss this investment? As
you might imagine, dishonest brokers often won’t take the time to meet
with you, and they don’t want you in their places of business. Legitimate
registered brokers are happy to sit down and discuss your financial goals.
 Where will my money be? What type of accounting can I expect?
Often, funds for certain investments are required to stay in separate
accounts at all times. Find out which accounting firm does the firm’s
auditing and what type of external audits the firm is subject to. (Make
certain that the well-known accounting firm is actually the auditor.)
 How much of my money will go to management fees, commissions,
and similar expenses? Legitimate investments often have restrictions
on the amount of management fees the firm can charge. Getting what
the firm charges in writing is important. Compare the firm’s fees with
charges for similar investments.
 How can I get my money if I want to liquidate my investment? You
might discover that your potential investment can’t be sold or that sell-
ing your investment involves substantial costs. If you’re unable to get a
solid answer in writing, the investment might be a scam.
 If a dispute arises, how will it be resolved? No one wants to go to court
and sue. The investment should be subject to a regulatory agency’s guide-
lines so that disputes are resolved inexpensively through arbitration,
mediation, or a reparation procedure.
Is your broker dishonest or just incompetent? The state of Massachusetts
provides a list of investment watchdog agencies at www.sec.state.ma.us/
sct/sctlink/linkidx.htm. You can also find the names, telephone num-
bers, and, when possible, the Web link to each state’s securities commission.

In This Chapter
 Getting a grip on selling principles 
 Setting profit goals and maintaining them
 Facing your disappointments
 Moving out mediocre performers
 Keeping an eye on the right economic indicators 
 Watching what the insiders are doing
K
nowing which stocks to sell and when to sell them is the hallmark of a
savvy investor. Selling decisions are difficult because no single solution
fits all investors. In this chapter, I present some general rules and insights.
You discover that individual investors routinely sell winners too early and
ride losers too long. From the time that you purchase a stock, you want to
start considering the right time to sell and reap your rewards.
If you’re pondering a sale, don’t focus on only the sales price. Take the time
to ask several questions and to research the Internet for answers about the
security’s future. Use this chapter to develop your personal selling system
checklist. Compare your selling candidates with your personal selling system
checklist. If your investment choice is a loser, face up to your disappointment
and take your losses. If your investment is a winner, you can laugh all the way
from cyberspace to the bank.
Determining Your Personal Selling Rules
When you purchase a security, you anticipate a certain rate of return. To
examine your investment selection’s performance, calculate what you have
gained by holding the security:
 For bonds, measure the current yield by taking the annual interest pay-
ment and dividing it by the current price of the bond. (For details, see
Chapter 13.)

 For stocks and mutual funds, calculate the investment’s total return
(ending value less beginning value plus income divided by beginning
value). See Chapter 3 for more information.
Visit the several credit-quality Web sites to check the quality rating of all
bonds. Read the appropriate annual reports and fund statements for your
stocks and mutual funds. Remember that no scientific formulas exist to guide
you in your selling decisions. Knowing some wide-ranging rules and the kinds
of questions to ask, however, can help you become a more successful investor.
I describe some general examples of selling rules that beginning investors
might find valuable. Veteran investors can have the same selling rules or quite
different ones. Regardless of which category you fall into, both new and expe-
rienced investors need to choose a personal system and stick to it.
When it’s time to sell, consider using a stop-loss order — also called a stop
market order (see Chapter 5). You can place a stop-loss order to sell when a
certain price is reached. Its purpose is to limit your loss on a particular secu-
rity. For example, you can set a stop-loss order for 10 percent below what you
bought the stock for to limit your loss to 10 percent. For investors who are
unable to watch their portfolios for an extended period of time because of
holidays, vacations, and so on, this order can be a tremendously useful tool.
A sure way to lose big money is to hang on to an investment that’s losing
money. Try not to involve yourself emotionally with your investment selec-
tions. One way to lower the likelihood of holding on to an investment for too
long is to develop a few personal selling rules. Write your personal selling
rules in your investment plan and store the plan on your computer’s hard
drive. If you’re thinking about selling an investment, use these rules to com-
pare your current state of mind with what has worked for you in the past.
Your personal selling rules may state, for example, that you should sell the
stock if any of the conditions in the following sections occur.
The stock drops below your predetermined
trading range
This selling technique is called scaling out. In other words, it is a structured
selling method based on your predetermined trading range. For example, you
can sell stock at predetermined levels as it goes up, say 20 to 25 percent of
your investment at a time, securing profits along the way. Each time you sell
20 to 25 percent, the average cost of the stock remaining decreases, protect-
ing you from the effects of a sudden possible decrease in the price of the
stock. Some industry experts suggest selling any stock that increases by 30
percent above the original purchase price. In contrast, sell the stock if it
drops below 10 percent of the purchase price. 
354
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Before you sell it, however, remember why you purchased the stock in the
first place; then find out what changed and how it affects your portfolio. In
the past, maybe the company was a market leader or the company had a 
new technology. Perform a post-sale analysis of the stocks that plan you sell.
Determine the best time for selling by examining the tax consequences of
your actions. For more about how you can avoid profit wipes-outs due to 
capital gains taxes, see the last section of this chapter. 
You discover that the company’s relative
strength is flat or trending downward
Relative strength is how the company compares with the market or operates in
the current market environment. (When researching, you often discover the
relative strength number calculated for you.) Check out the relative strength of
the stock’s performance over the latest 12-month period. Compare this number
with other stocks’ numbers to determine whether your stock is a loser. Low rel-
ative strength ratings are often the first red flags for sell candidates. The rating
scale is between 1 (lowest) and 99 (highest). Stocks rating 70 or lower may be
laggards and potential sell candidates.
You recognize that the industry 
is in a serious downturn
To recognize a downturn, you must watch the company, the industry, and 
the sector rather than just the stock price. Management changes can also
adversely affect stock prices. Sell the stock if the company shows signs that
it may not produce the earnings or sales growth you originally expected
when you purchased the stock.
You determine that the 
company is in decline
Even great companies are cyclical — that is, they have up periods and down
periods. Sometimes you can purchase shares at bargain prices, and other times
you buy shares that are overpriced. In general, all companies are affected by
the economy and have selling cycles. Some stocks trade with a low P/E ratio
even if the company is earning money. These low P/E ratios indicate that
investors fear the company’s earnings will decline. These fears, which may be
355
Chapter 19: Ten Important Selling Points

based on new competition in the marketplace, can also adversely affect earn-
ings growth and long-term prosperity. For example, does the company rely on
one single product whose life cycle or patent may be running out? If so, con-
sider selling this stock and replacing it with a similar stock that has more
promise.
You discover that the company’s 
profitability or financial health 
is in trouble
If profit margins and the financial structure of the company seem to be weak-
ening, you should consider selling. That is, sell if the stock shows below-
average profitability compared with the industry standard or other selling
standards based on the firm’s financial statement. For example, determine
whether the stock has three years of earnings that are up 25 percent or more
and a return on equity ratio (ROE) of 17 percent or more. Use a selling stan-
dard that meets your required rate of return. If the stock doesn’t meet your
standards, sell it.
Market experts call the company “steady”
or dividend increases are behind the 
general market
Some investors seek earnings growth (net income for a company during a spe-
cific period, usually after-tax income) of at least 10 percent per year. Determine
the amount of returns you can expect over the next five-year period. Make your
best estimate of earnings and discount them heavily if you expect the market
to be depressed. (See Chapter 8 for details.) Keep in mind that, because of
market volatility, your estimates may be subject to big errors. Compare your
results with your own required rate of return (which is different for each
investor). Is the stock worth holding if that’s your potential gain? If not, it’s
time to sell.
Company insiders are selling 
in the public marketplace
Insiders are individuals who own 10 percent or more of the company and are
required to report all their company stock trades. If insiders are selling their
shares in the company or if the company is purchasing its own shares — both
activities that may indicate future financial problems — you might want to sell.

Rebalancing Your Portfolio: Which
Winners Should You Sell?
Over time, your portfolio will go out of alignment if it’s not actively managed.
Rebalancing and allocating your assets can assist you in reaching your finan-
cial goals. Selling securities to rebalance your portfolio can be difficult
because you have to “prune” some of your winners. In other words, to keep
your portfolio in balance, you might have to replace some of the investments
you have grown to count on. You can use online portfolio trackers to unemo-
tionally determine which investments need to be pruned. Most online broker-
ages include portfolio tracking; however, what’s offered by your brokerage
may not meet your specific needs. Here are a few examples of what you can
find online:
 GainsKeeper (www.gainskeeper.com) provides accurate cost basis,
capital gains tax data, and trade decision tools that can maximize after-
tax returns. GainsKeeper allows you to import your portfolio from your
broker, MS Money, Quicken, or Excel files. You can export results to
Excel files, TurboTax, TaxCut, and other tax software programs. Expect
to pay $49 to track 100 stocks and $140 to track 1,000 stocks.
 Morningstar.com (www.morningstar.com) offers Premium Membership,
which includes analyzers that can help you understand the tax and cost
consequences of replacing a security within your portfolio. Additionally,
you can discover a plethora of online asset allocation tools that can
help balance your holdings, determine your optimum asset allocation,
and uncover the risk in your portfolio. A free 14-day trial is available, and
subscriptions are $12.95 per month, $115 per year, or $199 for two years.
 Reuters (www.reuters.com/finance.jhtml) requires your free regis-
tration to take advantage of the portfolio tracker. The Reuters portfolio
tracker is easy to use and allows you to set up multiple portfolios with
on-demand research for domestic and international stocks, U.S. funds,
and cash. You can edit your portfolios by adding or deleting companies
and changing investment amounts or shares. You can view your portfo-
lios by performance (How is the portfolio doing?), fundamentals (How
do my investments compare?), valuation (Am I making any gains or
losses?), and daily action (Do I need to make a trade?). Help icons pro-
vide additional information about portfolio functionality.
 Risk Grades (www.riskgrades.com) is based on a complicated scientific
formula for calculating the risk of your investments. With your free regis-
tration, you receive five portfolios, graphing features, risk versus return
analyses, risk alerts, “what-if” analyses, and historical event simulations.
Using these tools, you can determine which investments are beyond your
risk-tolerance level. Additionally, you can determine whether you’re being
properly compensated for the investment risk you’re taking.

Chapter 19: Ten Important Selling Points

Setting Profit-Taking Goals
Realizing your profit is what investing is all about. Paper profits may look
good, but money in the bank is what pays for your child’s education or
enables you to retire early. If your stock is selling for a high price and is now
a large part of your portfolio, you might want to sell.
What’s more, if you’re contemplating selling the stock, you don’t want to sell
before the stock reaches its peak. In other words, you want to sell at the best
price, before the stock starts to decline. What should you do? The following
list gives you some ideas:
 Suppose that you purchased your shares in 1996 and, despite market
downturns, your stock is currently selling for 50 percent more than your
purchase price. If the stock isn’t likely to go any higher, you may want to
take the money and run.
 Set a target price that might not be your sell price but will be a bench-
mark. If your stock reaches the benchmark price, reevaluate your invest-
ment plan. Make certain that you check similar companies to see whether
they’re selling at the same level or higher. If so, you might want to raise
your target price.
 If a winner now represents more than 10 percent of your portfolio, you
might want to sell part of your holdings. That way, you lock in part of the
profit and still benefit if the stock keeps rising.
 Don’t try to sell at the stock’s top price. You didn’t buy at the bottom, so
don’t expect to sell at the very top. Even after all your analyses, you still
need to rely on your gut feelings about the right time to sell.
You Can’t Be Right All the Time
Selling a loser is often harder than selling a winner. If you purchase a stock
with a certain expectation, but the company never lives up to your expecta-
tions, you should sell. The following list provides a few examples of such 
situations:
 You may want to consider selling a stock if it declines 20 percent in a
down market and 10 percent in an up market. If a stock drops 15 percent
in a flat market, reevaluate.
 The company’s growth rate and earnings trends peak and then fall.
 The company cuts its dividend or stops dividend payments entirely.
358
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

If you sell a loser, note exactly why it didn’t turn out as expected and include
these notes in your investment plan. Such documentation helps you avoid
making similar mistakes in the future.
Everyone expects strong performers to keep up the pace. Past performance,
however, doesn’t guarantee future performance. For more information, see
the article “Do Past Winners Repeat?” at the Investor Home Web site (www.
investorhome.com/mutual.htm#do).
If the Stock Is Going Nowhere, Get Going
If the stock or fund in which you invested is a mediocre performer, you need
to replace it. You may not want to rush to judgment, however. Give the com-
pany about a year to make any needed changes to bring its performance up
to speed. If you don’t see any improvement at all, sell it.
You can tell whether you have a nowhere stock by comparing it with the
appropriate index; see Chapter 8. If the index consistently matches your
nowhere stock, consider selling. Doing so frees up funds for you to purchase
better performers. If you don’t have any great investment candidates, think
about spreading the proceeds among your portfolio’s best existing ideas. Or,
better yet, just hang in there — a good investment opportunity is likely to
appear sooner or later.
To beat the crowd, get some help from The Online Investor at www.invest
help.com.
Don’t Be Fooled by P/E Spurts
Be suspicious of sudden jumps in the P/E (price/earnings) ratio, which may
indicate that the stock is headed for a fall. Soaring P/E ratios and depressed
dividend yields can be signs that market prices are unstable. Consider selling
if the P/E ratio rises more than 30 percent higher than its annual average for
the last ten years. Suppose that the P/E ratio for the last ten years is 20, for
example, and then it suddenly climbs to 26. Consider selling the stock. (On
the other hand, don’t sell stocks that are in a temporary sinking spell.)
Watch Interest Rates
Bond investors must anticipate the turns and directions of interest rates. If
interest rates increase, bonds and bond fund prices decrease because buyers
are less willing to purchase investments with lower rates than those stated on
359
Chapter 19: Ten Important Selling Points

new bond issues. Bonds with longer maturity terms lose more value if interest
rates continue to climb. Bonds are subject to inflationary expectations, mone-
tary demand, and changes in short-term interest rate expectations. Thirty-
year bonds purchased in the ’70s, for example, lost approximately 45 percent
of their value after interest rates increased in the ’80s; for details, see Chap-
ter 13. Keep in mind the following principles for a personal selling system:
 Rising interest rates tend to divert money from the stock market and
depress stock prices.
 Low interest rates usually indicate a good time to own stocks because
the economy grows as a result, and stock prices are sure to increase.
 Declining interest rates indicate less fear of inflation.
 Income stocks are often more sensitive to changes in interest rates than
are other types of stocks.
Keep an Eye on Economic Indicators
From December 31, 1948 to December 31, 1998, U.S. inflation has averaged 3.9
percent a year. Investments such as certificates of deposit (CDs), Treasury
securities, agency bonds, and corporate bonds are fixed-income investments;
their yields don’t vary regardless of the inflation rate. Over the long term,
therefore, low-yielding fixed-income securities can lose out to inflation.
Stock market declines often precede economic recessions. Indications of an
economic slump may suggest to you that you want to get out of the market.
Stock prices often rebound at the end of a recession, however, which argues
against selling during a recession.
For more information about what to look for in economic data, see the CBS
MarketWatch Web site (cbs.marketwatch.com/news/economy/default.
asp?siteid=mktw).
Sell When the Insiders Sell
Do you want an inside tip? Watch what insiders do with the stocks for their
own companies. The SEC requires that officers, directors, and shareholders
owning 10 percent or more of the company’s stock report their trades. These
reports are readily accessible on the Internet.
360
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Insiders trade shares so that they can purchase shares by using the options
that they receive as part of their employment contracts. Additionally, if the
stock’s value is significantly different from its selling price (either higher or
lower), you see lots of insider trading activity. High sales activity by insiders
may foreshadow a financial debacle. Consider selling your own shares if such
trading occurs (especially if the sale price is decreasing).
For a daily report of insider trading, see Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.
com). Look up a quote for the company you’re researching and click Insider
Transaction in the left margin for a list of the most recent insider trades.
Keep in mind that some of this data may be delayed. 
Get Out if the Company or Fund Changes
The company in which you own stock may have changed its core business
since your purchase, or the fund may have changed its objectives or increased
fees. You need to think about the original reasons you purchased a company’s
stock or a mutual fund. If the investments no longer meet these criteria, your
best bet is to move on.
Similarly, if your own financial situation changes, you might want to sell some
or all of your investments. A good reason to do so is if your risk-tolerance
level changes; for example, you’re getting close to retirement or your child is
about to start college.
Have you witnessed a material change in the company? For the latest news,
see MSNBC (www.msnbc.com/news/COM_Front.asp?0dm=C---B&ta=y) or

A Final Word about Stopping 
Profit Wipe-Outs
Selling your investments at the wrong time can result in Uncle Sam receiving
a big chunk of your gains. When deciding which investments to sell, you
should take into consideration the tax consequences of your decision-
making. However, don’t forget the elements listed earlier in this chapter. 
After all, the best strategy is to make good investments, hold on to them, 
and maximize your returns.
361
Chapter 19: Ten Important Selling Points

In December of each year, look at your portfolio and determine whether it
still fits your long-term financial objectives. Over the last year, some of your
investments may have shifted. The shifting of these investments and your
long-term financial objectives can result in a mismatch. Calculating the tax
consequences of selling these particular securities might help you decide
whether now is the right time to sell or to hold.
Capital assets are defined as any property you can buy and sell. A capital gain
occurs when you sell an asset for more than what you paid for it. Conversely,
a capital loss happens when you sell an asset for less than what you paid for
it. Table 19-1 shows a simplified view of how you calculate the basis for your
capital gains. The first row gives the sales price of the securities. The second
row shows how the original cost of the asset is deducted from the sales price.
The third row lists the brokerage fees for buying and selling the securities
that was deducted from the proceeds. The fourth row shows the net gain.

In other words, the broker’s commission and

Capital gain or loss 
$1,600
You can hold your capital assets until the cows come home and not have to
pay any taxes. However, the minute you sell, all your deferred capital gains
(or losses) are taxed at your personal capital gains rate. There are two types
of capital gains rates:
 Short-term capital gains: Capital assets owned for less than a year and
sold for a capital gain (that is, more than their purchase price) result in
a short-term capital gain. Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary
income (at your regular tax rate).
 Long-term capital gains: Capital assets held for more than a year and
sold for a capital gain are taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent (if your
marginal tax rate is 25 percent or higher). If your marginal tax rate is 10
or 15 percent, your long-term capital gains are taxed at 5 percent. (Note:
These capital gains rates are scheduled to remain in effect until 2009).

Table 19-2 shows the impact of the capital gains tax on an investor in the 
35-percent tax bracket. Table 19-2 illustrates how the investor sells $30,000
worth of securities. The investor’s personal tax rate is 35 percent. The next
row shows how the securities are taxed at the appropriate capital gains tax
rate. The last row illustrates the tax liability for the sale of the securities. To
sum it up, Table 19-2 shows how the investor saves $6,000 if he has a long-
term gain.

M
ore Americans own equities than ever before. According to the
Securities Industry Association (www.sia.com/press/FAQs/html/
question11.html), a total of 84.3 million individuals owned equities
(stocks) in early 2002 — about 49.5 percent of all American households, a
total of 52.7 million households. This number is a big change from 1983, when
only 42.4 million individuals owned equities. Despite all this popularity, equi-
ties have a serious drawback: They don’t offer the security of interest-bearing
investments (market funds, CDs, and fixed-income securities).
Interest-bearing securities offer consistent returns. In contrast, stock price
fluctuations just “happen.” Every stock investor can count on market
increases and decreases. These fluctuations aren’t company-specific, but
that fact doesn’t offer much comfort. Over time, stock investments tend to
reward patient investors with good, inflation-beating returns that are greater
than those of any other type of investment. For many individuals, investing
is the only way to reach their financial goals.
Over the years, avid investors have developed many methods to help others
decide which stocks to buy and when to purchase them. No hard-and-fast
rules exist. The approach that’s best is the one that works for you. The fol-
lowing sections offer a collection of investor wisdom that can assist you in
maximizing your personal wealth.

Digging Out of a Recession with 
Dollar-Cost Averaging
Many investors have learned that markets can decline as fast as they can
increase. Frequently, a recession causes these market turnarounds. The
National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), located at www.nber.org,
defines a recession as two or more quarters of negative gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) growth. The NBER documents the beginning and ending of reces-
sions. Many companies (such as automobile manufacturers) have business
cycles that are closely related to the GDP. For companies that are linked to
the GDP, a recession means a reduction in sales and earnings, which in turn
affects the profits of individuals who have invested in these companies.
Understanding that the economy may be affecting the future performance 
of an investment candidate and factoring this information into your buying
decision can be difficult. Ideally, you want to buy low and sell high. Some eco-
nomic reports can assist you in predicting upturns. In other words, referring
to these reports can help you get ready to buy. For example, if the consumer
confidence survey (www.conference-board.org) shows an increase, the
market may be improving; employment increases for two consecutive months
(www.bls.gov/home.htm) may indicate an upturn; and the Census Bureau
(www.census.gov/ftp/pub/indicator/www/m3/index.htm) showing a con-
sistent rise in capital-goods orders may be a predictor of a stronger market. 
What if there are no clear indicators of the market moving upward or down-
ward? In this situation, the dollar-cost averaging approach is the best way 
to get back into the game. The dollar-cost averaging approach is used when
you regularly invest a fixed sum. When stocks are down, you buy more. When
stocks are up, you buy less. Use your online broker, a direct purchase plan, 
a low-fee direct purchase plan (such as ShareBuilder), or buy no-load mutual
funds (for example, from Charles Schwab), which may let you invest as little
as $50 per month.
 For a $4 monthly brokerage fee, ShareBuilder (www.sharebuilder.com)
allows you to purchase the stocks you want and to automatically deduct
the amount you select (it can be as little as $25) from your checking
account.
 For the more affluent, Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com) has a similar
plan; if you invest $500 per month in a no-load mutual fund, you pay no
quarterly maintenance fees. Maintenance fees are $45 for accounts
under $5,000 and $30 for accounts under $50,000.
366
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Buy If the Stock Is at Its Lowest Price
“Buy low” is easier said than done. Excellent investment candidates are
stocks that are selling at their lowest price in three to five years (assuming
that the company’s financial position hasn’t deteriorated). Wait for the price
to stop declining and the company to show some strength, however, before
you put your money down.
You must condition yourself to work against the crowd. For free, delayed
quotes and online company reports, see Reuters at www.reuters.com. At

margin for the data you seek.
Invest in Companies with 
Beautiful Balance Sheets
Carefully analyze a firm’s financial statements before investing. The only way
to determine a company’s true financial situation and to evaluate the poten-
tial risk of investing in the firm is to do your homework and look behind the
numbers:
 The statement of cash flows: Does the company generate more cash
than necessary to sustain the business? Does it look like this situation
will not change for several years? If so, you may have found a winner.
 A change of auditors: Some firms use aggressive accounting standards
that may require them to restate their earnings. If a firm has to restate
earnings, the value of the stock usually decreases.
 The financial statement: If you don’t understand the financial reports,
don’t buy the stock.

Chapter 20: Ten Green Flags for Buying

Check Out the Earnings Forecast
People use earnings forecasts in fundamental analyses to determine the fair
value of a stock. If this fair value is less than the stock’s current price, the
stock is overpriced. If the fair value is more than the current price, the stock
might be underpriced and therefore a bargain.
Financial software developers and most brokerages have analysts that
develop earnings forecast for companies. Prices for these reports vary from
free to several hundred dollars. The Internet provides many sources for earn-
ings forecast reports:
 123Jump (Investing Newsletters) (www.123jump.com/letters/
letters.htm) provides free earnings upgrade and downgrade infor-
mation in addition to other related information.
 MSN Money (news.moneycentral.msn.com/category/topics.asp?
iSub=1&Topic=TOPIC_EARNINGS_FORECASTS) provides earnings
reports, earnings forecasts, and earnings surprises of publicly traded
companies.
 Stock Wiz Links (www.i-soft.com) provides a links page for company
information. Just enter the ticker symbol of the company you’re research-
ing, and you have your choice of hyperlinks to quotes, news, broker rec-
ommendations, research analysts’ earnings estimates (and actuals),
company profiles and fundamentals, SEC filings, and intraday charts.
Watch for Stocks That Are 
Trading under Book Value
Book value is the company’s net asset value — that is, assets minus liabilities
divided by the number of outstanding shares. This amount appears in the
company’s annual report. See the Reuters (investor.reuters.com) and use
its high-powered stock screen to find companies that are trading below book
value. Then go to the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov)
and read the annual reports of likely investment candidates. Companies that
sell below book value (if they don’t have serious problems) are often bargains.
368
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Look for Strong Dividend 
Pay-Out Records
Income stocks tend to hold their value in volatile markets because investors
are confident that they’re going to continue to receive sizable dividends. 
To find companies that investors categorize as income stocks, see Reuters
Ideas & Screening at www.investor.reuters.com/ReadHTML.aspx?
target=about&html=IncomeStocks. Reuters has developed a screen for
income stocks. The screen seeks yield and companies that have realistic expec-
tations of how much they can grow, how much capital they can productively
reinvest into the company, and how much they can pay out to shareholders.
Scroll down to the bottom and click the Daily Results of This Screen link to see
the daily results. The 50 income stock candidates can be downloaded to your
Excel application program for further research, or you can use the results for
additional sorts using Reuters Power Screener. 
Seek Out Firms with Low Debt Ratios
Usually, the lower the debt ratio, the safer the company. Compare the 
company you’re researching to similar firms. Get an industry report from
BigCharts (bigcharts.marketwatch.com/industry/bigcharts-com) and
discover the average debt ratio for the industry. Compare this average to the
debt ratio of the firm you’re researching. To discover which firms have low
debt ratios, use the online stock screens at MSN Money (moneycentral.
msn.com/investor/research/welcome.asp). Use the Basic or Deluxe
stock screeners to find companies with low debt equity ratios. Remember
that companies that have paid down their debt over the last two or three
years may be up-and-comers — and well worth your serious consideration.
Invest in Industry Leaders
If you investigate a company in a specific industry, determine which compa-
nies are growing the fastest in that industry and which ones are the industry
leaders. By focusing on just these two elements, you’re likely to reduce the
number of investment candidates for your consideration in this industry by
80 percent. You also discover that
369
Chapter 20: Ten Green Flags for Buying

 Many companies in the industry have no growth or display lackluster
growth.
 Older companies have slower growth rates than do younger companies.
Remember that investing in industry laggards seldom pays, even if they’re
amazingly cheap. Look for the market leader and make certain that you have
a good reason to invest in the industry in the first place. Additionally, be
aware that all industries have cycles of growth; you want to invest in an
industry that’s in an upswing. For industry surveys and reports, see Value
Line Investment Surveys (www.valueline.com).
Buy Good Performers
Try to buy for value and not for price. Select companies that regularly outper-
formed their competition in the last three to five years and that have consis-
tent rather than flashy returns. Also consider the following guidelines:
 Check the company’s stability and examine its five-year earnings record.
 Keep in mind that an annual percentage increase is desirable, but so is
stability and consistency over the past five years’ earnings.
 You may want to consider not including a company’s one-time extraordi-
nary gains in your calculations.
 Determine whether the company’s annual growth rate is between 25 per-
cent and 50 percent for the last four or five years. If so, it may be a
winner.
Don’t try to chase after last year’s high performer; it could be this year’s
loser. Double-check what you want. For company reports, see CAROL
(www.carolworld.com), which provides Company Annual Reports On-Line
from companies in the United States, Asia, and Europe. Your free registration
is required.
Select Your P/E Ratio Strategy
Any analysis of investment candidates includes P/E (price/earnings) ratios.
The importance of these ratios varies from analyst to analyst. The following
sections describe two strategies that are worthwhile to consider. Select the
one that works best for you. (See Chapters 8 and 9 for additional information
about P/E ratios.)
370
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Low P/E and high dividend approach
Long-term investors often employ the 7 and 7 approach — that is, they pur-
chase stock in companies with a P/E ratio of 7 or less and a dividend yield
greater than 7. Additionally, if the company’s P/E ratio is lower than 10, and
the earnings are rising, you may have found a winner. Make certain by investi-
gating the security, however, that no major long-term problems exist that can
drive the P/E to 4 or lower. (See Chapters 8 and 9 for details.)
High P/E ratios are worth the price
You often get what you pay for; consider the following example: From 1953 to
1985, the average P/E ratio for the best-performing emerging stocks was 20.
The Dow Jones Industrial’s P/E at the same time averaged 15. If you weren’t
willing to pay for the stocks that were trading over the average, you elimi-
nated most of the best investments available. In other words, sometimes it
doesn’t pay to be frugal. Investors who bit the bullet and bought the best-
performing emerging stocks were overwhelmingly rewarded for it in the next
several years for their timely purchases. 
For more information about how to use P/E ratios in your stock buying analy-
ses, visit the Investorguide Web site (www.investorguide.com/igustock
choose.html).
