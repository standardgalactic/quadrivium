Preface to the Sixth Edition
Computer software has been included as part of Schaum’s Outline of Statistics since the third edition of 
this book. However, with rapid development of computers and computer software since the publication of 
the third edition, the inclusion of computer software in the outline has increased steadily. I relied heavily 
on MINITAB, EXCEL, and STATISTIX in the sixth edition. The output from MINITAB and STATISTIX 
has helped clarify some of the statistical concepts which are hard to understand without some help from the 
graphics involved. I wish to thank the producers of the software packages for their permission to include out­
put from their software in the book. I am indebted to Laura Brown, head of the author’s assistance program 
at MINITAB, for all the help she has provided me as well as Dr. Gerard Nimis at STATISTIX for providing 
me with STATISTIX software to utilize as I was writing the sixth edition of the outline. Thanks to Diane 
Grayson at McGraw-Hill Education for the great work and time she has spent with me on the project. I also 
wish to thank my wife Lana, for all her help.

Preface to the Fourth Edition
This fourth edition, completed in 2007, contains new examples, 130 new ﬁgures, and output from ﬁve 
computer software packages representative of the hundreds or perhaps thousands of computer software 
packages that are available for use in statistics. All ﬁgures in the third edition are replaced by new and 
sometimes different ﬁgures created by the ﬁve software packages: EXCEL, MINITAB, SAS, SPSS, and 
STATISTIX. My examples were greatly inﬂuenced by USA Today as I put the book together. This 
newspaper is a great source of current uses and examples in statistics.
Other changes in the book include the following. Chapter 18 on the analyses of time series was 
removed and Chapter 19 on statistical process control and process capability is now Chapter 18. The 
answers to the supplementary problems at the end of each chapter are given in more detail. More 
discussion and use of p-values are included throughout the book.

Preface to the Third Edition
In preparing this third edition of Schaum’s Outline of Statistics, I have replaced dated problems with 
problems that reﬂect the technological and sociological changes that have occurred since the ﬁrst edition 
was published in 1961. One problem in the second edition dealt with the lifetimes of radio tubes, for 
example. Since most people under 30 probably do not know what radio tubes are, this problem, as well 
as many other problems, have been replaced by problems involving current topics such as health care 
issues, AIDS, the Internet, cellular phones, and so forth. The mathematical and statistical aspects have 
not changed, but the areas of application and the computational aspects of statistics have changed.
Another important improvement is the introduction of statistical software into the text. The devel- 
opment of statistical software packages such as SAS, SPSS, and MINITAB has dramatically changed the 
application of statistics to real-world problems. One of the most widely used statistical packages in 
academia as well as in industrial settings is the package called MINITAB (Minitab Inc., 1829 Pine 
Hall Road, State College, PA 16801). I would like to thank Minitab Inc. for granting me permission 
to include MINITAB output throughout the text. Many modern statistical textbooks include computer 
software output as part of the text. I have chosen to include MINITAB because it is widely used and is very 
friendly. Once a student learns the various data ﬁle structures needed to use MINITAB, and the 
structure of the commands and subcommands, this knowledge is readily transferable to other statistical 
software. With the introduction of pull-down menus and dialog boxes, the software has been made even 
friendlier. I include both commands and pull-down menus in the MINITAB discussions in the text.
Many of the new problems discuss the important statistical concept of the p-value for a statistical 
test. When the ﬁrst edition was introduced in 1961, the p-value was not as widely used as it is today, 
because it is often difficult to determine without the aid of computer software. Today p-values are 
routinely provided by statistical software packages since the computer software computation of p-values is 
often a trivial matter.
A new chapter entitled ‘‘Statistical Process Control and Process Capability’’ has replaced Chapter 19, 
‘‘Index Numbers.’’ These topics have many industrial applications, and I felt they needed to be 
included in the text. The inclusion of the techniques of statistical process control and process capabil­
ity in modern software packages has facilitated the implementation of these techniques in many indus­
trial settings. The software performs all the computations, which are rather burdensome. I chose to use 
MINITAB because I feel that it is among the best software for SPC applications.
I wish to thank my wife Lana for her understanding during the preparation of the book; my friend 
Stanley Wileman for all the computer help he has given me; and Alan Hunt and the staff at Keyword 
Publishing Services Ltd., London, England, for their ﬁne production work. Finally, I wish to thank the 
staff at McGraw-Hill for their cooperation and helpfulness.

Preface to the Second Edition
Statistics, or statistical methods as it is sometimes called, is playing an increasingly important role in 
nearly all phases of human endeavor. Formerly dealing only with affairs of the state, thus accounting for 
its name, the inﬂuence of statistics has now spread to agriculture, biology, business, chemistry, commu- 
nications, economics, education, electronics, medicine, physics, political science, psychology, sociology, 
and numerous other ﬁelds of science and engineering.
The purpose of this book is to present an introduction to the general statistical principles which will 
be found useful to all individuals regardless of their ﬁelds of specialization. It has been designed for use 
either as a supplement to all current standard texts or as a textbook for a formal course in statistics. 
It should also be of considerable value as a book of reference for those presently engaged in applications 
of statistics to their own special problems of research.
Each chapter begins with clear statements of pertinent deﬁnitions, theorems, and principles together 
with illustrative and other descriptive material. This is followed by graded sets of solved and supple- 
mentary problems which in many instances use data drawn from actual statistical situations. The solved 
problems serve to illustrate and amplify the theory, bring into sharp focus those ﬁne points without 
which the students continually feel themselves to be on unsafe ground, and provide the repetition of 
basic principles so vital to effective teaching. Numerous derivations of formulas are included among the 
solved problems. The large number of supplementary problems with answers serve as a complete review 
of the material of each chapter.
The only mathematical background needed for an understanding of the entire book is arithmetic and 
the elements of algebra. A review of important mathematical concepts used in the book is presented in 
the ﬁrst chapter which may either be read at the beginning of the course or referred to later as the need 
arises.
The early part of the book deals with the analysis of frequency distributions and associated measures 
of central tendency, dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis. This leads quite naturally to a discussion of 
elementary probability theory and applications, which paves the way for a study of sampling theory. 
Techniques of large sampling theory, which involve the normal distribution, and applications to statis- 
tical estimation and tests of hypotheses and signiﬁcance are treated ﬁrst. Small sampling theory, invol- 
ving student’s t distribution, the chi-square distribution, and the F distribution together with the 
applications appear in a later chapter. Another chapter on curve ﬁtting and the method of least squares 
leads logically to the topics of correlation and regression involving two variables. Multiple and partial 
correlation involving more than two variables are treated in a separate chapter. These are followed by 
chapters on the analysis of variance and nonparametric methods, new in this second edition. Two ﬁnal 
chapters deal with the analysis of time series and index numbers respectively.
Considerably more material has been included here than can be covered in most ﬁrst courses. This 
has been done to make the book more ﬂexible, to provide a more useful book of reference, and to 
stimulate further interest in the topics. In using the book it is possible to change the order of many 
later chapters or even to omit certain chapters without difficulty. For example, Chapters 13–15 and 
18–19 can, for the most part, be introduced immediately after Chapter 5, if it is desired to treat correla- 
tion, regression, times series, and index numbers before sampling theory. Similarly, most of Chapter 6 
may be omitted if one does not wish to devote too much time to probability. In a ﬁrst course all of 
Chapter 15 may be omitted. The present order has been used because there is an increasing tendency in 
modern courses to introduce sampling theory and statistical inﬂuence as early as possible.
I wish to thank the various agencies, both governmental and private, for their cooperation in supply-
ing data for tables. Appropriate references to such sources are given throughout the book. In particular,

I am indebted to Professor Sir Ronald A. Fisher, F.R.S., Cambridge; Dr. Frank Yates, F.R.S., 
Rothamsted; and Messrs. Oliver and Boyd Ltd., Edinburgh, for permission to use data from Table 
III of their book Statistical Tables for Biological, Agricultural, and Medical Research. I also wish to thank 
Esther and Meyer Scher for their encouragement and the staff of McGraw-Hill for their cooperation.

CHAPTER 1
STATISTICS
Statistics is concerned with scientific methods for collecting, organizing, summarizing, presenting, and analyz­
ing data as well as with drawing valid conclusions and making reasonable decisions on the basis of such analysis.
In a narrower sense, the term statistics is used to denote the data themselves or numbers derived from the 
data, such as averages. Thus we speak of employment statistics, accident statistics, etc.
POPULATION AND SAMPLE; INDUCTIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
In collecting data concerning the characteristics of a group of individuals or objects, such as the heights and 
weights of students in a university or the numbers of defective and nondefective bolts produced in a factory on a 
given day, it is often impossible or impractical to observe the entire group, especially if it is large. Instead of exam­
ining the entire group, called the population, or universe, one examines a small part of the group, called a sample.
A population can be finite or infinite. For example, the population consisting of all bolts produced in a fac­
tory on a given day is finite, whereas the population consisting of all possible outcomes (heads, tails) in succes­
sive tosses of a coin is infinite.
If a sample is representative of a population, important conclusions about the population can often be 
inferred from analysis of the sample. The phase of statistics dealing with conditions under which such inference 
is valid is called inductive statistics, or statistical inference. Because such inference cannot be absolutely certain, 
the language of probability is often used in stating conclusions.
The phase of statistics that seeks only to describe and analyze a given group without drawing any conclu­
sions or inferences about a larger group is called descriptive, or deductive, statistics.
Before proceeding with the study of statistics, let us review some important mathematical concepts.
VARIABLES: DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS
A variable is a symbol, such as X, Y, H, x, or B, that can assume any of a prescribed set of values, called the 
domain of the variable. If the variable can assume only one value, it is called a constant.
A variable that can theoretically assume any value between two given values is called a continuous variable; 
otherwise, it is called a discrete variable.
EXAMPLE 1.  The number N of children in a family, which can assume any of the values 0, 1, 2, 3, … but cannot be 2.5 
or 3.842, is a discrete variable.
EXAMPLE 2.  The height H of an individual, which can be 62 inches (in), 63.8 in, or 65.8341 in, depending on the accuracy 
of measurement, is a continuous variable.
Data that can be described by a discrete or continuous variable are called discrete data or continuous data, 
respectively. The number of children in each of 1000 families is an example of discrete data, while the heights 
Variables and Graphs

of 100 university students is an example of continuous data. In general, measurements give rise to continuous 
data, while enumerations, or countings, give rise to discrete data.
It is sometimes convenient to extend the concept of variables to nonnumerical entities; for example, color C in 
a rainbow is a variable that can take on the “values” red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It is gen­
erally possible to replace such variables by numerical quantities; for example, denote red by 1, orange by 2, etc.
ROUNDING OF DATA
The result of rounding a number such as 72.8 to the nearest unit is 73, since 72.8 is closer to 73 than to 72. 
Similarly, 72.8146 rounded to the nearest hundredth (or to two decimal places) is 72.81, since 72.8146 is closer 
to 72.81 than to 72.82.
In rounding 72.465 to the nearest hundredth, however, we are faced with a dilemma since 72.465 is just as 
far from 72.46 as from 72.47. It has become the practice in such cases to round to the even integer preceding the 5. 
Thus 72.465 is rounded to 72.46, 183.575 is rounded to 183.58, and 116,500,000 rounded to the nearest million 
is 116,000,000. This practice is especially useful in minimizing cumulative rounding errors when a large number 
of operations is involved (see Problem 1.4).
SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
When writing numbers, especially those involving many zeros before or after the decimal point, it is convenient 
to employ the scientific notation using powers of 10.

EXAMPLE 5.  864,000,000 = 8.64 × 108, and 0.00003416 = 3.416 × 10-5.
Note that multiplying a number by 108, for example, has the effect of moving the decimal point of the num­
ber eight places to the right. Multiplying a number by 10-6 has the effect of moving the decimal point of the 
number six places to the left.
We often write 0.1253 rather than .1253 to emphasize the fact that a number other than zero before the 
decimal point has not accidentally been omitted. However, the zero before the decimal point can be omitted in 
cases where no confusion can result, such as in tables.
Often we use parentheses or dots to show the multiplication of two or more numbers. Thus (5)(3) = 5 · 3 = 
5 × 3 = 15, and (10)(10)(10)

SIGNIFICANT FIGURES
If a height is accurately recorded as 65.4 in, it means that the true height lies between 65.35 and 65.45 in. The 
accurate digits, apart from zeros needed to locate the decimal point, are called the significant digits, or significant 
figures, of the number.
EXAMPLE 9.  65.4 has three significant figures.
EXAMPLE 10.  4.5300 has five significant figures.

− has four significant figures.
Numbers associated with enumerations (or countings), as opposed to measurements, are of course exact and so 
have an unlimited number of significant figures. In some of these cases, however, it may be difficult to decide which 
figures are significant without further information. For example, the number 186,000,000 may have 3, 4, …, 9 
significant figures. If it is known to have five significant figures, it would be better to record the number as either 
186.00 million or 1.8600 108
×
.
COMPUTATIONS
In performing calculations involving multiplication, division, and the extraction of roots of numbers, the final 
result can have no more significant figures than the numbers with the fewest significant figures (see Problem 1.9).

In performing additions and subtractions of numbers, the final result can have no more significant 
figures after the decimal point than the numbers with the fewest significant figures after the decimal point 
(see Problem 1.10).
EXAMPLE 17.  3.16 + 2.7 = 5.9
EXAMPLE 18.  83.42 - 72 = 11
EXAMPLE 19.  47.816 - 25 = 22.816 (if 25 is exact)
The above rule for addition and subtraction can be extended (see Problem 1.11).
FUNCTIONS
If to each value that a variable X can assume there corresponds one or more values of a variable Y, we say that Y 
is a function of X and write Y = F(X) (read “Y equals F of X”) to indicate this functional dependence. Other letters 
(G, f, etc.) can be used instead of F.

The variable X is called the independent variable and Y is called the dependent variable.
If only one value of Y corresponds to each value of X, we call Y a single-valued function of X; otherwise, it 
is called a multiple-valued function of X.
EXAMPLE 20.  The total population P of the United States is a function of the time t, and we write P = F(t).
EXAMPLE 21.  The stretch S of a vertical spring is a function of the weight W placed on the end of the spring. In symbols, 
S = G(W).
The functional dependence (or correspondence) between variables is often depicted in a table. However, it 
can also be indicated by an equation connecting the variables, such as Y = 2X - 3, from which Y can be deter­
mined corresponding to various values of X.
If Y = F(X), it is customary to let F(3) denote “the value of Y when X = 3,” to let F(10) denote “the value of 
Y when X = 10,” etc. Thus if Y = F(X) = X2, then F(3) = 32 = 9 is the value of Y when X = 3.
The concept of function can be extended to two or more variables (see Problem 1.17).
RECTANGULAR COORDINATES
Figure 1-1 shows an EXCEL scatter plot for four points. The scatter plot is made up of two mutually perpen­
dicular lines called the X and Y axes. The X axis is horizontal and the Y axis is vertical. The two axes meet at a 
point called the origin. The two lines divide the XY plane into four regions denoted by I, II, III, and IV and called 
the first, second, third, and fourth quadrants. Four points are shown plotted in Fig. 1-1. The point (2, 3) is in the 
first quadrant and is plotted by going 2 units to the right along the X axis from the origin and 3 units up from there. 
The point (-2.3, 4.5) is in the second quadrant and is plotted by going 2.3 units to the left along the X axis from 
the origin and then 4.5 units up from there. The point (-4, -3) is in the third quadrant and is plotted by going 4 
units to the left of the origin along the X axis and then 3 units down from there. The point (3.5, -4) is in the fourth 
quadrant and is plotted by going 3.5 units to the right along the X axis and then 4 units down from there. The first 
number in a pair is called the abscissa of the point and the second number is called the ordinate of the point. The 
abscissa and the ordinate taken together are called the coordinates of the point.
By constructing a Z axis through the origin and perpendicular to the XY plane, we can easily extend the 
above ideas. In such cases the coordinates of a point would be denoted by (X, Y, Z).

GRAPHS
A graph is a pictorial presentation of the relationship between variables. Many types of graphs are employed in 
statistics, depending on the nature of the data involved and the purpose for which the graph is intended. Among 
these are bar graphs, pie graphs, pictographs, etc. These graphs are sometimes referred to as charts or diagrams. 
Thus we speak of bar charts, pie diagrams, etc. (see Problems 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, and 1.27).

A bar chart is a plot of qualitative data in which the frequency or percent of the data is the length of a rect­
angle and each category is the base of the rectangle. Figure 1-2 is an EXCEL horizontal bar chart illustrating the 
data in Table 1.1.
A pie chart is a plot of qualitative data in which the size of the piece of pie is proportional to the frequency 
of a category. The angles of the pieces of pie that correspond to the categories add up to 360 degrees. 
For example, the piece of pie that represents “Fell from lap” has an angle equal to 0.30(360 degrees) = 
108 degrees. The piece of pie that represents “Knocked off table” has an angle equal to 0.08(360 degrees) = 
28.8 degrees. The data in Table 1.1 may be summarized as follows.

EQUATIONS
Equations are statements of the form A = B, where A is called the left-hand member (or side) of the equation, 
and B the right-hand member (or side). So long as we apply the same operations to both members of an equa­
tion, we obtain equivalent equations. Thus we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide both members of an equa­
tion by the same value and obtain an equivalent equation, the only exception being that division by zero is not 
allowed.
EXAMPLE 22.  Given the equation X

obtaining 2(3)
3
9
+
= , or 9 = 9, which is an identity. The process of obtaining solutions of an equation is called solving the 
equation.
The above ideas can be extended to finding solutions of two equations in two unknowns, three equations in 
three unknowns, etc. Such equations are called simultaneous equations (see Problem 1.29).
INEQUALITIES
The symbols < and > mean “less than” and “greater than,” respectively. The symbols ≤ and ≥ mean “less than or 
equal to” and “greater than or equal to,” respectively. They are known as inequality symbols.
EXAMPLE 23.  3 < 5 is read “3 is less than 5.”
EXAMPLE 24.  5 > 3 is read “5 is greater than 3.”
EXAMPLE 25.  X < 8 is read “X is less than 8.”
EXAMPLE 26.  X ≥ 10 is read “X is greater than or equal to 10.”
EXAMPLE 27.  4 < Y ≤ 6 is read “4 is less than Y, which is less than or equal to 6,” or Y is between 4 and 6, excluding 4 but 
including 6,” or “Y is greater than 4 and less than or equal to 6.” 
Relations involving inequality symbols are called inequalities. Just as we speak of members of an equation, 
so we can speak of members of an inequality. Thus in the inequality 4 < Y ≤ 6, the members are 4, Y, and 6.

Fig. 1-3  EXCEL pie chart of data in Table 1.1.
EXCEL may be used to form a pie chart of the data. The data, in summarized form, is entered into the work­
sheet. EXCEL was used to form the following pie chart.

A valid inequality remains valid when:
1.	 The same number is added to or subtracted from each member.
EXAMPLE 28.  Since 15 > 12, 15 + 3 > 12 + 3 (i.e., 18 > 15) and 15 - 3 > 12 - 3 (i.e., 12 > 9).
2.	 Each member is multiplied or divided by the same positive number.
EXAMPLE 29.  Since 15 > 12, (15)(3) > (12)(3) (i.e., 45 > 36) and 15 3
12 3
>
 (i.e., 5 > 4).
3.	 Each member is multiplied or divided by the same negative number, provided that the inequality symbols are 
reversed.

y = . A logarithm is an exponent. It is the power that the 
base b must be raised to in order to get the number for which you are taking the logarithm. The two bases that 
have traditionally been used are 10 and e, which equals 2.71828182 . . . . Logarithms with base 10 are called 
common logarithms and are written as log10 x or simply as log(x). Logarithms with base e are called natural 
logarithms and are written as ln(x).
EXAMPLE 31.  Find the following logarithms and then use EXCEL to find the same logarithms: log 8
2 , log 25
5
, and 
log 1000
10
. Three is the power of 2 that gives 8, and so log 8
3
2
= . Two is the power of 5 that gives 25, and so log 25
2
5
= . 
Three is the power of 10 that gives 1000, and so log 1000
3
10
= . EXCEL contains three functions that compute logarithms. 
The function LN computes natural logarithms, the function LOG10 computes common logarithms, and the function 
LOG(x,b) computes the logarithm of x to base b. =LOG(8,2) gives 3, =LOG(25,5) gives 2, and =LOG10(1000) gives 3.
EXAMPLE 32.  Use EXCEL to compute the natural logarithm of the integers 1 through 5. The numbers 1 through 5 are 
entered into B1:F1 and the expression =LN(B1) is entered into B2 and a click-and-drag is performed from B2 to F2. The

LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS
To solve logarithmic equations:
1.	 Isolate the logarithms on one side of the equation.
2.	 Express a sum or difference of logarithms as a single logarithm.
3.	 Re-express the equation in step 2 in exponential form.
4.	 Solve the equation in step 3.
5.	 Check all solutions.

  1.7	 What is the maximum error in each of the following measurements, assuming that they are recorded 
accurately?
(a)	 73.854 in	
(b)	 0.09800 cubic feet (ft3)	
(c)	 3.867 × 108 kilometers (km)
SOLUTION
(a)	 The measurement can range anywhere from 73.8535 to 73.8545 in; hence the maximum error is 0.0005 in. Five 
significant figures are present.
(b)	 The number of cubic feet can range anywhere from 0.097995 to 0.098005 ft3; hence the maximum error is 
0.000005 ft3. Four significant figures are present.
(c)	 The actual number of kilometers is greater than 3.8665 × 108 but less than 3.8675 × 108; hence the maximum error 
is 0.0005 × 108, or 50,000 km. Four significant figures are present.

Computations
  1.9	 Show that the product of the numbers 5.74 and 3.8, assumed to have three and two significant figures, 
respectively, cannot be accurate to more than two significant figures.
SOLUTION
First method
5.74
3.8
21.812
×
=
, but not all figures in this product are significant. To determine how many figures are significant, 
observe that 5.74 stands for any number between 5.735 and 5.745, while 3.8 stands for any number between 3.75 
and 3.85. Thus the smallest possible value of the product is 5.735 3.75
21.50625
×
=
, and the largest possible value is 
×
=
5.745
3.85
22.11825.
	
Since the possible range of values is 21.50625 to 22.11825, it is clear that no more than the first two figures in 
the product can be significant, the result being written as 22. Note that the number 22 stands for any number between 
21.5 and 22.5.
Second method
With doubtful figures in italic, the product can be computed as shown here:
5.74
38
——––
4592
1722
——––
21.812
We should keep no more than one doubtful figure in the answer, which is therefore 22 to two significant figures. 
Note that it is unnecessary to carry more significant figures than are present in the least accurate factor; thus if 
5.74 is rounded to 5.7, the product is 5.7
3.8
21.66
22
×
=
=
 to two significant figures, agreeing with the above 
results.
	
In calculating without the use of computers, labor can be saved by not keeping more than one or two figures 
beyond that of the least accurate factor and rounding to the proper number of significant figures in the final 
answer. With computers, which can supply many digits, we must be careful not to believe that all the digits are 
significant.

1.10	 Add the numbers 4.19355, 15.28, 5.9561, 12.3, and 8.472, assuming all figures to be significant.
SOLUTION
In calculation (a) below, the doubtful figures in the addition are in italic type. The final answer with no more than one 
doubtful figure is recorded as 46.2.

46.20
Some labor can be saved by proceeding as in calculation (b), where we have kept one more significant decimal place 
than that in the least accurate number. The final answer, rounded to 46.2, agrees with calculation (a).
1.11	 Calculate 475,000,000 + 12,684,000 - 1,372,410 if these numbers have three, five, and seven significant 
figures, respectively.
SOLUTION
In calculation (a) below, all figures are kept and the final answer is rounded. In calculation (b), a method similar to 
that of Problem 1.10(b) is used. In both cases, doubtful figures are in italic type.

(c)	 (28)(4193)(182)
(d )	(526.7)(0.001280)

The final result is rounded to 486,000,000; or better yet, to show that there are three significant figures, it is written 
as 486 million or 4.86 × 108.
1.12	 Perform each of the indicated operations.

SOLUTION
(a) 2004; (b) 2006; (c) 2004; (d ) 2002 and 2005; (e) 2006
1.15	 Let W and C denote, respectively, the number of bushels of wheat and corn produced during the year t 
on the Tyson farm of Problem 1.14. It is clear W and C are both functions of t; this we can indicate by 
W = F(t) and C = G(t).
(a)	 Find W when t = 2004.
(b)	 Find C when t = 2002.
(c)	 Find t when W = 205.
(d )	Find F(2005).
(e)	 Find G(2005).
( f )	 Find C when W = 190.
(g)	 What is the domain of the variable t?
(h)	 Is W a single-valued function of t?
(i)	 Is t a function of W?
( j)	 Is C a function of W?
(k)	 Which variable is independent, t or W?

(a)	 190
(b)	 80
(c)	 2002 and 2005
(d )	 205
(e)	 115
( f )	 110
(g)	 The years 2002 through 2006.
(h)	 Yes, since to each value that t can assume, there corresponds one and only one value of W.
(i)	 Yes, the functional dependence of t on W can be written t = H(W).
( j)	 Yes.
(k)	 Physically, it is customary to think of W as determined from t rather than t as determined from W. Thus, physi­
cally, t is the dependent variable and W is the independent variable. Mathematically, however, either variable can 
be considered the independent variable and the other the dependent. The one that is assigned various values is the 
independent variable; the one that is then determined as a result is the dependent variable.
1.16	 A variable Y is determined from a variable X according to the equation Y = 2X - 3, where the 2 and 3 
are exact.
(a)	 Find Y when X = 3, -2, and 1.5.
(b)	 Construct a table showing the values of Y corresponding to X = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
(c)	 If the dependence of Y on X is denoted by Y = F(X), determine F(2.4) and F(0.8).
(d )	What value of X corresponds to Y = 15?
(e)	 Can X be expressed as a function of Y?
( f )	 Is Y a single-valued function of X?
(g)	 Is X a single-valued function of Y?

SOLUTION
(a)	 When X = 3, Y = 2X - 3 = 2(3) - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3. When X = -2, Y = 2X -3 = 2(-2) -3 = -4 -3 = -7. When X = 1.5, 
Y = 2X - 3 = 2(1.5) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0.
(b)	 The values of Y, computed as in part (a), are shown in Table 1.3. Note that by using other values of X, we can 
construct many tables. The relation Y = 2X - 3 is equivalent to the collection of all such possible tables.

(d )	 Substitute Y = 15 in Y = 2X - 3. This gives 15 = 2X - 3, 2X = 18, and X = 9.
(e)	 Yes. Since Y = 2X - 3, Y + 3 = 2X and 
1

Y

. This expresses X explicitly as a function of Y.
( f )	 Yes, since for each value that X can assume (and there is an indefinite number of these values) there corresponds 
one and only one value of Y.
(g)	 Yes, since from part (e), 
1

, so that corresponding to each value assumed by Y there is one and only one 
value of X.
1.17	 If Z = 16 + 4X - 3Y, find the value of Z corresponding to (a) X = 2, Y = 5; (b) X = -3, Y = -7; and 
(c) X = -4, Y = 2.
SOLUTION
(a)	 Z = 16 + 4(2) - 3(5) = 16 + 8 - 15 = 9
(b)	 Z = 16 + 4(-3) - 3(-7) = 16 - 12 + 21 = 25
(c)	 Z = 16 + 4(-4) - 3(2) = 16 - 16 - 6 = -6
Given values of X and Y, there corresponds a value of Z. We can denote this dependence of Z on X and Y by writing 
Z = F(X, Y) (read “Z is a function of X and Y ”). F(2, 5) denotes the value of Z when X = 2 and Y = 5 and is 9, from 
part (a). Similarly, F(-3, -7) = 25 and F(-4, 2) = -6 from parts (b) and (c), respectively.
	 The variables X and Y are called independent variables, and Z is called a dependent variable.

45, and 50 units a day.
(c)	 Evaluate and interpret f (100).

SOLUTION
EXCEL is used to build Table 1.4 that gives the Y values for X values equal to -5, -4, . . . , 5. The expression 
=2*B1^2-3*B1-9 is entered into cell B2 and a click-and-drag is performed from B2 to L2. The chart wizard, in 
EXCEL, is used to form the graph shown in Fig. 1-6. The function is called a quadratic function. The roots (points 
where the graph cuts the x axis) of this quadratic function are at X = 3 and one is between -2 and -1. Clicking the 
chart wizard in EXCEL shows the many different charts that can be formed using EXCEL. Notice that the graph for 
this quadratic function goes off to positive infinity as X gets larger positive as well as larger negative. Also note that 
the graph has its lowest value when X is between 0 and 1.

SOLUTION
(a) Multiply the first equation by 7:
21a - 14b =   77
(1)
Multiply the second equation by 2:
10a + 14b =   78
(2)
Add:
31a        = 155
Divide by 31:
a  = 5
	
Note that by multiplying each of the given equations by suitable numbers, we are able to write two equivalent 
equations, (1) and (2), in which the coefficients of the unknown b are numerically equal. Then by addition we are 
able to eliminate the unknown b and thus find a.
	
Substitute a = 5 in the first equation: 3(5) - 2b = 11, -2b = -4, and b = 2. Thus a = 5 and b = 2.
	
Check: 3(5) - 2(2) = 11, 15 - 4 = 11, and 11 = 11; 5(5) + 7(2) = 39, 25 + 14 = 39, and 39 = 39.
(b) Multiply the first equation by 3:
15X + 42Y = 234
(3)
Mutiply the second equation by -14:
-98X - 42Y =   98
(4)
Add:
-83X        = 332
Divide by -83:
X   = -4
	
Substitute X = -4 in the first equation: 5(-4) + 14Y = 78, 14Y = 98, and Y = 7.
	
Thus X = -4 and Y = 7.
	
Check: 5(-4) + 14(7) = 78, -20 + 98 = 78, and 78 = 78; 7(-4) + 3(7) = -7, -28 + 21 = -7, and -7 = -7.
(c) Multiply the first equation by 2:
6a +   4b + 10c =   30
Multiply the second equation by -5:
-35a + 15b - 10c = -260
Add:
-29a + 19b 	
= -230
(5)
Multiply the second equation by 2:
14a - 6b + 4c = 104
Repeat the third equation:
5a +   b - 4c =   2
Add:
19a - 5b     = 106
(6)
	
We have thus eliminated c and are left with two equations, (5) and (6), to be solved simultaneously for a and b.
Multiply equation (5) by 5:
-145a + 95b = -1150
Multiply equation (6) by 19:
361a - 95b =    2014
Add:
216a =    864
Divide by 216:
             a = 4
	
Substituting a = 4 in equation (5) or (6), we find that b = -6.
	
Substituting a = 4 and b = -6 in any of the given equations, we obtain c = 3.
	
Thus a = 4, b = -6, and c = 3.
	
Check: 3(4) + 2(-6) + 5(3) = 15, and 15 = 15; 7(4) - 3(-6) + 2(3) = 52, and 52 = 52; 5(4) + (-6) -4(3) = 2, 
and 2 = 2.

CHAPTER 2
RAW DATA
Raw data are collected data that have not been organized numerically. An example is the set of heights of 100 
male students obtained from an alphabetical listing of university records.
ARRAYS
An array is an arrangement of raw numerical data in ascending or descending order of magnitude. The difference 
between the largest and smallest numbers is called the range of the data. For example, if the largest height of 100 
male students is 74 inches (in) and the smallest height is 60 in, the range is 74 - 60 = 14 in.
FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS
When summarizing large masses of raw data, it is often useful to distribute the data into classes, or categories, 
and to determine the number of individuals belonging to each class, called the class frequency. A tabular arrange­
ment of data by classes together with the corresponding class frequencies is called a frequency distribution, or 
frequency table. Table 2.1 is a frequency distribution of heights (recorded 
to the nearest inch) of 100 male students at XYZ University.
The first class (or category), for example, consists of heights from 60 to 
62 in and is indicated by the range symbol 60–62. Since five students have 
heights belonging to this class, the corresponding class frequency is 5.
Data organized and summarized as in the above frequency distribu­
tion are often called grouped data. Although the grouping process gen­
erally destroys much of the original detail of the data, an important 
advantage is gained in the clear “overall” picture that is obtained and in 
the vital relationships that are thereby made evident.
CLASS INTERVALS AND CLASS LIMITS
A symbol defining a class, such as 60–62 in Table 2.1, is called a class interval. The end numbers, 60 and 62, are 
called class limits; the smaller number (60) is the lower class limit, and the larger number (62) is the upper class 
limit. The terms class and class interval are often used interchangeably, although the class interval is actually a 
symbol for the class.
A class interval that, at least theoretically, has either no upper class limit or no lower class limit indicated is 
called an open class interval. For example, referring to age groups of individuals, the class interval “65 years and 
over” is an open class interval.
CLASS BOUNDARIES
If heights are recorded to the nearest inch, the class interval 60–62 theoretically includes all measurements from 
59.5000 to 62.5000 in. These numbers, indicated briefly by the exact numbers 59.5 and 62.5, are called class

boundaries, or true class limits; the smaller number (59.5) is the lower class boundary, and the larger number 
(62.5) is the upper class boundary.
In practice, the class boundaries are obtained by adding the upper limit of one class interval to the lower 
limit of the next-higher class interval and dividing by 2.
Sometimes, class boundaries are used to symbolize classes. For example, the various classes in the first 
column of Table 2.1 could be indicated by 59.5–62.5, 62.5–65.5, etc. To avoid ambiguity in using such notation, 
class boundaries should not coincide with actual observations. Thus if an observation were 62.5, it would not be 
possible to decide whether it belonged to the class interval 59.5–62.5 or 62.5–65.5.
THE SIZE, OR WIDTH, OF A CLASS INTERVAL
The size, or width, of a class interval is the difference between the lower and upper class boundaries and is also 
referred to as the class width, class size, or class length. If all class intervals of a frequency distribution have 
equal widths, this common width is denoted by c. In such case c is equal to the difference between two successive 
lower class limits or two successive upper class limits. For the data of Table 2.1, for example, the class interval 
is c = 62.5 - 59.5 = 65.5 - 62.5 = 3.
THE CLASS MARK
The class mark is the midpoint of the class interval and is obtained by adding the lower and upper class limits 
and dividing by 2. Thus the class mark of the interval 60–62 is (60 + 62)/2 = 61. The class mark is also called the 
class midpoint.
For purposes of further mathematical analysis, all observations belonging to a given class interval are assumed 
to coincide with the class mark. Thus all heights in the class interval 60–62 in are considered to be 61 in.
GENERAL RULES FOR FORMING FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS
1.	 Determine the largest and smallest numbers in the raw data and thus find the range (the difference between 
the largest and smallest numbers).
2.	 Divide the range into a convenient number of class intervals having the same size. If this is not feasible, use class 
intervals of different sizes or open class intervals (see Problem 2.12). The number of class intervals is usually 
between 5 and 20, depending on the data. Class intervals are also chosen so that the class marks (or midpoints) 
coincide with the actually observed data. This tends to lessen the so-called grouping error involved in further 
mathematical analysis. However, the class boundaries should not coincide with the actually observed data.
3.	 Determine the number of observations falling into each class interval; that is, find the class frequencies. This 
is best done by using a tally, or score sheet (see Problem 2.8).
HISTOGRAMS AND FREQUENCY POLYGONS
Histograms and frequency polygons are two graphic representations of frequency distributions.
1.	 A histogram or frequency histogram, consists of a set of rectangles having (a) bases on a horizontal axis (the 
X axis), with centers at the class marks and lengths equal to the class interval sizes, and (b) areas proportional 
to the class frequencies. It is one of the oldest constructs in use which shows distributions.
2.	 A frequency polygon is a line graph of the class frequencies plotted against class marks. It can be obtained by 
connecting the midpoints of the tops of the rectangles in the histogram. This information is represented 
graphically in Fig. 2-9.
The histogram and frequency polygon corresponding to the frequency distribution of heights in Table 2.1 are 
shown in Figs. 2-1 and 2-2.
Notice in Fig. 2-2 how the frequency polygon is tied down at the ends, that is, at 58 and 76.
3.	 Figure 2-2 is the MINITAB worksheet with the data from Table 2.2 in column c1. This data can either be 
entered directly from the keyboard or read from a file called iphone.xlsx. The pull down Graph ª Histogram 
gives a dialog box in which a simple histogram is chosen. In the simple histogram dialog box, it is requested 
that a histogram for the variable iPhone hours be prepared The result is shown in Fig 2 3

The histogram shows the researcher how the data is distributed. In this case, iPhone hours has a distribution 
we call the normal distribution. Most of the data is near the middle. There are a few values that are down in the 
10 and 11 range and a few that are up near the 22 and 23 range. Most of the data is concentrated in the middle 
between 13 and 21 hours per week.
DOT PLOTS AND BOX PLOTS
Another graphical picture called a dot plot is constructed using the software package MINITAB. Dot plots place 
dots atop numerical values that are placed along a horizontal axis. They are particularly useful with small data 
sets. The pull down Graph ª Dot plot gives the graph shown in Fig. 2-4. The “iPhone hours” values are plotted 
along the horizontal axis and dots are plotted above the numbers on the horizontal axis. The dot plot shows that 
most of the “iPhone hours” values are between 12 and 20 with the minimum value being 10.4 and the maximum 
value being 22.9. Another dot plot, made with STATISTIX, can be found in Fig. 2-5.

Figure 2-6 gives a box plot for the data in Table 2.2. The pull down Graph ª Box plot gives the graph 
shown in Fig. 2-6.
In its simplest form, a box plot shows a box which contains the middle 50% of the data values. It also shows 
two whiskers that extend from the box to the maximum value and from the box to the minimum value. In Fig. 2-6, 
the box extends from a number between 15 and 16 to a number between 18 and 19. The whiskers extend from a 
number a little larger than 10 to the box and from the box to a number a little less than 23. We shall have more to 
say about box plots as the text develops.
Figure 2-7 shows the worksheet for the software package SPSS containing the iPhone data.
Figure 2-8 gives an SPSS-created box plot. The pull down Graph ª Box plot is used to create the box plot 
in SPSS. The box plot gives a box that covers the middle 50% of the data. The box in Fig. 2.8 extends from 15.5 
to 18.8. The whiskers extend to 10.4 on one end of the box and to 22.9 on the other end. If the data has a bell-
shaped histogram, it will have a box plot like that shown in Fig. 2-8. The median of the data is shown by the 

heavy line in the middle of the box and will divide the box in half. Half of the data will be below the middle line 
and half will be above the middle line. The two whiskers will be roughly equal in length for a normal distribution. 
All of the statistical software given in this section reveals a set of data that is distributed symmetrically. A 
few values are low and a few are high but most are in the center of the distribution. Such a distribution is said to 
have a normal or bell-shaped distribution. Statistical graphics help the researcher form some idea of the charac­
teristic with which they are dealing. How variable is it? What type of distribution does it have? Are there some 
extreme values that occur? In all the spreadsheets shown, the data may be entered directly by the researcher or it 
may be read from a file. 
The histogram, dot plot, box plot, and stem-and-leaf plot are used with quantitative data. Quantitative 
research data is obtained from measuring. Qualitative research data gives classes or categories for your data 
values. If your data is qualitative, other techniques are used to graphically display your data.
RELATIVE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS
The relative frequency of a class is the frequency of the class divided by the total frequency of all classes and is gen­
erally expressed as a percentage. For example, the relative frequency of the class 66–68 in Table 2.1 is 42/100 = 42%. 
The sum of the relative frequencies of all classes is clearly 1, or 100%.
If the frequencies in Table 2.1 are replaced with the corresponding relative frequencies, the resulting table is 
called a relative-frequency distribution, percentage distribution, or relative-frequency table.
Graphic representation of relative-frequency distributions can be obtained from the histogram or frequency 
polygon simply by changing the vertical scale from frequency to relative frequency, keeping exactly the same 
diagram. The resulting graphs are called relative-frequency histograms (or percentage histograms) and relative-
frequency polygons (or percentage polygons), respectively.
CUMULATIVE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS AND OGIVES
The total frequency of all values less than the upper class boundary of a given class interval is called the cumu­
lative frequency up to and including that class interval. For example, the cumulative frequency up to and includ­
ing the class interval 66–68 in Table 2.1 is 5 + 18 + 42 = 65, signifying that 65 students have heights less than 
68.5 in.
A table presenting such cumulative frequencies is called a cumulative-frequency distribution, cumulative-
frequency table, or briefly a cumulative distribution and is shown in Table 2.3 for the student height distribution 
of Table 2.1. This information is also represented graphically in Fig. 2-9.
A graph showing the cumulative frequency less than any upper class boundary plotted against the upper 
class boundary is called a cumulative frequency polygon or ogive For some purposes it is desirable to consider

interval. Because in this case we consider heights of 59.5 in or more, 62.5 in or more, etc., this is sometimes 
called an “or more” cumulative distribution, while the one considered above is a “less than” cumulative distri­
bution. One is easily obtained from the other. The corresponding ogives are then called “or more” and “less 
than” ogives. Whenever we refer to cumulative distributions or ogives without qualification, the “less than” 
type is implied.
RELATIVE CUMULATIVE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS AND PERCENTAGE OGIVES
The relative cumulative frequency, or percentage cumulative frequency, is the cumulative frequency divided by 
the total frequency. For example, the relative cumulative frequency of heights less than 68.5 in is 65/100 = 65%, 
signifying that 65% of the students have heights less than 68.5 in. If the relative cumulative frequencies are used 
in Table 2.3, in place of cumulative frequencies, the results are called relative cumulative-frequency distributions 
(or percentage cumulative distributions) and relative cumulative-frequency polygons (or percentage ogives), 
respectively.
FREQUENCY CURVES AND SMOOTHED OGIVES
Collected data can usually be considered as belonging to a sample drawn from a large population. Since so many 
observations are available in the population, it is theoretically possible (for continuous data) to choose class 
intervals very small and still have sizable numbers of observations falling within each class. Thus one would 
expect the frequency polygon or relative-frequency polygon for a large population to have so many small, broken 
line segments that they closely approximate curves, which we call frequency curves or relative-frequency curves, 
respectively.
It is reasonable to expect that such theoretical curves can be approximated by smoothing the frequency 
polygons or relative-frequency polygons of the sample, the approximation improving as the sample size is 
increased. For this reason, a frequency curve is sometimes called a smoothed frequency polygon.
In a similar manner, smoothed ogives are obtained by smoothing the cumulative-frequency polygons, or 
ogives. It is usually easier to smooth an ogive than a frequency polygon.
TYPES OF FREQUENCY CURVES
Frequency curves arising in practice take on certain characteristic shapes, as shown in Fig. 2-10.
1.	 Symmetrical or bell-shaped curves are characterized by the fact that observations equidistant from the central 
maximum have the same frequency. Adult male and adult female heights have bell-shaped distributions.
2.	 Curves that have tails to the left are said to be skewed to the left. The lifetimes of males and females are 
skewed to the left A few die early in life but most live between 60 and 80 years Generally females live about

3.	 Curves that have tails to the right are said to be skewed to the right. The ages at the time of marriage of brides 
and grooms are skewed to the right. Most marry in their twenties and thirties but a few marry in their forties, 
fifties, sixties, and seventies.
4.	 Curves that have approximately equal frequencies across their values are said to be uniformly distributed. 
Certain machines that dispense liquid colas do so uniformly between 15.9 and 16.1 ounces, for example.
5.	 In a J-shaped or reverse J-shaped frequency curve the maximum occurs at one end or the other.
6.	 A U-shaped frequency distribution curve has maxima at both ends and a minimum in between.
7.	 A bimodal frequency curve has two maxima.
8.	 A multimodal frequency curve has more than two maxima.

SOLUTION
Some of these questions are so detailed that they are best answered by first constructing an array. This can be done by 
subdividing the data into convenient classes and placing each number taken from the table into the appropriate class, 
as in Table 2.4, called an entry table. By then arranging the numbers of each class into an array, as in Table 2.5, the 
required array is obtained. From Table 2.5 it is relatively easy to answer the above questions.

If the class marks in a frequency distribution of the weights of students are 128, 137, 146, 155, 164, 173, 
and 182 pounds (lb), find (a) the class-interval size, (b) the class boundaries, and (c) the class limits, 
assuming that the weights were measured to the nearest pound.

SOLUTION
(a)	 Class-interval size = common difference between successive class marks = 137 - 128 = 146 - 137 = etc. = 9 lb.
(b)	 Since the class intervals all have equal size, the class boundaries are midway between the class marks and thus 
have the values

  or  132.5, 141.5, 150.5, . . . , 177.5 lb
The first class boundary is 132.5 - 9 = 123.5 and the last class boundary is 177.5 + 9 = 186.5, since the common class-
interval size is 9 lb. Thus all the class boundaries are given by
123.5; 132; 141.5; 150.5; 159.5; 168.5; 177.5; 186.5 1b
(c)	 Since the class limits are integers, we choose them as the integers nearest to the class boundaries, namely, 123, 
124, 132, 133, 141, 142, . . . Thus the first class has limits 124–132, the next 133–141, etc.

(b)	 What percent spent more than 10 hours per week on a cell phone?
SOLUTION
(a)	 The cumulative percent for 15 hours is 78%. Thus 78% spent 15 hours or less on a cell phone per week.
(b)	 The cumulative percent for 10 hours is 58%. Thus 58% spent 10 hours or less on a cell phone per week. Therefore, 
42% spent more than 10 hours on a cell phone per week.

of these measurements.

Note that the lower limit in each first class could have been different from 5.10; for example, if in column I we 
had started with 5.15 as the lower limit, the first class interval could have been written 5.15–5.34.
(b)	 The class boundaries corresponding to columns I, II, and III of part (a) are given, respectively, by

5.095–5.495, 5.495–5.895, 5.895–6.295, . . . , 7.095–7.495
	
Note that these class boundaries are suitable since they cannot coincide with the observed measurements.
(c)	 The class marks corresponding to columns I, II, and III of part (a) are given, respectively, by
I  5.195, 5.395, . . . , 7.395    II  5.245, 5.545, . . . , 7.345    III  5.295, 5.695, . . . , 7.295
	
These class marks have the disadvantage of not coinciding with the observed measurements.
2.7	
In answering Problem 2.6(a), a student chose the class intervals 5.10–5.40, 5.40–5.70, . . . , 6.90–7.20, and 
7.20–7.50. Was there anything wrong with this choice?
SOLUTION
These class intervals overlap at 5.40, 5.70, . . . , 7.20. Thus a measurement recorded as 5.40, for example, could be 
placed in either of the first two class intervals. Some statisticians justify this choice by agreeing to place half of such 
ambiguous cases in one class and half in the other.
	
The ambiguity is removed by writing the class intervals as 5.10 to under 5.40, 5.40 to under 5.70, etc. In this case, 
the class limits coincide with the class boundaries, and the class marks can coincide with the observed data.
	
In general it is desirable to avoid overlapping class intervals whenever possible and to choose them so that the 
class boundaries are values not coinciding with actual observed data. For example, the class intervals for Problem 2.6 
could have been chosen as 5.095–5.395, 5.395–5.695, etc., without ambiguity. A disadvantage of this particular choice 
is that the class marks do not coincide with the observed data.

SOLUTION
The largest weight is 176 lb and the smallest weight is 119 lb, so that the range is 176 - 119 = 57 lb. If five class 

	
One convenient choice for the class-interval size is 5 lb. Also, it is convenient to choose the class marks as 120, 
125, 130, 135, . . . lb. Thus the class intervals can be taken as 118–122, 123–127, 128–132, . . . With this choice the 
class boundaries are 117.5, 122.5, 127.5, . . . , which do not coincide with the observed data.
	
The required frequency distribution is shown in Table 2.7. The center column, called a tally, or score sheet, is used 
to tabulate the class frequencies from the raw data and is usually omitted in the final presentation of the frequency 
distribution. It is unnecessary to make an array, although if it is available it can be used in tabulating the frequencies.

2.12	 At the P&R Company (Problem 2.3), five new employees were hired at weekly wages of $285.34, $316.83, 
$335.78, $356.21, and $374.50. Construct a frequency distribution of wages for the 70 employees.
SOLUTION
Possible frequency distributions are shown in Table 2.10.
	
In Table 2.10(a), the same class-interval size, $10.00, has been maintained throughout the table. As a result, there 
are too many empty classes and the detail is much too fine at the upper end of the wage scale.
	
In Table 2.10(b), empty classes and fine detail have been avoided by use of the open class interval “$320.00 and 
over.” A disadvantage of this is that the table becomes useless in performing certain mathematical calculations. For 
example, it is impossible to determine the total amount of wages paid per week, since “over $320.00” might conceiv­
ably imply that individuals could earn as high as $1400.00 per week.
	
In Table 2.10(c), a class-interval size of $20.00 has been used. A disadvantage is that much information is lost at 
the lower end of the wage scale and the detail is still fine at the upper end of the scale.
	
In Table 2.10(d ), unequal class-interval sizes have been used. A disadvantage is that certain mathematical calcula­
tions to be made later lose a simplicity that is available when class intervals have the same size. Also, the larger the 
class-interval size, the greater will be the grouping error.

Cumulative-Frequency Distributions and Ogives
2.14	 Construct (a) a cumulative-frequency distribution, (b) a percentage cumulative distribution, (c) an ogive, 
and (d ) a percentage ogive from the frequency distribution in Table 2.6 of Problem 2.3.
SOLUTION
(a) and (b)  The cumulative-frequency distribution and percentage cumulative distribution (or cumulative relative-
frequency distribution) are shown in Table 2.11.
	
Note that each entry in column 2 is obtained by adding successive entries from column 2 of Table 2.6, thus, 
18 = 8 + 10, 34 = 8 + 10 + 16, etc.
	
Each entry in column 3 is obtained from the previous column by dividing by 65, the total frequency, and express­
ing the result as a percentage. Thus, 34 65
52.3%
=
. Entries in this column can also be obtained by adding successive 
entries from column 2 of Table 2.9. Thus, 27.7 = 12.3 + 15.4, 52.3 = 12.3 + 15.4 + 24.6, etc.
	
(c) and (d )  The ogive (or cumulative-frequency polygon) is shown in Fig. 2-16(a) and the percentage ogive 
(relative cumulative-frequency polygon) is shown in Fig 2-16(b) Both of these are MINITAB-generated plots

2.15	 From the frequency distribution in Table 2.6 of Problem 2.3, construct (a) an “or more” cumulative-
frequency distribution and (b) an “or more” ogive.
SOLUTION
(a)	 Note that each entry in column 2 of Table 2.12 is obtained by adding successive entries from column 2 of 
Table 2.6, starting at the bottom of Table 2.6; thus 7 = 2 + 5, 17 = 2 + 5 + 10, etc. These entries can also be obtained 
by subtracting each entry in column 2 of Table 2.11 from the total frequency, 65; thus 57 = 65 - 8, 47 = 65 - 18, etc.
(b)	 Figure 2-17 shows the “or more” ogive.

2.16	 From the ogives in Figs. 2-16 and 2-17 (of Problems 2.14 and 2.15, respectively), estimate the number of 
employees earning (a) less than $288.00 per week, (b) $296.00 or more per week, and (c) at least $263.00 
per week but less than $275.00 per week.
SOLUTION
(a)	 Referring to the “less than” ogive of Fig. 2-16, construct a vertical line intersecting the “Wages” axis at $288.00. This 
line meets the ogive at the point with coordinates (288, 45); hence 45 employees earn less than $288.00 per week.
(b)	 In the “or more” ogive of Fig. 2-17, construct a vertical line at $296.00. This line meets the ogive at the point 
(296, 11); hence 11 employees earn $296.00 or more per week.
	
    This can also be obtained from the “less than” ogive of Fig. 2-16. By constructing a line at $296.00, we find that 
54 employees earn less than $296.00 per week; hence 65 - 54 = 11 employees earn $296.00 or more per week.
(c)	 Using the “less than” ogive of Fig. 2-16, we have: Required number of employees = number earning less than 
$275.00 per week - number earning less than $263.00 per week = 26 - 11 = 15.
Note that the above results could just as well have been obtained by the process of interpolation in the cumulative-
frequency tables. In part (a), for example, since $288.00 is 8/10, or 4/5, of the way between $280.00 and $290.00, the 
required number of employees should be 4/5 of the way between the corresponding values 34 and 48 (see Table 2.11). 
But 4/5 of the way between 34 and 48 is (48

. Thus the required number of employees is 34 + 11 = 45.
2.17	 Five pennies were tossed 1000 times, and at each toss the number of heads was observed. The number of 
tosses during which 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 heads were obtained is shown in Table 2.13.

(a)	 Graph the data of Table 2.13.
(b)	 Construct a table showing the percentage of tosses resulting in a number of heads less than 0, 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, or 6.
(c)	 Graph the data of the table in part (b).
SOLUTION
(a)	 The data can be shown graphically either as in Fig. 2-18 or as in Fig. 2-19.

	
    Figure 2-18 seems to be a more natural graph to use—since, for example, the number of heads cannot be 1.5 
or 3.2. The graph is called a dot plot. It is especially used when the data are discrete.
	
    Figure 2-19 shows a histogram of the data. Note that the total area of the histogram is the total frequency 1000, 
as it should be. In using the histogram representation or the corresponding frequency polygon, we are essentially 
treating the data as if they were continuous. This will later be found useful. Note that we have already used the 
histogram and frequency polygon for discrete data in Problem 2.10.
(b)	 Referring to the required Table 2.14, note that it shows simply a cumulative-frequency distribution and percent­
age cumulative distribution of the number of heads. It should be observed that the entries “Less than 1,” “Less 
than 2,” etc., could just as well have been “Less than or equal to 0,” “Less than or equal to 1,” etc.

    Figure 2-20 is the most natural for presenting discrete data—since, for example, the percentage of tosses in 
which there will be less than 2 heads is equal to the percentage in which there will be less than 1.75, 1.56, or 1.23 
heads, so that the same percentage (18.2%) should be shown for these values (indicated by the horizontal line).
	
    Figure 2-21 shows the cumulative-frequency polygon, or ogive, for the data and essentially treats the data as 
if they were continuous.
	
    Note that Figs. 2-20 and 2-21 correspond, respectively, to Figs. 2-18 and 2-19 of part (a).
Frequency Curves and Smoothed Ogives
2.18	 Samples from populations have histograms and frequency polygons that have certain shapes. If the samples 
are extremely large, the histograms and frequency polygons approach the frequency distribution of the 
population. Consider two such population frequency distributions. (a) Consider a machine that fills cola 
containers uniformly between 15.9 and 16.1 ounces. Construct the frequency curve and determine what 
percent put more than 15.95 ounces in the containers. (b) Consider the heights of females. They have a 
population frequency distribution that is symmetrical or bell shaped with an average equal to 65 in and stan­
dard deviation equal to 3 in. (Standard deviation is discussed in a later chapter.) What percent of the heights 
are between 62 and 68 in tall, that are within one standard deviation of the mean? What percent are within 
two standard deviations of the mean? What percent are within three standard deviations of the mean?
SOLUTION
Figure 2-22 shows a uniform frequency curve. The cross-hatched region corresponds to fills of more than 15.95 ounces. 
Note that the region covered by the frequency curve is shaped as a rectangle. The area under the frequency curve is

length × width or (16.10 - 15.90) × 5 = 1. The area of the cross-hatched region is (16.10 - 15.90) × 5 = 0.75. This is 
interpreted to mean that 75% of the machine fills exceed 15.95 ounces.
	
Figure 2-23 shows a symmetrical or bell-shaped frequency curve. It shows the heights within one standard 
deviation as the cross-hatched region. Calculus is used to find this area. The area within one standard deviation is 
approximately 68% of the total area under the curve. The area within two standard deviations is approximately 95% 
of the total area under the curve. The area within three standard deviations is approximately 99.7% of the total area 
under the curve.
	
We shall have more to say about finding areas under these curves in later chapters.

The Mean, Median, Mode, 
and Other Measures
of Central Tendency
INDEX, OR SUBSCRIPT, NOTATION
Let the symbol Xj (read ‘‘X sub j’’) denote any of the N values X1, X2, X3, . . . , XN assumed by a
variable X. The letter j in Xj, which can stand for any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , N is called a subscript,
or index. Clearly any letter other than j, such as i, k, p, q, or s, could have been used as well.
SUMMATION NOTATION
The symbol PN
j¼1 Xj is used to denote the sum of all the Xj’s from j ¼ 1 to j ¼ N; by deﬁnition,
X
N
j¼1
Xj ¼ X1 þ X2 þ X3 þ    þ XN
When no confusion can result, we often denote this sum simply by P X, P Xj, or P
j Xj. The symbol P
is the Greek capital letter sigma, denoting sum.

AVERAGES, OR MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY
An average is a value that is typical, or representative, of a set of data. Since such typical values tend
to lie centrally within a set of data arranged according to magnitude, averages are also called measures of
central tendency.
Several types of averages can be deﬁned, the most common being the arithmetic mean, the median,
the mode, the geometric mean, and the harmonic mean. Each has advantages and disadvantages, depend-
ing on the data and the intended purpose.
THE ARITHMETIC MEAN
The arithmetic mean, or brieﬂy the mean, of a set of N numbers X1, X2, X3, . . . , XN is denoted by X
(read ‘‘X bar’’) and is deﬁned as
X ¼ X1 þ X2 þ X3 þ    þ XN
N

EXAMPLE 4.

X ¼ 8 þ 3 þ 5 þ 12 þ 10
5
¼ 38
5 ¼ 7:6
If the numbers X1, X2, . . . , XK occur f1, f2, . . . , fK times, respectively (i.e., occur with frequencies
f1, f2, . . . , fK), the arithmetic mean is
X ¼ f1X1 þ f2X2 þ    þ fKXK

where N ¼ P f is the total frequency (i.e., the total number of cases).
EXAMPLE 5.
If 5, 8, 6, and 2 occur with frequencies 3, 2, 4, and 1, respectively, the arithmetic mean is
X ¼ ð3Þð5Þ þ ð2Þð8Þ þ ð4Þð6Þ þ ð1Þð2Þ
3 þ 2 þ 4 þ 1
¼ 15 þ 16 þ 24 þ 2
10
¼ 5:7
THE WEIGHTED ARITHMETIC MEAN
Sometimes we associate with the numbers X1, X2, . . . , XK certain weighting factors (or weights)
w1, w2, . . . , wK, depending on the signiﬁcance or importance attached to the numbers. In this case,
X ¼ w1X1 þ w2X2 þ    þ wKXk
w1 þ w2 þ    þ wK
¼
P wX
P w
ð3Þ
is called the weighted arithmetic mean. Note the similarity to equation (2), which can be considered a
weighted arithmetic mean with weights f1, f2, . . . , fK.
EXAMPLE 6.
If a ﬁnal examination in a course is weighted 3 times as much as a quiz and a student has a ﬁnal
examination grade of 85 and quiz grades of 70 and 90, the mean grade is
X ¼ ð1Þð70Þ þ ð1Þð90Þ þ ð3Þð85Þ
1 þ 1 þ 3
¼ 415
5 ¼ 83

PROPERTIES OF THE ARITHMETIC MEAN
1.
The algebraic sum of the deviations of a set of numbers from their arithmetic mean is zero.
EXAMPLE 7.
The deviations of the numbers 8, 3, 5, 12, and 10 from their arithmetic mean 7.6 are 8  7:6, 3  7:6,
5  7:6, 12  7:6, and 10  7:6, or 0.4, 4:6, 2:6, 4.4, and 2.4, with algebraic sum 0:4  4:6  2:6 þ 4:4 þ 2:4 ¼ 0.
2.
The sum of the squares of the deviations of a set of numbers Xj from any number a is a minimum if
and only if a ¼ X (see Problem 4.27).
3.
If f1 numbers have mean m1, f2 numbers have mean m2, . . . , fK numbers have mean mK, then the
mean of all the numbers is
X ¼ f1m1 þ f2m2 þ    þ fKmK
f1 þ f2 þ    þ fK
ð4Þ
that is, a weighted arithmetic mean of all the means (see Problem 3.12).
4.
If A is any guessed or assumed arithmetic mean (which may be any number) and if dj ¼ Xj  A are the
deviations of Xj from A, then equations (1) and (2) become, respectively,
X ¼ A þ
X
N

ð5Þ
X ¼ A þ

ð6Þ
where N ¼ PK
j¼1 fj ¼ P f . Note that formulas (5) and (6) are summarized in the equation
X ¼ A þ d (see Problem 3.18).
THE ARITHMETIC MEAN COMPUTED FROM GROUPED DATA
When data are presented in a frequency distribution, all values falling within a given class interval
are considerd to be coincident with the class mark, or midpoint, of the interval. Formulas (2) and (6) are
valid for such grouped data if we interpret Xj as the class mark, fj as its corresponding class frequency, A
as any guessed or assumed class mark, and dj ¼ Xj  A as the deviations of Xj from A.
Computations using formulas (2) and (6) are sometimes called the long and short methods, respec-
tively (see Problems 3.15 and 3.20).
If class intervals all have equal size c, the deviations dj ¼ Xj  A can all be expressed as cuj, where uj
can be positive or negative integers or zero (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .), and formula (6) becomes

which is equivalent to the equation X ¼ A þ cu (see Problem 3.21). This is called the coding method for
computing the mean. It is a very short method and should always be used for grouped data where the
class-interval sizes are equal (see Problems 3.22 and 3.23). Note that in the coding method the values of
the variable X are transformed into the values of the variable u according to X ¼ A þ cu.

THE MEDIAN
The median of a set of numbers arranged in order of magnitude (i.e., in an array) is either the middle
value or the arithmetic mean of the two middle values.
EXAMPLE 8.
The set of numbers 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 8, 8, and 10 has median 6.
EXAMPLE 9.
The set of numbers 5, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, and 18 has median 1
2 ð9 þ 11Þ ¼ 10.
For grouped data, the median, obtained by interpolation, is given by
Median ¼ L1 þ
N
2  ðP f Þ1
fmedian
0
B
@
1
C
Ac
ð8Þ
where
L1 ¼ lower class boundary of the median class (i.e., the class containing the median)
N ¼ number of items in the data (i.e., total frequency)
ðP f Þ1 ¼ sum of frequencies of all classes lower than the median class
fmedian ¼ frequency of the median class
c ¼ size of the median class interval
Geometrically the median is the value of X (abscissa) corresponding to the vertical line which divides
a histogram into two parts having equal areas. This value of X is sometimes denoted by ~X.
THE MODE
The mode of a set of numbers is that value which occurs with the greatest frequency; that is, it is the
most common value. The mode may not exist, and even if it does exist it may not be unique.
EXAMPLE 10.
The set 2, 2, 5, 7, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, and 18 has mode 9.
EXAMPLE 11.
The set 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 16 has no mode.
EXAMPLE 12.
The set 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, and 9 has two modes, 4 and 7, and is called bimodal.
A distribution having only one mode is called unimodal.
In the case of grouped data where a frequency curve has been constructed to ﬁt the data, the mode
will be the value (or values) of X corresponding to the maximum point (or points) on the curve.
This value of X is sometimes denoted by ^X.
From a frequency distribution or histogram the mode can be obtained from the formula
Mode ¼ L1 þ
1
1 þ 2


c
ð9Þ
where
L1 ¼ lower class boundary of the modal class (i.e., the class containing the mode)
1 ¼ excess of modal frequency over frequency of next-lower class
2 ¼ excess of modal frequency over frequency of next-higher class
c ¼ size of the modal class interval
THE EMPIRICAL RELATION BETWEEN THE MEAN, MEDIAN, AND MODE
For unimodal frequency curves that are moderately skewed (asymmetrical), we have the empirical
relation
Mean  mode ¼ 3ðmean  medianÞ
ð10Þ

Figures 3-1 and 3-2 show the relative positions of the mean, median, and mode for frequency curves
skewed to the right and left, respectively. For symmetrical curves, the mean, mode, and median all
coincide.
THE GEOMETRIC MEAN G
The geometric mean G of a set of N positive numbers X1, X2, X3, . . . , XN is the Nth root of the
product of the numbers:
G ¼ N ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

EXAMPLE 13.

ð2Þð4Þð8Þ
p

64
p
¼ 4.
We can compute G by logarithms (see Problem 3.35) or by using a calculator. For the geometric
mean from grouped data, see Problems 3.36 and 3.91.
THE HARMONIC MEAN H
The harmonic mean H of a set of N numbers X1, X2, X3, . . . , XN is the reciprocal of the arithmetic
mean of the reciprocals of the numbers:
H ¼

For the harmonic mean from grouped data, see Problems 3.99 and 3.100.
THE RELATION BETWEEN THE ARITHMETIC, GEOMETRIC, AND HARMONIC MEANS
The geometric mean of a set of positive numbers X1, X2, . . . , XN is less than or equal to their
arithmetic mean but is greater than or equal to their harmonic mean. In symbols,
H  G  X
ð14Þ
The equality signs hold only if all the numbers X1, X2, . . . , XN are identical.
EXAMPLE 15.
The set 2, 4, 8 has arithmetic mean 4.67, geometric mean 4, and harmonic mean 3.43.
THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE
The root mean square (RMS), or quadratic mean, of a set of numbers X1, X2, . . . , XN is sometimes
denoted by

QUARTILES, DECILES, AND PERCENTILES
If a set of data is arranged in order of magnitude, the middle value (or arithmetic mean of the two
middle values) that divides the set into two equal parts is the median. By extending this idea, we can
think of those values which divide the set into four equal parts. These values, denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3,
are called the ﬁrst, second, and third quartiles, respectively, the value Q2 being equal to the median.
Similarly, the values that divide the data into 10 equal parts are called deciles and are denoted by D1,
D2, . . . , D9, while the values dividing the data into 100 equal parts are called percentiles and are denoted
by P1, P2, . . . , P99. The ﬁfth decile and the 50th percentile correspond to the median. The 25th and 75th
percentiles correspond to the ﬁrst and third quartiles, respectively.
Collectively, quartiles, deciles, percentiles, and other values obtained by equal subdivisions of
the data are called quantiles. For computations of these from grouped data, see Problems 3.44 to 3.46.

To ﬁnd the ﬁrst quartile, put the data in the ﬁrst 60 rows of column A of the EXCEL worksheet.
Then give the command ¼PERCENTILE(A1:A60,0.25). EXCEL returns the value 37.75. We ﬁnd
that 15 out of the 60 values are less than 37.75 or 25% of the scores are less than 37.75. Similarly,
we
ﬁnd
¼PERCENTILE(A1:A60,0.5)
gives
57,
¼PERCENTILE(A1:A60,0.75)
gives
76,
¼PERCENTILE(A1:A60,0.9) gives 89.2, and ¼PERCENTILE(A1:A60,0.95) gives 94.1. EXCEL
gives quartiles, deciles, and percentiles all expressed as percentiles.
An algorithm that is often used to ﬁnd quartiles, deciles, and percentiles by hand is described as
follows. The data in example 17 is ﬁrst sorted and the result is:

Suppose we wish to ﬁnd the ﬁrst quartile (25th percentile). Calculate i ¼ np/100 ¼ 60(25)/100 ¼ 15.
Since 15 is a whole number, go to the 15th and 16th numbers in the sorted array and average the 15th
and 16th numbers. That is average 37 and 38 to get 37.5 as the ﬁrst quartile (Q1 ¼ 37.5). To ﬁnd the 93rd
percentile, calculate np/100 ¼ 60(93)/100 to get 55.8. Since this number is not a whole number, always
round it up to get 56. The 56th number in the sorted array is 93 and P93 ¼ 93. The EXCEL command
¼PERCENTILE(A1:A60,0.93) gives 92.74. Note that EXCEL does not give the same values for the
percentiles, but the values are close. As the data set becomes larger, the values tend to equal each other.

The mean 10.4 hours is not typical of the times. Note that 21 of the 30 times are in the single digits, but
the mean is 10.4 hours. A great disadvantage of the mean is that it is strongly aﬀected by extreme values.

Yes, the result is the same. To prove this, suppose that f1 numbers have mean m1 and that f2 numbers
have mean m2. We must show that the mean of all the numbers is
X ¼ f1m1 þ f2m2
f1 þ f2
Let the f1 numbers add up to M1 and the f2 numbers add up to M2. Then by deﬁnition of the
arithmetic mean,
m1 ¼ M1
f1
and
m2 ¼ M2
f2
or M1 ¼ f1m1 and M2 ¼ f2m2. Since all ðf1 þ f2Þ numbers add up to ðM1 þ M2Þ, the arithmetic mean of
all numbers is
X ¼ M1 þ M2
f1 þ f2
¼ f1m1 þ f2m2
f1 þ f2
as required. The result is easily extended.
(c)
We can say that $10.75 is a ‘‘typical’’ hourly wage in the sense that most of the employees earn $10.00,
which is not too far from $10.75 per hour. It must be remembered that, whenever we summarize
numerical data into a single number (as is true in an average), we are likely to make some error.
Certainly, however, the result is not as misleading as that in Problem 3.8.
Actually, to be on safe ground, some estimate of the ‘‘spread,’’ or ‘‘variation,’’ of the data about the
mean (or other average) should be given. This is called the dispersion of the data. Various measures of
dispersion are given in Chapter 4.

If the mean annual incomes of agricultural and nonagricultural workers are $25,000 and $35,000,
respectively, would the mean annual income of both groups together be $30,000?

SOLUTION
It would be $30,000 only if the numbers of agricultural and nonagricultural workers were the same.
To determine the true mean annual income, we would have to know the relative numbers of workers in
each group. Suppose that 10% of all workers are agricultural workers. Then the mean would be
ð0:10Þð25; 000Þ þ ð0:90Þð35; 000Þ ¼ $34; 000. If there were equal numbers of both types of workers, the
mean would be ð0:50Þð25; 000Þ þ ð0:50Þð35; 000Þ ¼ $30; 000.

Use the frequency distribution of heights in Table 2.1 to ﬁnd the mean height of the 100 male
students at XYZ university.
SOLUTION
The work is outlined in Table 3.1. Note that all students having heights 60 to 62 inches (in), 63 to 65 in,
etc., are considered as having heights 61 in, 64 in, etc. The problem then reduces to ﬁnding the mean height
of 100 students if 5 students have height 61 in, 18 have height 64 in, etc.
The computations involved can become tedious, especially for cases in which the numbers are large and
many classes are present. Short techniques are available for lessening the labor in such cases; for example,
see Problems 3.20 and 3.22.

THE ARITHMETIC MEAN COMPUTED FROM GROUPED DATA

Use the method of Problem 3.18(a) to ﬁnd the arithmetic mean of the numbers 5, 8, 11, 9, 12, 6,
14, and 10, choosing as the ‘‘guessed mean’’ A the values (a) 9 and (b) 20.

SOLUTION
(a)
The deviations of the given numbers from 9 are 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 3, 5, and 1, and the sum of the
deviations is P d ¼ 4  1 þ 2 þ 0 þ 3  3 þ 5 þ 1 ¼ 3. Thus

SOLUTION
The work may be arranged as in Table 3.2. We take the guessed mean A to be the class mark 67 (which
has the largest frequency), although any class mark can be used for A. Note that the computations are
simpler than those in Problem 3.15. To shorten the labor even more, we can proceed as in Problem 3.22,
where use is made of the fact that the deviations (column 2 of Table 3.2) are all integer multiples of the
class-interval size.

SOLUTION
(a)
The result is illustrated in Table 3.2 of Problem 3.20, where it is observed that the deviations in column
2 are all multiples of the class-interval size c ¼ 3 in.
To see that the result is true in general, note that if X1, X2, X3; . . . are successive class marks, their
common diﬀerence will for this case be equal to c, so that X2 ¼ X1 þ c, X3 ¼ X1 þ 2c, and in general
Xj ¼ X1 þ ð j  1Þc. Then any two class marks Xp and Xq, for example, will diﬀer by
Xp  Xq ¼ ½X1 þ ðp  1Þc  ½X1 þ ðq  1Þc ¼ ðp  qÞc
which is a multiple of c.

The number of ATM transactions per day were recorded at 15 locations in a large city. The data
were: 35, 49, 225, 50, 30, 65, 40, 55, 52, 76, 48, 325, 47, 32, and 60. Find (a) the median number of
transactions and (b) the mean number of transactions.
SOLUTION
(a)
Arranged in order, the data are: 30, 32, 35, 40, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 55, 60, 65, 76, 225, and 325.
Since there is an odd number of items, there is only one middle value, 50, which is the required
median.
(b)
The sum of the 15 values is 1189. The mean is 1189=15 ¼ 79:267.
Note that the median is not aﬀected by the two extreme values 225 and 325, while the mean is
aﬀected by it. In this case, the median gives a better indication of the average number of daily ATM
transactions.
3.27
If (a) 85 and (b) 150 numbers are arranged in an array, how would you ﬁnd the median of the
numbers?
SOLUTION
(a)
Since there are 85 items, an odd number, there is only one middle value with 42 numbers below and 42
numbers above it. Thus the median is the 43rd number in the array.
(b)
Since there are 150 items, an even number, there are two middle values with 74 numbers below them
and 74 numbers above them. The two middle values are the 75th and 76th numbers in the array, and
their arithmetic mean is the required median.

The weights in the frequency distribution of Table 3.7 are assumed to be continuously distributed.
In such case the median is that weight for which half the total frequency (40=2 ¼ 20) lies above it and
half lies below it.
Now the sum of the ﬁrst three class frequencies is 3 þ 5 þ 9 ¼ 17. Thus to give the desired 20,
we require three more of the 12 cases in the fourth class. Since the fourth class interval, 145–153,

actually corresponds to weights 144.5 to 153.5, the median must lie 3/12 of the way between 144.5 and
153.5; that is, the median is
144:5 þ 3
12 ð153:5  144:5Þ ¼ 144:5 þ 3
12 ð9Þ ¼ 146:8 lb
Second method (using formula)
Since the sum of the ﬁrst three and ﬁrst four class frequencies are 3 þ 5 þ 9 ¼ 17 and
3 þ 5 þ 9 þ 12 ¼ 29, respectively, it is clear that the median lies in the fourth class, which is therefore
the median class. Then
L1 ¼ lower class boundary of median class ¼ 144:5
N ¼ number of items in the data ¼ 40
ðP f Þ1 ¼ sum of all classes lower than the median class ¼ 3 þ 5 þ 9 ¼ 17
fmedian ¼ frequency of median class ¼ 12

The median is the arithmetic mean of the 20th and 2lst weights in this array and is equal to 146 lb.

SOLUTION
The number of deaths range from 20 to 1710. The distribution is bimodal. The two modes are
60 and 120, both of which occur three times.
The class (7)
2
0334689 is the median class. That is, the median is
contained in this class. The median is the middle of the data or the 26th value in the ordered
array. The 24th value is 200, the 25th value is 230, and the 26th value is also 230. Therefore
the median is 230.
The sum of the 51 values is 16,660 and the mean is 16,660/51 = 326.67.

Here N ¼ 65 and N=2 ¼ 32:5. Since the sum of the ﬁrst two and ﬁrst three class frequencies
are 8 þ 10 ¼ 18 and 8 þ 10 þ 16 ¼ 34, respectively, the median class is the third class. Using the

Mean ¼ 1

3.32
Suppose you desired to ﬁnd the mode for the data in Problem 3.29. You could use frequencies
procedure of SAS to obtain the following output. By considering the output from FREQ
Procedure (Fig. 3-4), what are the modes of the alcohol-linked deaths?

SOLUTION
The data is bimodal and the modes are 60 and 120. This is seen by considering the SAS
output and noting that both 60 and 120 have a frequency of 3 which is greater than any other of
the values.
3.33
Some statistical software packages have a mode routine built in but do not return all modes in the
case that the data is multimodal. Consider the output from SPSS in Fig. 3-5.
What does SPSS do when asked to ﬁnd modes?

THE EMPIRICAL RELATION BETWEEN THE MEAN, MEDIAN, AND MODE
3.34
(a)
Use the empirical formula mean  mode ¼ 3ðmean  medianÞ to ﬁnd the modal wage of the
65 employees at the P&R Company.
(b)
Compare your result with the mode obtained in Problem 3.33.
SOLUTION
(a)
From Problems 3.23 and 3.30 we have mean ¼ $279:77 and median ¼ $279:06. Thus
Mode ¼ mean  3ðmean  medianÞ ¼ $279:77  3ð$279:77  $279:06Þ ¼ $277:64
(b)
From Problem 3.33 the modal wage is $277.50, so there is good agreement with the empirical result in
this case.
THE GEOMETRIC MEAN
3.35
Find (a) the geometric mean and (b) the arithmetic mean of the numbers 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 10, and 12.
Assume that the numbers are exact.
SOLUTION

During one year the ratio of milk prices per quart to bread prices per loaf was 3.00, whereas
during the next year the ratio was 2.00.
(a)
Find the arithmetic mean of these ratios for the 2-year period.
(b)
Find the arithmetic mean of the ratios of bread prices to milk prices for the 2-year period.
(c)
Discuss the advisability of using the arithmetic mean for averaging ratios.
(d)
Discuss the suitability of the geometric mean for averaging ratios.
SOLUTION
(a)
Mean ratio of milk to bread prices ¼ 1
2 ð3:00 þ 2:00Þ ¼ 2:50:
(b)
Since the ratio of milk to bread prices for the ﬁrst year is 3.00, the ratio of bread to milk prices
is 1=3:00 ¼ 0:333. Similarly, the ratio of bread to milk prices for the second year is 1=2:00 ¼ 0:500.
Thus
Mean ratio of bread to milk prices ¼ 1
2 ð0:333 þ 0:500Þ ¼ 0:417
(c)
We would expect the mean ratio of milk to bread prices to be the reciprocal of the mean ratio of bread
to milk prices if the mean is an appropriate average. However, 1=0:417 ¼ 2:40 6¼ 2:50. This shows that
the arithmetic mean is a poor average to use for ratios.

3.38
The bacterial count in a certain culture increased from 1000 to 4000 in 3 days. What was the
average percentage increase per day?
SOLUTION
Since an increase from 1000 to 4000 is a 300% increase, one might be led to conclude that the average
percentage increase per day would be 300%=3 ¼ 100%. This, however, would imply that during the ﬁrst day
the count went from 1000 to 2000, during the second day from 2000 to 4000, and during the third day from
4000 to 8000, which is contrary to the facts.
To determine this average percentage increase, let us denote it by r. Then
Total bacterial count after 1 day ¼ 1000 þ 1000r ¼ 1000ð1 þ rÞ
Total bacterial count after 2 days ¼ 1000ð1 þ rÞ þ 1000ð1 þ rÞr ¼ 1000ð1 þ rÞ2
Total bacterial count after 3 days ¼ 1000ð1 þ rÞ2 þ 1000ð1 þ rÞ2r ¼ 1000ð1 þ rÞ3
This last expression must equal 4000. Thus 1000ð1 þ rÞ3 ¼ 4000, ð1 þ rÞ3 ¼ 4, 1 þ r ¼ 3 ﬃﬃﬃ

, and r ¼ 3 ﬃﬃﬃ

 1 ¼

In general, if we start with a quantity P and increase it at a constant rate r per unit of time, we will have
after n units of time the amount
A ¼ Pð1 þ rÞn
This is called the compound-interest formula (see Problems 3.94 and 3.95).

During four successive years, a home owner purchased oil for her furnace at respective costs of
$0.80, $0.90, $1.05, and $1.25 per gallon (gal). What was the average cost of oil over the 4-year
period?
SOLUTION
Case 1
Suppose that the home owner purchased the same quantity of oil each year, say 1000 gal. Then
Average cost ¼
total cost
total quantity purchased ¼ $800 þ $900 þ $1050 þ $1250
4000 gal
¼ $1:00=gal
This is the same as the arithmetic mean of the costs per gallon; that is, 1
4 ð$0:80 þ $0:90 þ $1:05 þ $1:25Þ ¼
1:00/gal. This result would be the same even if x gallons were used each year.
Case 2
Suppose that the home owner spends the same amount of money each year, say $1000. Then
Average cost ¼
total cost
total quantity purchased ¼
$4000
ð1250 þ 1111 þ 952 þ 800Þgal ¼ $0:975=gal

This is the same as the harmonic mean of the costs per gallon:
4
1
0:80 þ
1
0:90 þ
1
1:05 þ
1
1:25
¼ 0:975
This result would be the same even if y dollars were spent each year.
Both averaging processes are correct, each average being computed under diﬀerent prevailing
conditions.
It should be noted that in case the number of gallons used changes from one year to another instead of
remaining the same, the ordinary arithmetic mean of Case 1 is replaced by a weighted arithmetic mean.
Similarly, if the total amount spent changes from one year to another, the ordinary harmonic mean of Case 2

geometric mean.

We are required to show that

1
2 ða2 þ b2Þ
q
>
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ab

1
2 ða2 þ b2Þ > ab, so that a2 þ b2 > 2ab, a2  2ab þ b2 > 0, or (a  bÞ2 > 0. But this last inequality is true,
since the square of any real number not equal to zero must be positive.

The proof consists in establishing the reversal of the above steps. Thus starting with ða  bÞ2 > 0, which
we know to be true, we can show that a2 þ b2 > 2ab, 1
2 ða2 þ b2Þ > ab, and ﬁnally

QUARTILES, DECILES, AND PERCENTILES
3.44
Find (a) the quartiles Q1, Q2, and Q3 and (b) the deciles D1, D2, . . . , D9 for the wages of the
65 employees at the P&R Company (see Problem 2.3).
SOLUTION
(a)
The ﬁrst quartile Q1 is that wage obtained by counting N=4 ¼ 65=4 ¼ 16:25 of the cases, beginning with
the ﬁrst (lowest) class. Since the ﬁrst class contains 8 cases, we must take 8.25 (16:25  8) of the 10 cases
from the second class. Using the method of linear interpolation, we have
Q1 ¼ $259:995 þ 8:25
10 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $268:25
The second quartile Q2 is obtained by counting the ﬁrst 2N=4 ¼ N=2 ¼ 65=2 ¼ 32:5 of the cases.
Since the ﬁrst two classes comprise 18 cases, we must take 32:5  18 ¼ 14:5 of the 16 cases from the
third class; thus
Q2 ¼ $269:995 þ 14:5
16 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $279:06
Note that Q2 is actually the median.
The third quartile Q3 is obtained by counting the ﬁrst 3N=4 ¼ 3
4 ð65Þ ¼ 48:75 of the cases.
Since the ﬁrst four classes comprise 48 cases, we must take 48:75  48 ¼ 0:75 of the 10 cases from the
ﬁfth class; thus
Q3 ¼ $289:995 þ 0:75
10 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $290:75
Hence 25% of the employees earn $268.25 or less, 50% earn $279.06 or less, and 75% earn $290.75
or less.
(b)
The ﬁrst, second, . . . , ninth deciles are obtained by counting N=10, 2N=10, . . . , 9N=10 of the cases,
beginning with the ﬁrst (lowest) class. Thus
D1 ¼ $249:995 þ 6:5
8 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $258:12
D6 ¼ $279:995 þ 5
14 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $283:57
D2 ¼ $259:995 þ 5
10 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $265:00
D7 ¼ $279:995 þ 11:5
14 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $288:21
D3 ¼ $269:995 þ 1:5
16 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $270:94
D8 ¼ $289:995 þ 4
10 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $294:00
D4 ¼ $269:995 þ 8
16 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $275:00
D9 ¼ $299:995 þ 0:5
5 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $301:00
D5 ¼ $269:995 þ 14:5
16 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $279:06
Hence 10% of the employees earn $258.12 or less, 20% earn $265.00 or less, . . . , 90% earn $301.00
or less.
Note that the ﬁfth decile is the median. The second, fourth, sixth, and eighth deciles, which divide
the distribution into ﬁve equal parts and which are called quintiles, are sometimes used in practice.

3.45
Determine (a) the 35th and (b) the 60th percentiles for the distribution in Problem 3.44.
SOLUTION
(a)
The 35th percentile, denoted by P35, is obtained by counting the ﬁrst 35N=100 ¼ 35ð65Þ=100 ¼ 22:75 of
the cases, beginning with the ﬁrst (lowest) class. Then, as in Problem 3.44,
P35 ¼ $269:995 þ 4:75
16 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $272:97
This means that 35% of the employees earn $272.97 or less.
(b)
The 60th percentile is P60 ¼ $279:995 þ 5
14 ð$10:00Þ ¼ $283:57. Note that this is the same as the sixth
decile or third quintile.

CHAPTER 4
The Standard Deviation
and Other Measures
of Dispersion
DISPERSION, OR VARIATION
The degree to which numerical data tend to spread about an average value is called the dispersion,
or variation, of the data. Various measures of this dispersion (or variation) are available, the most
common being the range, mean deviation, semi-interquartile range, 10–90 percentile range, and standard
deviation.
THE RANGE
The range of a set of numbers is the diﬀerence between the largest and smallest numbers in the set.
EXAMPLE 1.
The range of the set 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 8, 10, 12 is 12  2 ¼ 10. Sometimes the range is given by simply
quoting the smallest and largest numbers; in the above set, for instance, the range could be indicated as 2 to 12,
or 2–12.
THE MEAN DEVIATION
The mean deviation, or average deviation, of a set of N numbers X1, X2, . . . , XN is abbreviated MD
and is deﬁned by
Mean deviation ðMDÞ ¼
X
N
j¼1
jXj  Xj
N
¼
P jX  Xj
N
¼ jX  Xj
ð1Þ
where X is the arithmetic mean of the numbers and jXj  Xj is the absolute value of the deviation of Xj
from X. (The absolute value of a number is the number without the associated sign and is indicated by
two vertical lines placed around the number; thus j  4j ¼ 4, j þ 3j ¼ 3, j6j ¼ 6, and j  0:84j ¼ 0:84.)

EXAMPLE 2.
Find the mean deviation of the set 2, 3, 6, 8, 11.

If X1, X2, . . . , XK occur with frequencies f1, f2, . . . ; fK, respectively, the mean deviation can be
written as
MD ¼

j¼1
fjjXj  Xj
N
¼
P f jX  Xj
N
¼ jX  Xj
ð2Þ
where N ¼ PK
j¼1 fj ¼ P f . This form is useful for grouped data, where the Xj’s represent class marks
and the fj’s are the corresponding class frequencies.
Occasionally the mean deviation is deﬁned in terms of absolute deviations from the median or other
average instead of from the mean. An interesting property of the sum PN
j¼1 jXj  aj is that it is a
minimum when a is the median (i.e., the mean deviation about the median is a minimum).
Note that it would be more appropriate to use the terminology mean absolute deviation than mean
deviation.
THE SEMI-INTERQUARTILE RANGE
The semi-interquartile range, or quartile deviation, of a set of data is denoted by Q and is deﬁned by
Q ¼ Q3  Q1
2
ð3Þ
where Q1 and Q3 are the ﬁrst and third quartiles for the data (see Problems 4.6 and 4.7). The interquartile
range Q3  Q1 is sometimes used, but the semi-interquartile range is more common as a measure of
dispersion.
THE 10–90 PERCENTILE RANGE
The 10–90 percentile range of a set of data is deﬁned by
1090 percentile range ¼ P90  P10
ð4Þ
where P10 and P90 are the 10th and 90th percentiles for the data (see Problem 4.8). The semi-10–90
percentile range, 1
2 ðP90  P10Þ, can also be used but is not commonly employed.
THE STANDARD DEVIATION
The standard deviation of a set of N numbers X1, X2, . . . , XN is denoted by s and is deﬁned by
s ¼
X
N
j¼1
ðXj  XÞ2
N

where x represents the deviations of each of the numbers Xj from the mean X. Thus s is the root mean
square (RMS) of the deviations from the mean, or, as it is sometimes called, the root-mean-square
deviation.

If X1, X2, . . . , XK occur with frequencies f1, f2, . . . , fK, respectively, the standard deviation can be
written

where N ¼ PK
j¼1 fj ¼ P f . In this form it is useful for grouped data.
Sometimes the standard deviation of a sample’s data is deﬁned with ðN  1Þ replacing N in the
denominators of the expressions in equations (5) and (6) because the resulting value represents a better
estimate of the standard deviation of a population from which the sample is taken. For large values of N
(certainly N > 30), there is practically no diﬀerence betwen the two deﬁnitions. Also, when the better
estimate is needed we can always obtain it by multiplying the standard deviation computed according to
the ﬁrst deﬁnition by
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N=ðN  1Þ
p
. Hence we shall adhere to the form (5) and (6).
THE VARIANCE
The variance of a set of data is deﬁned as the square of the standard deviation and is thus given by s2
in equations (5) and (6).
When it is necessary to distinguish the standard deviation of a population from the standard
deviation of a sample drawn from this population, we often use the symbol s for the latter and 
(lowercase Greek sigma) for the former. Thus s2 and 2 would represent the sample variance and
population variance, respectively.

This last formula provides a very short method for computing the standard deviation and should always
be used for grouped data when the class-interval sizes are equal. It is called the coding method and
is exactly analogous to that used in Chapter 3 for computing the arithmetic mean of grouped data.
(See Problems 4.16 to 4.19.)
PROPERTIES OF THE STANDARD DEVIATION
1.
The standard deviation can be deﬁned as
s ¼
X
N
j¼1
ðXj  aÞ2
N
where a is an average besides the arithmetic mean. Of all such standard deviations, the minimum
is that for which a ¼ X, because of Property 2 in Chapter 3. This property provides an
important reason for deﬁning the standard deviation as above. For a proof of this property,
see Problem 4.27.
2.
For normal distributions (see Chapter 7), it turns out that (as shown in Fig. 4-1):
(a)
68.27% of the cases are included between X  s and X þ s (i.e., one standard deviation on
either side of the mean).
(b)
95.45% of the cases are included between X  2s and X þ 2s (i.e., two standard deviations
on either side of the mean).
(c)
99.73% of the cases are included between X  3s and X þ 3s (i.e., three standard deviations on
either side of the mean).
For moderately skewed distributions, the above percentages may hold approximately
(see Problem 4.24).
3.
Suppose that two sets consisting of N1 and N2 numbers (or two frequency distributions with
total frequencies N1 and N2) have variances given by s2
1 and s2
2, respectively, and have the same
mean X. Then the combined, or pooled, variance of both sets (or both frequency distributions)
is given by
s2 ¼ N1s2
1 þ N2s2
2
N1 þ N2
ð12Þ
Note that this is a weighted arithmetic mean of the variances. This result can be generalized to three
or more sets.
4.
Chebyshev’s theorem states that for k41, there is at least ð1  ð1=k2ÞÞ  100% of the probability
distribution for any variable within k standard deviations of the mean. In particular, when k ¼ 2,
there is at least ð1  ð1=22ÞÞ  100% or 75% of the data in the interval ðx  2S, x þ 2SÞ, when
k ¼ 3 there is at least ð1  ð1=32ÞÞ  100% or 89% of the data in the interval ðx  3S, x þ 3SÞ,
and when k ¼ 4 there is at least ð1  ð1=42ÞÞ  100% or 93.75% of the data in the interval
ðx  4S, x þ 4SÞ.

CHARLIER’S CHECK
Charlier’s check in computations of the mean and standard deviation by the coding method makes
use of the identities
P f ðu þ 1Þ ¼ P fu þ P f ¼ P fu þ N
P f ðu þ 1Þ2 ¼ P f ðu2 þ 2u þ 1Þ ¼ P fu2 þ 2 P fu þ P f ¼ P fu2 þ 2 P fu þ N

SHEPPARD’S CORRECTION FOR VARIANCE
The computation of the standard deviation is somewhat in error as a result of grouping the data into
classes (grouping error). To adjust for grouping error, we use the formula
Corrected variance ¼ variance from grouped data  c2
12
ð13Þ
where c is the class-interval size. The correction c2=12 (which is subtracted) is called Sheppard’s correc-
tion. It is used for distributions of continuous variables where the ‘‘tails’’ go gradually to zero in both
directions.
Statisticians diﬀer as to when and whether Sheppard’s correction should be applied. It should
certainly not be applied before one examines the situation thoroughly, for it often tends to overcorrect,
thus replacing an old error with a new one. In this book, unless otherwise indicated, we shall not be using
Sheppard’s correction.
EMPIRICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN MEASURES OF DISPERSION
For moderately skewed distributions, we have the empirical formulas
Mean deviation ¼ 4
5 ðstandard deviationÞ
Semi-interquartile range ¼ 2
3 ðstandard deviationÞ
These are consequences of the fact that for the normal distribution we ﬁnd that the mean
deviation and semi-interquartile range are equal, respectively, to 0.7979 and 0.6745 times the standard
deviation.
ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE DISPERSION; COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION
The actual variation, or dispersion, as determined from the standard deviation or other measure
of dispersion is called the absolute dispersion. However, a variation (or dispersion) of 10 inches
(in) in measuring a distance of 1000 feet (ft) is quite diﬀerent in eﬀect from the same variation
of 10 in in a distance of 20 ft. A measure of this eﬀect is supplied by the relative dispersion, which
is deﬁned by
Relative dispersion ¼ absolute dispersion
average
ð14Þ
If the absolute dispersion is the standard deviation s and if the average is the mean X, then the
relative dispersion is called the coeﬃcient of variation, or coeﬃcient of dispersion; it is denoted by V and
is given by
Coeﬃcient of variation ðVÞ ¼ s
X
(15)
and is generally expressed as a percentage. Other possibilities also occur (see Problem 4.30).
Note that the coeﬃcient of variation is independent of the units used. For this reason, it is useful in
comparing distributions where the units may be diﬀerent. A disadvantage of the coeﬃcient of variation
is that it fails to be useful when X is close to zero.

STANDARDIZED VARIABLE; STANDARD SCORES
The variable that measures the deviation from the mean in units of the standard deviation is called a
standardized variable, is a dimensionless quantity (i.e., is independent of the units used), and is given by
z ¼ X  X
s
ð16Þ
If the deviations from the mean are given in units of the standard deviation, they are said to be
expressed in standard units, or standard scores. These are of great value in the comparison of distributions
(see Problem 4.31).
SOFTWARE AND MEASURES OF DISPERSION
The statistical software gives a variety of measures for dispersion. The dispersion measures are
usually given in descriptive statistics. EXCEL allows for the computation of all the measures discussed
in this book. MINITAB and EXCEL are discussed here and outputs of other packages are given in the
solved problems.
EXAMPLE 3.

EXCEL provides calculations for several measures of dispersion. The following example illus-
trates several. A survey was taken at a large company and the question asked was how many

Solved Problems
THE RANGE
4.1
Find the range of the sets (a) 12, 6, 7, 3, 15, 10, 18, 5 and (b) 9, 3, 8, 8, 9, 8, 9, 18.
SOLUTION
In both cases, range ¼ largest number  smallest number ¼ 18  3 ¼ 15. However, as seen from the
arrays of sets (a) and (b),
(a)
3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18
(b)
3, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 18
there is much more variation, or dispersion, in (a) than in (b). In fact, (b) consists mainly of 8’s and 9’s.
Since the range indicates no diﬀerence between the sets, it is not a very good measure of dispersion in
this case. Where extreme values are present, the range is generally a poor measure of dispersion.
An improvement is achieved by throwing out the extreme cases, 3 and 18. Then for set (a) the range is
ð15  5Þ ¼ 10, while for set (b) the range is ð9  8Þ ¼ 1, clearly showing that (a) has greater dispersion than
(b). However, this is not the way the range is deﬁned. The semi-interquartile range and the 10–90 percentile
range were designed to improve on the range by eliminating extreme cases.
4.2

SOLUTION
There are two ways of deﬁning the range for grouped data.
First method

Second method

The lower and upper quartiles are Q1 ¼ 65:5 þ 2
42 ð3Þ ¼ 65:64 in and Q3 ¼ 68:5 þ 10

Note that 50% of the cases lie between Q1 and Q3 (i.e., 50 students have heights between 65.64 and 69.61 in).

We can consider 1

It follows that 50% of the heights lie in the range 67:63  1:98 in.
4.7
Find the semi-interquartile range for the wages of the 65 employees at the P&R Company (see
Table 2.5 of Problem 2.3).
SOLUTION
From
Problem
3.44,
Q1 ¼ $268:25
and
Q3 ¼ $290:75.
Thus
the
semi-interquartile
range
Q ¼ 1
2 ðQ3  Q1Þ ¼ 1
2 ð$290:75  $268:25Þ ¼ $11:25. Since
1

50% of the employees earn wages lying in the range $279:50  $11:25.
THE 10–90 PERCENTILE RANGE

Find the 10–90 percentile range of the heights of the students at XYZ University (see Table 2.1).
SOLUTION
Here P10 ¼ 62:5 þ 5
18 ð3Þ ¼ 63:33 in, and P90 ¼ 68:5 þ 25
27 ð3Þ ¼ 71:27 in. Thus the 10–90 percentile range
is P90  P10 ¼ 71:27  63:33 ¼ 7:94 in. Since 1
2 ðP10 þ P90Þ ¼ 67:30 in and 1
2 ðP90  P10Þ ¼ 3:97 in, we can
conclude that 80% of the students have heights in the range 67:30  3:97 in.

The above results should be compared with those of Problem 4.3. It will be noted that the standard
deviation does indicate that set (b) shows less dispersion than set (a). However, the eﬀect is masked by the
fact that extreme values aﬀect the standard deviation much more than they aﬀect the mean deviation. This is
to be expected, of course, since the deviations are squared in computing the standard deviation.

Find the standard deviation of the heights of the students at XYZ University (see Table 2.1)
by using (a) the formula derived in Problem 4.15 and (b) the coding method of Problem 4.16.
SOLUTION
In Tables 4.4 and 4.5, A is arbitrarily chosen as being equal to the class mark 67. Note that in Table 4.4
the deviations d ¼ X  A are all multiples of the class-interval size c ¼ 3. This factor is removed in Table 4.5.
As a result, the computations in Table 4.5 are greatly simpliﬁed (compare them with those of Problems
4.11 and 4.14). For this reason, the coding method should be used wherever possible.

The intelligence quotient is
IQ ¼

expressed as a percentage. For example, an 8-year-old child who (according to certain educational proce-
dures) has a mentality equivalent to that of a 10-year-old child would have an IQ of 10/8 ¼ 1:25 ¼ 125%, or
simply 125, the % sign being understood.

CHARLIER’S CHECK
4.20
Use Charlier’s check to help verify the computations of (a) the mean and (b) the standard
deviation performed in Problem 4.19.
SOLUTION
To supply the required check, the columns of Table 4.9 are added to those of Table 4.8 (with the
exception of column 2, which is repeated in Table 4.9 for convenience).
(a)
From Table 4.9, P f ðu þ 1Þ ¼ 716; from Table 4.8, P fu þ N ¼ 236 þ 480 ¼ 716. This provides the
required check on the mean.

To compute the standard deviation from the actual weights of the students given in the problem,
it is convenient ﬁrst to subtract a suitable number, say A ¼ 150 lb, from each weight and then
use the method of Problem 4.15. The deviations d ¼ X  A ¼ X  150 are then given in the

EMPIRICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN MEASURES OF DISPERSION
4.23
For the distribution of the heights of the students at XYZ University, discuss the validity of the
empirical formulas (a) mean deviation ¼ 4
5 (standard deviation) and (b) semi-interquartile
range ¼ 2
3 (standard deviation).
SOLUTION
(a)
From Problems 4.4 and 4.11, mean deviation  standard deviation ¼ 2:26=2:92 ¼ 0:77, which is
close to 4
5.
(b)
From Problems 4.6 and 4.11, semi-interquartile range  standard deviation ¼ 1:98=2:92 ¼ 0:68, which
is close to 2
3.
Thus the empirical formulas are valid in this case.
Note that in the above we have not used the standard deviation with Sheppard’s correction for group-
ing, since no corresponding correction has been made for the mean deviation or semi-interquartile range.

The percentages in parts (a), (b), and (c) agree favorably with those to be expected for a normal
distribution: 68.27%, 95.45%, and 99.73%, respectively.
Note that we have not used Sheppard’s correction for the standard deviation. If this is used, the results
in this case agree closely with the above. Note also that the above results can also be obtained by using
Table 4.11 of Problem 4.32.

Here the means of the two sets are 8 and 16, respectively, while the variances are the same as the sets of
the preceding problem, namely, s2

SOLUTION
(a)
We have w2 þ pw þ q ¼ ðw þ 1

4 p2. Since ðq  1
4 p2Þ is a constant, the expression has the least
value (i.e., is a minimum) if and only if w þ 1

ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE DISPERSION; COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION
4.28
A manufacturer of television tubes has two types of tubes, A and B. Respectively, the tubes have
mean lifetimes of XA ¼ 1495 hours and XB ¼ 1875 hours, and standard deviations of sA ¼ 280
hours and sB ¼ 310 hours. Which tube has the greater (a) absolute dispersion and (b) relative
dispersion?

SOLUTION
(a)
The absolute dispersion of A is sA ¼ 280 hours, and of B is sB ¼ 310 hours. Thus tube B has the greater
absolute dispersion.
(b)
The coeﬃcients of variation are
A ¼ sA
XA
¼ 280
1495 ¼ 18:7%
B ¼ sB
XB
¼ 310
1875 ¼ 16:5%
Thus tube A has the greater relative variation, or dispersion.

Deﬁne a measure of relative dispersion that could be used for a set of data for which the
quartiles are known.
(b)
Illustrate the calculation of the measure deﬁned in part (a) by using the data of Problem 4.6.

(a)
If Q1 and Q3 are given for a set of data, then 1
2 ðQ1 þ Q3Þ is a measure of the data’s central tendency, or
average, while Q ¼ 1
2 ðQ3  Q1Þ, the semi-interquartile range, is a measure of the data’s dispersion.

STANDARDIZED VARIABLE; STANDARD SCORES
4.31
A student received a grade of 84 on a ﬁnal examination in mathematics for which the mean grade
was 76 and the standard deviation was 10. On the ﬁnal examination in physics, for which the
mean grade was 82 and the standard deviation was 16, she received a grade of 90. In which subject
was her relative standing higher?
SOLUTION
The standardized variable z ¼ ðX  XÞ=s measures the deviation of X from the mean X in terms of
standard deviation s. For mathematics, z ¼ ð84  76Þ=10 ¼ 0:8; for physics, z ¼ ð90  82Þ=16 ¼ 0:5. Thus
the student had a grade 0.8 of a standard deviation above the mean in mathematics, but only 0.5 of a
standard deviation above the mean in physics. Thus her relative standing was higher in mathematics.
The variable z ¼ ðX  XÞ=s is often used in educational testing, where it is known as a standard score.

CHAPTER 5
Moments, Skewness,
and Kurtosis
MOMENTS
If X1, X2; . . . ; XN are the N values assumed by the variable X, we deﬁne the quantity
Xr ¼ Xr

2 þ    þ Xr

called the rth moment. The ﬁrst moment with r ¼ 1 is the arithmetic mean X.
The rth moment about the mean X is deﬁned as
mr ¼

N
j¼1
ðXj  XÞr
N

P ðX  XÞr
N
¼ ðX  XÞr
ð2Þ
If r ¼ 1, then m1 ¼ 0 (see Problem 3.16). If r ¼ 2, then m2 ¼ s2, the variance.
The rth moment about any origin A is deﬁned as
m 0
r ¼

N
j¼1
ðXj  AÞr

P ðX  AÞr

ð3Þ
where d ¼ X  A are the deviations of X from A. If A ¼ 0, equation (3) reduces to equation (1). For this
reason, equation (1) is often called the rth moment about zero.
MOMENTS FOR GROUPED DATA
If X1, X2; . . . , XK occur with frequencies f1, f2; . . . , fK, respectively, the above moments are given by

etc. (see Problem 5.5). Note that m 0
1 ¼ X  A.
COMPUTATION OF MOMENTS FOR GROUPED DATA
The coding method given in previous chapters for computing the mean and standard deviation can
also be used to provide a short method for computing moments. This method uses the fact that
Xj ¼ A þ cuj (or brieﬂy, X ¼ A þ cu), so that from equation (6) we have
m 0
r ¼ cr
P fur
N
¼ crur
ð8Þ
which can be used to ﬁnd mr by applying equations (7).
CHARLIER’S CHECK AND SHEPPARD’S CORRECTIONS
Charlier’s check in computing moments by the coding method uses the identities:
P f ðu þ 1Þ ¼ P fu þ N
P f ðu þ 1Þ2 ¼ P fu2 þ 2 P fu þ N
P f ðu þ 1Þ3 ¼ P fu3 þ 3 P fu2 þ 3 P fu þ N
P f ðu þ 1Þ4 ¼ P fu4 þ 4 P fu3 þ 6 P fu2 þ 4 P fu þ N
ð9Þ
Sheppard’s corrections for moments are as follows:
Corrected m2 ¼ m2  1
12 c2
Corrected m4 ¼ m4  1
2 c2m2 þ
7
240 c4
The moments m1 and m3 need no correction.
MOMENTS IN DIMENSIONLESS FORM
To avoid particular units, we can deﬁne the dimensionless moments about the mean as
ar ¼ mr
sr ¼
mr
(
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
m2
p
)r ¼
mrﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
mr
2
p
ð10Þ
where s ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
m2
p
is the standard deviation. Since m1 ¼ 0 and m2 ¼ s2, we have a1 ¼ 0 and a2 ¼ 1.

SKEWNESS
Skewness is the degree of asymmetry, or departure from symmetry, of a distribution. If the frequency
curve (smoothed frequency polygon) of a distribution has a longer tail to the right of the central
maximum than to the left, the distribution is said to be skewed to the right, or to have positive skewness.
If the reverse is true, it is said to be skewed to the left, or to have negative skewness.
For skewed distributions, the mean tends to lie on the same side of the mode as the longer tail
(see Figs. 3-1 and 3-2). Thus a measure of the asymmetry is supplied by the diﬀerence: mean–mode.
This can be made dimensionless if we divide it by a measure of dispersion, such as the standard deviation,
leading to the deﬁnition
Skewness ¼
mean  mode
standard deviation ¼
X  mode
s
ð11Þ
To avoid using the mode, we can employ the empirical formula (10) of Chapter 3 and deﬁne
Skewness ¼ 3ðmean  medianÞ
standard deviation ¼ 3ð X  medianÞ
s
ð12Þ
Equations (11) and (12) are called, respectively, Pearson’s ﬁrst and second coeﬃcients of skewness.
Other measures of skewness, deﬁned in terms of quartiles and percentiles, are as follows:
Quartile coefficient of skewness ¼ ðQ3  Q2Þ  ðQ2  Q1Þ
Q3  Q1
¼ Q3  2Q2 þ Q1
Q3  Q1
ð13Þ
1090 percentile coefficient of skewness ¼ ðP90  P50Þ  ðP50  P10Þ
P90  P10
¼ P90  2P50 þ P10
P90  P10
ð14Þ
An important measure of skewness uses the third moment about the mean expressed in dimension-
less form and is given by
Moment coefficient of skewness ¼ a3 ¼ m3
s3 ¼
m3
(
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
m2
p
)3 ¼
m3ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
m2
p
3
ð15Þ
Another measure of skewness is sometimes given by b1 ¼ a2
3. For perfectly symmetrical curves,
such as the normal curve, a3 and b1 are zero.
KURTOSIS
Kurtosis is the degree of peakedness of a distribution, usually taken relative to a normal distribution.
A distribution having a relatively high peak is called leptokurtic, while one which is ﬂat-topped is called
platykurtic. A normal distribution, which is not very peaked or very ﬂat-topped, is called mesokurtic.
One measure of kurtosis uses the fourth moment about the mean expressed in dimensionless form
and is given by
Moment coefficient of kurtosis ¼ a4 ¼ m4
s4 ¼ m4
m2
2
ð16Þ
which is often denoted by b2. For the normal distribution, b2 ¼ a4 ¼ 3. For this reason, the kurtosis is
sometimes deﬁned by ðb2  3Þ, which is positive for a leptokurtic distribution, negative for a platykurtic
distribution, and zero for the normal distribution.
Another measure of kurtosis is based on both quartiles and percentiles and is given by
 ¼
Q
P90  P10
ð17Þ
where Q ¼ 1
2 ðQ3  Q1Þ is the semi-interquartile range. We refer to  (the lowercase Greek letter kappa)
as the percentile coeﬃcient of kurtosis; for the normal distribution,  has the value 0.263.

POPULATION MOMENTS, SKEWNESS, AND KURTOSIS
When it is necessary to distinguish a sample’s moments, measures of skewness, and measures of
kurtosis from those corresponding to a population of which the sample is a part, it is often the custom to
use Latin symbols for the former and Greek symbols for the latter. Thus if the sample’s moments are
denoted by mr and m 0
r, the corresponding Greek symbols would be r and  0
r ( is the Greek letter mu).
Subscripts are always denoted by Latin symbols.
Similarly, if the sample’s measures of skewness and kurtosis are denoted by a3 and a4, respectively,
the population’s skewness and kurtosis would be 3 and 4 ( is the Greek letter alpha).
We already know from Chapter 4 that the standard deviation of a sample and of a population are
denoted by s and , respectively.
SOFTWARE COMPUTATION OF SKEWNESS AND KURTOSIS
The software that we have discussed in the text so far may be used to compute skewness and kurtosis
measures for sample data. The data in Table 5.1 samples of size 50 from a normal distribution,
a skewed-right distribution, a skewed-left distribution, and a uniform distribution.
The normal data are female height measurements, the skewed-right data are age at marriage for
females, the skewed-left data are obituary data that give the age at death for females, and the uniform
data are the amount of cola put into a 12 ounce container by a soft drinks machine. The distribution of

the four sets of sample data is shown in Fig. 5-1. The distributions of the four samples are illustrated by
dotplots.
The variable Height is the height of 50 adult females, the variable Wedage is the age at the wedding
of 50 females, the variable Obitage is the age at death of 50 females, and the variable Cola-ﬁll is the
amount of cola put into 12 ounce containers. Each sample is of size 50. Using the terminology that we
have learned in this chapter: the height distribution is mesokurtic, the cola-ﬁll distribution is platykurtic,
the wedage distribution is skewed to the right, and the obitage distribution is skewed to the left.

Use EXCEL to ﬁnd the skewness and kurtosis values for the data in Fig. 5-1. If the variable
names are entered into A1:D1 and the sample data are entered into A2:D51 and any open cell is used to
enter
¼SKEW(A2:A51)
the
value
0.0203
is
returned.
The
function ¼SKEW(B2:B51)
returns
1.9774,
the function ¼SKEW(C2:C51) returns 1.4986, and ¼SKEW(D2:D51) returns 0.0156. The kurtosis values are
obtained by ¼KURT(A2:A51) which gives 0.6083, ¼KURT(B2:B51) which gives 4.0985, ¼KURT(C2:C51)
which gives 2.6368, and ¼KURT(D2:D51) which gives 1.1889. It can be seen that MINITAB and EXCEL give
the same values for kurtosis and skewness.

Since the numerical values diﬀer slightly from MINITAB and EXCEL, it is obvious that slightly
diﬀerent measures of skewness and kurtosis are used by the software.
EXAMPLE 4.
The SPSS pull-down menu ‘‘Analyze ) Descriptive Statistics ) Descriptives’’ gives the dialog box in
Fig. 5-3 and the routines Mean, Std. deviation, Kurtosis, and Skewness are chosen. SPSS gives the same measures of

SOLUTION
Mean ¼ $279:76, median ¼ $279:06, mode ¼ $277:50, and standard deviation s ¼ $15:60. Thus:
(a)
First coeﬃcient of skewness ¼ mean  mode

Note that both distributions are moderately skewed, distribution (a) to the left (negatively) and
distribution (b) to the right (positively). Distribution (b) is more skewed than (a); that is, (a) is more
symmetrical than (b), as is evidenced by the fact that the numerical value (or absolute value) of the
skewness coeﬃcient for (b) is greater than that for (a).

Since for a normal distribution a4 ¼ 3, it follows that both distributions (a) and (b) are platykurtic with
respect to the normal distribution (i.e., less peaked than the normal distribution).
Insofar as peakedness is concerned, distribution (b) approximates the normal distribution much better
than does distribution (a). However, from Problem 5.12 distribution (a) is more symmetrical than (b), so that
as far as symmetry is concerned, (a) approximates the normal distribution better than (b) does.

Elementary
Probability Theory
DEFINITIONS OF PROBABILITY
Classic Deﬁnition
Suppose that an event E can happen in h ways out of a total of n possible equally likely ways. Then
the probability of occurrence of the event (called its success) is denoted by
p ¼ PrfEg ¼ h
n
The probability of nonoccurrence of the event (called its failure) is denoted by
q ¼ Prfnot Eg ¼ n  h
n
¼ 1  h
n ¼ 1  p ¼ 1  PrfEg
Thus p þ q ¼ 1, or PrfEg þ Prfnot Eg ¼ 1. The event ‘‘not E’’ is sometimes denoted by E, ~E, or E.
EXAMPLE 1.
When a die is tossed, there are 6 equally possible ways in which the die can fall:
The event E, that a 3 or 4 turns up, is:
and the probability of E is Pr{E} ¼ 2/6 or 1/3. The probability of not getting a 3 or 4 (i.e., getting a 1,
2, 5, or 6) is Prf Eg ¼ 1  PrfEg ¼ 2=3.
Note that the probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1. If the event cannot occur,
its probability is 0. If it must occur (i.e., its occurrence is certain), its probability is 1.
If p is the probability that an event will occur, the odds in favor of its happening are p : q (read ‘‘p to
q’’); the odds against its happening are q : p. Thus the odds against a 3 or 4 in a single toss of a fair die
are q : p ¼ 2
3 : 1
3 ¼ 2 : 1 (i.e., 2 to 1).

Relative-Frequency Deﬁnition
The classic deﬁnition of probability has a disadvantage in that the words ‘‘equally likely’’ are vague.
In fact, since these words seem to be synonymous with ‘‘equally probable,’’ the deﬁnition is circular
because we are essentially deﬁning probability in terms of itself. For this reason, a statistical deﬁnition of
probability has been advocated by some people. According to this the estimated probability, or empirical
probability, of an event is taken to be the relative frequency of occurrence of the event when the number
of observations is very large. The probability itself is the limit of the relative frequency as the number of
observations increases indeﬁnitely.
EXAMPLE 2.
If 1000 tosses of a coin result in 529 heads, the relative frequency of heads is 529/1000 ¼ 0.529.
If
another
1000
tosses
results
in
493
heads,
the
relative
frequency
in
the
total
of
2000
tosses
is
ð529 þ 493Þ=2000 ¼ 0:511. According to the statistical deﬁnition, by continuing in this manner we should ultimately
get closer and closer to a number that represents the probability of a head in a single toss of the coin. From the
results so far presented, this should be 0.5 to one signiﬁcant ﬁgure. To obtain more signiﬁcant ﬁgures, further
observations must be made.
The statistical deﬁnition, although useful in practice, has diﬃculties from a mathematical point of
view, since an actual limiting number may not really exist. For this reason, modern probability theory
has been developed axiomatically; that is, the theory leaves the concept of probability undeﬁned, much
the same as point and line are undeﬁned in geometry.
CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY; INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT EVENTS
If E1 and E2 are two events, the probability that E2 occurs given that E1 has occurred is denoted by
PrfE2jE1g, or PrfE2 given E1g, and is called the conditional probability of E2 given that E1 has occurred.
If the occurrence or nonoccurrence of E1 does not aﬀect the probability of occurrence of E2, then
PrfE2jE1g ¼ PrfE2g and we say that E1 and E2 are independent events; otherwise, they are dependent
events.
If we denote by E1E2 the event that ‘‘both E1 and E2 occur,’’ sometimes called a compound event,
then
PrfE1E2g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2jE1g
ð1Þ
In particular,
PrfE1E2g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2g
for independent events
ð2Þ
For three events E1, E2, and E3, we have
PrfE1E2E3g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2jE1g PrfE3jE1E2g
ð3Þ
That is, the probability of occurrence of E1, E2, and E3 is equal to (the probability of E1Þ  ðthe
probability of E2 given that E1 has occurredÞ  ðthe probability of E3 given that both E1 and E2 have
occurred). In particular,
PrfE1E2E3g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2g PrfE3g
for independent events
ð4Þ
In general, if E1, E2, E3, . . . , En are n independent events having respective probabilities p1, p2,
p3, . . . , pn, then the probability of occurrence of E1 and E2 and E3 and    En is p1p2p3    pn.
EXAMPLE 3.
Let E1 and E2 be the events ‘‘heads on ﬁfth toss’’ and ‘‘heads on sixth toss’’ of a coin, respectively.
Then E1 and E2 are independent events, and thus the probability of heads on both the ﬁfth and sixth tosses is
(assuming the coin to be fair)
PrfE1E2g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2g ¼
1
2
  1

EXAMPLE 4.
If the probability that A will be alive in 20 years is 0.7 and the probability that B will be alive in
20 years is 0.5, then the probability that they will both be alive in 20 years is ð0:7Þð0:5Þ ¼ 0:35.
EXAMPLE 5.
Suppose that a box contains 3 white balls and 2 black balls. Let E1 be the event ‘‘ﬁrst ball drawn is
black’’ and E2 the event ‘‘second ball drawn is black,’’ where the balls are not replaced after being drawn. Here E1
and E2 are dependent events.
The probability that the ﬁrst ball drawn is black is PrfE1g ¼ 2=ð3 þ 2Þ ¼ 2
5. The probability that the second ball
drawn is black, given that the ﬁrst ball drawn was black, is PrfE2jE1g ¼ 1=ð3 þ 1Þ ¼ 1
4. Thus the probability that
both balls drawn are black is
PrfE1E2g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2jE1g ¼ 2
5  1
4 ¼ 1
10
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS
Two or more events are called mutually exclusive if the occurrence of any one of them excludes the
occurrence of the others. Thus if E1 and E2 are mutually exclusive events, then PrfE1E2g ¼ 0.
If E1 þ E2 denotes the event that ‘‘either E1 or E2 or both occur,’’ then
PrfE1 þ E2g ¼ PrfE1g þ PrfE2g  PrfE1E2g
ð5Þ
In particular,
PrfE1 þ E2g ¼ PrfE1g þ PrfE2g
for mutually exclusive events
ð6Þ
As an extension of this, if E1, E2, . . . , En are n mutually exclusive events having respective prob-
abilities of occurrence p1, p2, . . . , pn, then the probability of occurrence of either E1 or E2 or    En is
p1 þ p2 þ    þ pn.
Result (5) can also be generalized to three or more mutually exclusive events.
EXAMPLE 6.
If E1 is the event ‘‘drawing an ace from a deck of cards’’ and E2 is the event ‘‘drawing a king,’’ then
PrfE1g ¼ 4
52 ¼ 1
13 and PrfE2g ¼ 4
52 ¼ 1
13. The probability of drawing either an ace or a king in a single draw is
PrfE1 þ E2g ¼ PrfE1g þ PrfE2g ¼ 1
13 þ 1
13 ¼ 2
13
since both an ace and a king cannot be drawn in a single draw and are thus mutually exclusive events (Fig. 6-1).
Note that E1 and E2 have no outcomes in common. They are mutually exclusive.
EXAMPLE 7.
If E1 is the event ‘‘drawing an ace’’ from a deck of cards and E2 is the event ‘‘drawing a spade,’’ then
E1 and E2 are not mutually exclusive since the ace of spades can be drawn (Fig. 6-2). Thus the probability of drawing
either an ace or a spade or both is
PrfE1 þ E2g ¼ PrfE1g þ PrfE2g  PrfE1E2g ¼ 4
52 þ 13
52  1
52 ¼ 16
52 ¼ 4
13
Note that the event ‘‘E1 and E2’’ consisting of those outcomes in both events is the ace of spades.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS
Discrete
If a variable X can assume a discrete set of values X1, X2; . . . , XK with respective probabilities p1;
p2, . . . , pK, where p1 þ p2 þ    þ pK ¼ 1, we say that a discrete probability distribution for X has been
deﬁned. The function pðXÞ, which has the respective values p1, p2, . . . , pK for X ¼ X1, X2, . . . , XK, is
called the probability function, or frequency function, of X. Because X can assume certain values with
given probabilities, it is often called a discrete random variable. A random variable is also known as a
chance variable or stochastic variable.
EXAMPLE 8.
Let a pair of fair dice be tossed and let X denote the sum of the points obtained. Then the probability
distribution is as shown in Table 6.1. For example, the probability of getting sum 5 is 4
36 ¼ 1
9; thus in 900 tosses of the
dice we would expect 100 tosses to give the sum 5.
Note that this is analogous to a relative-frequency distribution with probabilities replacing the
relative frequencies. Thus we can think of probability distributions as theoretical or ideal limiting
forms of relative-frequency distributions when the number of observations made is very large. For
this reason, we can think of probability distributions as being distributions of populations, whereas
relative-frequency distributions are distributions of samples drawn from this population.
The probability distribution can be represented graphically by plotting pðXÞ against X, just as for
relative-frequency distributions (see Problem 6.11).
By cumulating probabilities, we obtain cumulative probability distributions, which are analogous to
cumulative relative-frequency distributions. The function associated with this distribution is sometimes
called a distribution function.
The distribution in Table 6.1 can be built using EXCEL. The following portion of an EXCEL
worksheet is built by entering Die1 into A1, Die2 into B1, and Sum into C1. The 36 outcomes on the
dice are entered into A2:B37. In C2, ¼SUM(A2:B2) is entered and a click-and-drag is performed from
C2 to C37. By noting that the sum 2 occurs once, the sum 3 occurs twice, etc., the probability distribution
in Table 6.1 is formed.

Continuous
The above ideas can be extended to the case where the variable X may assume a continuous set of
values. The relative-frequency polygon of a sample becomes, in the theoretical or limiting case of a
population, a continuous curve (such as shown in Fig. 6-3) whose equation is Y ¼ pðXÞ. The total area
under this curve bounded by the X axis is equal to 1, and the area under the curve between lines X ¼ a
and X ¼ b (shaded in Fig. 6-3) gives the probability that X lies between a and b, which can be denoted
by Prfa < X < bg:
a
b
X
p(X)
Fig. 6-3
Pr{a5X5b} is shown as the cross-hatched area under the density function.

We call pðXÞ a probability density function, or brieﬂy a density function, and when such a function is
given we say that a continuous probability distribution for X has been deﬁned. The variable X is then often
called a continuous random variable.
As in the discrete case, we can deﬁne cumulative probability distributions and the associated
distribution functions.
MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATION
If p is the probability that a person will receive a sum of money S, the mathematical expectation
(or simply the expectation) is deﬁned as pS.
EXAMPLE 9.
Find E(X) for the distribution of the sum of the dice given in Table 6.1. The distribution is given in
the following EXCEL printout. The distribution is given in A2:B12 where the p(X) values have been converted to
their decimal equivalents. In C2, the expression ¼A2*B2 is entered and a click-and-drag is performed from C2
to C12. In C13, the expression ¼Sum(C2:C12) gives the mathematical expectation which equals 7.

The concept of expectation is easily extended. If X denotes a discrete random variable that
can
assume
the
values
X1, X2, . . . , XK
with
respective
probabilities
p1, p2, . . . , pK,
where
p1 þ p2 þ    þ pK ¼ 1, the mathematical expectation of X (or simply the expectation of X), denoted
by EðXÞ, is deﬁned as
EðXÞ ¼ p1X1 þ p2X2 þ    þ pKXK ¼
X
K
j¼1
pjXj ¼
X
pX
ð7Þ
If the probabilities pj in this expectation are replaced with the relative frequencies fj=N, where
N ¼ P fj, the expectation reduces to (P fXÞ=N, which is the arithmetic mean X of a sample of size
N in which X1, X2, . . . , XK appear with these relative frequencies. As N gets larger and larger, the
relative frequencies fj=N approach the probabilities pj. Thus we are led to the interpretation that
EðXÞ represents the mean of the population from which the sample is drawn. If we call m the sample
mean, we can denote the population mean by the corresponding Greek letter  (mu).
Expectation can also be deﬁned for continuous random variables, but the deﬁnition requires the use
of calculus.
RELATION BETWEEN POPULATION, SAMPLE MEAN, AND VARIANCE
If we select a sample of size N at random from a population (i.e., we assume that all such samples are
equally probable), then it is possible to show that the expected value of the sample mean m is the
population mean .

It does not follow, however, that the expected value of any quantity computed from a sample is the
corresponding population quantity. For example, the expected value of the sample variance as we have
deﬁned it is not the population variance, but ðN  1Þ=N times this variance. This is why some statisti-
cians choose to deﬁne the sample variance as our variance multiplied by N=ðN1Þ.
COMBINATORIAL ANALYSIS
In obtaining probabilities of complex events, an enumeration of cases is often diﬃcult, tedious, or
both. To facilitate the labor involved, use is made of basic principles studied in a subject called combi-
natorial analysis.
Fundamental Principle
If an event can happen in any one of n1 ways, and if when this has occurred another event can
happen in any one of n2 ways, then the number of ways in which both events can happen in the speciﬁed
order is n1n2.
EXAMPLE 10.
The numbers 0 through 5 are entered into A1 through A6 in EXCEL and ¼FACT(A1) is entered
into B1 and a click-and-drag is performed from B1 through B6. Then the chart wizard is used to plot the points. The
function ¼FACT(n) is the same as n!. For n ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, ¼FACT(n) equals 1, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 120. Figure 6.4
was generated by the chart wizard in EXCEL.
EXAMPLE 11.
The number of permutations of the letters a, b, and c taken two at a time is 3P2 ¼ 3  2 ¼ 6.
These are ab, ba, ac, ca, bc, and cb.

COMBINATIONS
A combination of n diﬀerent objects taken r at a time is a selection of r out of the n objects, with no
attention given to the order of arrangement. The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is
denoted by the symbol ðn

RELATION OF PROBABILITY TO POINT SET THEORY
As shown in Fig. 6-5, a Venn diagram represents all possible outcomes of an experiment as a
rectangle, called the sample space, S. Events are represented as four-sided ﬁgures or circles inside the
sample space. If S contains only a ﬁnite number of points, then with each point we can associate a
nonnegative number, called probability, such that the sum of all numbers corresponding to all points in S
add to 1. An event is a set (or collection) of points in S, such as indicated by E1 and E2 in Fig. 6-5.
EULER OR VENN DIAGRAMS AND PROBABILITY
The event E1 þ E2 is the set of points that are either in E1 or E2 or both, while the event E1E2 is
the set of points common to both E1 and E2. Thus the probability of an event such as E1 is the sum of
the probabilities associated with all points contained in the set E1. Similarly, the probability of E1 þ E2,
denoted by PrfE1 þ E2g, is the sum of the probabilities associated with all points contained in
the set E1 þ E2. If E1 and E2 have no points in common (i.e., the events are mutually exclusive),
then
PrfE1 þ E2g ¼ PrfE1g þ PrfE2g.
If
they
have
points
in
common,
then
PrfE1 þ E2g ¼
PrfE1g þ PrfE2g  PrfE1E2g:
The set E1 þ E2 is sometimes denoted by E1 [ E2 and is called the union of the two sets. The set E1E2
is sometimes denoted by E1 \ E2 and is called the intersection of the two sets. Extensions to more than
two sets can be made; thus instead of E1 þ E2 þ E3 and E1E2E3, we could use the notations E1 [ E2 [ E3
and E1 \ E2 \ E3, respectively.
The symbol  (the Greek letter phi) is sometimes used to denote a set with no points in it, called
the null set. The probability associated with an event corresponding to this set is zero (i.e., Prfg ¼ 0Þ.
If E1 and E2 have no points in common, we can write E1E2 ¼ , which means that the corresponding

events are mutually exclusive, whereby PrfE1E2g ¼ 0.
With this modern approach, a random variable is a function deﬁned at each point of the
sample space. For example, in Problem 6.37 the random variable is the sum of the coordinates of
each point.
In the case where S has an inﬁnite number of points, the above ideas can be extended by using
concepts of calculus.
EXAMPLE 14.
An experiment consists of rolling a pair of dice. Event E1 is the event that a 7 occurs, i. e., the sum
on the dice is 7. Event E2 is the event that an odd number occurs on die 1. Sample space S, events E1 and E2 are
shown. Find Pr{E1}, Pr{E2}, Pr{E1 \ E2} and Pr(E1 [ E2). E1, E2, and S are shown in separate panels of the

Solved Problems
FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF PROBABILITY
6.1
Determine the probability p, or an estimate of it, for each of the following events:
(a)
An odd number appears in a single toss of a fair die.
(b)
At least one head appears in two tosses of a fair coin.
(c)
An ace, 10 of diamonds, or 2 of spades appears in drawing a single card from a well-shuﬄed
ordinary deck of 52 cards.
(d)
The sum 7 appears in a single toss of a pair of fair dice.
(e)
A tail appears in the next toss of a coin if out of 100 tosses 56 were heads.
SOLUTION
(a)
Out of six possible equally likely cases, three cases (where the die comes up 1, 3, or 5) are favorable to
the event. Thus p ¼ 3
6 ¼ 1
2.
(b)
If H denotes ‘‘head’’ and T denotes ‘‘tail,’’ the two tosses can lead to four cases: HH, HT, TH, and TT,
all equally likely. Only the ﬁrst three cases are favorable to the event. Thus p ¼ 3
4.
(c)
The event can occur in six ways (ace of spades, ace of hearts, ace of clubs, ace of diamonds, 10 of
diamonds, and 2 of spades) out of 52 equally likely cases. Thus p ¼ 6
52 ¼ 3
26.
(d)
Each of the six faces of one die can be associated with each of the six faces of the other die, so that the
total number of cases that can arise, all equally likely, is 6  6 ¼ 36. These can be denoted by (1, 1), (2, 1),
(3, 1Þ, . . . , (6, 6).
There are six ways of obtaining the sum 7, denoted by (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1).
Thus p ¼ 6
36 ¼ 1
6.
(e)
Since 100  56 ¼ 44 tails were obtained in 100 tosses, the estimated (or empirical) probability of a tail
is the relative frequency 44/100 ¼ 0:44.

6.4
A fair die is tossed twice. Find the probability of getting a 4, 5, or 6 on the ﬁrst toss and a 1, 2, 3,
or 4 on the second toss.
SOLUTION
Let E1 ¼ event ‘‘4, 5, or 6’’ on the ﬁrst toss, and let E2 ¼ event ‘‘1, 2, 3, or 4’’ on the second toss. Each of
the six ways in which the die can fall on the ﬁrst toss can be associated with each of the six ways in which it
can fall on the second toss, a total of 6  6 ¼ 36 ways, all equally likely. Each of the three ways in which E1
can occur can be associated with each of the four ways in which E2 can occur, to give 3  4 ¼ 12 ways in
which both E1 and E2, or E1E2 occur. Thus PrfE1E2g ¼ 12=36 ¼ 1=3.
Note that PrfE1E2g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2g (i.e., 1

6.5
Two cards are drawn from a well-shuﬄed ordinary deck of 52 cards. Find the probability that
they are both aces if the ﬁrst card is (a) replaced and (b) not replaced.
SOLUTION
Let E1 ¼ event ‘‘ace’’ on the ﬁrst draw, and let E2 ¼ event ‘‘ace’’ on the second draw.
(a)
If the ﬁrst card is replaced, E1 and E2 are independent events. Thus Pr{both cards drawn are
acesg ¼ PrfE1E2g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2g ¼ ð 4
52Þð 4
52Þ ¼

169 :
(b)
The ﬁrst card can be drawn in any one of 52 ways, and the second card can be drawn in any one
of 51 ways since the ﬁrst card is not replaced. Thus both cards can be drawn in 52  51 ways,
all equally likely.
There are four ways in which E1 can occur and three ways in which E2 can occur, so that both E1
and E2, or E1E2, can occur in 4  3 ways. Thus PrfE1E2g ¼ ð4  3Þ=ð52  51Þ ¼
1
221.
Note that PrfE2jE1g ¼ Prfsecond card is an ace given that ﬁrst card is an aceg ¼ 3

result is an illustration of the general rule that PrfE1E2g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2jE1g when E1 and E2 are
dependent events.
6.6
Three balls are drawn successively from the box of Problem 6.3. Find the probability

SOLUTION
Let R ¼ event ‘‘red’’ on the ﬁrst draw, W ¼ event ‘‘white’’ on the second draw, and B ¼ event ‘‘blue’’
on the third draw. We require PrfRWBg.

Find the probability of a 4 turning up at least once in two tosses of a fair die.
SOLUTION
Let E1 ¼ event ‘‘4’’ on the ﬁrst toss, E2 ¼ event ‘‘4’’ on the second toss, and E1 þ E2 ¼ event ‘‘4’’
on the ﬁrst toss or ‘‘4’’ on the second toss or both ¼ event that at least one 4 turns up.
We require PrfE1 þ E2g.
First method
The total number or equally likely ways in which both dice can fall is 6  6 ¼ 36. Also,
Number of ways in which E1 occurs but not E2 ¼ 5
Number of ways in which E2 occurs but not E1 ¼ 5
Number of ways in which both E1 and E2 occur ¼ 1
Thus the number of ways in which at least one of the events E1 or E2 occurs is 5 þ 5 þ 1 ¼ 11, and thus
Pr{E1 þ E2g ¼ 11

Second method
Since E1 and E2 are not mutually exclusive, Pr{E1 þ E2g ¼ PrfE1g þ PrfE2g  PrfE1E2g. Also, since

Pr{E1E2g ¼ PrfE1g PrfE2g.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS
6.10
Find the probability of boys and girls in families with three children, assuming equal probabilities
for boys and girls.
SOLUTION
Let B ¼ event ‘‘boy in the family,’’ and let G ¼ event ‘‘girl in the family.’’ Thus according to the
assumption of equal probabilities, PrfBg ¼ PrfGg ¼ 1
2 : In families of three children the following mutually
exclusive events can occur with the corresponding indicated probabilities:
(a)
Three boys (BBB):
PrfBBBg ¼ PrfBg PrfBg PrfBg ¼ 1
8
Here we assume that the birth of a boy is not inﬂuenced in any manner by the fact that a previous child
was also a boy, that is, we assume that the events are independent.
(b)
Three girls (GGG): As in part (a) or by symmetry,
PrfGGGg ¼ 1

If we call X the random variable showing the number of boys in families with three children, the
probability distribution is as shown in Table 6.2.

Graph the distribution of Problem 6.10.
SOLUTION
The graph can be represented either as in Fig. 6-7 or Fig. 6-8. Note that the sum of the areas of the
rectangles in Fig. 6-8 is 1; in this ﬁgure, called a probability histogram, we are considering X as a continuous
variable even though it is actually discrete, a procedure that is often found useful. Figure 6-7, on the other
hand, is used when one does not wish to consider the variable as continuous.

In how many ways can 5 diﬀerently colored marbles be arranged in a row?
SOLUTION
We must arrange the 5 marbles in 5 positions:     . The ﬁrst position can be occupied by any
one of 5 marbles (i.e., there are 5 ways of ﬁlling the ﬁrst position). When this has been done, there are 4 ways
of ﬁlling the second position. Then there are 3 ways of ﬁlling the third position, 2 ways of ﬁlling the fourth
position, and ﬁnally only 1 way of ﬁlling the last position. Therefore:
Number of arrangements of 5 marbles in a row ¼ 5  4  3  2  1 ¼ 5! ¼ 120
In general,
Number of arrangements of n different objects in a row ¼ nðn  1Þðn  2Þ    1 ¼ n!
This is also called the number of permutations of n diﬀerent objects taken n at a time and is denoted by nPn.
6.18
In how many ways can 10 people be seated on a bench if only 4 seats are available?
SOLUTION
The ﬁrst seat can be ﬁlled in any one of 10 ways, and when this has been done there are 9 ways of ﬁlling
the second seat, 8 ways of ﬁlling the third seat, and 7 ways of ﬁlling the fourth seat. Therefore:
Number of arrangements of 10 people taken 4 at a time ¼ 10  9  8  7 ¼ 5040
In general,
Number of arrangements of n different objects taken r at a time ¼ nðn  1Þ    ðn  r þ 1Þ

This is also called the number of permutations of n diﬀerent objects taken r at a time and is denoted by nPr,
Pðn, rÞ or Pn;r. Note that when r ¼ n, nPn ¼ n!, as in Problem 6.17.

It is required to seat 5 men and 4 women in a row so that the women occupy the even places.
How many such arrangements are possible?
SOLUTION
The men may be seated in 5P5 ways and the women in 4P4 ways; each arrangement of the men may be
associated with each arrangement of the women. Hence the required number of arrangements is
5P5  4P4 ¼ 5!4! ¼ ð120Þð24Þ ¼ 2880:
6.21
How many four-digit numbers can be formed with the 10 digits 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9, if (a) repetitions
are allowed, (b) repetitions are not allowed, and (c) the last digit must be zero and repetitions are
not allowed?
SOLUTION
(a)
The ﬁrst digit can be any one of 9 (since 0 is not allowed). The second, third and fourth digits can be
any one of 10. Then 9  10  10  10 ¼ 9000 numbers can be formed.
(b)
The ﬁrst digit can be any one of 9 (any one but 0).
The second digit can be any one of 9 (any but that used for the ﬁrst digit).
The third digit can be any one of 8 (any but those used for the ﬁrst two digits).
The fourth digit can be any one of 7 (any but those used for the ﬁrst three digits).
Thus 9  9  8  7 ¼ 4536 numbers can be formed.
Another method
The ﬁrst digit can be any one of 9 and the remaining three can be chosen in 9P3 ways. Thus
9  9P3 ¼ 9  9  8  7 ¼ 4536 numbers can be formed.
(c)
The ﬁrst digit can be chosen in 9 ways, the second in 8 ways, and the third in 7 ways. Thus 9  8  7 ¼ 504
numbers can be formed.
Another method
The ﬁrst digit can be chosen in 9 ways and the next two digits in
9P2 ways. Thus
9  8P2 ¼ 9  8  7 ¼ 504 numbers can be found.

Four diﬀerent mathematics books, 6 diﬀerent physics books, and 2 diﬀerent chemistry books are to
be arranged on a shelf. How many diﬀerent arrangements are possible if (a) the books in each
particular subject must all stand together and (b) only the mathematics books must stand together?
SOLUTION
(a)
The mathematics books can be arranged among themselves in 4P4 ¼ 4! ways, the physics books in
6P6 ¼ 6! ways, the chemistry books in 2P2 ¼ 2! ways, and the three groups in 3P3 ¼ 3! ways. Thus the
required number of arrangements ¼ 4! 6! 2! 3! ¼ 207,360.

(b)
Consider the 4 mathematics books as one big book. Then we have 9 books that can be arranged
in 9P9 ¼ 9! ways. In all of these ways the mathematics books are together. But the mathematics
books can be arranged among themselves in
4P4 ¼ 4! ways. Thus the required number of
arrangements ¼ 9! 4! ¼ 8,709,120.

Five red marbles, 2 white marbles, and 3 blue marbles are arranged in a row. If all the marbles of
the same color are not distinguishable from each other, how many diﬀerent arrangements are
possible? Use the EXCEL function ¼MULTINOMIAL to evaluate the expression.
SOLUTION
Assume that there are P diﬀerent arrangements. Multiplying P by the numbers of ways of arranging
(a) the 5 red marbles among themselves, (b) the 2 white marbles among themselves, and (c) the 3 blue
marbles among themselves (i.e., multiplying P by 5! 2! 3!), we obtain the number of ways of arranging the 10
marbles if they are distinguishable (i.e., 10!). Thus
ð5!2!3!ÞP ¼ 10!
and
P ¼ 10!

In how many ways can 7 people be seated at a round table if (a) they can sit anywhere and
(b) 2 particular people must not sit next to each other?
SOLUTION
(a)
Let 1 of them be seated anywhere. Then the remaining 6 people can be seated in 6! ¼ 720 ways, which is
the total number of ways of arranging the 7 people in a circle.
(b)
Consider the 2 particular people as 1 person. Then there are 6 people altogether and they can be
arranged in 5! ways. But the 2 people considered as 1 can be arranged among themselves in 2! ways.
Thus the number of ways of arranging 6 people at a round table with 2 particular people sitting
together ¼ 5!2! ¼ 240.
Then using part (a), the total number of ways in which 6 people can be seated at a round table so
that the 2 particular people do not sit together ¼ 720  240 ¼ 480 ways.

A girl has 5 ﬂowers, each of a diﬀerent variety. How many diﬀerent bouquets can she form?
SOLUTION
Each ﬂower can be dealt with in 2 ways: It can be chosen or not chosen. Since each of the 2 ways of
dealing with a ﬂower is associated with 2 ways of dealing with each of the other ﬂowers, the number of ways

of dealing with the 5 ﬂowers ¼ 25. But these 25 ways include the case in which no ﬂower is chosen. Hence the
required number of bouquets ¼ 25  1 ¼ 31:

Figure 6-11 shows how to represent the sample space for tossing a fair coin 4 times and event E1
that exactly two heads and two tails occurred and event E2 that the coin showed the same thing on
the ﬁrst and last toss. This is one way to represent Venn diagrams and events in a computer
worksheet.
The outcomes in E1 have an X beside them under event E1 and the outcomes in E2 have a Y beside them
under event E2.
(a)
Give the outcomes in E1 \ E2 and E1 [ E2.
(b)
Give the probabilities Pr{E1 \ E2} and Pr{E1 [ E2}.
SOLUTION
(a)
The outcomes in E1 \ E2 have an X and a Y beside them. Therefore E1 \ E2 consists of outcomes htth
and thht. The outcomes in E1 [ E2 have an X, Y, or X and Y beside them. The outcomes in E1 [ E2 are:
hhhh, hhth, hhtt, hthh, htth, thht, thth, thtt, tthh, ttht, and tttt.
(b)
Pr{E1 \ E2} ¼ 2/16 ¼ 1/8 or 0.125. Pr{E1 [ E2} ¼ 12/16 ¼ 3/4 or 0.75.

SOLUTION
(a)
The nonmutually exclusive union A [ B is expressible as the mutually exclusive union of A \ B, B \ A,
and A \ B.
PrfA [ Bg ¼ PrfA \ Bg þ PrfB \ Ag þ PrfA \ Bg
Now add and subtract Pr{A \ B} from the right-hand side of this equation.
PrfA [ Bg ¼ PrfA \ BÞ þ PrfB \ Ag þ PrfA \ Bg þ ½PrfA \ Bg  PrfA \ Bg
Rearrange this equation as follows:
PrfA [ Bg ¼ ½PrfA \ BÞ þ PrfA \ Bg þ ½PrfB \ Ag þ PrfA \ Bg  PrfA \ Bg

In Fig. 6-13, event A is composed of regions 1, 2, 3, and 6, event B is composed of 1, 3, 4, and 7, and
event C is composed of regions 1, 2, 4, and 5.
The sample space in Fig. 6-13 is made up of 8 mutually exclusive regions. The eight regions are described
as follows: region 1 is A \ B \ C , region 2 is A \ C \ B, region 3 is A \ B \ C, region 4 is A \ C \ B, region
5 is A \ C \ B, region 6 is A \ C \ B, region 7 is A \ C \ B, and region 8 is A \ C \ B.
The probability Pr{A [ B [ C} may be expressed as the probability of the 7 mutually exclusive
regions that make up A [ B [ C as follows:
PrfA \ B \ Cg þ PrfA \ C \ Bg þ PrfA \ B \ Cg þ Prf A \ C \ Bg

In a survey of 500 adults were asked the three-part question (1) Do you own a cell phone, (2) Do
you own an ipod, and (3) Do you have an internet connection? The results of the survey were as
follows (no one answered no to all three parts):
cell phone
329
cell phone and ipod
83
ipod
186
cell phone and internet connection
217
internet connection
295

63
Give the probabilities of the following events:
(a) answered yes to all three parts, (b) had a cell phone but not an internet connection, (c) had an
ipod but not a cell phone, (d ) had an internet connection but not an ipod, (e) had a cell phone or
an internet connection but not an ipod and, ( f ) had a cell phone but not an ipod or an internet
connection.
SOLUTION
Event A is that the respondent had a cell phone, event B is that the respondent had an ipod, and event C
is that the respondent had an internet connection.
(a)
The probability that everyone is in the union is 1 since no one answered no to all three parts.
Pr{A[B[C} is given by the following expression:
PrfAg þ PrfBg þ PrfCg  PrfA \ Bg  PrfB \ Cg  PrfA \ Cg þ PrfA \ B \ Cg
1 ¼ 329=500 þ 186=500 þ 295=500  83=500  63=500  217=500 þ PrfA \ B \ Cg
Solving for PrfA \ B \ Cg; we obtain 1  447=500 or 53=500 ¼ 0:106:
Before answering the other parts, it is convenient to ﬁll in the regions in Fig. 6-14 as shown in Fig. 6-15.
The number in region 2 is the number in region A \ C minus the number in region 1 or 217  53 ¼ 164.
The number in region 3 is the number in region A \ B minus the number in region 1 or 83  53 ¼ 30. The
number in region 4 is the number in region B \ C minus the number in region 1 or 63  53 ¼ 10.
The number in region 5 is the number in region C minus the number in regions 1, 2, and 4 or
295  53  164  10 ¼ 68. The number in region 6 is the number in region A minus the number in
regions 1, 2, and 3 or 329  53  164  30 ¼ 82. The number in region 7 is 186  53  30  10 ¼ 93.

98 in favor of A or B but not C
64 in favor of C but not A or B
42 in favor of B but not A or C
14 in favor of A and C but not B
How many of the voters were in favor of (a) all three candidates, (b) A irrespective of B or C, (c) B

Let E1, E2, and E3 be three diﬀerent events, at least one of which is known to have occurred. Suppose that
any of these events can result in another event A, which is also known to have occurred. If all the prob-
abilities PrfE1g, PrfE2g, PrfE3g and PrfAjE1g, PrfAjE2g, PrfAjE3g are assumed known, prove that
PrfE1jAg ¼

PrfE1g PrfAjE1g þ PrfE2g PrfAjE2g þ PrfE3g PrfAjE3g
with similar results for PrfE2jAg and PrfE3jAg. This is known as Bayes’ rule or theorem. It is useful in
computing probabilities of various hypotheses E1, E2, or E3 that have resulted in the event A. The result can
be generalized.

THE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
If p is the probability that an event will happen in any single trial (called the probability of a success)
and q ¼ 1  p is the probability that it will fail to happen in any single trial (called the probability of a
failure), then the probability that the event will happen exactly X times in N trials (i.e., X successes and
N  X failures will occur) is given by

Using EXCEL, the evaluation of the probability of 2 heads in 6 tosses is given by the following:
¼BINOMDIST(2,6,0.5,0), where the function BINOMDIST has 4 parameters.
The ﬁrst parameter is the number of successes, the second is the number of trials, the third is the probability of
success, and the fourth is a 0 or 1. A zero gives the probability of the number of successes and a 1 gives the
cumulative probability. The function ¼BINOMDIST(2,6,0.5,0) gives 0.234375 which is the same as 15/64.

Using EXCEL, the solution is ¼1-BINOMDIST(3,6,0.5,1) or 0.34375 which is the same as 11/32.
Since Pr{X  4} ¼ 1  Pr{X  3}, and BINOMDIST(3,6,0.5,1) ¼ Pr{X  3}, this computation will give
the probability of at least 4 heads.

THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
One of the most important examples of a continuous probability distribution is the normal distribu-
tion, normal curve, or gaussian distribution. It is deﬁned by the equation
Y ¼

ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
e1=2ðXÞ2=2
ð3Þ
where  ¼ mean,  ¼ standard deviation,  ¼ 3:14159   , and e ¼ 2:71828   . The total area bounded
by curve (3) and the X axis is 1; hence the area under the curve between two ordinates X ¼ a and X ¼ b,
where a < b, represents the probability that X lies between a and b. This probability is denoted by
Prfa < X < bg.
When the variable X is expressed in terms of standard units ½z ¼ ðX  Þ=, equation (3) is replaced
by the so-called standard form:
Y ¼

In such cases we say that z is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1. Figure 7-1 is a graph of this
standardized normal curve. It shows that the areas included between z ¼ 1 and þ1, z ¼ 2 and þ2,
and z ¼ 3 and þ3 are equal, respectively, to 68.27%, 95.45%, and 99.73% of the total area, which is 1.
The table in Appendix II shows the areas under this curve bounded by the ordinates at z ¼ 0 and any
positive value of z. From this table the area between any two ordinates can be found by using the
symmetry of the curve about z ¼ 0.
Some properties of the normal distribution given by equation (3) are listed in Table 7.2.
RELATION BETWEEN THE BINOMIAL AND NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
If N is large and if neither p nor q is too close to zero, the binomial distribution can be closely
approximated by a normal distribution with standardized variable given by
z ¼ X  Np
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Npq
p
The approximation becomes better with increasing N, and in the limiting case it is exact; this is shown in
Tables 7.1 and 7.2, where it is clear that as N increases, the skewness and kurtosis for the binomial
distribution approach that of the normal distribution. In practice the approximation is very good if both
Np and Nq are greater than 5.

where e ¼ 2:71828    and  is a given constant, is called the Poisson distribution after Sime´ on-Denis
Poisson, who discovered it in the early part of the nineteenth century. The values of pðXÞ can be
computed by using the table in Appendix VIII (which gives values of e for various values of ) or
by using logarithms.
EXAMPLE 6.
The number of admissions per day at an emergency room has a Poisson distribution and the mean
is 5. Find the probability of at most 3 admissions per day and the probability of at least 8 admissions per day.
The probability of at most 3 is Pr{X  3} ¼ e5{50/0! þ 51/1! þ 52/2! þ 53/3!}. From Appendix VIII, e5 ¼ 0.006738,

Some properties of the Poisson distribution are listed in Table 7.3.
RELATION BETWEEN THE BINOMIAL AND POISSON DISTRIBUTIONS
In the binomial distribution (1), if N is large while the probability p of the occurrence of an event is
close to 0, so that q ¼ 1  p is close to 1, the event is called a rare event. In practice we shall consider an
event to be rare if the number of trials is at least 50 (N  50) while Np is less than 5. In such case
the binomial distribution (1) is very closely approximated by the Poisson distribution (5) with  ¼ Np.
This is indicated by comparing Tables 7.1 and 7.3—for by placing  ¼ Np, q  1, and p  0 in Table 7.1,
we get the results in Table 7.3.
Since there is a relation between the binomial and normal distributions, it follows that there also is
a relation between the Poisson and normal distributions. It can in fact be shown that the Poisson distribu-
tion approaches a normal distribution with standardized variable ðX  Þ=

THE MULTINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
If events E1, E2, . . . , EK can occur with probabilities p1, p2, . . . , pK, respectively, then the probability

is called the multinomial distribution since equation (6) is the general term in the multinomial expansion

which gives 7,484,400. This is then divided by 612 which is 2,176,782,336. The quotient is 0.00344.
FITTING THEORETICAL DISTRIBUTIONS TO SAMPLE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS
When one has some indication of the distribution of a population by probabilistic reasoning or
otherwise, it is often possible to ﬁt such theoretical distributions (also called model or expected distribu-
tions) to frequency distributions obtained from a sample of the population. The method used consists in
general of employing the mean and standard deviation of the sample to estimate the mean and sample of
the population (see Problems 7.31, 7.33, and 7.34).
In order to test the goodness of ﬁt of the theoretical distributions, we use the chi-square test (which
is given in Chapter 12). In attempting to determine whether a normal distribution represents a good ﬁt
for given data, it is convenient to use normal-curve graph paper, or probability graph paper as it is
sometimes called (see Problem 7.32).

N ¼ 4 and N ¼ 6, respectively. By writing these coeﬃcients for N ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , as shown in the following
array, we obtain an arrangement called Pascal’s triangle. Note that the ﬁrst and last numbers in each row are
1 and that any other number can be obtained by adding the two numbers to the right and left of it in the
preceding row.

7.9
What is the probability of getting a total of 9 (a) twice and (b) at least twice in 6 tosses of a pair
of dice?
SOLUTION
Each of the 6 ways in which the ﬁrst die can fall can be associated with each of the 6 ways in which the
second die can fall; thus there are 6  6 ¼ 36 ways in which both dice can fall. These are: 1 on the ﬁrst die and
1 on the second die, 1 on the ﬁrst die and 2 on the second die, etc., denoted by (1, 1), (1, 2), etc.
Of these 36 ways (all equally likely if the dice are fair), a total of 9 occurs in 4 cases: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4),
and (6, 3). Thus the probability of a total of 9 in a single toss of a pair of dice is p ¼ 4
36 ¼ 1
9, and the
probability of not getting a total of 9 in a single toss of a pair of dice is q ¼ 1  p ¼ 8

Suppose the number of games in which major league baseball players play during their careers is
normally distributed with mean equal to 1500 games and standard deviation equal to 350 games.
Use EXCEL to solve the following problems. (a) What percentage play in fewer than 750 games?
(b) What percentage play in more than 2000 games? (c) Find the 90th percentile for the number of
games played during a career.
SOLUTION
(a)
The EXCEL statement ¼NORMDIST(750, 1500, 350, 1) requests the area to the left of 750 for a
normal curve having mean equal to 1500 and standard deviation equal to 350. The answer is
Pr{X51500} ¼ 0.0161 or 1.61% play in less than 750 games.
(b)
The EXCEL statement ¼1-NORMDIST(2000, 1500, 350, 1) requests the area to the right of 2000 for a
normal curve having mean equal to 1500 and standard deviation equal to 350. The answer is
Pr{X42000} ¼ 0.0766 or 7.66 % play in more than 2000 games.
(c)
The EXCEL statement ¼NORMINV(0.9, 1500, 350) requests the value on the horizontal axis which is
such that there is 90% of the area to its left under the normal curve having mean equal to 1500 and
standard deviation equal to 350. In the notation of Chapter 3, P90 ¼ 1948.5.
7.17
Find the area under the standard normal curve in the following case:
(a)
Between z ¼ 0.81 and z ¼ 1.94.
(b)
To the right of z ¼ 1.28.
(c)
To the right of z ¼ 2.05 or to the left of z ¼ 1.44.
Use Appendix II as well as EXCEL to solve (a) through (c) [see Figs. 7-6 (a), (b), and (c)].
SOLUTION
(a)
In Appendix II go down the z column until you reach 1.9; then proceed right to the column marked 4.
The result 0.4738 is Pr{0  z  1.94}. Next, go down the z column until you reach 0.8; then proceed
right to the column marked 1. The result 0.2910 is Pr{0  z  0.81}. The area Pr{0.81  z  1.94} is the
diﬀerence of the two, Pr{0  z  1.94}  Pr{0  z  0.81} ¼ 0.4738  0.2910 ¼ 0.1828. Using EXCEL,
the answer is ¼NORMSDIST(1.94)-NORMSDIST(0.81) ¼ 0.1828. When EXCEL is used, the area
Pr{0.81  z  1.94} is the diﬀerence Pr{inﬁnity  z  1.94}  Pr{inﬁnity  z  0.81}. Note that the
table in Appendix II gives areas from 0 to a positive z-value and EXCEL gives the area from –inﬁnity
to the same z-value.
(b)
The area to the right of z ¼ 1.28 is the same as the area to the left of z ¼ 1.28. Using Appendix II, the
area to the left of z ¼ 1.28 is Pr{z  0} þ Pr{05z  1.28} or 0.5 þ 0.3997 ¼ 0.8997. Using EXCEL,
Pr{z  1.28} ¼ Pr{z  1.28} and Pr{z  1.28} is given by ¼NORMSDIST(1.28) or 0.8997.
(c)
Using Appendix II, the area to the right of 2.05 is 0.5  Pr{z  2.05} or 0.5  0.4798 ¼ 0.0202. The area
to the left of 1.44 is the same as the area to the right of 1.44. The area to the right of 1.44 is
0.5  Pr{z  1.44} ¼ 0.5  0.4251 ¼ 0.0749. The two tail areas are equal to 0.0202 þ 0.0749 ¼ 0.0951.
Using EXCEL, the area is given by the following: ¼NORMSDIST(1.44) þ (1  NORMSDIST(2.05))
or 0.0951.
Note in EXCEL, ¼NORMSDIST(z) gives the area under the standard normal curve to the left of z
whereas ¼NORMDIST(z, m, , 1) gives the area under the normal curve having mean m and standard
deviation  to the left of z.

Determine the second quartile (Q2), the third quartile (Q3), and the 90th percentile (P90) for
the times that college students spend on the internet. Use the normal distribution given in
Problem 7.20.
SOLUTION
The second quartile or 50th percentile for the normal distribution will occur at the center of the curve.
Because of the symmetry of the distribution it will occur at the same point as the mean. In the case of the
internet usage, that will be 13.5 hours per week. The EXCEL function ¼NORMINV(0.5, 13.5, 2.5) is used to
ﬁnd the 50th percentile. The 50th percentile means that 0.5 of the area is to the left of the second quartile,

of the times are less than that value; (b) Q3 is the value such that 75% of the times are less than that value;
(c) P90 is the value such that 90% of the times are less than that value.

Figure 7-10 (c) shows that 90% of the area is to the left of P90. The EXCEL function ¼NORMINV
(0.90,13.5,2.5) gives P90 ¼ 16.70.

Using Appendix II, ﬁnd Q3, in Problem 7.21.
SOLUTION
When software such as EXCEL or MINITAB is not available you must work with the standard normal
distribution since it is the only one available in tables.
Using Appendix II in reverse, we see that the area from z ¼ 0 to z ¼ 0.67 is 0.2486 and from z ¼ 0
to z ¼ 0.68 is 0.2518 (see Fig. 7-11). The area from inﬁnity to z ¼ 0.675 is approximately 0.75 since there
is 0.5 from inﬁnity to 0 and 0.25 from 0 to z ¼ 0.675. Therefore 0.675 is roughly the third quartile on the
standard normal curve. Let Q3 be the third quartile on the normal curve having mean ¼ 13.5 and standard
deviation ¼ 2.5 [see Fig. 7-10 (b)]. Now when Q3 is transformed to a z-value, we have 0.675 ¼ (Q3  13.5)/2.5.
Solving this equation for Q3, we have Q3 ¼ 2.5(0.675) þ 13.5 ¼ 15.19, the same answer EXCEL gave in
Problem 7.21.

Washers are produced so that their inside diameter is normally distributed with mean 0.500 inches
(in) and standard deviation equal to 0.005 in. The washers are considered defective if their
inside diameter is less than 0.490 in or greater than 0.510 in. Find the percent defective using
Appendix II and EXCEL.
SOLUTION
0:490 in standard units is 0:490  0:500

0:510 in standard units is 0:510  0:500

From Appendix II, the area to the right of Z ¼ 2.00 is 0.5  0.4772 or 0.0228. The area to the left of
Z ¼ 2.00 is 0.0228. The percent defective is (0.0228 þ 0.0228) 100 ¼ 4.56%. When ﬁnding areas under
a normal curve using Appendix II, we convert to the standard normal curve to ﬁnd the answer.
If EXCEL is used, the answer is ¼ 2*NORMDIST(0.490, 0.500, 0.005, 1) which also gives 4.56%.

The EXCEL plot of the binomial distribution for N ¼ 10 tosses of a fair coin is shown in Fig. 7-13.
Note that even though the binomial distribution is discrete, it has the shape of the continuous
normal distribution. When approximating the binomial probability at 3, 4, 5, and 6 heads by the area
under the normal curve, ﬁnd the normal curve area from X ¼ 2.5 to X ¼ 6.5. The 0.5 that you go on
either side of X ¼ 3 and X ¼ 6 is called the continuity correction. The following are the steps to follow
when

curve from 2.5 to 6.5 as shown in Fig. 7-14. This is the normal approximation to the binomial
distribution.
The solution when using an EXCEL worksheet is given by ¼NORMDIST(6.5, 5, 1.58, 1)  NORMDIST
(2.5, 5, 1.58, 1) which equals 0.7720.
If the technique using Appendix II is applied, the normal values 6.5 and 2.5 are ﬁrst converted to standard
normal values. (2.5 in standard units is 1.58 and 6.5 in standard units is 0.95.) The area between 1.58 and
0.95 from Appendix II is 0.7718. Whichever method is used the answer is very close to the binomial answer
of 0.7734.

Normal approximation to 3, 4, 5, or 6 heads when a coin is tossed 10 times.

(a)
We require the probability that the number of heads will lie between 240 and 260 or, considering the
data to be continuous, between 239.5 and 260.5. Since 239.5 in standard units is (239:5  250)/
11.18 ¼ 0:94, and 260.5 in standard units is 0.94, we have
Required probability ¼ ðarea under normal curve between z ¼ 0:94 and z ¼ 0:94Þ
¼ ðtwice area between z ¼ 0 and z ¼ 0:94Þ ¼ 2ð0:3264Þ ¼ 0:6528
(b)
We require the probability that the number of heads will lie between 220 and 280 or, considering the
data to be continuous, between 219.5 and 280.5. Since 219.5 in standard units is (219:5  250)/
11.18 ¼ 2:73, and 280.5 in standard units is 2.73, we have
Required probability ¼ ðtwice area under normal curve between z ¼ 0 and z ¼ 2:73Þ
¼ 2ð0:4968Þ ¼ 0:9936
It follows that we can be very conﬁdent that the number of heads will not diﬀer from that expected (250)
by more than 30. Thus if it turned out that the actual number of heads was 280, we would strongly
believe that the coin was not fair (i.e., was loaded).

SOLUTION
We have Pr{X heads in a toss of 5 pennies} ¼ pðXÞ ¼ ð5
XÞpXq5X, where p and q are the respective
probabilities of a head and a tail on a single toss of a penny. By Problem 7.11(a), the mean number of heads
is  ¼ Np ¼ 5p. For the actual (or observed) frequency distribution, the mean number of heads is

Table 7.8 lists the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 accidents as obtained from this Poisson distribution,
as well as the expected or theoretical number of days during which X accidents take place (obtained by
multiplying the respective probabilities by 50). For convenience of comparison, column 4 repeats the actual
number of days from Table 7.7.
Note that the ﬁt of the Poisson distribution to the given data is good.
For a true Poisson distribution, the variance 2 ¼ . Computing the variance of the given distribution
gives 0.97. This compares favorably with the value 0.90 for , and this can be taken as further evidence for

CHAPTER 8
Elementary Sampling Theory
SAMPLING THEORY
Sampling theory is a study of relationships existing between a population and samples drawn from
the population. It is of great value in many connections. For example, it is useful in estimating unknown
population quantities (such as population mean and variance), often called population parameters or
brieﬂy parameters, from a knowledge of corresponding sample quantities (such as sample mean and
variance), often called sample statistics or brieﬂy statistics. Estimation problems are considered in
Chapter 9.
Sampling theory is also useful in determining whether the observed diﬀerences between two samples
are due to chance variation or whether they are really signiﬁcant. Such questions arise, for example, in
testing a new serum for use in treatment of a disease or in deciding whether one production process is
better than another. Their answers involve the use of so-called tests of signiﬁcance and hypotheses that are
important in the theory of decisions. These are considered in Chapter 10.
In general, a study of the inferences made concerning a population by using samples drawn from it,
together with indications of the accuracy of such inferences by using probability theory, is called
statistical inference.
RANDOM SAMPLES AND RANDOM NUMBERS
In order that the conclusions of sampling theory and statistical inference be valid, samples must be
chosen so as to be representative of a population. A study of sampling methods and of the related
problems that arise is called the design of the experiment.
One way in which a representative sample may be obtained is by a process called random sampling,
according to which each member of a population has an equal chance of being included in the
sample. One technique for obtaining a random sample is to assign numbers to each member of
the population, write these numbers on small pieces of paper, place them in an urn, and then draw
numbers from the urn, being careful to mix thoroughly before each drawing. An alternative method
is to use a table of random numbers (see Appendix IX) specially constructed for such purposes.
See Problem 8.6.

SAMPLING WITH AND WITHOUT REPLACEMENT
If we draw a number from an urn, we have the choice of replacing or not replacing the number into
the urn before a second drawing. In the ﬁrst case the number can come up again and again, whereas in
the second it can only come up once. Sampling where each member of the population may be chosen
more than once is called sampling with replacement, while if each member cannot be chosen more than
once it is called sampling without replacement.
Populations are either ﬁnite or inﬁnite. If, for example, we draw 10 balls successively
without replacement from an urn containing 100 balls, we are sampling from a ﬁnite population;
while if we toss a coin 50 times and count the number of heads, we are sampling from an inﬁnite
population.
A ﬁnite population in which sampling is with replacement can theoretically be considered inﬁnite,
since any number of samples can be drawn without exhausting the population. For many practical
purposes, sampling from a ﬁnite population that is very large can be considered to be sampling from
an inﬁnite population.
SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS
Consider all possible samples of size N that can be drawn from a given population (either with or
without replacement). For each sample, we can compute a statistic (such as the mean and the standard
deviation) that will vary from sample to sample. In this manner we obtain a distribution of the statistic
that is called its sampling distribution.
If, for example, the particular statistic used is the sample mean, then the distribution is called
the sampling distribution of means, or the sampling distribution of the mean. Similarly, we could have
sampling distributions of standard deviations, variances, medians, proportions, etc.
For each sampling distribution, we can compute the mean, standard deviation, etc. Thus we can
speak of the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means, etc.
SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF MEANS
Suppose that all possible samples of size N are drawn without replacement from a ﬁnite
population of size Np > N. If we denote the mean and standard deviation of the sampling
distribution of means by  X and  X and the population mean and standard deviation by  and ,
respectively, then
 X ¼

 X ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ

If the population is inﬁnite or if sampling is with replacement, the above results reduce to
 X ¼ 
and
 X ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
p
ð2Þ
For large values of N ðN  30Þ, the sampling distribution of means is approximately a normal
distribution with mean  X and standard deviation  X, irrespective of the population (so long as the
population mean and variance are ﬁnite and the population size is at least twice the sample size). This
result for an inﬁnite population is a special case of the central limit theorem of advanced probability
theory, which shows that the accuracy of the approximation improves as N gets larger. This is sometimes
indicated by saying that the sampling distribution is asymptotically normal.

In case the population is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of means is also normally
distributed even for small values of N (i.e., N < 30).
SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF PROPORTIONS
Suppose that a population is inﬁnite and that the probability of occurrence of an event (called its
success) is p, while the probability of nonoccurrence of the event is q ¼ 1  p. For example, the popula-
tion may be all possible tosses of a fair coin in which the probability of the event ‘‘heads’’ is p ¼ 1
2.
Consider all possible samples of size N drawn from this population, and for each sample determine the
proportion P of successes. In the case of the coin, P would be the proportion of heads turning up in N
tosses. We thus obtain a sampling distribution of proportions whose mean P and standard deviation P
are given by
P ¼ p
and
P ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

N
r
¼

which can be obtained from equations (2) by placing  ¼ p and  ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
pq
p
. For large values of N ðN  30Þ,
the sampling distribution is very closely normally distributed. Note that the population is binomially
distributed.
Equations (3) are also valid for a ﬁnite population in which sampling is with replacement. For ﬁnite
populations in which sampling is without replacement, equations (3) are replaced by equations (1) with
 ¼ p and  ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
pq
p
.
Note that equations (3) are obtained most easily by dividing the mean and standard deviation (Np
and
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Npq
p
) of the binomial distribution by N (see Chapter 7).
SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENCES AND SUMS
Suppose that we are given two populations. For each sample of size N1 drawn from the ﬁrst
population, let us compute a statistic S1; this yields a sampling distribution for the statistic S1, whose
mean and standard deviation we denote by S1 and S1, respectively. Similarly, for each sample of size
N2 drawn from the second population, let us compute a statistic S2; this yields a sampling distribution
for the statistic S2, whose mean and standard deviation are denoted by S2 and S2. From all possible
combinations of these samples from the two populations we can obtain a distribution of the diﬀerences,
S1  S2, which is called the sampling distribution of diﬀerences of the statistics. The mean and standard
deviation of this sampling distribution, denoted respectively by S1S2 and S1S2, are given by
S1S2 ¼ S1  S2
and
S1S2 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2
S1 þ 2
S2
q
ð4Þ
provided that the samples chosen do not in any way depend on each other (i.e., the samples are
independent).
If S1, and S2 are the sample means from the two populations—which means we denote by X1 and
X2, respectively—then the sampling distribution of the diﬀerences of means is given for inﬁnite popula-
tions with means and standard deviations ð1, 1Þ and ð2, 2Þ, respectively, by
 X1 X2 ¼  X1   X2 ¼ 1  2

Corresponding results can be obtained for the sampling distributions of diﬀerences of proportions
from two binomially distributed populations with parameters ð p1, q1Þ and ð p2, q2), respectively. In this
case S1 and S2 correspond to the proportion of successes, P1 and P2, and equations (4) yield the results

If N1, and N2 are large ðN1, N2  30), the sampling distributions of diﬀerences of means or proportions

STANDARD ERRORS
The standard deviation of a sampling distribution of a statistic is often called its standard error.
Table 8.1 lists standard errors of sampling distributions for various statistics under the conditions of
random sampling from an inﬁnite (or very large) population or of sampling with replacement from a
ﬁnite population. Also listed are special remarks giving conditions under which results are valid and
other pertinent statements.
The quantities , , p, r and X, s, P, mr denote, respectively, the population and sample means,
standard deviations, proportions, and rth moments about the mean.
It is noted that if the sample size N is large enough, the sampling distributions are normal or nearly
normal. For this reason, the methods are known as large sampling methods. When N <30, samples are
called small. The theory of small samples, or exact sampling theory as it is sometimes called, is treated
in Chapter 11.
When population parameters such as , p, or r, are unknown, they may be estimated closely by
their corresponding sample statistics namely, s (or ^s ¼

SOFTWARE DEMONSTRATION OF ELEMENTARY SAMPLING THEORY
EXAMPLE 1.
A large population has the following random variable deﬁned on it. X represents the number of
computers per household and X is uniformly distributed, that is, p(x) ¼ 0.25 for x ¼ 1, 2, 3, and 4. In
other words, 25% of the households have 1 computer, 25% have 2 computers, 25% have 3 computers,
and 25% have 4 computers. The mean value of X is  ¼ xpðxÞ ¼ 0:25 þ 0:5 þ 0:75 þ 1 ¼ 2:5.
The variance of X is 2 ¼ x2pðxÞ  2 ¼ 0:25 þ 1 þ 2:25 þ 4  6:25 ¼ 1:25. We say that the mean
number of computers per household is 2.5 and the variance of the number of computers is 1.25 per
household.
EXAMPLE 2.
MINITAB may be used to list all samples of two households taken with replacement. The worksheet
would be as in Table 8.2. The 16 samples are shown in C1 and C2 and the mean for each sample in C3.
Because the population is uniformly distributed, each sample mean has probability 1/16. Summarizing,
the probability distribution is given in C4 and C5.
Note that x ¼ xpðxÞ ¼ 1ð0:0625Þ þ 1:5ð0:1250Þ þ    þ 4ð0:0625Þ ¼ 2:5. We see that x ¼ .
Also,

x ¼ 1ð0:0625Þ þ 2:25ð0:1250Þ þ    þ 16ð0:0625Þ  6:25 ¼ 0:625
which
gives
2
x ¼ ð2=2Þ. If MINITAB is used to draw the graph of the probability distribution of xbar, the result
shown in Fig. 8-1 is obtained. (Note that X and xbar are used interchangeably.)

Assume that the heights of 3000 male students at a university are normally distributed with mean
68.0 inches (in) and standard deviation 3.0 in. If 80 samples consisting of 25 students each are
obtained, what would be the expected mean and standard deviation of the resulting sampling
distribution of means if the sampling were done (a) with replacement and (b) without replacement?
SOLUTION
The numbers of samples of size 25 that could be obtained theoretically from a group of 3000 students with
and without replacement are ð3000Þ25 and ð3000
25 Þ, which are much larger than 80. Hence we do not get a true
sampling distribution of means, but only an experimental sampling distribution. Nevertheless, since the number
of samples is large, there should be close agreement between the two sampling distributions. Hence the
expected mean and standard deviation would be close to those of the theoretical distribution. Thus we have:

which is only very slightly less than 0.6 in and can therefore, for all practical purposes, be considered the
same as in sampling with replacement.
Thus we would expect the experimental sampling distribution of means to be approximately
normally distributed with mean 68.0 in and standard deviation 0.6 in.

In how many samples of Problem 8.3 would you expect to ﬁnd the mean (a) between 66.8 and 68.3

Show how to select 30 random samples of 4 students each (with replacement) from Table 2.1
by using random numbers.
(b)
Find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means in part (a).
(c)
Compare the results of part (b) with theoretical values, explaining any discrepancies.
SOLUTION
(a)
Use two digits to number each of the 100 students: 00, 01, 02, . . . , 99 (see Table 8.3). Thus the 5 students
with heights 60–62 in are numbered 00–04, the 18 students with heights 63–65 in are numbered 05–22,
etc. Each student number is called a sampling number.
We now draw sampling numbers from the random-number table (Appendix IX). From the ﬁrst
line we ﬁnd the sequence 51, 77, 27, 46, 40, etc., which we take as random sampling numbers, each of
which yields the height of a particular student. Thus 51 corresponds to a student having height 66–68 in,
which we take as 67 in (the class mark). Similarly, 77, 27, and 46 yield heights of 70, 67, and 67 in,
respectively.
By this process we obtain Table 8.4, which shows the sample numbers drawn, the corresponding
heights, and the mean height for each of 30 samples. It should be mentioned that although we have
entered the random-number table on the ﬁrst line, we could have started anywhere and chosen any
speciﬁed pattern.
(b)
Table 8.5 gives the frequency distribution of the sample mean heights obtained in part (a). This is a
sampling distribution of means. The mean and the standard deviation are obtained as usual by the

The theoretical mean of the sampling distribution of means, given by  X, should equal the population

heads and (b) 5
8 or more will be heads.

We consider the 120 tosses of the coin to be a sample from the inﬁnite population of all possible tosses
of the coin. In this population the probability of heads is p ¼ 1
2 and the probability of tails is q ¼ 1  p ¼ 1

We require the probability that the number of heads in 120 tosses will be less than 48 or more than 72.

Normal approximation to the binomial uses the standard normal curve.

1=2N ¼ 1=2ð120Þ from 0.40 and add 1=2N ¼ 1=2ð120Þ to 0.60; thus, since 1=240 ¼ 0:00417, the

Each person of a group of 500 people tosses a fair coin 120 times. How many people should be
expected to report that (a) between 40% and 60% of their tosses resulted in heads and (b) 5
8 or
more of their tosses resulted in heads?
SOLUTION
This problem is closely related to Problem 8.7. Here we consider 500 samples, of size 120 each, from the
inﬁnite population of all possible tosses of a coin.
(a)
Part (a) of Problem 8.7 states that of all possible samples, each consisting of 120 tosses of a coin, we can
expect to ﬁnd 97.74% with a percentage of heads between 40% and 60%. In 500 samples we can thus
expect to ﬁnd about (97.74% of 500Þ ¼ 489 samples with this property. It follows that about 489 people
would be expected to report that their experiment resulted in between 40% and 60% heads.
It is interesting to note that 500  489 ¼ 11 people who would be expected to report that the
percentage of heads was not between 40% and 60%. Such people might reasonably conclude that
their coins were loaded even though they were fair. This type of error is an everpresent risk whenever
we deal with probability.
(b)
By reasoning as in part (a), we conclude that about ð500Þð0:0040Þ ¼ 2 persons would report that 5
8 or
more of their tosses resulted in heads.
8.9

On a continuous-variable basis, 5 or more heads means 4.5 or more heads, so that the diﬀerence in
proportions should be 4:5=50 ¼ 0:09 or more; that is, z is greater than or equal to ð0:09  0Þ=0:10 ¼ 0:9 (or
z  0:9). The probability of this is the area under the normal curve to the right of z ¼ 0:9, which is
ð0:5000  0:3159Þ ¼ 0:1841.
Thus the odds against A winning are ð1  0:1841Þ:0:1841 ¼ 0:8159:0:1841, or 4.43 to 1.

CHAPTER 9
Statistical Estimation Theory
ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS
In the Chapter 8 we saw how sampling theory can be employed to obtain information about samples
drawn at random from a known population. From a practical viewpoint, however, it is often more
important to be able to infer information about a population from samples drawn from it. Such
problems are dealt with in statistical inference, which uses principles of sampling theory.
One important problem of statistical inference is the estimation of population parameters, or brieﬂy
parameters (such as population mean and variance), from the corresponding sample statistics, or brieﬂy
statistics (such as sample mean and variance). We consider this problem in this chapter.
UNBIASED ESTIMATES
If the mean of the sampling distribution of a statistic equals the corresponding population
parameter, the statistic is called an unbiased estimator of the parameter; otherwise, it is called a
biased estimator. The corresponding values of such statistics are called unbiased or biased estimates,
respectively.
EXAMPLE 1.
The mean of the sampling distribution of means  X is , the population mean. Hence the sample
mean X is an unbiased estimate of the population mean .
EXAMPLE 2.
The mean of the sampling distribution of variances is
s2 ¼ N  1
N
2
where 2 is the population variance and N is the sample size (see Table 8.1). Thus the sample variance s2 is a biased
estimate of the population variance 2. By using the modiﬁed variance
^s2 ¼
N
N  1 s2
we ﬁnd ^s2 ¼ 2, so that ^s2 is an unbiased estimate of 2. However, ^s is a biased estimate of .

In the language of expectation (see Chapter 6) we could say that a statistic is unbiased if its
expectation equals the corresponding population parameter. Thus
X and ^s2 are unbiased since
Ef Xg ¼  and Ef^s2g ¼ 2.
EFFICIENT ESTIMATES
If the sampling distributions of two statistics have the same mean (or expectation), then the statistic
with the smaller variance is called an eﬃcient estimator of the mean, while the other statistic is called an
ineﬃcient estimator. The corresponding values of the statistics are called eﬃcient and uneﬃcient estimates.
If we consider all possible statistics whose sampling distributions have the same mean, the one with
the smallest variance is sometimes called the most eﬃcient, or best, estimator of this mean.
EXAMPLE 3.
The sampling distributions of the mean and median both have the same mean, namely, the popula-
tion mean. However, the variance of the sampling distribution of means is smaller than the variance of the sampling
distribution of medians (see Table 8.1). Hence the sample mean gives an eﬃcient estimate of the population mean,
while the sample median gives an ineﬃcient estimate of it.
Of all statistics estimating the population mean, the sample mean provides the best (or most eﬃcient) estimate.
In practice, ineﬃcient estimates are often used because of the relative ease with which some of them
can be obtained.
POINT ESTIMATES AND INTERVAL ESTIMATES; THEIR RELIABILITY
An estimate of a population parameter given by a single number is called a point estimate of the
parameter. An estimate of a population parameter given by two numbers between which the parameter
may be considered to lie is called an interval estimate of the parameter.
Interval estimates indicate the precision, or accuracy, of an estimate and are therefore preferable to
point estimates.
EXAMPLE 4.
If we say that a distance is measured as 5.28 meters (m), we are giving a point estimate. If, on the
other hand, we say that the distance is 5:28  0:03 m (i.e., the distance lies between 5.25 and 5.31 m), we are giving an
interval estimate.
A statement of the error (or precision) of an estimate is often called its reliability.
CONFIDENCE-INTERVAL ESTIMATES OF POPULATION PARAMETERS
Let S and S be the mean and standard deviation (standard error), respectively, of the sampling
distribution of a statistic S. Then if the sampling distribution of S is approximately normal (which as we
have seen is true for many statistics if the sample size N  30), we can expect to ﬁnd an actual sample
statistic S lying in the intervals S  S to S þ S, S  2S to S þ 2S, or S  3S to S þ 3S about
68.27%, 95.45%, and 99.73% of the time, respectively.
Equivalently, we can expect to ﬁnd (or we can be conﬁdent of ﬁnding) S in the intervals S  S to
S þ S, S  2S to S þ 2S, or S  3S to S þ 3S about 68.27%, 95.45%, and 99.73% of the time,
respectively. Because of this, we call these respective intervals the 68.27%, 95.45%, and 99.73% con-
ﬁdence intervals for estimating S. The end numbers of these intervals (S  S, S  2S, and S  3S) are
then called the 68.27%, 95.45%, and 99.73% conﬁdence limits, or ﬁducial limits.
Similarly, S  1:96S and S  2:58S are the 95% and 99% (or 0.95 and 0.99) conﬁdence limits
for S. The percentage conﬁdence is often called the conﬁdence level. The numbers 1.96, 2.58, etc., in
the conﬁdence limits are called conﬁdence coeﬃcients, or critical values, and are denoted by zc. From
conﬁdence levels we can ﬁnd conﬁdence coeﬃcients, and vice versa.

Table 9.1 shows the values of zc corresponding to various conﬁdence levels used in practice. For
conﬁdence levels not presented in the table, the values of zc can be found from the normal-curve area
tables (see Appendix II).
Conﬁdence Intervals for Means
If the statistic S is the sample mean X, then the 95% and 99% conﬁdence limits for estimating the
population mean , are given by X  1:96 X and X  2:58 X, respectively. More generally, the con-
ﬁdence limits are given by X  zc X, where zc (which depends on the particular level of conﬁdence
desired) can be read from Table 9.1. Using the values of  X obtained in Chapter 8, we see that the
conﬁdence limits for the population mean are given by
X  zc

Np  N

ð2Þ
if the sampling is without replacement from a population of ﬁnite size Np.
Generally, the population standard deviation  is unknown; thus, to obtain the above conﬁdence
limits, we use the sample estimate ^s or s. This will prove satisfactory when N  30. For N < 30, the
approximation is poor and small sampling theory must be employed (see Chapter 11).
Conﬁdence Intervals for Proportions
If the statistic S is the proportion of ‘‘successes’’ in a sample of size N drawn from a binomial
population in which p is the proportion of successes (i.e., the probability of success), then the conﬁdence
limits for p are given by P  zcP, where P is the proportion of successes in the sample of size N. Using
the values of P obtained in Chapter 8, we see that the conﬁdence limits for the population proportion
are given by

Problem 9.12.

95% conﬁdence interval for the population mean  is 66.88 to 68.02 in, which can be denoted
by 66:88 <  < 68:02.
We can therefore say that the probability that the population mean height lies between 66.88 and
68.02 in is about 95%, or 0.95. In symbols we write Prf66:88 <  < 68:02g ¼ 0:95. This is equivalent to
saying that we are 95% conﬁdent that the population mean (or true mean) lies between 66.88 and

In obtaining the above conﬁdence intervals, we assumed that the population was inﬁnite or so large

Blaises’ Christmas Tree Farm has 5000 trees that are mature and ready to be cut and sold.
One-hundred of the trees are randomly selected and their heights measured. The heights in inches
are given in Table 9.2. Use MINITAB to set a 95% conﬁdence interval on the mean height of all
5000 trees. If the trees sell for $2.40 per foot, give a lower and an upper bound on the value of the
5000 trees.
SOLUTION
The MINITAB conﬁdence interval given below indicates that the mean height for the 5000 trees could
be as small as 57.24 or as large as 61.20 inches. The total number of inches for all 5000 trees ranges between
ð57:24Þð5000Þ ¼ 286;2000 and ð61:20Þð5000Þ ¼ 306;000. If the trees sell for $2.40 per foot, then cost

per inch is $0.2. The value of the trees ranges between ð286;000Þð0:2Þ ¼ $57;200 and ð306;000Þð0:2Þ ¼
$61;200 with 95% conﬁdence.

In measuring reaction time, a psychologist estimates that the standard deviation is 0.05 seconds
(s). How large a sample of measurements must he take in order to be (a) 95% and (b) 99%
conﬁdent that the error of his estimate will not exceed 0.01 s?

What are the 95% conﬁdence limits for estimates of the mean of the 200 grades?
(b)
With what degree of conﬁdence could we say that the mean of all 200 grades is 75  1?

CHAPTER 10
Statistical Decision Theory
STATISTICAL DECISIONS
Very often in practice we are called upon to make decisions about populations on the basis of sample
information. Such decisions are called statistical decisions. For example, we may wish to decide on the
basis of sample data whether a new serum is really eﬀective in curing a disease, whether one educational
procedure is better than another, or whether a given coin is loaded.
STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES
In attempting to reach decisions, it is useful to make assumptions (or guesses) about the populations
involved. Such assumptions, which may or may not be true, are called statistical hypotheses. They are
generally statements about the probability distributions of the populations.
Null Hypotheses
In many instances we formulate a statistical hypothesis for the sole purpose of rejecting or
nullifying it. For example, if we want to decide whether a given coin is loaded, we formulate the
hypothesis that the coin is fair (i.e., p ¼ 0:5, where p is the probability of heads). Similarly, if we
want to decide whether one procedure is better than another, we formulate the hypothesis that there
is no diﬀerence between the procedures (i.e., any observed diﬀerences are due merely to ﬂuctuations
in sampling from the same population). Such hypotheses are often called null hypotheses and are
denoted by H0.
Alternative Hypotheses
Any hypothesis that diﬀers from a given hypothesis is called an alternative hypothesis. For example,
if one hypothesis is p ¼ 0:5, alternative hypotheses might be p ¼ 0:7, p 6¼ 0:5, or p > 0:5. A hypothesis
alternative to the null hypothesis is denoted by H1.

TESTS OF HYPOTHESES AND SIGNIFICANCE, OR DECISION RULES
If we suppose that a particular hypothesis is true but ﬁnd that the results observed in a random
sample diﬀer markedly from the results expected under the hypothesis (i.e., expected on the basis of pure
chance, using sampling theory), then we would say that the observed diﬀerences are signiﬁcant and would
thus be inclined to reject the hypothesis (or at least not accept it on the basis of the evidence obtained).
For example, if 20 tosses of a coin yield 16 heads, we would be inclined to reject the hypothesis that the
coin is fair, although it is conceivable that we might be wrong.
Procedures that enable us to determine whether observed samples diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the results
expected, and thus help us decide whether to accept or reject hypotheses, are called tests of hypotheses,
tests of signiﬁcance, rules of decision, or simply decision rules.
TYPE I AND TYPE II ERRORS
If we reject a hypothesis when it should be accepted, we say that a Type I error has been made. If, on
the other hand, we accept a hypothesis when it should be rejected, we say that a Type II error has been
made. In either case, a wrong decision or error in judgment has occurred.
In order for decision rules (or tests of hypotheses) to be good, they must be designed so as to
minimize errors of decision. This is not a simple matter, because for any given sample size, an attempt
to decrease one type of error is generally accompanied by an increase in the other type of error. In
practice, one type of error may be more serious than the other, and so a compromise should be reached
in favor of limiting the more serious error. The only way to reduce both types of error is to increase the
sample size, which may or may not be possible.
LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE
In testing a given hypothesis, the maximum probability with which we would be willing to risk a
Type I error is called the level of signiﬁcance, or signiﬁcance level, of the test. This probability, often
denoted by , is generally speciﬁed before any samples are drawn so that the results obtained will not
inﬂuence our choice.
In practice, a signiﬁcance level of 0.05 or 0.01 is customary, although other values are used. If, for
example, the 0.05 (or 5%) signiﬁcance level is chosen in designing a decision rule, then there are about
5 chances in 100 that we would reject the hypothesis when it should be accepted; that is, we are about 95%
conﬁdent that we have made the right decision. In such case we say that the hypothesis has been rejected
at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, which means that the hypothesis has a 0.05 probability of being wrong.
TESTS INVOLVING NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
To illustrate the ideas presented above, suppose that under a given hypothesis the sampling dis-
tribution of a statistic S is a normal distribution with mean S and standard deviation S. Thus the
distribution of the standardized variable (or z score), given by z ¼ ðS  SÞ=S, is the standardized
normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1), as shown in Fig. 10-1.
As indicated in Fig. 10-1, we can be 95% conﬁdent that if the hypothesis is true, then the z score of
an actual sample statistic S will lie between 1:96 and 1.96 (since the area under the normal curve
between these values is 0.95). However, if on choosing a single sample at random we ﬁnd that the z score
of its statistic lies outside the range 1:96 to 1.96, we would conclude that such an event could happen
with a probability of only 0.05 (the total shaded area in the ﬁgure) if the given hypothesis were true. We
would then say that this z score diﬀered signiﬁcantly from what would be expected under the hypothesis,
and we would then be inclined to reject the hypothesis.
The total shaded area 0.05 is the signiﬁcance level of the test. It represents the probability of our
being wrong in rejecting the hypothesis (i.e., the probability of making a Type I error). Thus we say that

the hypothesis is rejected at 0.05 the signiﬁcance level or that the z score of the given sample statistic is
signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level.
The set of z scores outside the range 1:96 to 1.96 constitutes what is called the critical region of the
hypothesis, the region of rejection of the hypothesis, or the region of signiﬁcance. The set of z scores inside
the range 1:96 to 1.96 is thus called the region of acceptance of the hypothesis, or the region of non-
signiﬁcance.
On the basis of the above remarks, we can formulate the following decision rule (or test of hypoth-
esis or signiﬁcance):
Reject the hypothesis at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level if the z score of the statistic S lies outside the range
1:96 to 1.96 (i.e., either z >1:96 or z <1:96). This is equivalent to saying that the observed sample
statistic is signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level.
Accept the hypothesis otherwise (or, if desired, make no decision at all).
Because the z score plays such an important part in tests of hypotheses, it is also called a test statistic.
It should be noted that other signiﬁcance levels could have been used. For example, if the 0.01 level
were used, we would replace 1.96 everywhere above with 2.58 (see Table 10.1). Table 9.1 can also be
used, since the sum of the signiﬁcance and conﬁdence levels is 100%.
TWO-TAILED AND ONE-TAILED TESTS
In the above test we were interested in extreme values of the statistic S or its corresponding z score
on both sides of the mean (i.e., in both tails of the distribution). Such tests are thus called two-sided tests,
or two-tailed tests.
Often, however, we may be interested only in extreme values to one side of the mean (i.e., in one tail
of the distribution), such as when we are testing the hypothesis that one process is better than another
(which is diﬀerent from testing whether one process is better or worse than the other). Such tests are

called one-sided tests, or one-tailed tests. In such cases the critical region is a region to one side of the
distribution, with area equal to the level of signiﬁcance.
Table 10.1, which gives critical values of z for both one-tailed and two-tailed tests at various levels of
signiﬁcance, will be found useful for reference purposes. Critical values of z for other levels of signiﬁ-
cance are found from the table of normal-curve areas (Appendix II).
SPECIAL TESTS
For large samples, the sampling distributions of many statistics are normal distributions (or at least
nearly normal), and the above tests can be applied to the corresponding z scores. The following special
cases, taken from Table 8.1, are just a few of the statistics of practical interest. In each case the results
hold for inﬁnite populations or for sampling with replacement. For sampling without replacement from
ﬁnite populations, the results must be modiﬁed. See page 182.

The results for other statistics can be obtained similarly.
OPERATING-CHARACTERISTIC CURVES; THE POWER OF A TEST
We have seen how the Type I error can be limited by choosing the signiﬁcance level properly. It is
possible to avoid risking Type II errors altogether simply by not making them, which amounts to never
accepting hypotheses. In many practical cases, however, this cannot be done. In such cases, use is often
made of operating-characteristic curves, or OC curves, which are graphs showing the probabilities of
Type II errors under various hypotheses. These provide indications of how well a given test will enable us
to minimize Type II errors; that is, they indicate the power of a test to prevent us from making wrong
decisions. They are useful in designing experiments because they show such things as what sample sizes
to use.
p-VALUES FOR HYPOTHESES TESTS
The p-value is the probability of observing a sample statistic as extreme or more extreme than the
one observed under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. When testing a hypothesis, state the

value of a. Calculate your p-value and if the p-value a, then reject H0. Otherwise, do not reject H0.
For testing means, using large samples (n430), calculate the p-value as follows:
1. For H0 : m ¼ m0 and H1 : m5m0, p-value ¼ P(Z5computed test statistic),
2. For H0 : m ¼ m0 and H1 : m4m0, p-value ¼ P(Z4computed test statistic), and
3. For H0 : m ¼ m0 and H1 : m6¼ m0, p-value ¼ P(Z5j computed test statistic j) þ P(Z4 j computed
test statistic j).
The computed test statistic is x  0
ðs=
ﬃﬃﬃn
p Þ, where x is the mean of the sample, s is the standard deviation
of the sample, and 0 is the value speciﬁed for  in the null hypothesis. Note that if  is unknown, it is
estimated from the sample by using s. This method of testing hypothesis is equivalent to the method of
ﬁnding a critical value or values and if the computed test statistic falls in the rejection region, reject the
null hypothesis. The same decision will be reached using either method.
CONTROL CHARTS
It is often important in practice to know when a process has changed suﬃciently that steps should be
taken to remedy the situation. Such problems arise, for example, in quality control. Quality control
supervisors must often decide whether observed changes are due simply to chance ﬂuctuations or are
due to actual changes in a manufacturing process because of deteriorating machine parts, employees’
mistakes, etc. Control charts provide a useful and simple method for dealing with such problems
(see Problem 10.16).
TESTS INVOLVING SAMPLE DIFFERENCES
Diﬀerences of Means
Let X1 and X2 be the sample means obtained in large samples of sizes N1 and N2 drawn from
respective populations having means 1 and 2 and standard deviations 1 and 2. Consider the null
hypothesis that there is no diﬀerence between the population means (i.e., 1 ¼ 2), which is to say that
the samples are drawn from two populations having the same mean.
Placing 1 ¼ 2 in equation (5) of Chapter 8, we see that the sampling distribution of
diﬀerences in means is approximately normally distributed, with its mean and standard deviation
given by
 X1 X2 ¼ 0

we can test the null hypothesis against alternative hypotheses (or the signiﬁcance of an observed diﬀer-
ence) at an appropriate level of signiﬁcance.
Diﬀerences of Proportions
Let P1 and P2 be the sample proportions obtained in large samples of sizes N1 and N2 drawn from
respective populations having proportions p1 and p2. Consider the null hypothesis that there is no
diﬀerence between the population parameters (i.e., p1 ¼ p2) and thus that the samples are really
drawn from the same population.

Placing p1 ¼ p2 ¼ p in equation (6) of Chapter 8, we see that the sampling distribution of diﬀerences
in proportions is approximately normally distributed, with its mean and standard deviation given by

we can test observed diﬀerences at an appropriate level of signiﬁcance and thereby test the null

Tests involving other statistics can be designed similarly.
TESTS INVOLVING BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Tests involving binomial distributions (as well as other distributions) can be designed in a manner
analogous to those using normal distributions; the basic principles are essentially the same. See Problems
10.23 to 10.28.

To test the hypothesis that a coin is fair, adopt the following decision rule:
Accept the hypothesis if the number of heads in a single sample of 100 tosses is between 40
and 60 inclusive.
Reject the hypothesis otherwise.
(a)
Find the probability of rejecting the hypothesis when it is actually correct.
(b)
Graph the decision rule and the result of part (a).
(c)
What conclusions would you draw if the sample of 100 tosses yielded 53 heads? And if it
yielded 60 heads?
(d)
Could you be wrong in your conclusions about part (c)? Explain.
SOLUTION
(a)
From Problem 10.1, the probability of not getting between 40 and 60 heads inclusive if the coin
is fair is 1  0:9642 ¼ 0:0358. Thus the probability of rejecting the hypothesis when it is correct
is 0.0358.
(b)
The decision rule is illustrated in Fig. 10-2, which shows the probability distribution of heads in 100
tosses of a fair coin. If a single sample of 100 tosses yields a z score between 2:10 and 2.10, we accept
the hypothesis; otherwise, we reject the hypothesis and decide that the coin is not fair.
The error made in rejecting the hypothesis when it should be accepted is the Type 1 error of
the decision rule; and the probability of making this error, equal to 0.0358 from part (a), is
represented by the total shaded area of the ﬁgure. If a single sample of 100 tosses yields a number
of heads whose z score (or z statistic) lies in the shaded regions, we would say that this z score
diﬀered signiﬁcantly from what would be expected if the hypothesis were true. For this reason,
the total shaded area (i.e., the probability of a Type I error) is called the signiﬁcance level of the
decision rule and equals 0.0358 in this case. Thus we speak of rejecting the hypothesis at the 0.0358
(or 3.58%) signiﬁcance level.
(c)
According to the decision rule, we would have to accept the hypothesis that the coin is fair
in both cases. One might argue that if only one more head had been obtained, we would have
rejected the hypothesis. This is what one must face when any sharp line of division is used in making
decisions.
(d)
Yes. We could accept the hypothesis when it actually should be rejected—as would be the case, for
example, when the probability of heads is really 0.7 instead of 0.5. The error made in accepting the
hypothesis when it should be rejected is the Type II error of the decision.

Using the binomial distribution and not the normal approximation to the binomial distribution,
design a decision rule to test the hypothesis that a coin is fair if a sample of 64 tosses of the coin is
taken and a signiﬁcance level of 0.05 is used. Use MINITAB to assist with the solution.

P(X  41) ¼ 0.01638. The rejection region {X  23 and X  41} has probability 2(0.01638) ¼ 0.03276.
The rejection region {X  24 and X  40} would exceed 0.05. When the binomial distribution is used we cannot
have a rejection region equal to exactly 0.05. The closest we can get to 0.05 without exceeding it is 0.03276.
Summarizing, the coin will be ﬂipped 64 times. It will be declared unfair or not balanced if 23 or fewer
heads or 41 or more heads are obtained. The chance of making a Type 1 error is 0.03276 which is as close to
0.05 as you can get without exceeding it.

In an experiment on extrasensory perception (ESP), an individual (subject) in one room is asked
to state the color (red or blue) of a card chosen from a deck of 50 well-shuﬄed cards by an
individual in another room. It is unknown to the subject how many red or blue cards are in the
deck. If the subject identiﬁes 32 cards correctly, determine whether the results are signiﬁcant at the
(a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01 levels.
Z
Critical region
Fig. 10-4
Determining the Z value that will give a critical region equal to 0.05.

SOLUTION
If p is the probability of the subject choosing the color of a card correctly, then we have to decide
between two hypotheses:
H0 : p ¼ 0:5, and the subject is simply guessing (i.e., the results are due to chance).
H1 : p > 0:5, and the subject has powers of ESP.
Since we are not interested in the subject’s ability to obtain extremely low scores, but only in the ability
to obtain high scores, we choose a one-tailed test. If hypothesis H0 is true, then the mean and standard
deviation of the number of cards identiﬁed correctly are given by
 ¼ Np ¼ 50ð0:5Þ ¼ 25
and

(a)
For a one-tailed test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we must choose z in Fig. 10-4 so that the shaded area
in the critical region of high scores is 0.05. The area between 0 and z is 0.4500, and z ¼ 1.645; this can
also be read from Table 10.1. Thus our decision rule (or test of signiﬁcance) is:
If the z score observed is greater than 1.645, the results are signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level and the
individual has powers of ESP.
If the z score is less than 1.645, the results are due to chance (i.e., not signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level).
Since 32 in standard units is ð32  25Þ=3:54 ¼ 1:98, which is greater than 1.645, we conclude at the
0.05 level that the individual has powers of ESP.
Note that we should really apply a continuity correction, since 32 on a continuous scale is between
31.5 and 32.5. However, 31.5 has a standard score of ð31:5  25Þ=3:54 ¼ 1:84, and so the same con-
clusion is reached.
(b)
If the signiﬁcance level is 0.01, then the area between 0 and z is 0.4900, from which we conclude that
z ¼ 2.33.
Since 32 (or 31.5) in standard units is 1.98 (or 1.84), which is less than 2.33, we conclude that the results
are not signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level.
Some statisticians adopt the terminology that results signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level are highly signiﬁcant,
that results signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level but not at the 0.01 level are probably signiﬁcant, and that results
signiﬁcant at levels larger than 0.05 are not signiﬁcant. According to this terminology, we would conclude
that the above experimental results are probably signiﬁcant, so that further investigations of the phenomena
are probably warranted.
Since signiﬁcance levels serve as guides in making decisions, some statisticians quote the actual prob-
abilities involved. For instance, since prfz  1:84g ¼ 0:0322, in this problem, the statistician could say that
on the basis of the experiment the chances of being wrong in concluding that the individual has powers of
ESP are about 3 in 100. The quoted probability (0.0322 in this case) is called the p-value for the test.

The claim is made that 40% of tax ﬁlers use computer software to ﬁle their taxes. In a sample of
50, 14 used computer software to ﬁle their taxes. Test H0 : p ¼ 0.4 versus Ha : p50.4 at  ¼ 0:05
where p is the population proportion who use computer software to ﬁle their taxes. Test using the
binomial distribution and test using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.
SOLUTION
If the exact test of H0 : p ¼ 0.4 versus Ha : p50.4 at  ¼ 0:05 is used, the null is rejected if X  15. This is
called the rejection region. If the test based on the normal approximation to the binomial is used, the null is
rejected if Z51.645 and this is called the rejection region. X ¼ 14 is called the test statistic. The binomial
test statistic is in the rejection region and the null is rejected. Using the normal approximation, the test
statistic is z ¼ 1420
3:46 ¼ 1:73. The actual value of a is 0.054 and the rejection region is X  15 and the
cumulative binomial probability P(X  15) is used. If the normal approximation is used, you would also
reject since z ¼ 1:73 is in the rejection region which is Z51.645. Note that if the binomial distribution is
used to perform the test, the test statistic has a binomial distribution. If the normal distribution is used to test
the hypothesis, the test statistic, Z, has a standard normal distribution.

10.7
The p-value for a test of hypothesis is deﬁned to be the smallest level of signiﬁcance at which the
null hypothesis is rejected. This problem illustrates the computation of the p-value for a statistical
test. Use the data in Problem 9.6 to test the null hypothesis that the mean height of all the trees on
the farm equals 5 feet (ft) versus the alternative hypothesis that the mean height is less than 5 ft.
Find the p-value for this test.
SOLUTION
The computed value for z is z ¼ ð59:22  60Þ=1:01 ¼ 0:77. The smallest level of signiﬁcance at which
the null hypothesis would be rejected is p-value ¼ Pðz < 0:77Þ ¼ 0:5  0:2794 ¼ 0:2206: The null hypoth-
esis is rejected if the p-value is less than the pre-set level of signiﬁcance. In this problem, if the level of
signiﬁcance is pre-set at 0.05, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. The MINITAB solution is as follows
where the subcommand Alternative-1 indicates a lower-tail test.

The breaking strengths of cables produced by a manufacturer have a mean of 1800 pounds (lb)
and a standard deviation of 100 lb. By a new technique in the manufacturing process, it is claimed
that the breaking strength can be increased. To test this claim, a sample of 50 cables is tested and
it is found that the mean breaking strength is 1850 lb. Can we support the claim at the 0.01
signiﬁcance level?
SOLUTION
We have to decide between the two hypotheses:
H0 :  ¼ 1800 lb, and there is really no change in breaking strength.
H1 :  > 1800 lb, and there is a change in breaking strength.
A one-tailed test should be used here; the diagram associated with this test is identical with Fig. 10-4 of
Problem 10.5(a). At the 0.01 signiﬁcance level, the decision rule is:
If the z score observed is greater than 2.33, the results are signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level and H0 is rejected.
Otherwise, H0 is accepted (or the decision is withheld).
Under the hypothesis that H0 is true, we ﬁnd that

is not less than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. Refer to Fig. 10-6 to see the graphically the
computed p-value for this problem.
10.11 Refer to Problem 10.10. Use the statistical software MINITAB to analyze the data. Note that the

In the ﬁrst portion of the SPSS output, the needed statistics are given. Note that the computed test
statistic is referred to as t, not z. This is because for n430, the t and the z distribution are very
similar. The t distribution has a parameter called the degrees of freedom that is equal to n  1:
The p-value computed by SPSS is always a two-tailed p-value and is referred to as Sig.(2-tailed). It is
equal to 0.002. The 1-tailed value is 0.002/2 ¼ 0.001. This is close to the value found in Problem 10.14
which equals 0.00054. When using computer software, the user must become aware of the idiosyncrasies
of the software.
CONTROL CHARTS
10.16 A control chart is used to control the amount of mustard put into containers. The mean amount
of ﬁll is 496 grams (g) and the standard deviation is 5 g. To determine if the machine ﬁlling the
mustard containers is in proper working order, a sample of 5 is taken every hour for all eight h in
the day. The data for two days is given in Table 10.5.
(a)
Design a decision rule whereby one can be fairly certain that the mean ﬁll is being main-
tained at 496 g with a standard deviation equal to 5 g for the two days.

SOLUTION
(a)
With 99.73% conﬁdence we can say that the sample mean x must lie in the range mx  3x to mx þ 3x
or   3 ﬃﬃﬃn
p
to  þ 3 ﬃﬃﬃn
p . Since m ¼ 496,  ¼ 5, and n ¼ 5, it follows that with 99.73% conﬁdence, the
sample mean should fall in the interval 496  3 5ﬃﬃﬃ
5
p
to 496 þ 3 5ﬃﬃﬃ
5
p or between 489.29 and 502.71. Hence
our decision rule is as follows:
If a sample mean falls inside the range 489.29 g to 502.71 g, assume the machine ﬁll is correct.
Otherwise, conclude that the ﬁlling machine is not in proper working order and seek to determine
the reasons for the incorrect ﬁlls.
(b)
A record of the sample means can be kept by the use of a chart such as shown in Fig. 10-11, called
a quality control chart. Each time a sample mean is computed, it is represented by a particular point.
As long as the points lie between the lower limit and the upper limit, the process is under control.
When a point goes outside these control limits, there is a possibility that something is wrong and
investigation is warranted.

chart shown in Fig. 10-11.
The control limits speciﬁed above are called the 99.73% conﬁdence limits, or brieﬂy, the 3 limits.
Other conﬁdence limits (such as 99% or 95% limits) could be determined as well. The choice in each case
depends on the particular circumstances.
TESTS INVOLVING DIFFERENCES OF MEANS AND PROPORTIONS
10.17 An examination was given to two classes consisting of 40 and 50 students, respectively. In the ﬁrst
class the mean grade was 74 with a standard deviation of 8, while in the second class the mean
grade was 78 with a standard deviation of 7. Is there a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the perfor-
mance of the two classes at the (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01 levels?
SOLUTION
Suppose that the two classes come from two populations having the respective means 1 and 2.
We thus need to decide between the hypotheses:
H0 : 1 ¼ 2, and the diﬀerence is due merely to chance.
H1 : 1 6¼ 2, and there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the classes.

(a)
For a two-tailed test, the results are signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level if z lies outside the range 1:96 to 1.96.
Hence we conclude that at the 0.05 level there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in performance between the
two classes and that the second class is probably better.
(b)
For a two-tailed test, the results are signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level if z lies outside the range 2:58 and 2.58.
Hence we conclude that at the 0.01 level there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the classes.
Since the results are signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level but not at the 0.01 level, we conclude that the results are
probably signiﬁcant (according to the terminology used at the end of Problem 10.5).
10.18 The mean height of 50 male students who showed above-average participation in college athletics
was 68.2 inches (in) with a standard deviation of 2.5 in, while 50 male students who showed no
interest in such participation had a mean height of 67.5 in with a standard deviation of 2.8 in.
Test the hypothesis that male students who participate in college athletics are taller than other
male students.
SOLUTION
We must decide between the hypotheses:
H0 : 1 ¼ 2, and there is no diﬀerence between the mean heights.
H1 : 1 > 2, and the mean height of the ﬁrst group is greater than that of the second group.

Using a one-tailed test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we would reject hypothesis H0 if the z score were greater
than 1.645. Thus we cannot reject the hypothesis at this level of signiﬁcance.
It should be noted, however, that the hypothesis can be rejected at the 0.10 level if we are willing to take
the risk of being wrong with a probability of 0.10 (i.e., 1 chance in 10).
10.19 A study was undertaken to compare the mean time spent on cell phones by male and female
college students per week. Fifty male and 50 female students were selected from Midwestern
University and the number of hours per week spent talking on their cell phones determined.
The results in hours are shown in Table 10.6. It is desired to test H0 : 1  2 ¼ 0 versus
Ha : m1  m2 6¼ 0 based on these samples. Use EXCEL to ﬁnd the p-value and reach a decision
about the null hypothesis.

SOLUTION
The data in Table 10.6 are entered into an EXCEL worksheet as shown in Fig. 10-12. The male data are
entered into A2 : E11 and the female data are entered into F2:J11. The variance of the male data is computed
by entering ¼ VAR(A2 : E11) into A14. The variance of female data is computed by entering
¼ VAR(F2 : J11) into A15. The mean of male data is computed by entering ¼ AVERAGE(A2 : E11)

into A16. The mean of female data is computed by entering ¼ AVERAGE(F2 : J11) into A17. The test
statistic is ¼ (A16-A17)/SQRT(A14/50þA15/50) and is shown in A19. The test statistic has a standard
normal distribution and a value of 0.304. The expression ¼ 2*(1-NORMSDIST(A19)) computes the area
to the right of 0.304 and doubles it. This gives a p-value of 0.761.
Since the p-value is not smaller than any of the usual  values such as 0.01 or 0.05, the null hypothesis is
not rejected. The probability of obtaining samples like the one we obtained is 0.761, assuming the null
hypothesis to be true. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the null hypothesis is false and that it
should be rejected.
10.20 Two groups, A and B, consist of 100 people each who have a disease. A serum is given to group A
but not to group B (which is called the control); otherwise, the two groups are treated identically.
It is found that in groups A and B, 75 and 65 people, respectively, recover from the disease.
At signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.01, (b) 0.05, and (c) 0.10, test the hypothesis that the serum
helps cure the disease. Compute the p-value and show that p-value40.01, p-value40.05, but
p-value50.10.
SOLUTION
Let p1 and p2 denote the population proportions cured by (1) using the serum and (2) not using the
serum, respectively. We must decide between two hypotheses:
H0 : p1 ¼ p2, and the observed diﬀerences are due to chance (i.e. the serum is ineﬀective).
H1 : p1 > p2, and the serum is eﬀective.

(a)
Using a one-tailed test at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level, we would reject hypothesis H0 only if the z score
were greater than 2.33. Since the z score is only 1.54, we must conclude that the results are due to
chance at this level of signiﬁcance.
(b)
Using a one-tailed test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we would reject H0 only if the z score
were greater than 1.645. Hence we must conclude that the results are due to chance at this
level also.
(c)
If a one-tailed test at the 0.10 signiﬁcance level were used, we would reject H0 only if the z score were
greater than 1.28. Since this condition is satisﬁed, we conclude that the serum is eﬀective at the
0.10 level.
(d)
Using EXCEL, the p-value is given by ¼ 1 - NORMSDIST(1.54) which equals 0.06178. This is the
area to the right of 1.54. Note that the p-value is greater than 0.01, 0.05, but is less than 0.10.
Note that these conclusions depend how much we are willing to risk being wrong. If the results are
actually due to chance, but we conclude that they are due to the serum (Type I error), we might proceed to
give the serum to large groups of people—only to ﬁnd that it is actually ineﬀective. This is a risk that we are
not always willing to assume.
On the other hand, we could conclude that the serum does not help, whereas it actually does help
(Type II error). Such a conclusion is very dangerous, especially if human lives are at stake.
10.21 Work Problem 10.20 if each group consists of 300 people and if 225 people in group A
and 195 people in group B are cured. Find the p-value using EXCEL and comment on
your decision.

SOLUTION
Note that in this case the proportions of people cured in the two groups are 225=300 ¼ 0:750 and
195=300 ¼ 0:650, respectively, which are the same as in Problem 10.20. Under hypothesis H0,

Since this value of z is greater than 2.33, we can reject the hypothesis at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level; that is,
we can conclude that the serum is eﬀective with only a 0.01 probability of being wrong.
This shows how increasing the sample size can increase the reliability of decisions. In many cases,
however, it may be impractical to increase sample sizes. In such cases we are forced to make decisions on
the basis of available information and must therefore contend with greater risks of incorrect decisions.
p-value ¼ 1 - NORMSDIST(2.67) ¼ 0.003793. This is less than 0.01.
10.22 A sample poll of 300 voters from district A and 200 voters from district B showed that 56% and
48%, respectively, were in favor of a given candidate. At a signiﬁcance level of 0.05, test the
hypotheses (a) that there is a diﬀerence between the districts and (b) that the candidate is preferred

If we wish only to determine whether there is a diﬀerence between the districts, we must decide between
the hypotheses H0 : p1 ¼ p2 and H1 : p1 6¼ p2, which involves a two-tailed test. Using a two-tailed test at
the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we would reject H0 if z were outside the interval 1:96 to 1.96. Since z ¼ 1:75
lies inside this interval, we cannot reject H0 at this level; that is, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the districts.

0.05 signiﬁcance level, we would reject H0 if z were greater than 1.645. Since this is the case, we can
reject H0 at this level and conclude that the candidate is preferred in district A.
(c)
For the two-tailed alternative, the p-value ¼ 2*(1-NORMSDIST(1.75)) ¼ 0.0801. You cannot reject the
null hypothesis at  ¼ 0:05. For the one-tailed alternative, p-value ¼1-NORMSDIST(1.75) ¼ 0.04006.
You can reject the null hypothesis at alpha ¼ 0.05.
TESTS INVOLVING BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS
10.23 An instructor gives a short quiz involving 10 true-false questions. To test the hypothesis that
students are guessing, the instructor adopts the following decision rule:
If seven or more answers are correct, the student is not guessing.
If less than seven answers are correct, the student is guessing.

Find the following probability of rejecting the hypothesis when it is correct using (a) the binomial
probability formula and (b) EXCEL.
SOLUTION
(a)
Let p be the probability that a question is answered correctly. The probability of getting X problems
out of 10 correct is ð10

CHAPTER 11
Small Sampling Theory
SMALL SAMPLES
In previous chapters we often made use of the fact that for samples of size N > 30, called large
samples, the sampling distributions of many statistics are approximately normal, the approximation
becoming better with increasing N. For samples of size N < 30, called small samples, this approximation
is not good and becomes worse with decreasing N, so that appropriate modiﬁcations must be made.
A study of sampling distributions of statistics for small samples is called small sampling theory.
However, a more suitable name would be exact sampling theory, since the results obtained hold for large
as well as for small samples. In this chapter we study three important distributions: Student’s t distribu-
tion, the chi-square distribution, and the F distribution.
STUDENT’S t DISTRIBUTION
Let us deﬁne the statistic

If we consider samples of size N drawn from a normal (or approximately normal) population with
mean  and if for each sample we compute t, using the sample mean X and sample standard deviation s
or ^s, the sampling distribution for t can be obtained. This distribution (see Fig. 11-1) is given by
Y ¼

where Y0 is a constant depending on N such that the total area under the curve is 1, and where the
constant  ¼ ðN  1Þ is called the number of degrees of freedom ( is the Greek letter nu).
Distribution (2) is called Student’s t distribution after its discoverer, W. S. Gossett, who published
his works under the pseudonym ‘‘Student’’ during the early part of the twentieth century.
For large values of  or N (certainly N  30Þ the curves (2) closely approximate the standardized

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
As done with normal distributions in Chapter 9, we can deﬁne 95%, 99%, or other conﬁdence
intervals by using the table of the t distribution in Appendix III. In this manner we can estimate within
speciﬁed limits of conﬁdence the population mean .
For example, if t:975 and t:975 are the values of t for which 2.5% of the area lies in each tail of the
t distribution, then the 95% conﬁdence interval for t is
t:975 <
X

with 95% conﬁdence (i.e. probability 0.95). Note that t:975 represents the 97.5 percentile value, while
t:025 ¼ t:975 represents the 2.5 percentile value.
In general, we can represent conﬁdence limits for population means by
X  tc

N  1
p
ð5Þ
where the values tc, called critical values or conﬁdence coeﬃcients, depend on the level of conﬁdence
desired and on the sample size. They can be read from Appendix III.
The sample is assumed to be taken from a normal population. This assumption may be checked out
using the Komogorov–Smirnov test for normality.

TESTS OF HYPOTHESES AND SIGNIFICANCE
Tests of hypotheses and signiﬁcance, or decision rules (as discussed in Chapter 10), are easily
extended to problems involving small samples, the only diﬀerence being that the z score, or z statistic,
is replaced by a suitable t score, or t statistic.

have means given by X1 and X2 and standard deviations given by s1 and s2, respectively. To test
the hypothesis H0 that the samples come from the same population (i.e., 1 ¼ 2 as well as 1 ¼ 2Þ;

THE CHI-SQUARE DISTRIBUTION
Let us deﬁne the statistic
2 ¼ Ns2
2 ¼ ðX1  XÞ2 þ ðX2  XÞ2 þ    þ ðXN  XÞ2
2
ð8Þ
where  is the Greek letter chi and 2 is read ‘‘chi-square.’’
If we consider samples of size N drawn from a normal population with standard deviation , and if
for each sample we compute 2, a sampling distribution for 2 can be obtained. This distribution, called
the chi-square distribution, is given by
Y ¼ Y0ð2Þð1=2Þð2Þ eð1=2Þ2 ¼ Y02 eð1=2Þ2
ð9Þ

where  ¼ N  1 is the number of degrees of freedom, and Y0 is a constant depending on  such that the
total area under the curve is 1. The chi-square distributions corresponding to various values of  are
shown in Fig. 11-2. The maximum value of Y occurs at 2 ¼   2 for   2:
CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR 
As done with the normal and t distribution, we can deﬁne 95%, 99%, or other conﬁdence limits
by using the table of the 2 distribution in Appendix IV. In this manner we can estimate within
speciﬁed limits of conﬁdence the population standard deviation  in terms of a sample standard
deviation s.
For example, if 2
:025 and X2
:975 are the values of 2 (called critical values) for which 2.5% of the area
lies in each tail of the distribution, then the 95% conﬁdence interval is
2
:025 < Ns2

with 95% conﬁdence. Other conﬁdence intervals can be found similarly. The values :025 and :095
represent, respectively, the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile values.
Appendix IV gives percentile values corresponding to the number of degrees of freedom . For large
values of  ð  30Þ, we can use the fact that ð

In these cases, agreement is close to the results obtained in Chapters 8 and 9.

DEGREES OF FREEDOM
In order to compute a statistic such as (1) or (8), it is necessary to use observations obtained from a
sample as well as certain population parameters. If these parameters are unknown, they must be esti-
mated from the sample.

Chi-square distributions with (a) 2, (b) 4, (c) 6, and (d) 10 degrees of freedom.

The number of degrees of freedom of a statistic, generally denoted by , is deﬁned as the number N
of independent observations in the sample (i.e., the sample size) minus the number k of population
parameters, which must be estimated from sample observations. In symbols,  ¼ N  k.
In the case of statistic (1), the number of independent observations in the sample is N, from which
we can compute X and s. However, since we must estimate , k ¼ 1 and so  ¼ N  1.
In the case of statistic (8), the number of independent observations in the sample is N, from which
we can compute s. However, since we must estimate , k ¼ 1 and so  ¼ N  1.
THE F DISTRIBUTION
As we have seen, it is important in some applications to know the sampling distribution of the
diﬀerence in means ð X1  X2Þ of two samples. Similarly, we may need the sampling distribution of the
diﬀerence in variances ðS2
1  S2
2Þ. It turns out, however, that this distribution is rather complicated.
Because of this, we consider instead the statistic S2
1=S2
2, since a large or small ratio would indicate a
large diﬀerence, while a ratio nearly equal to 1 would indicate a small diﬀerence. The sampling distribu-
tion in such a case can be found and is called the F distribution, named after R. A. Fisher.
More precisely, suppose that we have two samples, 1 and 2, of sizes N1 and N2, respectively, drawn
from two normal (or nearly normal) populations having variances 2
1 and 2
2. Let us deﬁne the statistic

Appendixes V and VI give percentile values of F for which the areas in the right-hand tail are 0.05
and 0.01, denoted by F:95 and F:99, respectively. Representing the 5% and 1% signiﬁcance levels, these
can be used to determine whether or not the variance S2
1 is signiﬁcantly larger than S2
2. In practice,
the sample with the larger variance is chosen as sample 1.
Statistical software has added to the ability to ﬁnd areas under the Student t distribution, the chi-
square distribution, and the F distribution. It has also added to our ability to sketch the various
distributions. We will illustrate this in the solved problems section in this chapter.
Solved Problems
STUDENT’S t DISTRIBUTION
11.1
The graph of Student’s t distribution with nine degrees of freedom is shown in Fig. 11-4. Use
Appendix III to ﬁnd the values of a for which (a) the area to the right of a is 0.05, (b) the total
shaded area is 0.05, (c) the total unshaded area is 0.99, (d) the shaded area on the left is 0.01, and
(e) the area to the left of a is 0.90. Find (a) through (e) using EXCEL.
SOLUTION
(a)
If the shaded area on the right is 0.05, the area to the left of a is ð1  0:05Þ ¼ 0:95 and a represents the 95th
percentile, t.95. Referring to Appendix III, proceed downward under the column headed  until reaching
entry 9, and then proceed right to the column headed t.95; the result, 1.83, is the required value of t.
(b)
If the total shaded area is 0.05, then the shaded area on the right is 0.025 by symmetry. Thus the area to
the left of a is ð1  0:025Þ ¼ 0:975 and a represents the 97.5th percentile, t.975. From Appendix III
we ﬁnd 2.26 to be the required value of t.
(c)
If the total unshaded area is 0.99, then the total shaded area is ð1  0:99Þ ¼ 0:01 and the shaded area to
the right is 0.01/2 ¼ 0.005. From Appendix III we ﬁnd that t.995 ¼ 3.25.
(d)
If the shaded area on the left is 0.01, then by symmetry the shaded area on the right is 0.01. From Appendix
III, t.99 ¼ 2.82. Thus the critical value of t for which the shaded area on the left is 0.01 equals 2.82.
(e)
If the area to the left of a is 0.90, the a corresponds to the 90th percentile, t.90, which from Appendix III
equals 1.38.

Fig. 11-4
Student’s t distribution with 9 degrees of freedom.

Using EXCEL, the expression ¼ TINV(0.1,9) gives 1.833113. EXCEL requires the sum of the areas
in the two tails and the degrees of freedom. Similarly, ¼TINV(0.05,9) gives 2.262157, ¼TINV(0.01,9)
gives 3.249836, ¼TINV(0.02,9) gives 2.821438, and ¼TINV(0.2,9) gives 1.383029.
11.2
Find the critical values of t for which the area of the right-hand tail of the t distribution is 0.05 if
the number of degrees of freedom, , is equal to (a) 16, (b) 27, and (c) 200.
SOLUTION
Using Appendix III, we ﬁnd in the column headed t:95 the values (a) 1.75, corresponding to  ¼ 16;
(b) 1.70, corresponding to  ¼ 27; and (c) 1.645, corresponding to  ¼ 200. (The latter is the value that
would be obtained by using the normal curve; in Appendix III it corresponds to the entry in the last row
marked 1, or inﬁnity.)
11.3
The 95% conﬁdence coeﬃcients (two-tailed) for the normal distribution are given by 1:96. What
are the corresponding coeﬃcients for the t distribution if (a)  ¼ 9, (b)  ¼ 20, (c)  ¼ 30, and
(d)  ¼ 60?
SOLUTION
For the 95% conﬁdence coeﬃcients (two-tailed), the total shaded area in Fig. 11-4 must be 0.05. Thus the
shaded area in the right tail is 0.025 and the corresponding critical value of t is t:975. Then the required conﬁdence
coeﬃcients are t:975; for the given values of , these are (a) 2:26, (b) 2:09, (c) 2:04, and (d) 2:00.

A sample of 10 measurements of the diameter of a sphere gave a mean X ¼ 438 centimeters (cm)

The number of days absent from work last year due to job-related cases of carpal tunnel syn-
drome were recorded for 25 randomly selected workers. The results are given in Table 11.1. When
the data are used to set a conﬁdence interval on the mean of the population of all job-related cases
of carpal tunnel syndrome, a basic assumption underlying the procedure is that the number of
days absent are normally distributed for the population. Use the data to test the normality
assumption and if you are willing to assume normality, then set a 95% conﬁdence interval on .

SOLUTION
The normal probability plot from MINITAB (Fig. 11-5) indicates that it would be reasonable to assume
normality since the p-value exceeds 0.15. This p-value is used to test the null hypothesis that the data were
selected from a normally distributed population. If the conventional level of signiﬁcance, 0.05, is used then
normality of the population distribution would be rejected only if the p-value is less than 0.05. Since the
p-value associated with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normality is reported as p-value > 0:15, we do not
reject the assumption of normality.
The conﬁdence interval is found using MINITAB as follows. The 95% conﬁdence interval for the
population mean extends from 27.21 to 33.59 days per year.

In the past, a machine has produced washers having a thickness of 0.050 inch (in). To determine
whether the machine is in proper working order, a sample of 10 washers is chosen, for which the
mean thickness is 0.053 in and the standard deviation is 0.003 in. Test the hypothesis that the
machine is in proper working order, using signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01.
SOLUTION
We wish to decide between the hypotheses:
H0 :  ¼ 0:050, and the machine is in proper working order
H1 :  6¼ 0:050, and the machine is not in proper working order
Thus a two-tailed test is required. Under hypothesis H0, we have

interval 2:26 to 2:26.

For a two-tailed test at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level, we adopt the decision rule:
Accept H0 if t lies inside the interval t:995 to t:995, which for 10  1 ¼ 9 degrees of freedom is the
interval 3:25 to 3.25.
Reject H0 otherwise
Since t ¼ 3:00, we accept H0 at the 0.01 level.
Because we can reject H0 at the 0.05 level but not at the 0.01 level, we say that the sample result is
probably signiﬁcant (see the terminology at the end of Problem 10.5). It would thus be advisable to check the
machine or at least to take another sample.

A mall manager conducts a test of the null hypothesis that  ¼ $50 versus the alternative hypoth-
esis that  6¼ $50, where  represents the mean amount spent by all shoppers making purchases at
the mall. The data shown in Table 11.2 give the dollar amount spent for 28 shoppers. The test of
hypothesis using the Student’s t distribution assumes that the data used in the test are selected
from a normally distributed population. This normality assumption may be checked out using
anyone of several diﬀerent tests of normality. MINITAB gives 3 diﬀerent choices for a normality
test. Test for normality at the conventional level of signiﬁcance equal to  ¼ 0:05: If the normality
assumption is not rejected, then proceed to test the hypothesis that  ¼ $50 versus the alternative
hypothesis that  6¼ $50 at  ¼ 0:05:
SOLUTION
The Anderson–Darling normality test from MINITAB gives a p-value ¼ 0:922, the Ryan–Joyner nor-
mality test gives the p-value as greater than 0.10, and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test gives the
p-value as greater than 0.15. In all 3 cases, the null hypothesis that the data were selected from a normally
distributed population would not be rejected at the conventional 5% level of signiﬁcance. Recall that the null
hypothesis is rejected only if the p-value is less than the preset level of signiﬁcance. The MINITAB analysis for
the test of the mean amount spent per customer is shown below. If the classical method of testing hypothesis is
used then the null hypothesis is rejected if the computed value of the test statistic exceeds 2.05 in absolute
value. The critical value, 2.05, is found by using Student’s t distribution with 27 degrees of freedom. Since the
computed value of the test statistic equals 18.50, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the
mean amount spent exceeds $50. If the p-value approach is used to test the hypothesis, then since the computed
p-value ¼ 0:0000 is less than the level of signiﬁcance (0.05), we also reject the null hypothesis.

The intelligence quotients (IQs) of 16 students from one area of a city showed a mean of 107 and a
standard deviation of 10, while the IQs of 14 students from another area of the city showed a
mean of 112 and a standard deviation of 8. Is there a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the IQs of the
two groups at signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.01 and (b) 0.05?
SOLUTION
If 1 and 2 denote the population mean IQs of students from the two areas, respectively, we have to
decide between the hypotheses:
H0 : 1 ¼ 2, and there is essentially no diﬀerence between the groups.
H1 : 1 6¼ 2, and there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the groups.

Using a two-tailed test at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level, we would reject H0 if t were outside the range t:995
to t:995, which for ðN1 þ N2  2Þ ¼ ð16 þ 14  2Þ ¼ 28 degrees of freedom is the range 2:76 to 2:76.
Thus we cannot reject H0 at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level.
(b)
Using a two-tailed test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we would reject H0 if t were outside the range t:975
to t:975, which for 28 degrees of freedom is the range 2:05 to 2.05. Thus we cannot reject H0 at the
0.05 signiﬁcance levels.
We conclude that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the IQs of the two groups.

The costs (in thousands of dollars) for tuition, room, and board per year at 15 randomly
selected public colleges and 10 randomly selected private colleges are shown in Table 11.3. Test
the null hypothesis that the mean yearly cost at private colleges exceeds the mean yearly
cost at public colleges by 10 thousand dollars versus the alternative hypothesis that the
diﬀerence is not 10 thousand dollars. Use level of signiﬁcance 0.05. Test the assumptions of
normality and equal variances at level of signiﬁcance 0.05 before performing the test concerning
the means.

SOLUTION
The Anderson–Darling normality test from MINITAB for the public colleges data is shown in
Fig. 11-6. Since the p-value (0.432) is not less than 0.05, the normality assumption is not rejected. A similar
test for private colleges indicates that the normality assumption is valid for private colleges.
The F test shown in the lower part of Fig. 11-6 indicates that equal variances may be assumed. The pull-

THE CHI-SQUARE DISTRIBUTION
11.10 The graph of the chi-square distribution with 5 degrees of freedom is shown in Fig. 11-7. Using
Appendix IV, ﬁnd the critical values of 2 for which (a) the shaded area on the right is 0.05,
(b) the total shaded area is 0.05, (c) the shaded area on the left is 0.10, and (d ) the shaded area on
the right is 0.01. Find the same answers using EXCEL.
SOLUTION
(a)
If the shaded area on the right is 0.05, then the area to the left of b is ð1  0:05Þ ¼ 0:95 and b represents
the 95th percentile, 2
:95. Referring to Appendix IV, proceed downward under the column headed 
until reaching entry 5, and then proceed right to the column headed 2
:95; the result, 11.1, is the
required critical value of 2.
(b)
Since the distribution is not symmetrical, there are many critical values for which the total shaded area
is 0.05. For example, the right-hand shaded area could be 0.04 while the left-hand shaded area is 0.01. It
is customary, however, unless otherwise speciﬁed, to choose the two areas to be equal. In this case, then,
each area is 0.025. If the shaded area on the right is 0.025, the area to the left of b is 1  0:025 ¼ 0:975
and b represents the 97.5th percentile, 2
:975, which from Appendix IV is 12.8. Similarly, if the shaded
area on the left is 0.025, the area to the left of a is 0.025 and a represents the 2.5th percentile, 2
:025,
which equals 0.831. Thus, the critical values are 0.83 and 12.8.
(c)
If the shaded area on the left is 0.10, a represents the 10th percentile, 2
:10, which equals 1.61.
(d)
If the shaded area on the right is 0.01, the area to the left of b is 0.99 and b represents the 99th
percentile, 2
:99, which equals 15.1.
The EXCEL answer to (a) is ¼CHIINV(0.05,5) or 11.0705. The ﬁrst parameter in CHIINV is the
area to the right of the point and the second is the degrees of freedom. The answer to (b) is
¼CHIINV(0.975,5) or 0.8312 and ¼CHIINV(0.025,5) or 12.8325. The answer to (c) is ¼CHIINV(0.9,5)
or 1.6103. The answer to (d) is ¼CHIINV(0.01,5) or 15.0863.
11.11 Find the critical values of 2 for which the area of the right-hand tail of the 2 distribution is 0.05,
if the number of degrees of freedom, , is equal to (a) 15, (b) 21, and (c) 50.
SOLUTION
Using Appendix IV, we ﬁnd in the column headed 2
:95 the values (a) 25.0, corresponding to  ¼ 15;
(b) 32.7, corresponding to  ¼ 21; and (c) 67.5, corresponding to  ¼ 50.

11.12 Find the median value of 2 corresponding to (a) 9, (b) 28, and (c) 40 degrees of freedom.
SOLUTION
Using Appendix IV, we ﬁnd in the column headed 2
:50 (since the median is the 50th percentile) the
values (a) 8.34, corresponding to  ¼ 9; (b) 27.3, corresponding to  ¼ 28; and (c) 39.3, corresponding to
 ¼ 40.
It is of interest to note that the median values are very nearly equal to the number of degrees of freedom.
In fact, for  > 10 the median values are equal to ð  0:7Þ, as can be seen from the table.

11.16 A manufacturer of axles must maintain a mean diameter of 5.000 cm in the manufacturing
process. In addition, in order to insure that the wheels ﬁt on the axle properly, it is necessary
that the standard deviation of the diameters equal 0.005 cm or less. A sample of 20 axles is
obtained and the diameters are given in Table 11.4.
The manufacturer wishes to test the null hypothesis that the population standard deviation is
0.005 cm versus the alternative hypothesis that the population standard deviation exceeds
0.005 cm. If the alternative hypothesis is supported, then the manufacturing process must be
stopped and repairs to the machinery must be made. The test procedure assumes that the axle
diameters are normally distributed. Test this assumption at the 0.05 level of signiﬁcance. If you
are willing to assume normality, then test the hypothesis concerning the population standard
deviation at the 0.05 level of signiﬁcance.
SOLUTION
The Shapiro–Wilk test of normality is given in Fig. 11-8. The large p-value (0.9966) would indicate that
normality would not be rejected. This probability plot and Shapiro–Wilk analysis was produced by the
statistical software package STATISTIX.
We have to decide between the hypothesis:
H0: ¼ 0:005 cm; and the observed value is due to chance:
H1:  > 0:005 cm; and the variability is too large:

11.17 In the past, the standard deviation of weights of certain 40.0-ounce packages ﬁlled by a machine
was 0.25 ounces (oz). A random sample of 20 packages showed a standard deviation of 0.32 oz. Is
the apparent increase in variability signiﬁcant at the (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01 levels?
SOLUTION
We have to decide between the hypotheses:
H0 :  ¼ 0:25 oz, and the observed result is due to chance.
H1 : a > 0:25 oz, and the variability has increased.
The value of 2 for the sample is
2 ¼ Ns2
2 ¼ 20ð0:32Þ2
ð0:25Þ2
¼ 32:8
(a)
Using a one-tailed test, we would reject H0 at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level if the sample value of 2 were
greater than 2
:95, which equals 30.1 for  ¼ 20  1 ¼ 19 degrees of freedom. Thus we would reject H0
at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level.
(b)
Using a one-tailed test, we would reject H0 at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level if the sample value of 2 were
greater than 2
:99, which equals 36.2 for 19 degrees of freedom. Thus we would not reject H0 at the 0.01
signiﬁcance level.
We conclude that the variability has probably increased. An examination of the machine should
be made.
THE F DISTRIBUTION
11.18 Two samples of sizes 9 and 12 are drawn from two normally distributed populations having
variances 16 and 25, respectively. If the sample variances are 20 and 8, determine whether the
ﬁrst sample has a signiﬁcantly larger variance than the second sample at signiﬁcance levels of
(a) 0.05, (b) 0.01, and (c) Use EXCEL to show that the area to the right of 4.03 is between 0.01
and 0.05.

(a)
The degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator of F are 1 ¼ N1  1 ¼ 9  1 ¼ 8 and
2 ¼ N2  1 ¼ 12  1 ¼ 11. Then from Appendix V we ﬁnd that F:95 ¼ 2:95. Since the calculated
F ¼ 4:03 is greater than 2.95, we conclude that the variance for sample 1 is signiﬁcantly larger than
that for sample 2 at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level.
(b)
For 1 ¼ 8 and v2 ¼ 11, we ﬁnd from Appendix VI that F:01 ¼ 4:74. In this case the calculated F ¼ 4:03
is less than 4.74. Thus we cannot conclude that the sample 1 variance is larger than the sample 2
variance at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level.
(c)
The area to the right of 4.03 is given by ¼FDIST(4.03,8,11) or 0.018.
11.19 Two samples of sizes 8 and 10 are drawn from two normally distributed populations having
variances 20 and 36, respectively. Find the probability that the variance of the ﬁrst sample is more
than twice the variance of the second sample.
Use EXCEL to ﬁnd the exact probability that F with 7 and 9 degrees of freedom exceeds 3.70.

We have N1 ¼ 8, N2 ¼ 10, 2

The number of degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator are 1 ¼ N1  1 ¼ 8  1 ¼ 7 and

Looking up 3.70 in Appendixes V and VI, we ﬁnd that the probability is less than 0.05 but greater than 0.01.
For exact values, we need a more extensive tabulation of the F distribution.
The EXCEL answer is ¼FDIST(3.7,7,9) or 0.036 is the probability that F with 7 and 9 degrees
of freedom exceeds 3.70.

An eﬃciency expert claims that by introducing a new type of machinery into a production process, he can
substantially decrease the time required for production. Because of the expense involved in maintenance of
the machines, management feels that unless the production time can be decreased by at least 8.0%, it cannot
aﬀord to introduce the process. Six resulting experiments show that the time for production is decreased by
8.4% with a standard deviation of 0.32%. Using signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.01 and (b) 0.05, test the
hypothesis that the process should be introduced.

CHAPTER 12
The Chi-Square Test
OBSERVED AND THEORETICAL FREQUENCIES
As we have already seen many times, the results obtained in samples do not always agree exactly
with the theoretical results expected according to the rules of probability. For example, although
theoretical considerations lead us to expect 50 heads and 50 tails when we toss a fair coin 100 times,
it is rare that these results are obtained exactly.
Suppose that in a particular sample a set of possible events E1, E2, E3, . . . , Ek (see Table 12.1) are
observed to occur with frequencies o1, o2, o3, . . . , ok, called observed frequencies, and that according to
probability rules they are expected to occur with frequencies e1, e2, e3, . . . , ek, called expected, or theo-
retical, frequencies. Often we wish to know whether the observed frequencies diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the
expected frequencies.
DEFINITION OF v2
A measure of the discrepancy existing between the observed and expected frequencies is supplied by
the statistic 2 (read chi-square) given by
2 ¼ ðo1  e1Þ2

An expression equivalent to formula (1) is (see Problem 12.11)
2 ¼ P o2

ej
 N
ð3Þ
If 2 ¼ 0, the observed and theoretical frequencies agree exactly; while if 2 > 0, they do not agree
exactly. The larger the value of 2, the greater is the discrepancy between the observed and expected
frequencies.

The sampling distribution of 2 is approximated very closely by the chi-square distribution
Y ¼ Y0ð2Þ1=2ð2Þe1=22 ¼ Y02e1=22
ð4Þ
(already considered in Chapter 11) if the expected frequencies are at least equal to 5. The approximation
improves for larger values.
The number of degrees of freedom, , is given by
(1)
 ¼ k  1 if the expected frequencies can be computed without having to estimate the population
parameters from sample statistics. Note that we subtract 1 from k because of constraint condition
(2), which states that if we know k  1 of the expected frequencies, the remaining frequency can be
determined.
(2)
 ¼ k  1  m if the expected frequencies can be computed only by estimating m population
parameters from sample statistics.
SIGNIFICANCE TESTS
In practice, expected frequencies are computed on the basis of a hypothesis H0. If under this
hypothesis the computed value of 2 given by equation (1) or (3) is greater than some critical value
(such as 2
:95 or 2
:99, which are the critical values of the 0.05 and 0.01 signiﬁcance levels, respectively), we
would conclude that the observed frequencies diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the expected frequencies and
would reject H0 at the corresponding level of signiﬁcance; otherwise, we would accept it (or at least
not reject it). This procedure is called the chi-square test of hypothesis or signiﬁcance.
It should be noted that we must look with suspicion upon circumstances where 2 is too close to zero,
since it is rare that observed frequencies agree too well with expected frequencies. To examine such
situations, we can determine whether the computed value of 2 is less than 2
:05 or 2
:01, in which cases we
would decide that the agreement is too good at the 0.05 or 0.01 signiﬁcance levels, respectively.
THE CHI-SQUARE TEST FOR GOODNESS OF FIT
The chi-square test can be used to determine how well theoretical distributions (such as the normal
and binomial distributions) ﬁt empirical distributions (i.e., those obtained from sample data).
See Problems 12.12 and 12.13.
EXAMPLE 1.
A pair of dice is rolled 500 times with the sums in Table 12.2 showing on the dice:
The expected number, if the dice are fair, are determined from the distribution of x as in Table 12.3.

If the observed and expected are entered into B1:L2 in the EXCEL worksheet, the expression ¼(B1-B2)^2/B2
is entered into B4, a click-and-drag is executed from B4 to L4, and then the quantities in B4:L4 are summed we
obtain 10.34 for 2 ¼ P
j ððoj  ejÞ2=ejÞ.
The p-value corresponding to 10.34 is given by the EXCEL expression ¼CHIDIST(10.34,10). The p-value is
0.411. Because of this large p-value, we have no reason to doubt the fairness of the dice.
CONTINGENCY TABLES
Table 12.1, in which the observed frequencies occupy a single row, is called a one-way classiﬁcation
table. Since the number of columns is k, this is also called a 1  k (read ‘‘1 by k’’) table. By extending
these ideas, we can arrive at two-way classiﬁcation tables, or h  k tables, in which the observed
frequencies occupy h rows and k columns. Such tables are often called contingency tables.
Corresponding to each observed frequency in an h  k contingency table, there is an expected (or
theoretical) frequency that is computed subject to some hypothesis according to rules of probability.
These frequencies, which occupy the cells of a contingency table, are called cell frequencies. The total
frequency in each row or each column is called the marginal frequency.
To investigate agreement between the observed and expected frequencies, we compute the statistic
2 ¼
X
j
ðoj  ejÞ2
ej
ð5Þ
where the sum is taken over all cells in the contingency table and where the symbols oj and ej represent,
respectively, the observed and expected frequencies in the jth cell. This sum, which is analogous to
equation (1), contains hk terms. The sum of all observed frequencies is denoted by N and is equal to
the sum of all expected frequencies [compare with equation (2)].
As before, statistic (5) has a sampling distribution given very closely by (4), provided the expected
frequencies are not too small. The number of degrees of freedom, , of this chi-square distribution is
given for h > 1 and k > 1 by
1.
 ¼ ðh  1Þðk  1Þ if the expected frequencies can be computed without having to estimate popula-
tion parameters from sample statistics. For a proof of this, see Problem 12.18.
2.
 ¼ ðh  1Þðk  1Þ  m if the expected frequencies can be computed only by estimating m population
parameters from sample statistics.
Signiﬁcance tests for h  k tables are similar to those for 1  k tables. The expected frequencies are
found subject to a particular hypothesis H0. A hypothesis commonly assumed is that the two classiﬁca-
tions are independent of each other.
Contingency tables can be extended to higher dimensions. Thus, for example, we can have h  k  l
tables, where three classiﬁcations are present.
EXAMPLE 2.
The data in Table 12.5 were collected on how individuals prepared their taxes and their education
level. The null hypothesis is that the way people prepare their taxes (computer software or pen and paper) is
independent of their education level. Table 12.5 is a contingency table.
If MINITAB is used to analyze this data, the following results are obtained.

Because of the small p-value, the hypothesis of independence would be rejected and we would
conclude that tax preparation would be contingent upon education level.
YATES’ CORRECTION FOR CONTINUITY
When results for continuous distributions are applied to discrete data, certain corrections for con-
tinuity can be made, as we have seen in previous chapters. A similar correction is available when the
chi-square distribution is used. The correction consists in rewriting equation (1) as
2ðcorrectedÞ ¼ ðjo1  e1j  0:5Þ2
e1
þ ðjo2  e2j  0:5Þ2
e2
þ    þ ðjok  ekj  0:5Þ2
ek
ð6Þ
and is often referred to as Yates’ correction. An analogous modiﬁcation of equation (5) also exists.
In general, the correction is made only when the number of degrees of freedom is  ¼ 1. For large
samples, this yields practically the same results as the uncorrected 2, but diﬃculties can arise
near critical values (see Problem 12.8). For small samples where each expected frequency is between
5 and 10, it is perhaps best to compare both the corrected and uncorrected values of 2. If both values
lead to the same conclusion regarding a hypothesis, such as rejection at the 0.05 level, diﬃculties are
rarely encountered. If they lead to diﬀerent conclusions, one can resort to increasing the sample sizes or,
if this proves impractical, one can employ methods of probability involving the multinomial distribution
of Chapter 6.
SIMPLE FORMULAS FOR COMPUTING v2
Simple formulas for computing 2 that involve only the observed frequencies can be derived.
The following gives the results for 2  2 and 2  3 contingency tables (see Tables 12.6 and 12.7,
respectively).

which is called the coeﬃcient of contingency. The larger the value of C, the greater is the degree of

the maximum value of C is given by

THE CHI-SQUARE TEST
12.1
In 200 tosses of a coin, 115 heads and 85 tails were observed. Test the hypothesis that the coin is
fair, using Appendix IV and signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01. Test the hypothesis by
computing the p-value and (c) comparing it to levels 0.05 and 0.01.
SOLUTION
The observed frequencies of heads and tails are o1 ¼ 115 and o2 ¼ 85, respectively, and the expected
frequencies of heads and tails (if the coin is fair) are e1 ¼ 100 and e2 ¼ 100, respectively. Thus

¼ 4:50
Since the number of categories, or classes (heads, tails), is k ¼ 2,  ¼ k  1 ¼ 2  1 ¼ 1.
(a)
The critical value 2
:95 for 1 degree of freedom is 3.84. Thus, since 4:50 > 3:84, we reject the hypothesis
that the coin is fair at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level.
(b)
The critical value 2
:99 for 1 degree of freedom is 6.63. Thus, since 4:50 < 6:63, we cannot reject the
hypothesis that the coin is fair at the 0.02 signiﬁcance level.
We conclude that the observed results are probably signiﬁcant and that the coin is probably not fair.
For a comparison of this method with previous methods used, see Problem 12.3.
Using EXCEL, the p-value is given by ¼CHIDIST(4.5,1), which equals 0.0339. And we see, using the
p-value approach that the results are signiﬁcant at 0.05 but not at 0.01. Either of these methods of testing
may be used.

respectively.
First method
115 heads in standard units ¼ 115  100
7:07
¼ 2:12
Using the 0.05 signiﬁcance level and a two-tailed test, we would reject the hypothesis that the coin is fair
if the z score were outside the interval 1.96 to 1.96. With the 0.01 level, the corresponding interval would be
2.58 to 2.58. It follows (as in Problem 12.1) that we can reject the hypothesis at the 0.05 level but cannot
reject it at the 0.01 level.
Note that the square of the above standard score, ð2:12Þ2 ¼ 4:50, is the same as the value of 2 obtained
in Problem 12.1. This is always the case for a chi-square test involving two categories (see Problem 12.10).
Second method
Using the correction for continuity, 115 or more heads is equivalent to 114.5 or more heads. Then 114.5
in standard units ¼ ð114:5  100Þ=7:07 ¼ 2:05. This leads to the same conclusions as in the ﬁrst method.
Note that the square of this standard score is ð2:05Þ2 ¼ 4:20, agreeing with the value of 2 corrected for
continuity by using Yates’ correction of Problem 12.2. This is always the case for a chi-square test involving
two categories in which Yates’ correction is applied.

The 0.01 critical value is given by ¼CHIINV(0.01, 9) which equals 21.6660. Since the computed value of
2 exceeds this value, we reject the hypothesis that the numbers are random.
(c)
The p-value is given by the EXCEL expression ¼CHIDIST(23.3, 9) which equals 0.0056, which is less
than 0.01. By the p-value technique, we reject the null.

In his experiments with peas, Gregor Mendel observed that 315 were round and yellow, 108 were
round and green, 101 were wrinkled and yellow, and 32 were wrinkled and green. According to
his theory of heredity, the numbers should be in the proportion 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Is there any evidence to
doubt his theory at the (a) 0.01 and (b) 0.05 signiﬁcance levels?
SOLUTION
The total number of peas is 315 þ 108 þ 101 þ 32 ¼ 556. Since the expected numbers are in the propor-
tion 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 (and 9 þ 3 þ 3 þ 1 ¼ 16Þ, we would expect

Since there are four categories, k ¼ 4 and the number of degrees of freedom is  ¼ 4  1 ¼ 3.
(a)
For  ¼ 3, 2
:99 ¼ 11:3, and thus we cannot reject the theory at the 0.01 level.
(b)
For  ¼ 3, 2
:95 ¼ 7:81, and thus we cannot reject the theory at the 0.05 level.
We conclude that the theory and experiment are in agreement.
Note that for 3 degrees of freedom, 2
:05 ¼ 0:352 and 2 ¼ 0:470 > 0:352. Thus, although the
agreement is good, the results obtained are subject to a reasonable amount of sampling error.
12.7
An urn contains a very large number of marbles of four diﬀerent colors: red, orange, yellow, and
green. A sample of 12 marbles drawn at random from the urn revealed 2 red, 5 orange, 4 yellow,
and 1 green marble. Test the hypothesis that the urn contains equal proportions of the diﬀerently
colored marbles.
SOLUTION
Under the hypothesis that the urn contains equal proportions of the diﬀerently colored marbles,
we would expect 3 of each kind in a sample of 12 marbles. Since these expected numbers are less than 5,

the chi-square approximation will be in error. To avoid this, we combine categories so that the expected
number in each category is at least 5.
If we wish to reject the hypothesis, we should combine categories in such a way that the evidence against
the hypothesis shows up best. This is achieved in our case by considering the categories ‘‘red or green’’ and
‘‘orange or yellow,’’ for which the sample revealed 3 and 9 marbles, respectively. Since the expected number
in each category under the hypothesis of equal proportions is 6, we have
2 ¼ ð3  6Þ2
6
þ ð9  6Þ2
6
¼ 3
For  ¼ 2  1 ¼ 1, 2
:95 ¼ 3:84. Thus we cannot reject the hypothesis at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level
(although we can at the 0.10 level). Conceivably the observed results could arise on the basis of chance
even when equal proportions of the colors are present.
Another method
Using Yates’ correction, we ﬁnd

6

6

which leads to the same conclusion given above. This is to be expected, of course, since Yates’ correction
always reduces the value of 2.
It should be noted that if the 2 approximation is used despite the fact that the frequencies are too
small, we would obtain

Since for  ¼ 4  1 ¼ 3, 2
:95 ¼ 7:81, we would arrive at the same conclusions as above. Unfortunately,
the 2 approximation for small frequencies is poor; hence, when it is not advisable to combine frequencies,
we must resort to the exact probability methods of Chapter 6.
12.8
In 360 tosses of a pair of dice, 74 sevens and 24 elevens are observed. Using the 0.05 signiﬁcance
level, test the hypothesis that the dice are fair.
SOLUTION
A pair of dice can fall 36 ways. A seven can occur in 6 ways, an eleven in 2 ways. Then
Prfseveng ¼ 6
36 ¼ 1
6 and Prfeleveng ¼ 2
36 ¼ 1
18. Thus in 360 tosses we would expect 1

1
18 ð360Þ ¼ 20 elevens, so that
2 ¼ ð74  60Þ2
60
þ ð24  20Þ2
20
¼ 4:07
For  ¼ 2  1 ¼ 1, 2
:95 ¼ 3:84. Thus, since 4:07 > 3:84, we would be inclined to reject the hypothesis
that the dice are fair. Using Yates’ correction, however, we ﬁnd
2 ðcorrectedÞ ¼ ðj74  60j  0:5Þ2

þ ðj24  20j  0:5Þ2
20
¼ ð13:5Þ2
60
þ ð3:5Þ2
20
¼ 3:65
Thus on the basis of the corrected 2 we could not reject the hypothesis at the 0.05 level.
In general, for large samples such as we have here, results using Yates’ correction prove to be
more reliable than uncorrected results. However, since even the corrected value of 2 lies so close to the
critical value, we are hesitant about making decisions one way or the other. In such cases it is perhaps best
to increase the sample size by taking more observations if we are interested especially in the 0.05 level
for some reason; otherwise, we could reject the hypothesis at some other level (such as 0.10) if this is
satisfactory.
12.9
A survey of 320 families with 5 children revealed the distribution shown in Table 12.10. Is the
result consistent with the hypothesis that male and female births are equally probable?

SOLUTION
Let p ¼ probability of a male birth, and let q ¼ 1  p ¼ probability of a female birth. Then the prob-
abilities of (5 boys), (4 boys and 1 girl), . . . , (5 girls) are given by the terms in the binomial expansion
ð p þ qÞ5 ¼ p5 þ 5p4q þ 10p3q2 þ 10p2q3 þ 5pq4 þ q5
If p ¼ q ¼ 1

32
Prf0 boys and 5 girlsg ¼ ð1

32
Then the expected number of families with 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 boys are obtained by multiplying the above
probabilities by 320, and the results are 10, 50, 100, 100, 50, and 10, respectively. Hence

Since 2

the 0.05 but not at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level. Thus we conclude that the results are probably signiﬁcant and
male and female births are not equally probable.
12.10 In a survey of 500 individuals, it was found that 155 of the 500 rented at least one video from a
video rental store during the past week. Test the hypothesis that 25% of the population rented at
least one video during the past week using a two-tailed alternative and  ¼ 0:05. Perform the test
using both the standard normal distribution and the chi-square distribution. Show that the
chi-square test involving only two categories is equivalent to the signiﬁcance test for proportions
given in Chapter 10.

The computed test statistic is Z ¼ ð155  125Þ=9:68 ¼ 3:10. The critical values are 1:96, and the null

The solution using the chi-square distribution is found by using the results as displayed in Table 12.11.

12.12 A racquetball player plays 3 game sets for exercise several times over the years and keeps records
of how he does in the three game sets. For 250 days, his records show that he wins 0 games on
25 days, 1 game on 75 days, 2 games on 125 days, and wins all 3 games on 25 days. Test that
X ¼ the number of wins in a 3 game series is binomial distributed at a ¼ 0.05.
SOLUTION
The mean number of wins in 3 game sets is ð0  25 þ 1  75 þ 2  125 þ 3  25Þ=250 ¼ 1:6. If X is
binomial, the mean is np ¼ 3p which is set equal to the statistic 1.6 and solving for p, we ﬁnd that p ¼ 0.53.
We wish to test that X is binomial with n ¼ 3 and p ¼ 0.53. If X is binomial with p ¼ 0.53, the distribution of
X and the expected number of wins is shown in the following EXCEL output. Note that the binomial
probabilities, p(x) are found by entering ¼BINOMDIST(A2, 3, 0.53, 0) and performing a click-and-drag
from B2 to B5. This gives the values shown under p(x).

12.13 The number of hours per week that 200 college students spend on the Internet is grouped into the
classes 0 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 11, 12 to 15, 16 to 19, 20 to 23, and 24 to 27 with the observed
frequencies 12, 25, 36, 45, 34, 31, and 17. The grouped mean and the grouped standard deviation

are found from the data. The null hypothesis is that the data are normally distributed. Using the
mean and the standard deviation that are found from the grouped data and assuming a normal
distribution, the expected frequencies are found, after rounding oﬀ, to be the following: 10, 30,

12.14 Work Problem 10.20 by using the chi-square test. Also work using MINITAB and compare the
two solutions.
SOLUTION
The conditions of the problem are presented in Table 12.12(a). Under the null hypothesis H0 that the
serum has no eﬀect, we would expect 70 people in each of the groups to recover and 30 in each group not to
recover, as shown in Table 12.12(b). Note that H0 is equivalent to the statement that recovery is independent
of the use of the serum (i.e., the classiﬁcations are independent).

To determine the number of degrees of freedom, consider Table 12.13, which is the same as Table 12.12
except that only the totals are shown. It is clear that we have the freedom of placing only one number in any
of the four empty cells, since once this is done the numbers in the remaining cells are uniquely determined
from the indicated totals. Thus there is 1 degree of freedom.
Another method
By formula (see Problem 12.18),  ¼ ðh  1Þðk  1Þ ¼ ð2  1Þð2  1Þ ¼ 1. Since 2
:95 ¼ 3:84 for 1 degree
of freedom and since 2 ¼ 2:38 < 3:84, we conclude that the results are not signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level. We
are thus unable to reject H0 at this level, and we either conclude that the serum is not eﬀective or withhold
decision, pending further tests.
Note that 2 ¼ 2:38 is the square of the z score, z ¼ 1:54, obtained in Problem 10.20. In general the
chi-square test involving sample proportions in a 2  2 contingency table is equivalent to a test of signiﬁ-
cance of diﬀerences in proportions using the normal approximation.
Note also that a one-tailed test using 2 is equivalent to a two-tailed test using  since, for example,
2 > 2
:95 corresponds to  > :95 or  < :95. Since for 2  2 tables 2 is the square of the z score, it
follows that  is the same as z for this case. Thus a rejection of a hypothesis at the 0.05 level using 2 is
equivalent to a rejection in a two-tailed test at the 0.10 level using z.

12.16 A cellular phone company conducts a survey to determine the ownership of cellular phones in
diﬀerent age groups. The results for 1000 households are shown in Table 12.14. Test the
hypothesis that the proportions owning cellular phones are the same for the diﬀerent age groups.
SOLUTION
Under the hypothesis H0 that the proportions owning cellular phones are the same for the diﬀerent age
groups, 250=1000 ¼ 25% is an estimate of the percentage owning a cellular phone in each age group, and
75% is an estimate of the percent not owning a cellular phone in each age group. The frequencies expected
under H0 are shown in Table 12.15.
The computed value of the chi-square statistic can be found as illustrated in Table 12.16.
The degrees of freedom for the chi-square distribution is  ¼ ðh  1Þðk  1Þ ¼ ð2  1Þð4  1Þ ¼ 3. Since
2
:95 ¼ 7:81, and 14.3 exceeds 7.81, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the percentages are not the
same for the four age groups.

12.18 Show that for an h  k contingency table the number of degrees of freedom is ðh  1Þ  ðk  1Þ,
where h > 1 and k > 1.
SOLUTION
In a table with h rows and k columns, we can leave out a single number in each row and column, since
such numbers can easily be restored from a knowledge of the totals of each column and row. It follows that
we have the freedom of placing only ðh  1Þðk  1Þ numbers into the table, the others being then automa-
tically determined uniquely. Thus the number of degrees of freedom is ðh  1Þðk  1Þ. Note that this result
holds if the population parameters needed in obtaining the expected frequencies are known.

12.22 Find the maximum value of C for the 2  2 table of Problem 12.14.
SOLUTION
The maximum value of C occurs when the two classiﬁcations are perfectly dependent or associated. In
such case all those who take the serum will recover, and all those who do not take the serum will not recover.
The contingency table then appears as in Table 12.18.
Since the expected cell frequencies, assuming complete independence, are all equal to 50,

ADDITIVE PROPERTY OF v2
12.25 To test a hypothesis H0, an experiment is performed three times. The resulting values of 2 are
2.37, 2.86, and 3.54, each of which corresponds to 1 degree of freedom. Show that while H0
cannot be rejected at the 0.05 level on the basis of any individual experiment, it can be rejected
when the three experiments are combined.
SOLUTION
The value of 2 obtained by combining the results of the three experiments is, according to the additive
property, 2 ¼ 2:37 þ 2:86 þ 3:54 ¼ 8:77 with 1 þ 1 þ 1 ¼ 3 degrees of freedom. Since 2
:95 for 3 degrees of
freedom is 7.81, we can reject H0 at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level. But since 2
:95 ¼ 3:84 for 1 degree of freedom,
we cannot reject H0 on the basis of any one experiment.
In combining experiments in which values of 2 corresponding to 1 degree of freedom are obtained,
Yates’ correction is omitted since it has a tendency to overcorrect.

CHAPTER 13
Curve Fitting and the 
Method of Least Squares
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIABLES
Very often in practice a relationship is found to exist between two (or more) variables. For
example, weights of adult males depend to some degree on their heights, the circumferences of circles
depend on their radii, and the pressure of a given mass of gas depends on its temperature and
volume.
It is frequently desirable to express this relationship in mathematical form by determining an
equation that connects the variables.
CURVE FITTING
To determine an equation that connects variables, a ﬁrst step is to collect data that show corre-
sponding values of the variables under consideration. For example, suppose that X and Y denote,
respectively, the height and weight of adult males; then a sample of N individuals would reveal the
heights X1, X2, . . . , XN and the corresponding weights Y1, Y2, . . . , YN.
A next step is to plot the points ðX1,Y1Þ, ðX2,Y2Þ, . . . , ðXN,YN) on a rectangular coordinate system.
The resulting set of points is sometimes called a scatter diagram.
From the scatter diagram it is often possible to visualize a smooth curve that approximates the data.
Such a curve is called an approximating curve. In Fig. 13-1, for example, the data appear to be approxi-
mated well by a straight line, and so we say that a linear relationship exists between the variables. In
Fig. 13-2, however, although a relationship exists between the variables, it is not a linear relationship,
and so we call it a nonlinear relationship.
The general problem of ﬁnding equations of approximating curves that ﬁt given sets of data is called
curve ﬁtting.

EQUATIONS OF APPROXIMATING CURVES
Several common types of approximating curves and their equations are listed below for reference
purposes. All letters other than X and Y represent constants. The variables X and Y are often referred to
as independent and dependent variables, respectively, although these roles can be interchanged.

Nonlinear relationships sometimes describe the relationship between two variables.

The right sides of the above equations are called polynomials of the ﬁrst, second, third, fourth, and nth
degrees, respectively. The functions deﬁned by the ﬁrst four equations are sometimes called linear,
quadratic, cubic, and quartic functions, respectively.
The following are some of the many other equations frequently used in practice:

ð14Þ
To decide which curve should be used, it is helpful to obtain scatter diagrams of transformed
variables. For example, if a scatter diagram of log Y versus X shows a linear relationship, the equation
has the form (7), while if log Y versus log X shows a linear relationship, the equation has the form (8).
Special graph paper is often used in order to make it easy to decide which curve to use. Graph paper
having one scale calibrated logarithmically is called semilogarithmic (or semilog) graph paper, and that
having both scales calibrated logarithmically is called log-log graph paper.
FREEHAND METHOD OF CURVE FITTING
Individual judgment can often be used to draw an approximating curve to ﬁt a set of data. This is
called a freehand method of curve ﬁtting. If the type of equation of this curve is known, it is possible to
obtain the constants in the equation by choosing as many points on the curve as there are constants in
the equation. For example, if the curve is a straight line, two points are necessary; if it is a parabola, three
points are necessary. The method has the disadvantage that diﬀerent observers will obtain diﬀerent
curves and equations.
THE STRAIGHT LINE
The simplest type of approximating curve is a straight line, whose equation can be written
Y ¼ a0 þ a1X
ð15Þ
Given any two points ðX1,Y1Þ and ðX2,Y2Þ on the line, the constants a0 and a1 can be determined. The
resulting equation of the line can be written
Y  Y1 ¼
Y2  Y1
X2  X1


ðX  X1Þ
or
Y  Y1 ¼ mðX  X1Þ
ð16Þ
where
m ¼ Y2  Y1
X2  X1
is called the slope of the line and represents the change in Y divided by the corresponding change in X.

When the equation is written in the form (15), the constant a1 is the slope m. The constant a0, which
is the value of Y when X ¼ 0, is called the Y intercept.
THE METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES
To avoid individual judgment in constructing lines, parabolas, or other approximating curves to ﬁt
sets of data, it is necessary to agree on a deﬁnition of a ‘‘best-ﬁtting line,’’ ‘‘best-ﬁtting parabola,’’ etc.
By way of forming a deﬁnition, consider Fig. 13-3, in which the data points are given by ðX1,Y1Þ,
ðX2,Y2Þ, . . . , ðXN,YNÞ. For a given value of X, say X1, there will be a diﬀerence between the value Y1 and
the corresponding value as determined from the curve C. As shown in the ﬁgure, we denote this
diﬀerence by D1, which is sometimes referred to as a deviation, error, or residual and may be positive,
negative, or zero. Similarly, corresponding to the values X2, . . . , XN we obtain the deviations
D2, . . . , DN.
A measure of the ‘‘goodness of ﬁt’’ of the curve C to the given data is provided by the quantity
D2
1 þ D2
2 þ    þ D2
N. If this is small, the ﬁt is good; if it is large, the ﬁt is bad. We therefore make the
following
Deﬁnition:
Of all curves approximating a given set of data points, the curve having the
property that D2
1 þ D2
2 þ    þ D2
N is a minimum is called a best-ﬁtting curve.
A curve having this property is said to ﬁt the data in the least-squares sense and is called a least-squares
curve. Thus a line having this property is called a least-squares line, a parabola with this property is called
a least-squares parabola, etc.
It is customary to employ the above deﬁnition when X is the independent variable and Y is the
dependent variable. If X is the dependent variable, the deﬁnition is modiﬁed by considering horizontal
instead of vertical deviations, which amounts to an interchange of the X and Y axes. These two deﬁni-
tions generally lead to diﬀerent least-squares curves. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we shall consider Y the
dependent variable and X the independent variable.
It is possible to deﬁne another least-squares curve by considering perpendicular distances from each
of the data points to the curve instead of either vertical or horizontal distances. However, this is not used
very often.
THE LEAST-SQUARES LINE
The least-squares line approximating the set of points ðX1,Y1Þ, ðX2,Y2Þ, . . . , ðXN,YNÞ has the equation
Y ¼ a0 þ a1X

where the constants a0 and a1 are determined by solving simultaneously the equations
P Y ¼ a0N
þ a1
P X
P XY ¼ a0
P X þ a1
P X2
ð18Þ
which are called the normal equations for the least-squares line (17). The constants a0 and a1 of equations
(18) can, if desired, be found from the formulas
a0 ¼ ðP YÞðP X2Þ  ðP XÞðP XYÞ
N P X2  ðP XÞ2
a1 ¼ N P XY  ðP XÞðP YÞ
N P X2  ðP XÞ2
ð19Þ
The normal equations (18) are easily remembered by observing that the ﬁrst equation can be
obtained formally by summing on both sides of (17) [i.e., P Y ¼ P ða0 þ a1XÞ ¼ a0N þ a1
P X,
while the second equation is obtained formally by ﬁrst multiplying both sides of (17) by X and then
summing [i.e., P XY ¼ P Xða0 þ a1XÞ ¼ a0
P X þ a1
P X2. Note that this is not a derivation of the
normal equations, but simply a means for remembering them. Note also that in equations (18) and (19)
we have used the short notation P X, P XY, etc., in place of PN
j¼1 Xj, PN
j¼1 XjYj, etc.
The labor involved in ﬁnding a least-squares line can sometimes be shortened by transforming the
data so that x ¼ X  X and y ¼ Y  Y. The equation of the least-squares line can then be written
(see Problem 13.15)
y ¼
P xy
P x2


x
or
y ¼
P xY
P x2


x
ð20Þ
In particular, if X is such that P X ¼ 0 (i.e., X ¼ 0), this becomes
Y ¼ Y þ
P XY
P X2


X
ð21Þ
Equation (20) implies that y ¼ 0 when x ¼ 0; thus the least-squares line passes through the point
ð X, YÞ, called the centroid, or center of gravity, of the data.
If the variable X is taken to be the dependent instead of the independent variable, we write equation
(17) as X ¼ b0 þ b1Y. Then the above results hold if X and Y are interchanged and a0 and a1 are replaced
by b0 and b1, respectively. The resulting least-squares line, however, is generally not the same as that
obtained above [see Problems 13.11 and 13.15(d)].
NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIPS
Nonlinear relationships can sometimes be reduced to linear relationships by an appropriate trans-
formation of the variables (see Problem 13.21).
THE LEAST-SQUARES PARABOLA
The least-squares parabola approximating the set of points ðX1,Y1Þ, ðX2,Y2Þ, . . . , ðXN,YN) has the
equation
Y ¼ a0 þ a1X þ a2X2
ð22Þ
where the constants a0, a1, and a2 are determined by solving simultaneously the equations
P Y
¼ a0N
þ a1
P X þ a2
P X2
P XY ¼ a0
P X þ a1
P X2 þ a2
P X3
P X2Y ¼ a0
P X2 þ a1
P X3 þ a2
P X4
ð23Þ
called the normal equations for the least-squares parabola (22).

Equations (23) are easily remembered by observing that they can be obtained formally by multi-
plying equation (22) by 1, X, and X2, respectively, and summing on both sides of the resulting equations.
This technique can be extended to obtain normal equations for least-squares cubic curves, least-squares
quartic curves, and in general any of the least-squares curves corresponding to equation (5).
As in the case of the least-squares line, simpliﬁcations of equations (23) occur if X is chosen so that
P X ¼ 0. Simpliﬁcation also occurs by choosing the new variables x ¼ X  X and y ¼ Y  Y.
REGRESSION
Often, on the basis of sample data, we wish to estimate the value of a variable Y corresponding to a
given value of a variable X. This can be accomplished by estimating the value of Y from a least-squares
curve that ﬁts the sample data. The resulting curve is called a regression curve of Y on X, since Y is
estimated from X.
If we wanted to estimate the value of X from a given value of Y, we would use a regression curve of X
on Y, which amounts to interchanging the variables in the scatter diagram so that X is the dependent
variable and Y is the independent variable. This is equivalent to replacing the vertical deviations in the
deﬁnition of the least-squares curve on page 284 with horizontal deviations.
In general, the regression line or curve of Y on X is not the same as the regression line or curve
of X on Y.
APPLICATIONS TO TIME SERIES
If the independent variable X is time, the data show the values of Y at various times. Data arranged
according to time are called time series. The regression line or curve of Y on X in this case is often called a
trend line or trend curve and is often used for purposes of estimation, prediction, or forecasting.
PROBLEMS INVOLVING MORE THAN TWO VARIABLES
Problems involving more than two variables can be treated in a manner analogous to that for two
variables. For example, there may be a relationship between the three variables X, Y, and Z that can be
described by the equation
Z ¼ a0 þ a1X þ a2Y
ð24Þ
which is called a linear equation in the variables X, Y, and Z.
In a three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system this equation represents a plane, and the actual
sample points ðX1,Y1, Z1Þ, ðX2, Y2, Z2Þ, . . . , ðXN, YN, ZNÞ may ‘‘scatter’’ not too far from this plane,
which we call an approximating plane.
By extension of the method of least squares, we can speak of a least-squares plane approximating the
data. If we are estimating Z from given values of X and Y, this would be called a regression plane of Z on
X and Y. The normal equations corresponding to the least-squares plane (24) are given by
P Z
¼ a0N
þ a1
P X
þ a2
P Y
P XZ ¼ a0
P X þ a1
P X2 þ a2
P XY
P YZ ¼ a0
P Y þ a1
P XY þ a2
P Y2
ð25Þ
and can be remembered as being obtained from equation (24) by multiplying by 1, X, and Y successively
and then summing.

More complicated equations than (24) can also be considered. These represent regression surfaces. If
the number of variables exceeds three, geometric intuition is lost since we then require four-, ﬁve-, . . .
n-dimensional spaces.
Problems involving the estimation of a variable from two or more variables are called problems of
multiple regression and will be considered in more detail in Chapter 15.

(b)
Find the equation of a straight line that passes through the points ð2, 3Þ and (4, 5).
SOLUTION
(a)
The equation of a straight line is
Y ¼ a0 þ a1X
ð29Þ
Since ðX1,Y1Þ lies on the line,
Y1 ¼ a0 þ a1X1
ð30Þ
Since ðX2,Y2Þ lies on the line,
Y2 ¼ a0 þ a1X2
ð31Þ
Subtracting equation (30) from (29),
Y  Y1 ¼ a1ðX  X1Þ
ð32Þ
Subtracting equation (30) from (31),
Y2  Y1 ¼ a1ðX2  X1Þ
or
a1 ¼ Y2  Y1
X2  X1
Substituting this value of a1 into equation (32), we obtain
Y  Y1 ¼ Y2  Y1
X2  X1
ðX  X1Þ
as required. The quantity
Y2  Y1
X2  X1
often abbreviated m, represents the change in Y divided by the corresponding change in X and is the
slope of the line. The required equation can be written Y  Y1 ¼ mðX  X1Þ.
(b)
First method [using the result of part (a)]
Corresponding to the ﬁrst point ð2, 3Þ, we have X1 ¼ 2 and Y1 ¼ 3; corresponding to the
second point (4, 5), we have X2 ¼ 4 and Y2 ¼ 5. Thus the slope is
m ¼ Y2  Y1
X2  X1
¼ 5  ð3Þ
4  2
¼ 8
2 ¼ 4
and the required equation is
Y  Y1 ¼ mðX  X1Þ
or
Y  ð3Þ ¼ 4ðX  2Þ
which can be written Y þ 3 ¼ 4ðX  2Þ, or Y ¼ 4X  11.
Second method
The equation of a straight line is Y ¼ a0 þ a1X. Since the point ð2,  3Þ is on the line
3 ¼ a0 þ 2a1, and since the point (4, 5) is on the line, 5 ¼ a0 þ 4a1; solving these two equations
simultaneously, we obtain a1 ¼ 4 and a0 ¼ 11. Thus the required equation is
Y ¼ 11 þ 4X
or
Y ¼ 4X  11

Find (a) the slope, (b) the equation, (c) the Y intercept, and (d) the X intercept of the line that
passes through the points (1, 5) and ð4, 1Þ.
SOLUTION
(a)
ðX1 ¼ 1, Y1 ¼ 5Þ and ðX2 ¼ 4, Y2 ¼ 1Þ. Thus
m ¼ slope ¼ Y2  Y1
X2  X1
¼ 1  5
4  1 ¼ 6

The negative sign of the slope indicates that as X increases, Y decreases, as shown in Fig. 13-8.
(b)
The equation of the line is
Y  Y1 ¼ mðX  X1Þ
or
Y  5 ¼ 2ðX  1Þ
That is,
Y  5 ¼ 2X þ 2
or
Y ¼ 7  2X
This can also be obtained by the second method of Problem 13.3(b).
(c)
The Y intercept, which is the value of Y when X ¼ 0, is given by Y ¼ 7  2ð0Þ ¼ 7. This can also be
seen directly from Fig. 13-8.
(d)
The X intercept is the value of X when Y ¼ 0. Substituting Y ¼ 0 in the equation Y ¼ 7  2X, we have
0 ¼ 7  2X, or 2X ¼ 7 and X ¼ 3:5. This can also be seen directly from Fig. 13-8.
13.6
Find the equation of a line passing through the point (4, 2) that is parallel to the line 2X þ 3Y ¼ 6.
SOLUTION
If two lines are parallel, their slopes are equal. From 2X þ 3Y ¼ 6 we have 3Y ¼ 6  2X, or
Y ¼ 2  2
3 X, so that the slope of the line is m ¼  2
3. Thus the equation of the required line is
Y  Y1 ¼ mðX  X1Þ
or
Y  2 ¼  2

which can also be written 2X þ 3Y ¼ 14.

Any line parallel to 2X þ 3Y ¼ 6 has the equation 2X þ 3Y ¼ c. To ﬁnd c, let X ¼ 4 and Y ¼ 2. Then
2ð4Þ þ 3ð2Þ ¼ c, or c ¼ 14, and the required equation is 2X þ 3Y ¼ 14.
13.7
Find the equation of a line whose slope is 4 and whose Y intercept is 16.
SOLUTION
In the equation Y ¼ a0 þ a1X, a0 ¼ 16 is the Y intercept and a1 ¼ 4 is the slope. Thus the required
equation is Y ¼ 16  4X.
13.8
(a)
Construct a straight line that approximates the data of Table 13.3.
(b)
Find an equation for this line.
SOLUTION
(a)
Plot the points (1, 1), (3, 2), (4, 4), (6, 4), (8, 5), (9, 7), (11, 8), and (14, 9) on a rectangular coordinate
system, as shown in Fig. 13-9. A straight line approximating the data is drawn freehand in the ﬁgure.
For a method eliminating the need for individual judgment, see Problem 13.11, which uses the method
of least squares.
(b)
To obtain the equation of the line constructed in part (a), choose any two points on the line, such as P
and Q; the coordinates of points P and Q, as read from the graph, are approximately (0, 1) and (12, 7.5).
The equation of the line is Y ¼ a0 þ a1X. Thus for point (0, 1) we have 1 ¼ a0 þ a1ð0Þ, and for point
(12, 7.5) we have 7:5 ¼ a0 þ 12a1; since the ﬁrst of these equations gives us a0 ¼ 1, the second gives us
a1 ¼ 6:5=12 ¼ 0:542. Thus the required equation is Y ¼ 1 þ 0:542X.
Another method
Y  Y1 ¼ Y2  Y1

and
Y  1 ¼ 7:4  1

of Y corresponding to other values of X can be obtained similarly. The values of Y estimated from the
equation Y ¼ 1 þ 0:542X are denoted by Yest. These estimated values, together with the actual data
from Table 13.3, are shown in Table 13.4.
(b)
The estimated value of Y when X ¼ 10 is Y ¼ 1 þ 0:542ð10Þ ¼ 6:42, or 6.4.

Since there are eight pairs of values of X and Y, N ¼ 8 and the normal equations become

or

Thus Y ¼ a0 þ a1X, or Y ¼ 0:545 þ 0:636X, as before.
(b)
If X is considered the dependent variable, and Y the independent variable, the equation of the least-
squares line is X ¼ b0 þ b1Y and the normal equations are
P X
¼ b0N
þ b1
P Y
P XY ¼ b0
P Y þ b1
P Y2
Then from Table 13.6 the normal equations become
8b0 þ 40b1 ¼ 56
40b0 þ 256b1 ¼ 364
from which b0 ¼  1
2, or 0:50, and b1 ¼ 3

b0 ¼ ðP XÞðP Y2Þ  ðP YÞðP XYÞ

N P Y2  ðP YÞ2
¼ ð8Þð364Þ  ð56Þð40Þ
ð8Þð256Þ  ð40Þ2
¼ 1:50
Thus the required equation of the least-squares line is X ¼ b0 þ b1Y, or X ¼ 0:50 þ 1:50Y.
Note that by solving this equation for Y we obtain Y ¼ 1
3 þ 2
3 X, or Y ¼ 0:333 þ 0:667X, which is
not the same as the line obtained in part (a).
13.12 For the height/weight data in Problem 13.10 use the statistical package SAS to plot the observed
data points and the least-squares line on the same graph.
SOLUTION
In Fig. 13-11, the observed data values are shown as open circles, and the least-squares line is shown as
a dashed line.

SAS plot of the data points from Table 13.5 and the least-squares line.

13.13 (a)
Show that the two least-squares lines obtained in Problem 13.11 intersect at point ð X, YÞ.
(b)
Estimate the value of Y when X ¼ 12.
(c)
Estimate the value of X when Y ¼ 3.
SOLUTION
X ¼
P X
N
¼ 56
8 ¼ 7
Y ¼
P Y
N
¼ 40
8 ¼ 5
Thus point ð X, YÞ, called the centroid, is (7, 5).
(a)
Point (7, 5) lies on line Y ¼ 0:545 þ 0:636X; or, more exactly, Y ¼ 6
11 þ 7
11 X, since 5 ¼ 6
11 þ 7
11 ð7Þ. Point
(7, 5) lies on line X ¼  1
2 þ 3
2 Y, since 7 ¼  1
2 þ 3
2 ð5Þ.
Another method
The equations of the two lines are Y ¼ 6
11 þ 7
11 X and X ¼  1
2 þ 3
2 Y. Solving simultaneously,
we ﬁnd that X ¼ 7 and Y ¼ 5. Thus the lines intersect at point (7,5).
(b)
Putting X ¼ 12 into the regression line of Y (Problem 13.11), Y ¼ 0:545 þ 0:636ð12Þ ¼ 8:2.
(c)
Putting Y ¼ 3 into the regression line of X (Problem 13.11), X ¼ 0:50 þ 1:50ð3Þ ¼ 4:0.
13.14 Prove that a least-squares line always passes through the point ð X, YÞ.
SOLUTION
Case 1 (X is the independent variable)
The equation of the least-squares line is
Y ¼ a0 þ a1X
ð34Þ
A normal equation for the least-squares line is
P Y ¼ a0N þ a1
P X
ð35Þ
Dividing both sides of equation (35) by N gives
Y ¼ a0 þ a1 X
ð36Þ
Subtracting equation (36) from equation (34), the least-squares line can be written
Y  Y ¼ a1ðX  XÞ
ð37Þ
which shows that the line passes through the point ð X, YÞ.
Case 2 (Y is the independent variable)
Proceeding as in Case 1, but interchanging X and Y and replacing the constants a0 and a1 with b0 and
b1, respectively, we ﬁnd that the least-squares line can be written
X  X ¼ b1ðY  YÞ
ð38Þ
which indicates that the line passes through the point ð X, YÞ.
Note that lines (37) and (38) are not coincident, but intersect in ð X, YÞ.
13.15 (a)
Considering X to be the independent variable, show that the equation of the least-squares
line can be written
y ¼

or
y ¼

where x ¼ X  X and y ¼ Y  Y.

(b)
If X ¼ 0, show that the least-squares line in part (a) can be written

(c)
Write the equation of the least-squares line corresponding to that in part (a) if Y is the
independent variable.
(d)
Verify that the lines in parts (a) and (c) are not necessarily the same.
SOLUTION
(a)
Equation (37) can be written y ¼ a1x, where x ¼ X  X and y ¼ Y  Y. Also, from the simultaneous
solution of the normal equations (18) we have
a1 ¼ N P XY  ðP XÞðP YÞ
N P X2  ðP XÞ2
¼ N P ðx þ XÞðy þ YÞ  ½P ðx þ X½P ðy þ YÞ

N P x2 þ 2N X P x þ N2 X2  ðP x þ N XÞ2
But P x ¼ P ðX  XÞ ¼ 0 and P y ¼ P ðY  YÞ ¼ 0; hence the above simpliﬁes to
a1 ¼ N P xy þ N2 X Y  N2 X Y
N P x2 þ N2 X2  N2 X2 ¼

This can also be written

P x2 ¼
P xðY  YÞ
P x2

Thus the least-squares line is y ¼ a1x; that is,

or
y ¼

(b)
If X ¼ 0, x ¼ X  X ¼ X. Then from

we have
y ¼

X
or
Y ¼ Y þ
P XY
P X2

Another method
The normal equations of the least-squares line Y ¼ a0 þ a1X are
P Y ¼ a0N þ a1
P X
and
P XY ¼ a0
P X þ a1
P X2
If X ¼ ðP XÞ=N ¼ 0, then P X ¼ 0 and the normal equations become
P Y ¼ a0N
and
P XY ¼ a1
P X2
from which
a0 ¼
P Y
N
¼ Y
and
a1 ¼
P XY
P X2
Thus the required equation of the least-squares line is
Y ¼ a0 þ a1X
or
Y ¼ Y þ

(c)
By interchanging X and Y or x and y, we can show as in part (a) that

From part (a), the least-squares line is

Since in general

the least-squares lines (39) and (40) are diﬀerent in general. Note, however, that they intersect at x ¼ 0
and y ¼ 0 [i.e., at the point ð X, YÞ].
13.16 If X 0 ¼ X þ A and Y 0 ¼ Y þ B, where A and B are any constants, prove that
a1 ¼ N P XY  ðP XÞðP YÞ
N P X2  ðP XÞ2
¼ N P X 0Y 0  ðP X 0ÞðP Y 0Þ
N P X 02  ðP X 0Þ2

SOLUTION
x 0 ¼ X 0  X 0 ¼ ðX þ AÞ  ð X þ AÞ ¼ X  X ¼ x
y 0 ¼ Y 0  Y 0 ¼ ðY þ BÞ  ð Y þ BÞ ¼ Y  Y ¼ y
Then
P xy
P x2 ¼
P x 0y 0
P x 02
and the result follows from Problem 13.15. A similar result holds for b1.
This result is useful, since it enables us to simplify calculations in obtaining the regression line by
subtracting suitable constants from the variables X and Y (see the second method of Problem 13.17).
Note: The result does not hold if X 0 ¼ c1X þ A and Y 0 ¼ c2Y þ B unless c1 ¼ c2.
13.17 Fit a least-squares line to the data of Problem 13.10 by using (a) X as the independent variable
and (b) X as the dependent variable.
SOLUTION
First method
(a)
From Problem 13.15(a) the required line is
y ¼
P xy
P x2


x
where x ¼ X  X and y ¼ Y  Y. The work involved in computing the sums can be arranged as in
Table 13.7. From the ﬁrst two columns we ﬁnd X ¼ 802=12 ¼ 66:8 and Y ¼ 1850=12 ¼ 154:2. The last
column has been added for use in part (b).

The required least-squares line is
y ¼
P xy
P x2


x ¼ 616:32
191:68 x ¼ 3:22x
or Y  154:2 ¼ 3:22ðX  66:8Þ, which can be written Y ¼ 3:22X  60:9. This equation is called the
regression line of Y on X and is used for estimating Y from given values of X.
(b)
If X is the dependent variable, the required line is
x ¼
P xy
P y2


y ¼ 616:32
2659:68 y ¼ 0:232y
which can be written X  66:8 ¼ 0:232ðY  154:2Þ, or X ¼ 31:0 þ 0:232Y. This equation is called the
regression line of X on Y and is used for estimating X from given values of Y.
Note that the method of Problem 13.11 can also be used if desired.
Second method
Using the result of Problem 13.16, we may subtract suitable constants from X and Y. We choose to
subtract 65 from X and 150 from Y. Then the results can be arranged as in Table 13.7.
a1 ¼ N P X 0Y 0  ðP X 0ÞðP Y 0Þ
N P X 02  ðP X 0Þ2
¼ ð12Þð708Þ  ð22Þð50Þ
ð12Þð232Þ  ð22Þ2
¼ 3:22
b1 ¼ N P X 0Y 0  ðP Y 0ÞðP X 0Þ
N P Y 02  ðP Y 0Þ2
¼ ð12Þð708Þ  ð50Þð22Þ
ð12Þð2868Þ  ð50Þ2 ¼ 0:232
Since X ¼ 65 þ 22=12 ¼ 66:8 and Y ¼ 150 þ 50=12 ¼ 154:2, the regression equations are Y  154:2 ¼
3:22ðX  66:8Þ and X  66:8 ¼ 0:232ðY  154:2Þ; that is Y ¼ 3:22X  60:9 and X ¼ 0:232Y þ 31:0, in
agreement with the ﬁrst method.
13.18 Work Problem 13.17 using MINITAB. Plot the regression line of weight on height and the
regression line of height on weight on the same set of axes. Show that the point ð X, YÞ satisﬁes
both equations. The lines therefore intersect at ð X, YÞ.

SOLUTION
ð X, YÞ is the same as (xbar, ybar) and equals (66.83, 154.17). Note that weight ¼ 3:22ð66:83Þ
60:9 ¼ 154:17 and height ¼ 31.0 þ 0.232(154.17) ¼ 66.83. Therefore, both lines pass through (xbar, ybar).

Table 13.14 gives X ¼ log V and Y ¼ log P, corresponding to the values of V and P in Table 13.13, and
also indicates the calculations involved in computing the least-squares line (41). The normal equations
corresponding to the least-squares line (41) are
P Y ¼ a0N þ a1

and
P XY ¼ a0

from which
a0 ¼ ðP YÞðP X2Þ  ðP XÞðP XYÞ

a1 ¼ N P XY  ðP XÞðP YÞ
N P X2  ðP XÞ2

Thus Y ¼ 4:20  1:40X.
(a)
Since a0 ¼ 4:20 ¼ log C and a1 ¼ 1:40 ¼ , C ¼ 1:60  104 and  ¼ 1:40.
(b)
The required equation in terms of P and V can be written PV1:40 ¼ 16,000.
(c)
When V ¼ 100, X ¼ log V ¼ 2 and Y ¼ log P ¼ 4:20  1:40ð2Þ ¼ 1:40. Then P ¼ antilog 1:40 ¼
25:1 lb=in2.

Table 13.16 gives the ﬁtted values and residuals for the straight line ﬁt to the data.
Table 13.17 gives the ﬁtted values and residuals for the parabolic ﬁt to the data. The sum of squares of
the residuals for the straight line is 76.073 and the sum of squares of the residuals for the parabola is 20.042.
It appears that, overall, the parabola ﬁts the data better than the straight line.
To predict the population in the year 2010, note that the coded value for 2010 is 11. The straight line
predicted value is population ¼ 166 þ 12.6x ¼ 166 þ 138.6 ¼ 304.6 million and the parabola model predicts
population ¼ 174 þ 9.03x þ 0.326x2 ¼ 174 þ 99.33 þ 39.446 ¼ 312.776.

CHAPTER 14
Correlation Theory
CORRELATION AND REGRESSION
In Chapter 13 we considered the problem of regression, or estimation, of one variable (the dependent
variable) from one or more related variables (the independent variables). In this chapter we consider the
closely related problem of correlation, or the degree of relationship between variables, which seeks to
determine how well a linear or other equation describes or explains the relationship between variables.
If all values of the variables satisfy an equation exactly, we say that the variables are perfectly
correlated or that there is perfect correlation between them. Thus the circumferences C and radii r
of all circles are perfectly correlated since C ¼ 2r. If two dice are tossed simultaneously 100 times,
there is no relationship between corresponding points on each die (unless the dice are loaded);
that is, they are uncorrelated. Such variables as the height and weight of individuals would show some
correlation.
When only two variables are involved, we speak of simple correlation and simple regression. When
more than two variables are involved, we speak of multiple correlation and multiple regression.
This chapter considers only simple correlation. Multiple correlation and regression are considered
in Chapter 15.
LINEAR CORRELATION
If X and Y denote the two variables under consideration, a scatter diagram shows the location of
points ðX,YÞ on a rectangular coordinate system. If all points in this scatter diagram seem to lie near a
line, as in Figs. 14-1(a) and 14-1(b), the correlation is called linear. In such cases, as we have seen in
Chapter 13, a linear equation is appropriate for purposes of regression (or estimation).
If Y tends to increase as X increases, as in Fig. 14-1(a), the correlation is called positive, or direct,
correlation. If Y tends to decrease as X increases, as in Fig. 14-1(b), the correlation is called negative, or
inverse, correlation.
If all points seem to lie near some curve, the correlation is called nonlinear, and a nonlinear equation
is appropriate for regression, as we have seen in Chapter 13. It is clear that nonlinear correlation can be
sometimes positive and sometimes negative.
If there is no relationship indicated between the variables, as in Fig. 14-1(c), we say that there is
no correlation between them (i.e., they are uncorrelated).

MEASURES OF CORRELATION
We can determine in a qualitative manner how well a given line or curve describes the relation-
ship between variables by direct observation of the scatter diagram itself. For example, it is seen
that a straight line is far more helpful in describing the relation between X and Y for the data of
Fig. 14-1(a) than for the data of Fig. 14-1(b) because of the fact that there is less scattering about the
line of Fig. 14-1(a).
If we are to deal with the problem of scattering of sample data about lines or curves in a quantitative
manner, it will be necessary for us to devise measures of correlation
THE LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION LINES
We ﬁrst consider the problem of how well a straight line explains the relationship between two
variables. To do this, we shall need the equations for the least-squares regression lines obtained in
Chapter 13. As we have seen, the least-squares regression line of Y on X is
Y ¼ a0 þ a1X

The regression equations are identical if and only if all points of the scatter diagram lie on a line.
In such case there is perfect linear correlation between X and Y.
STANDARD ERROR OF ESTIMATE
If we let Yest represent the value of Y for given values of X as estimated from equation (1), a measure
of the scatter about the regression line of Y on X is supplied by the quantity
sY:X ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
P ðY  YestÞ2
N
s
ð8Þ
which is called the standard error of estimate of Y on X.

If the regression line (4) is used, an analogous standard error of estimate of X on Y is deﬁned by
sX:Y ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

In general, sY:X 6¼ sX:Y.
Equation (8) can be written

Y:X ¼
P Y2  a0
P Y  a1
P XY
N
ð10Þ
which may be more suitable for computation (see Problem 14.3). A similar expression exists for
equation (9).
The standard error of estimate has properties analogous to those of the standard deviation.
For example, if we construct lines parallel to the regression line of Y on X at respective vertical distances
sY:X, 2sY:X, and 3sY:X from it, we should ﬁnd, if N is large enough, that there would be included
between these lines about 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the sample points.

is useful. For this reason, some statisticians prefer to deﬁne equation (8) or (9) with N  2 replacing
N in the denominator.
EXPLAINED AND UNEXPLAINED VARIATION
The total variation of Y is deﬁned as P ðY  YÞ2: that is, the sum of the squares of the deviations
of the values of Y from the mean Y. As shown in Problem 14.7, this can be written
P ðY  YÞ2 ¼ P ðY  YestÞ2 þ P ðYest  YÞ2
ð11Þ
The ﬁrst term on the right of equation (11) is called the unexplained variation, while the second term
is called the explained variation—so called because the deviations Yest  Y have a deﬁnite pattern, while
the deviations Y  Yest behave in a random or unpredictable manner. Similar results hold for the
variable X.
COEFFICIENT OF CORRELATION
The ratio of the explained variation to the total variation is called the coeﬃcient of determination.
If there is zero explained variation (i.e., the total variation is all unexplained), this ratio is 0. If there is
zero unexplained variation (i.e., the total variation is all explained), the ratio is 1. In other cases the ratio
lies between 0 and 1. Since the ratio is always nonnegative, we denote it by r2. The quantity r, called the
coeﬃcient of correlation (or brieﬂy correlation coeﬃcient), is given by
r ¼ 

and varies between 1 and þ1. The þ and  signs are used for positive linear correlation and negative
linear correlation, respectively. Note that r is a dimensionless quantity; that is, it does not depend on the
units employed.
By using equations (8) and (11) and the fact that the standard deviation of Y is
sY ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
P ðY  YÞ2

or

Similar equations exist when X and Y are interchanged.
For the case of linear correlation, the quantity r is the same regardless of whether X or Y is
considered the independent variable. Thus r is a very good measure of the linear correlation between
two variables.
REMARKS CONCERNING THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT
The deﬁnitions of the correlation coeﬃcient in equations (12) and (14) are quite general and can be
used for nonlinear relationships as well as for linear ones, the only diﬀerences being that Yest is computed
from a nonlinear regression equation in place of a linear equation and that the þ and  signs are
omitted. In such case equation (8), deﬁning the standard error of estimate, is perfectly general. Equation
(10), however, which applies to linear regression only, must be modiﬁed. If, for example, the estimating
equation is
Y ¼ a0 þ a1X þ a2X2 þ    þ an1Xn1
ð15Þ
then equation (10) is replaced by
s2
Y:X ¼
P Y2  a0
P Y  a1
P XY      an1
P Xn1Y
N
ð16Þ
In such case the modiﬁed standard error of estimate (discussed earlier in this chapter) is
^sY:X ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N
N  n
r
sY:X
where the quantity N  n is called the number of degrees of freedom.
It must be emphasized that in every case the computed value of r measures the degree of the
relationship relative to the type of equation that is actually assumed. Thus if a linear equation is assumed
and equation (12) or (14) yields a value of r near zero, it means that there is almost no linear correlation
between the variables. However, it does not mean that there is no correlation at all, since there may
actually be a high nonlinear correlation between the variables. In other words, the correlation coeﬃcient
measures the goodness of ﬁt between (1) the equation actually assumed and (2) the data. Unless other-
wise speciﬁed, the term correlation coeﬃcient is used to mean linear correlation coeﬃcient.
It should also be pointed out that a high correlation coeﬃcient (i.e., near 1 or 1) does not
necessarily indicate a direct dependence of the variables. Thus there may be a high correlation between
the number of books published each year and the number of thunderstorms each year. Such examples
are sometimes referred to as nonsense, or spurious, correlations.

PRODUCT-MOMENT FORMULA FOR THE LINEAR CORRELATION COEFFICIENT
If a linear relationship between two variables is assumed, equation (12) becomes
r ¼
P xy
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ðP x2ÞðP y2Þ
p
ð17Þ
where x ¼ X  X and y ¼ Y  Y (see Problem 14.10). This formula, which automatically gives the
proper sign of r, is called the product-moment formula and clearly shows the symmetry between X and Y.
If we write
sXY ¼
P xy
N
sX ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
P x2
N
s
sY ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
P y2
N
s
ð18Þ
then sX and sY will be recognized as the standard deviations of the variables X and Y, respectively, while
s2
X and s2
Y are their variances. The new quantity sXY is called the covariance of X and Y. In terms of the
symbols of formulas (18), formula (17) can be written
r ¼ sXY
sXsY
ð19Þ
Note that r is not only independent of the choice of units of X and Y, but is also independent of the
choice of origin.

which is often used in computing r.
For data grouped as in a bivariate frequency table, or bivariate frequency distribution (see Problem

written
r ¼

where cX and cY are the class-interval widths (assumed constant) corresponding to the variables X and

Formula (19) is seen to be equivalent to (21) if results (22) to (24) are used.

REGRESSION LINES AND THE LINEAR CORRELATION COEFFICIENT
The equation of the least-squares line Y ¼ a0 þ a1X, the regression line of Y on X, can be written
Y  Y ¼ rsY
sX
ðX  XÞ
or
y ¼ rsY
sX
x
ð25Þ
Similarly, the regression line of X on Y, X ¼ b0 þ b1Y, can be written
X  X ¼ rsX
sY
ðY  YÞ
or
x ¼ rsX
sY
y
ð26Þ
The slopes of the lines in equations (25) and (26) are equal if and only if r ¼ 1. In such case the two
lines are identical and there is perfect linear correlation between the variables X and Y. If r ¼ 0, the lines
are at right angles and there is no linear correlation between X and Y. Thus the linear correlation
coeﬃcient measures the departure of the two regression lines.
Note that if equations (25) and (26) are written Y ¼ a0 þ a1X and X ¼ b0 þ b1Y, respectively, then
a1b1 ¼ r2 (see Problem 14.22).
CORRELATION OF TIME SERIES
If each of the variables X and Y depends on time, it is possible that a relationship may exist between
X and Y even though such relationship is not necessarily one of direct dependence and may produce
‘‘nonsense correlation.’’ The correlation coeﬃcient is obtained simply by considering the pairs of values
ðX,YÞ corresponding to the various times and proceeding as usual, making use of the above formulas
(see Problem 14.28).
It is possible to attempt to correlate values of a variable X at certain times with corresponding values
of X at earlier times. Such correlation is often called autocorrelation.
CORRELATION OF ATTRIBUTES
The methods described in this chapter do not enable us to consider the correlation of variables
that are nonnumerical by nature, such as the attributes of individuals (e.g., hair color, eye color, etc.).
For a discussion of the correlation of attributes, see Chapter 12.
SAMPLING THEORY OF CORRELATION
The N pairs of values ðX, YÞ of two variables can be thought of as samples from a population of all
such pairs that are possible. Since two variables are involved, this is called a bivariate population, which
we assume to be a bivariate normal distribution.
We can think of a theoretical population coeﬃcient of correlation, denoted by , which is estimated
by the sample correlation coeﬃcient r. Tests of signiﬁcance or hypotheses concerning various values of 
require knowledge of the sampling distribution of r. For  ¼ 0 this distribution is symmetrical, and a
statistic involving Student’s distribution can be used. For  6¼ 0, the distribution is skewed; in such case a
transformation developed by Fisher produces a statistic that is approximately normally distributed.
The following tests summarize the procedures involved:
1. Test of Hypothesis  ¼ 0. Here we use the fact that the statistic
t ¼ r
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N  2
p
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1  r2
p
ð27Þ
has Student’s distribution with  ¼ N  2 degrees of freedom (see Problems 14.31 and 14.32).

2. Test of Hypothesis  ¼ 0 6¼ 0. Here we use the fact that the statistic
Z ¼ 1
2 loge
1 þ r
1  r

1  r

given by

Z ¼

ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N  3

ð29Þ
Equations (28) and (29) can also be used to ﬁnd conﬁdence limits for correlation coeﬃcients
(see Problems 14.33 and 14.34). Equation (28) is called Fisher’s Z transformation.
3. Signiﬁcance of a Diﬀerence between Correlation Coeﬃcients. To determine whether two correlation
coeﬃcients, r1 and r2, drawn from samples of sizes N1 and N2, respectively, diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
each other, we compute Z1 and Z2 corresponding to r1 and r2 by using equation (28). We then use the
fact that the test statistic
z ¼ Z1  Z2  Z1Z2
Z1Z2
ð30Þ
where
Z1Z2 ¼ Z1  Z2

SAMPLING THEORY OF REGRESSION
The regression equation Y ¼ a0 þ a1X is obtained on the basis of sample data. We are often
interested in the corresponding regression equation for the population from which the sample was
drawn. The following are three tests concerning such a population:
1. Test of Hypothesis a1 ¼ A1. To test the hypothesis that the regression coeﬃcient a1 is equal to some
speciﬁed value A1, we use the fact that the statistic
t ¼ a1  A1
sY:X=sX
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N  2
p
ð31Þ
has Student’s distribution with N  2 degrees of freedom. This can also be used to ﬁnd conﬁdence
intervals for population regression coeﬃcients from sample values (see Problems 14.36 and 14.37).
2. Test of Hypothesis for Predicted Values. Let Y0 denote the predicted value of Y corresponding to
X ¼ X0 as estimated from the sample regression equation (i.e., Y0 ¼ a0 þ a1X0Þ. Let Yp denote the
predicted value of Y corresponding to X ¼ X0 for the population. Then the statistic
t ¼

to X ¼ X0 as estimated from the sample regression equation (i.e., Y0 ¼ a0 þ a1X0Þ. Let Yp denote the

The comparison of the sums of squares of residuals indicates that the ﬁt for the least-squares regression
line of Y on X is much better than the ﬁt for the least-squares regression line of X on Y. Recall that the
smaller the sums of squares of residuals, the better the regression model ﬁts the data. The height of the father
is a better predictor of the height of the son than the height of the son is of the height of the father.

14.5
Compute the standard error of estimate, sY:X, for the data of Problem 14.1 by using (a) the
deﬁnition and (b) the result of Problem 14.4.
SOLUTION
(a)
From Problem 14.1(b) the regression line of Y on X is Y ¼ 35:82 þ 0:476X. Table 14.5 lists the actual
values of Y (from Table 14.1) and the estimated values of Y, denoted by Yest, as obtained from the
regression line; for example, corresponding to X ¼ 65 we have Yest ¼ 35:82 þ 0:476ð65Þ ¼ 66:76.
Also listed are the values Y  Yest, which are needed in computing sY:X:

SOLUTION
(a)
The regression line Y ¼ 35.82 þ 0.476X, as obtained in Problem 14.1, is shown as the line with the
squares on it. It is the middle of the three lines in Fig. 14-3. There are two other lines shown in Fig. 14-3.
They are at a vertical distance SY.X ¼ 1.28 from the regression line. They are called the lower and
upper lines.
(b)
The twelve data points are shown as black circles in Fig. 14-3. Eight of twelve or 66.7% of the data
points are between the upper and lower lines. Two data points are outside the lines and two are on the
lines.
EXPLAINED AND UNEXPLAINED VARIATION
14.7
Prove that P ðY  YÞ2 ¼ P ðY  YestÞ2 þ P ðYest  YÞ2.
SOLUTION
Squaring both sides of Y  Y ¼ ðY  YestÞ þ ðYest  YÞ and then summing, we have
P ðY  YÞ2 ¼ P ðY  YestÞ2 þ P ðYest  YÞ2 þ 2 P ðY  YestÞðYest  YÞ
The required result follows at once if we can show that the last sum is zero; in the case of linear regression,
this is so since
P ðY  YestÞðYest  YÞ ¼ P ðY  a0  a1XÞða0 þ a1X  YÞ
¼ a0
P ðY  a0  a1XÞ þ a1
P XðY  a0  a1XÞ  Y P ðY  a0  a1XÞ ¼ 0
because of the normal equations P ðY  a0  a1XÞ ¼ 0 and P XðY  a0  a1XÞ ¼ 0.
The result can similarly be shown valid for nonlinear regression by using a least-squares curve given by
Yest ¼ a0 þ a1X þ a2X2 þ    þ anXn.
14.8
Compute (a) the total variation, (b) the unexplained variation, and (c) the explained variation for
the data in Problem 14.1.
SOLUTION
The least-squares regression line is Yest ¼ 35:8 þ 0:476X. From Table 14.6, we see that the total variation
¼ P ðY  YÞ2 ¼ 38:917, the unexplained variation ¼ P ðY  YestÞ2 ¼ 19:703, and the explained variation
¼ P ðYest  YÞ2 ¼ 19:214.

p
is positive when yest increases as x increases (i.e., positive linear correlation) and negative when yest decreases
as x increases (i.e., negative linear correlation), it automatically has the correct sign associated with it. Hence
we deﬁne the coeﬃcient of linear correlation to be
r ¼

This is often called the product-moment formula for the linear correlation coeﬃcient.

14.12 In order to investigate the connection between grade point average (GPA) and hours of TV
watched per week, the pairs of data in Table 14.9 and Fig. 14-4 were collected and EXCEL
was used to make a scatter plot of the data. The data was collected on 10 high school students and
X is the number of hours the subject spends watching TV per week (TV hours) and Y is
their GPA:
Use EXCEL to compute the correlation coeﬃcient of the two variables and verify it by using the
product-moment formula.
SOLUTION
The EXCEL function ¼CORREL(E2:E11,F2:F11) is used to ﬁnd the correlation coeﬃcient, if the
TV hours are in E2:E11 and the GPA values are in F2:F11. The correlation coeﬃcient is 0.9097. The
negative value means that the two variables are negatively correlated. That is, as more hours of TV are
watched, the lower is the GPA.
14.13 A study recorded the starting salary (in thousands), Y, and years of education, X, for 10 workers.
The data and a SPSS scatter plot are given in Table 14.10 and Fig. 14-5.

14.17 Table 14.13 shows the frequency distributions of the ﬁnal grades of 100 students in mathematics
and physics. Referring to this table, determine:
(a)
The number of students who received grades of 70–79 in mathematics and 80–89 in physics.
(b)
The percentage of students with mathematics grades below 70.
(c)
The number of students who received a grade of 70 or more in physics and of less than 80 in
mathematics.

SOLUTION
(a)
In Table 14.13, proceed down the column headed 70–79 (mathematics grade) to the row marked 80–89
(physics grade), where the entry is 4, which is the required number of students.
(b)
The total number of students with mathematics grades below 70 is the number with grades 4049 þ the
number with grades 5059 þ the number with grades 6069 ¼ 7 þ 15 þ 25 ¼ 47. Thus the required
percentage of students is 47=100 ¼ 47%.
(c)
The required number of students is the total of the entries in Table 14.14 (which represents part of
Table 14.13). Thus the required number of students is 1 þ 5 þ 2 þ 4 þ 10 ¼ 22.
(d)
Table 14.15 (taken from Table 14.13) shows that the number of students with grades below 60 in both
mathematics and physics is 3 þ 3 þ 6 þ 5 ¼ 17. Thus the number of students with grades 60 or over in
either physics or mathematics or in both is 100  17 ¼ 83, and the required percentage is
83=100 ¼ 83%.
Table 14.13 is sometimes called a bivariate frequency table, or bivariate frequency distribution.
Each square in the table is called a cell and corresponds to a pair of classes or class intervals. The
number indicated in the cell is called the cell frequency. For example, in part (a) the number 4 is
the frequency of the cell corresponding to the pair of class intervals 70–79 in mathematics and 80–89 in
physics.
The totals indicated in the last row and last column are called marginal totals, or marginal frequencies.
They correspond, respectively, to the class frequencies of the separate frequency distributions of the mathe-
matics and physics grades.

14.18 Show how to modify the formula of Problem 14.15 for the case of data grouped as in the bivariate
frequency table (Table 14.13).
SOLUTION
For grouped data, we can consider the various values of the variables X and Y as coinciding with the
class marks, while fX and fY are the corresponding class frequencies, or marginal frequencies, shown in the
last row and column of the bivariate frequency table. If we let f represent the various cell frequencies
corresponding to the pairs of class marks ðX,YÞ, then we can replace the formula of Problem 14.15 with
r ¼
N P fXY  ðP fXXÞðP fYYÞ
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
½N P fXX2  ðP fXXÞ2½N P fYY2  ðP fYYÞ2
q
ð35Þ
If we let X ¼ A þ cXuX and Y ¼ B þ cYuY, where cX and cY are the class-interval widths (assumed
constant) and A and B are arbitrary class marks corresponding to the variables, formula (35) becomes
formula (21) of this chapter:

This is the coding method used in previous chapters as a short method for computing means, standard
deviations, and higher moments.
14.19 Find the coeﬃcient of linear correlation of the mathematics and physics grades of Problem 14.17.
SOLUTION
We use formula (21). The work can be arranged as in Table 14.16, which is called a correlation table.
The sums P fX, P fXuX, P fXu2
X, P fY, P fYuY, and P fYu2
Y are obtained by using the coding method,
as in earlier chapters.
The number in the corner of each cell in Table 14.16 represents the product fuXuY, where f is the cell
frequency. The sum of these corner numbers in each row is indicated in the corresponding row of the last
column. The sum of these corner numbers in each column is indicated in the corresponding column of the
last row. The ﬁnal totals of the last row and last column are equal and represent P fuXuY.
From Table 14.16 we have
r ¼

Thus the standard deviations of the mathematics and physics grades are 14.0 and 14.9, respectively, while
their covariance is 160.2. The correlation coeﬃcient r is therefore

r ¼ sXY

ð13:966Þð14:925Þ ¼ 0:7686
agreeing with Problem 14.19.
REGRESSION LINES AND THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT

(a) Y  Y ¼ ðrsY=sXÞðX  YÞ and (b) X  X ¼ ðrsX=sYÞðY  YÞ.

This follows by interchanging X and Y in part (a).
14.22 If, the regression lines of Y on X and of X on Y are given, respectively, by Y ¼ a0 þ a1X and
X ¼ b0 þ b1Y, prove that a1b1 ¼ r2.
SOLUTION
From Problem 14.21, parts (a) and (b),
a1 ¼ rsY

and
b1 ¼ rsX
sY
Thus
a1b1 ¼

This result can be taken as the starting point for a deﬁnition of the linear correlation coeﬃcient.
14.23 Use the result of Problem 14.22 to ﬁnd the linear correlation coeﬃcient for the data of
Problem 14.1.
SOLUTION
From Problem 14.1 [parts (b) and (c), respectively] a1 ¼ 484=1016 ¼ 0:476 and b1 ¼ 484=467 ¼ 1:036.
Thus Y2 ¼ a1b1 ¼ ð384=1016Þð484=467Þ and r ¼ 0:7027.
14.24 For the data of Problem 14.19, write the equations of the regression lines of (a) Y on X and

14.26 Table 14.17 shows the United States consumer price indexes for food and medical-care costs
during the years 2000 through 2006 compared with prices in the base years, 1982 to 1984
(mean taken as 100). Compute the correlation coeﬃcient between the two indexes and give the
MINITAB computation of the coeﬃcient.
SOLUTION
Denoting the index numbers for food and medical care as X and Y, respectively, the calculation of the
correlation coeﬃcient can be organized as in Table 14.18. (Note that the year is used only to specify the
corresponding values of X and Y.)
Then by the product-moment formula

After putting the X values in C1 and the Y values in C2, the MINITAB command correlation C1 C2

The normal equations (23) of Chapter 13 are

The work involved in computing the sums can be arranged as in Table 14.20. Then, since N ¼ 8, the normal
equations (36) become

ð37Þ
Solving, a0 ¼ 2:588, a1 ¼ 2:065, and a2 ¼ 0:2110; hence the required least-squares parabola has the
equation
Y ¼ 2:588 þ 2:065X  0:2110X2
The values for Y are entered into C1, the Values for X are entered into C2, and the values for X2 are entered
into C3. The MINITAB pull-down Stat ! Regression ! Regression is given. The least-squares
parabola is given as part of the output as follows.
The regression equation is Y ¼ 2.59 þ 2.06 X  0.211 Xsquared
This is the same solution as given by solving the normal equations.
14.28 Use the least-squares parabola of Problem 14.27 to estimate the values of Y from the given
values of X.

The fact that part (a) shows a linear correlation coeﬃcient of only 0.3743 indicates that there is
practically no linear relationship between X and Y. However, there is a very good nonlinear relationship

SAMPLING THEORY OF CORRELATION
14.31 A correlation coeﬃcient based on a sample of size 18 was computed to be 0.32. Can we conclude
at signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01 that the corresponding population correlation
coeﬃcient diﬀers from zero?

(a)
Using a one-tailed test of Student’s distribution at the 0.05 level, we would reject H0 if t > t:95 ¼ 1:75
for ð18  2Þ ¼ 16 degrees of freedom. Thus we cannot reject H0 at the 0.05 level.
(b)
Since we cannot reject H0 at the 0.05 level, we certainly cannot reject it at the 0.01 level.
14.32 What is the minimum sample size necessary in order that we may conclude that a correlation
coeﬃcient of 0.32 diﬀers signiﬁcantly from zero at the 0.05 level?
SOLUTION
Using a one-tailed test of Student’s distribution at the 0.05 level, the minimum value of N must be such
that

14.33 A correlation coeﬃcient on a sample of size 24 was computed to be r ¼ 0:75. At the 0.05
signiﬁcance level, can we reject the hypothesis that the population correlation coeﬃcient is as
small as (a)  ¼ 0:60 and (b)  ¼ 0:50?

Thus

Z

0:2182
¼ 1:28
Using a one-tailed test of the normal distribution at the 0.05 level, we would reject the hypothesis only if
z were greater than 1.64. Thus we cannot reject the hypothesis that the population correlation coeﬃcient
is as small as 0.60.
(b)
If  ¼ 0:50, then Z ¼ 1:1513 log 3 ¼ 0:5493 and z ¼ ð0:9730  0:5493Þ=0:2182 ¼ 1:94. Thus we
can reject the hypothesis that the population correlation coeﬃcient is as small as  ¼ 0:50 at the
0.05 level.
14.34 The correlation coeﬃcient between the ﬁnal grades in physics and mathematics for a group of
21 students was computed to be 0.80. Find the 95% conﬁdence limits for this coeﬃcient.
SOLUTION
Since r ¼ 0:80 and N ¼ 21, the 95% conﬁdence limits for Z are given by

Thus the 95% conﬁdence limits for  are 0.49 and 0.92.
14.35 Two correlation coeﬃcients obtained from samples of size N1 ¼ 28 and N3 ¼ 35 were computed
to be r1 ¼ 0:50 and r2 ¼ 0:30, respectively. Is there a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two

Using a two-tailed test of the normal distribution, we would reject H0 only if z > 1:96 or z < 1:96. Thus we
cannot reject H0, and we conclude that the results are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at the 0.05 level.

SAMPLING THEORY OF REGRESSION
14.36 In Problem 14.1 we found the regression equation of Y on X to be Y ¼ 35:82 þ 0:476X. Test the
null hypothesis at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level that the regression coeﬃcient of the population
regression equation is 0.180 versus the alternative hypothesis that the regression coeﬃcient
exceeds 0.180. Perform the test without the aid of computer software as well as with the aid of

The computed test statistic is found as follows:

¼ 1:94
The computed t value shown in the output, 3.12, is used for testing the null hypothesis that the regression
coeﬃcient is 0. To test any other value for the regression coeﬃcient requires a computation like the

one shown. To test that the regression coeﬃcient is 0.25, for example, the computed value of the test statistic
would equal
t ¼ 0:4764  0:25
0:1525
¼ 1:48
The null hypothesis that the regression coeﬃcient equals 0.25 would not be rejected.
14.37 Find the 95% conﬁdence limits for the regression coeﬃcient of Problem 14.36. Set the conﬁdence

CHAPTER 15
Multiple and Partial 
Correlation
MULTIPLE CORRELATION
The degree of relationship existing between three or more variables is called multiple correlation. The
fundamental principles involved in problems of multiple correlation are analogous to those of simple
correlation, as treated in Chapter 14.
SUBSCRIPT NOTATION
To allow for generalizations to large numbers of variables, it is convenient to adopt a notation
involving subscripts.
We
shall
let
X1, X2, X3, . . .
denote
the
variables
under
consideration.
Then
we
can
let
X11, X12, X13, . . . denote the values assumed by the variable X1, and X21, X22, X23, . . . denote the values
assumed by the variable X2, and so on. With this notation, a sum such as X21 þ X22 þ X23 þ    þ X2N
could be written PN
j¼1 X2j, P
j X2j, or simply P X2. When no ambiguity can result, we use the last
notation. In such case the mean of X2 is written X2 ¼ P X2=N.
REGRESSION EQUATIONS AND REGRESSION PLANES
A regression equation is an equation for estimating a dependent variable, say X1, from the indepen-
dent variables X2, X3, . . . and is called a regression equation of X1 on X2, X3, . . . : In functional notation
this is sometimes written brieﬂy as X1 ¼ FðX2, X3, . . .) (read ‘‘X1 is a function of X2, X3, and so on’’).
For the case of three variables, the simplest regression equation of X1 on X2 and X3 has the form
X1 ¼ b1:23 þ b12:3X2 þ b13:2X3
ð1Þ
where b1:23, b12:3, and b13:2 are constants. If we keep X3 constant in equation (1), the graph of X1 versus X2 is
a straight line with slope b12:3. If we keep X2 constant, the graph of X1 versus X3 is a straight line with
slope b13:2. It is clear that the subscripts after the dot indicate the variables held constant in each case.
Due to the fact that X1 varies partially because of variation in X2 and partially because of variation
in X3, we call b12:3 and b13:2 the partial regression coeﬃcients of X1 on X2 keeping X3 constant and of X1
on X3 keeping X2 constant, respectively.

Equation (1) is called a linear regression equation of X1 on X2 and X3. In a three-dimensional
rectangular coordinate system it represents a plane called a regression plane and is a generalization of
the regression line for two variables, as considered in Chapter 13.
NORMAL EQUATIONS FOR THE LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION PLANE
Just as there exist least-squares regression lines approximating a set of N data points ðX, YÞ in a two-
dimensional scatter diagram, so also there exist least-squares regression planes ﬁtting a set of N data
points ðX1, X2, X3Þ in a three-dimensional scatter diagram.
The least-squares regression plane of X1 on X2 and X3 has the equation (1) where b1:23, b12:3, and b13:2
are determined by solving simultaneously the normal equations
P X1
¼ b1:23N
þ b12:3
P X2

P X2X3
P X1X3 ¼ b1:23
P X3 þ b12:3
P X2X3 þ b13:2
P X2
3
ð2Þ
These can be obtained formally by multiplying both sides of equation (1) by 1, X2, and X3 successively
and summing on both sides.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, whenever we refer to a regression equation it will be assumed that the
least-squares regression equation is meant.
If x1 ¼ X1  X1, x2 ¼ X2  X2, and x3 ¼ X3  X3, the regression equation of X1 on X2 and X3 can
be written more simply as
x1 ¼ b12:3x2 þ b13:2x3
ð3Þ
where b12:3 and b13:2 are obtained by solving simultaneously the equations
P x1x2 ¼ b12:3
P x2
2
þ b13:2
P x2x3
P x1x3 ¼ b12:3
P x2x3 þ b13:2
P x2

ð4Þ
These equations which are equivalent to the normal equations (2) can be obtained formally by
multiplying both sides of equation (3) by x2 and x3 successively and summing on both sides
(see Problem 15.8).
REGRESSION PLANES AND CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS
If the linear correlation coeﬃcients between variables X1 and X2, X1 and X3, and X2 and X3, as
computed in Chapter 14, are denoted respectively by r12, r13, and r23 (sometimes called zero-order
correlation coeﬃcients), then the least-squares regression plane has the equation

where x1 ¼ X  X1, x2 ¼ X2  X2, and x3 ¼ X3  X3 and where s1, s2, and s3 are the standard deviations
of X1, X2, and X3, respectively (see Problem 15.9).
Note that if the variable X3 is nonexistent and if X1 ¼ Y and X2 ¼ X, then equation (5) reduces to
equation (25) of Chapter 14.

STANDARD ERROR OF ESTIMATE
By an obvious generalization of equation (8) of Chapter 14, we can deﬁne the standard error of
estimate of X1 on X2 and X3 by
s1:23 ¼

where X1,est indicates the estimated values of X1 as calculated from the regression equations (1) or (5).
In terms of the correlation coeﬃcients r12, r13, and r23, the standard error of estimate can also be
computed from the result
s1:23 ¼ s1

The sampling interpretation of the standard error of estimate for two variables as given on page 313
for the case when N is large can be extended to three dimensions by replacing the lines parallel to the
regression line with planes parallel to the regression plane. A better estimate of the population standard
error of estimate is given by ^s1:23 ¼

COEFFICIENT OF MULTIPLE CORRELATION
The coeﬃcient of multiple correlation is deﬁned by an extension of equation (12) or (14) of Chapter
14. In the case of two independent variables, for example, the coeﬃcient of multiple correlation is given by
R1:23 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1  s2
1:23

s
ð8Þ
where s1 is the standard deviation of the variable X1 and s1:23 is given by equation (6) or (7). The quantity
R2
1:23 is called the coeﬃcient of multiple determination.
When a linear regression equation is used, the coeﬃcient of multiple correlation is called the coeﬃ-
cient of linear multiple correlation. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, whenever we refer to multiple correlation,
we shall imply linear multiple correlation.
In terms of r12, r13, and r23, equation (8) can also be written
R1:23 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

ð9Þ
A coeﬃcient of multiple correlation, such as R1:23, lies between 0 and 1. The closer it is to 1, the
better is the linear relationship between the variables. The closer it is to 0, the worse is the linear
relationship. If the coeﬃcient of multiple correlation is 1, the correlation is called perfect. Although a
correlation coeﬃcient of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables, it is possible that a
nonlinear relationship may exist.
CHANGE OF DEPENDENT VARIABLE
The above results hold when X1 is considered the dependent variable. However, if we want to
consider X3 (for example) to be the dependent variable instead of X1, we would only have to replace

the subscripts 1 with 3, and 3 with 1, in the formulas already obtained. For example, the regressio
equation of X3 on X1 and X2 would be
x3

ð10
as obtained from equation (5), using the results r32 ¼ r23, r31 ¼ r13, and r21 ¼ r12.
GENERALIZATIONS TO MORE THAN THREE VARIABLES
These are obtained by analogy with the above results. For example, the linear regression equation
of X1 on X2, X3, and X4 can be written
X1 ¼ b1:234 þ b12:34X2 þ b13:24X3 þ b14:23X4
ð11
and represents a hyperplane in four-dimensional space. By formally multiplying both sides of equatio
(11) by 1, X2, X3, and X4 successively and then summing on both sides, we obtain the normal equation
for determining b1:234, b12:34, b13:24, and b14:23; substituting these in equation (11) then gives us the leas
squares regression equation of X1 on X2, X3, and X4. This least-squares regression equation can be writte
in a form similar to that of equation (5). (See Problem 15.41.)
PARTIAL CORRELATION
It is often important to measure the correlation between a dependent variable and one particula
independent variable when all other variables involved are kept constant; that is, when the eﬀects of a
other variables are removed (often indicated by the phrase ‘‘other things being equal’’). This can b
obtained by deﬁning a coeﬃcient of partial correlation, as in equation (12) of Chapter 14, except that w
must consider the explained and unexplained variations that arise both with and without the particula
independent variable.
If we denote by r12:3 the coeﬃcient of partial correlation between X1 and X2 keeping X3 constan
we ﬁnd that
r12:3 ¼
r12  r13r23
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ð1  r2
13Þð1  r2
23Þ
q
ð12
Similarly, if r12:34 is the coeﬃcient of partial correlation between X1 and X2 keeping X3 and X4 constan
then
r12:34 ¼
r12:4  r13:4r23:4
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

ð13
These results are useful since by means of them any partial correlation coeﬃcient can ultimately be mad
to depend on the correlation coeﬃcients r12, r23, etc. (i.e., the zero-order correlation coeﬃcients).
In the case of two variables, X and Y, if the two regression lines have equations Y ¼ a0 þ a1X an
X ¼ b0 þ b1Y, we have seen that r2 ¼ a1b1 (see Problem 14.22). This result can be generalized
For example, if
X1 ¼ b1:234 þ b12:34X2 þ b13:24X3 þ b14:23X4
ð14
and
X4 ¼ b4:123 þ b41:23X1 þ b42:13X2 þ b43:12X3
ð15

are linear regression equations of X1 on X2, X3, and X4 and of X4 on X1, X2, and X3, respectively, then
r2
14:23 ¼ b14:23b41:23
ð16Þ
(see Problem 15.18). This can be taken as the starting point for a deﬁnition of linear partial correlation
coeﬃcients.
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MULTIPLE AND PARTIAL CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS
Interesting results connecting the multiple correlation coeﬃcients can be found. For example,
we ﬁnd that
1  R2
1:23 ¼ ð1  r2
12Þð1  r2

1  R2
1:234 ¼ ð1  r2
12Þð1  r2

Generalizations of these results are easily made.
NONLINEAR MULTIPLE REGRESSION
The above results for linear multiple regression can be extended to nonlinear multiple regression.
Coeﬃcients of multiple and partial correlation can then be deﬁned by methods similar to those given
above.

The quantity r12 is the linear correlation coeﬃcient between the variables X1 and X2, ignoring the

correlations in EXCEL are shown in E1, E2, and E3.

P-Value
The correlation r12 is at the intersection of X1 and X2 and is seen to be 0.820. The value below it is
0.001. It is the p-value for testing no population correlation between X1 and X2. Because this p-value is
less than 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis of no population correlation between height (X2) and
weight (X1). All the other correlations and their p-values are read similarly.

Using the SPSS pull-down Analyze ! Correlate ! Bivariate gives the following output which is read
similar to MINITAB.

**Correlation is signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).

Work Problem 15.3(a) by using equation (5) of this chapter and the results of Problems 15.4

where x1 ¼ X1  X1, x2 ¼ X2  X2, and x3 ¼ X3  X3. Using the results of Problems 15.4 and 15.5,
equation (22) becomes

For the data of Problem 15.3, determine (a) the average increase in weight per inch of increase
in height for boys of the same age and (b) the average increase in weight per year for boys having
the same height.
SOLUTION
From the regression equation obtained in Problem 15.3(a) or 15.6 we see that the answer to (a) is
0.8546, or about 0.9 lb, and that the answer to (b) is 1.5063, or about 1.5 lb.
15.8
Show that equations (3) and (4) of this chapter follow from equations (1) and (2).
SOLUTION
From the ﬁrst of equations (2), on dividing both sides by N, we have
X1 ¼ b1:23 þ b12:3 X2 þ b13:2 X3

Subtracting equation (23) from equation (1) gives

or
x1 ¼ b12:3x2 þ b13:2x3

which is equation (3).
Let X1 ¼ x1 þ X1, X2 ¼ x2 þ X2, and X3 ¼ x3 þ X3 in the second and third of equations (2). Then after
some algebraic simpliﬁcations, using the results P x1 ¼ P x2 ¼ P x3 ¼ 0, they become

COEFFICIENT OF MULTIPLE CORRELATION

Note that the coeﬃcient of multiple correlation, R1:23, is larger than either of the coeﬃcients r12 or r13
(see Problem 15.5). This is always true and is in fact to be expected, since by taking into account additional
relevant independent variables we should arrive at a better relationship between the variables.
The following part of the MINITAB output given in the solution of Problem 15.3, R-Sq = 70.9%,
gives the square of the coeﬃcient of linear multiple correlation. The coeﬃcient of linear multiple correlation
is the square rooot of this value. That is R1:23 ¼

15.13 Compute the coeﬃcient of multiple determination of X1 on X2 and X3 for the data of Problem
15.3. Refer to the MINITAB output in the solution of Problem 15.3 to determine the coeﬃcient
of multiple determination.
SOLUTION
The coeﬃcient of multiple determination of X1 on X2 and X3 is
R2
1:23 ¼ ð0:8418Þ2 ¼ 0:7086
using Problem 15.12. Thus about 71% of the total variation in X1 is explained by using the regression
equation.
The coeﬃcient of multiple determination is read directly from the MINITAB output given in the
solution of Problem 15.3 as R-Sq = 70.9%.
15.14 For the data of Problem 15.3, calculate (a) R2:13 and (b) R3:12 and compare their values with the

Using the results of Problem 15.5, we ﬁnd that r12:3 ¼ 0:5334, r13:2 ¼ 0:3346, and r23:1 ¼ 0:4580. It follows that
for boys of the same age, the correlation coeﬃcient between weight and height is 0.53; for boys of the same
height, the correlation coeﬃcient between weight and age is only 0.33. Since these results are based on a small
sample of only 12 boys, they are of course not as reliable as those which would be obtained from a larger sample.

MULTIPLE AND PARTIAL CORRELATION INVOLVING FOUR OR MORE VARIABLES
15.20 A college entrance examination consisted of three tests: in mathematics, English, and general
knowledge. To test the ability of the examination to predict performance in a statistics course,
data concerning a sample of 200 students were gathered and analyzed. Letting
X1 ¼ grade in statistics course
X3 ¼ score on English test
X2 ¼ score on mathematics test
X4 ¼ score on general knowledge test
the following calculations were obtained:
X1 ¼ 75
s1 ¼ 10
X2 ¼ 24
s2 ¼ 5
X3 ¼ 15
s3 ¼ 3
X4 ¼ 36

r12 ¼ 0:90
r13 ¼ 0:75
r14 ¼ 0:80
r23 ¼ 0:70
r24 ¼ 0:70
r34 ¼ 0:85
Find the least-squares regression equation of X1 on X2, X3, and X4.
SOLUTION
Generalizing the result of Problem 15.8, we can write the least-squares regression equation of X1 on X2,
X3, and X4 in the form
x1 ¼ b12:34x2 þ b13:24x3 þ b14:23x4

where b12:34, b13:24, and b14:23 can be obtained from the normal equations

and where x1 ¼ X1  X1, x2 ¼ X2  X2, x3 ¼ X3  X3, and x4 ¼ X4  X4.
From the given data, we ﬁnd
P x2

P x1x4 ¼ Ns1s4r14 ¼ 9600
P x3x4 ¼ Ns3s4r34 ¼ 3060
Putting these results into equations (34) and solving, we obtain
b12:34 ¼ 1:3333
b13:24 ¼ 0:0000
b14:23 ¼ 0:5556
ð35Þ
which, when substituted in equation (33), yield the required regression equation
x1 ¼ 1:3333x2 þ 0:0000x3 þ 0:5556x4
or
X1  75 ¼ 1:3333ðX2  24Þ þ 0:5556ðX4  27Þ
ð36Þ
or
X1 ¼ 22:9999 þ 1:3333X2 þ 0:5556X4

An exact solution of equations (34) yields b12:34 ¼ 4
3, b13:24 ¼ 0, and b14:23 ¼ 5
9, so that the regression
equation can also be written
X1 ¼ 23 þ 4

9 X4
ð37Þ
It is interesting to note that the regression equation does not involve the score in English, namely, X3.
This does not mean that one’s knowledge of English has no bearing on proﬁciency in statistics. Instead, it
means that the need for English, insofar as prediction of the statistics grade is concerned, is amply evidenced
by the scores achieved on the other tests.
15.21 Two students taking the college entrance examination of Problem 15.20 receive respective scores
of (a) 30 in mathematics, 18 in English, and 32 in general knowledge; and (b) 18 in mathematics,
20 in English, and 36 in general knowledge. What would be their predicted grades in statistics?
SOLUTION
(a)
Substituting X2 ¼ 30, X3 ¼ 18, and X4 ¼ 32 in equation (37), the predicted grade in statistics is
X1 ¼ 81.
(b)
Proceeding as in part (a) with X2 ¼ 18, X3 ¼ 20, and X4 ¼ 36, we ﬁnd X1 ¼ 67.
15.22 For the data of Problem 15.20, ﬁnd the partial correlation coeﬃcients (a) r12:34, (b) r13:24, and

obtained in Problem 15.22.
SOLUTION
(a)
r12:4 ¼ 0:7935 represents the (linear) correlation coeﬃcient between statistics grades and mathematics
scores for students having the same general knowledge scores. In obtaining this coeﬃcient, scores in
English (as well as other factors that have not been taken into account) are not considered, as is
evidenced by the fact that the subscript 3 is omitted.

(b)
r13:4 ¼ 0:2215 represents the correlation coeﬃcient between statistics grades and English scores
for students having the same general knowledge scores. Here, scores in mathematics have not been
considered.
(c)
r12:34 ¼ 0:7814 represents the correlation coeﬃcient between statistics grades and mathematics scores
for students having both the same English scores and general knowledge scores.
(d)
r14:3 ¼ 0:4664 represents the correlation coeﬃcient between statistics grades and general knowledge
scores for students having the same English scores.
(e)

scores for students having both the same mathematics scores and English scores.

Explain the signiﬁcance of the equality in part (a).
SOLUTION
(a)
The left-hand side of equation (38) is evaluated in Problem 15.22(a) yielding the result 0.7814. To
evaluate the right-hand side of equation (38), use the results of Problem 15.22(c); again, the result is
0.7814. Thus the equality holds in this special case. It can be shown by direct algebraic processes that
the equality holds in general.
(b)
The left-hand side of equation (38) is r12:34, and the right-hand side is r12:43. Since r12:34 is the correlation
between variables X1 and X2 keeping X3 and X4 constant, while r12:43 is the correlation between X1 and
X2 keeping X4 and X3 constant, it is at once evident why the equality should hold.

CHAPTER 16
Analysis of Variance
THE PURPOSE OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE
In Chapter 8 we used sampling theory to test the signiﬁcance of diﬀerences between two sampling
means. We assumed that the two populations from which the samples were drawn had the same variance.
In many situations there is a need to test the signiﬁcance of diﬀerences between three or more sampling
means or, equivalently, to test the null hypothesis that the sample means are all equal.
EXAMPLE 1.
Suppose that in an agricultural experiment four diﬀerent chemical treatments of soil produced mean
wheat yields of 28, 22, 18, and 24 bushels per acre, respectively. Is there a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in these means, or is
the observed spread due simply to chance?
Problems such as this can be solved by using an important technique known as analysis of variance, developed
by Fisher. It makes use of the F distribution already considered in Chapter 11.
ONE-WAY CLASSIFICATION, OR ONE-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS
In a one-factor experiment, measurements (or observations) are obtained for a independent groups of
samples, where the number of measurements in each group is b. We speak of a treatments, each of which
has b repetitions, or b replications. In Example 1, a ¼ 4.
The results of a one-factor experiment can be presented in a table having a rows and b columns, as
shown in Table 16.1. Here Xjk denotes the measurement in the jth row and kth column, where
j ¼ 1, 2, . . . , a and where k ¼ 1, 2, . . . , b. For example, X35 refers to the ﬁfth measurement for the third
treatment.
We shall denote by Xj: the mean of the measurements in the jth row. We have
Xj: ¼ 1
b

Xjk
j ¼ 1, 2, . . . , a

The dot in Xj: is used to show that the index k has been summed out. The values Xj: are called group
means, treatment means, or row means. The grand mean, or overall mean, is the mean of all the measure-
ments in all the groups and is denoted by X:
X ¼ 1

ð2Þ
TOTAL VARIATION, VARIATION WITHIN TREATMENTS, AND VARIATION
BETWEEN TREATMENTS
We deﬁne the total variation, denoted by V, as the sum of the squares of the deviations of each
measurement from the grand mean X
Total variation ¼ V ¼
X
j;k
ðXjk  XÞ2
ð3Þ
By writing the identity
Xjk  X ¼ ðXjk  Xj:Þ þ ð Xj:  XÞ
ð4Þ
and then squaring and summing over j and k, we have (see Problem 16.1)
X
j;k
ðXjk  XÞ2 ¼
X
j;k
ðXjk  Xj:Þ2 þ
X
j;k
ð Xj:  XÞ2
ð5Þ
or
X
j;k
ðXjk  XÞ2 ¼
X
j;k
ðXjk  Xj:Þ2 þ b
X
j
ð Xj:  XÞ2
ð6Þ
We call the ﬁrst summation on the right-hand side of equations (5) and (6) the variation within treatments
(since it involves the squares of the deviations of Xjk from the treatment means Xj:) and denote it by VW.
Thus
VW ¼
X
j;k
ðXjk  Xj:Þ2
ð7Þ
The second summation on the right-hand side of equations (5) and (6) is called the variation between
treatments (since it involves the squares of the deviations of the various treatment means Xj: from the
grand mean X) and is denoted by VB. Thus
VB ¼
X
j;k
ð Xj:  XÞ2 ¼ b
X
j
ð Xj  XÞ2
ð8Þ
Equations (5) and (6) can thus be written
V ¼ VW þ VB
ð9Þ
SHORTCUT METHODS FOR OBTAINING VARIATIONS
To minimize the labor of computing the above variations, the following forms are convenient:
V ¼
X
j;k
X2
jk  T2
ab
ð10Þ
VB ¼ 1
b
X
j
T2
j:  T2
ab
ð11Þ
VW ¼ V  VB
ð12Þ

where T is the total of all values Xjk and where Tj: is the total of all values in the jth treatment:
T ¼
X
j;k
Xjk
Tj: ¼
X
k
Xjk
ð13Þ
In practice, it is convenient to subtract some ﬁxed value from all the data in the table in order to simplify
the calculation; this has no eﬀect on the ﬁnal results.
MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE
We can consider each row of Table 16.1 to be a random sample of size b from the population for that
particular treatment. The Xjk will diﬀer from the population mean j for the jth treatment by a chance
error, or random error, which we denote by "jk; thus
Xjk ¼ j þ "jk
ð14Þ
These errors are assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 2. If  is the mean of
the population for all treatments and if we let j ¼ j  , so that j ¼  þ j, then equation (14)
becomes
Xjk ¼  þ j þ "jk
ð15Þ
where P
j j ¼ 0 (see Problem 16.9). From equation (15) and the assumption that the "jk are normally
distributed with mean 0 and variance 2, we conclude that the Xjk can be considered random variables
that are normally distributed with mean  and variance 2.
The null hypothesis that all treatment means are equal is given by ðH0 : j ¼ 0; j ¼ 1, 2, . . . , aÞ or,
equivalently, by ðH0 : j ¼ ; j ¼ 1, 2, . . . , aÞ. If H0 is true, the treatment populations will all have the
same normal distribution (i.e., with the same mean and variance). In such cases there is just one treat-
ment population (i.e., all treatments are statistically identical); in other words, there is no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the treatments.
EXPECTED VALUES OF THE VARIATIONS
It can be shown (see Problem 16.10) that the expected values of VW, VB, and V are given by
EðVWÞ ¼ aðb  1Þ2
ð16Þ
EðVBÞ ¼ ða  1Þ2 þ b
X
j
2
j
ð17Þ
EðVÞ ¼ ðab  1Þ2 þ b

j
2

ð18Þ
From equation (16) it follows that
E
VW
aðb  1Þ


¼ 2
ð19Þ
so that
^S2
W ¼
VW
aðb  1Þ
ð20Þ
is always a best (unbiased) estimate of 2 regardless of whether H0 is true. On the other hand, we see
from equations (16) and (18) that only if H0 is true (i.e., j ¼ 0Þ will we have
E
VB
a  1


¼ 2
and
E
V
ab  1

ð21Þ

so that only in such case will
^S2
B ¼ VB

and
^S2 ¼
V
ab  1
ð22Þ
provide unbiased estimates of 2. If H0 is not true, however, then from equation (16) we have
Eð ^S2
BÞ ¼ 2 þ

ð23Þ
DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE VARIATIONS
Using the additive property of chi-square, we can prove the following fundamental theorems
concerning the distributions of the variations VW, VB, and V:
Theorem 1:
VW=2 is chi-square distributed with aðb  1Þ degrees of freedom.
Theorem 2:
Under the null hypothesis H0, VB=2 and V=2 are chi-square distributed
with a  1 and ab  1 degrees of freedom, respectively.
It is important to emphasize that Theorem 1 is valid whether or not H0 is assumed, whereas Theorem 2 is
valid only if H0 is assumed.
THE F TEST FOR THE NULL HYPOTHESIS OF EQUAL MEANS
If the null hypothesis H0 is not true (i.e., if the treatment means are not equal), we see from equation
(23) that we can expect ^S2
B to be greater than 2, with the eﬀect becoming more pronounced as the
discrepancy between the means increases. On the other hand, from equations (19) and (20) we can expect
^S2
W to be equal to 2 regardless of whether the means are equal. It follows that a good statistic for testing
hypothesis H0 is provided by ^S2
B= ^S2
W. If this statistic is signiﬁcantly large, we can conclude that there is a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the treatment means and can thus reject H0; otherwise, we can either
accept H0 or reserve judgment, pending further analysis.
In order to use the ^S2
B= ^S2
W statistic, we must know its sampling distribution. This is provided by
Theorem 3.
Theorem 3:
The statistic F ¼ ^S2
B= ^S2
W has the F distribution with a  1 and aðb  1Þ
degrees of freedom.
Theorem 3 enables us to test the null hypothesis at some speciﬁed signiﬁcance level by using a one-tailed
test of the F distribution (discussed in Chapter 11).
ANALYSIS-OF-VARIANCE TABLES
The calculations required for the above test are summarized in Table 16.2, which is called an
analysis-of-variance table. In practice, we would compute V and VB by using either the long method
[equations (3) and (8)] or the short method [equations (10) and (11)] and then by computing
VW ¼ V  VB. It should be noted that the degrees of freedom for the total variation (i.e., ab  1Þ
are equal to the sum of the degrees of freedom for the between-treatments and within-treatments
variations.

MODIFICATIONS FOR UNEQUAL NUMBERS OF OBSERVATIONS
In case the treatments 1, . . . , a have diﬀerent numbers of observations—equal to N1, . . . , Na,
respectively—the above results are easily modiﬁed, Thus we obtain
V ¼

ðXjk  XÞ2 ¼

VW ¼ V  VB
ð26Þ
where P
j;k denotes the summation over k from 1 to Nj and then the summation over j from 1 to a.
Table 16.3 is the analysis-of-variance table for this case.
TWO-WAY CLASSIFICATION, OR TWO-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS
The ideas of analysis of variance for one-way classiﬁcation, or one-factor experiments, can be
generalized. Example 2 illustrates the procedure for two-way classiﬁcation, or two-factor experiments.

EXAMPLE 2.
Suppose that an agricultural experiment consists of examining the yields per acre of 4 diﬀerent
varieties of wheat, where each variety is grown on 5 diﬀerent plots of land. Thus a total of ð4Þð5Þ ¼ 20 plots are
needed. It is convenient in such case to combine the plots into blocks, say 4 plots to a block, with a diﬀerent variety
of wheat grown on each plot within a block. Thus 5 blocks would be required here.
In this case there are two classiﬁcations, or factors, since there may be diﬀerences in yield per acre due to (1) the
particular type of wheat grown or (2) the particular block used (which may involve diﬀerent soil fertility, etc.).
By analogy with the agricultural experiment of Example 2, we often refer to the two factors in
an experiment as treatments and blocks, but of course we could simply refer to them as factor 1 and
factor 2.
NOTATION FOR TWO-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS
Assuming that we have a treatments and b blocks, we construct Table 16.4, where it is supposed that
there is one experimental value (such as yield per acre) corresponding to each treatment and block. For
treatment j and block k, we denote this value by Xjk. The mean of the entries in the jth row is denoted by
Xj:, where j ¼ 1, . . . , a, while the mean of the entries in the kth column is denoted by X:k, where
k ¼ 1, . . . , b. The overall, or grand, mean is denoted by X. In symbols,

VARIATIONS FOR TWO-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS
As in the case of one-factor experiments, we can deﬁne variations for two-factor experiments.
We ﬁrst deﬁne the total variation, as in equation (3), to be
V ¼
X
j;k
ðXjk  XÞ2
ð28Þ
By writing the identity
Xjk  X ¼ ðXjk  Xj:  X:k þ XÞ þ ð Xj:  XÞ þ ð X:k  XÞ
ð29Þ
and then squaring and summing over j and k, we can show that
V ¼ VE þ VR þ VC

where Tj: is the total of entries in the jth row, T:k is the total of entries in the kth column, and T is the
total of all entries.
ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR TWO-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS
The generalization of the mathematical model for one-factor experiments given by equation (15)
leads us to assume for two-factor experiments that
Xjk ¼  þ j þ k þ "jk
ð35Þ
where P j ¼ 0 and P k ¼ 0. Here  is the population grand mean, j is that part of Xjk due to the
diﬀerent treatments (sometimes called the treatment eﬀects), k is that part of Xjk due to the diﬀerent
blocks (sometimes called the block eﬀects), and "jk is that part of Xjk due to chance or error. As before,
we assume that the "jk are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 2, so that the Xjk are also
normally distributed with mean , and variance 2.
Corresponding to results (16), (17), and (18), we can prove that the expectations of the variations are
given by
EðVEÞ ¼ ða  1Þðb  1Þ2

There are two null hypotheses that we would want to test:
Hð1Þ
0 : All treatment (row) means are equal; that is, j ¼ 0, and j ¼ 1, . . . , a.
Hð2Þ
0 : All block (column) means are equal; that is, k ¼ 0, and k ¼ 1, . . . , b.

We see from equation (38) that, without regard to Hð1Þ
0
or Hð2Þ
0 , a best (unbiased) estimate of 2 is
provided by
^S2
E ¼
VE
ða  1Þðb  1Þ
that is;
Eð ^S2
EÞ ¼ 2
ð40Þ
Also, if hypotheses Hð1Þ

and Hð2Þ

are true, then
^S2
R ¼ VR

^S2
C ¼ VC
b  1

ð41Þ
will be unbiased estimates of 2. If Hð1Þ

and Hð2Þ

are not true, however, then from equations (36) and
(37), respectively, we have

The following theorems are similar to Theorems 1 and 2:
Theorem 4:
VE=2 is chi-square distributed with ða  1Þðb  1Þ degrees of freedom,
without regard to Hð1Þ
0
or Hð2Þ
0 .
Theorem 5:
Under hypothesis Hð1Þ
0 , VR=2 is chi-square distributed with a  1
degrees of freedom. Under hypothesis Hð2Þ
0 , VC=2 is chi-square distributed with
b  1 degrees of freedom. Under both hypotheses, Hð1Þ
0
and Hð2Þ
0 , V=2 is chi-square
distributed with ab  1 degrees of freedom.
To test hypothesis Hð1Þ
0 , it is natural to consider the statistic ^S2
R= ^S2
E since we can see from equation
(42) that ^S2
R is expected to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from 2 if the row (treatment) means are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent. Similarly, to test hypothesis Hð2Þ
0 , we consider the statistic ^S2
C= ^S2
E. The distributions of ^S2
R= ^S2
E
and ^S2
C= ^S2
E are given in Theorem 6, which is analogous to Theorem 3.
Theorem 6:
Under hypothesis Hð1Þ
0 , the statistic ^S2
R= ^S2
E has the F distribution with
a  1 and ða  1Þðb  1Þ degrees of freedom. Under hypothesis Hð2Þ
0 , the statistic
^S2
C= ^S2
E has the F distribution with b  1 and ða  1Þðb  1Þ degrees of freedom.
Theorem 6 enables us to accept or reject Hð1Þ
0
or Hð2Þ
0
at speciﬁed signiﬁcance levels. For convenience, as
in the one-factor case, an analysis-of-variance table can be constructed as shown in Table 16.5.
TWO-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS WITH REPLICATION
In Table 16.4 there is only one entry corresponding to a given treatment and a given block. More
information regarding the factors can often be obtained by repeating the experiment, a process called
replication. In such case there will be more than one entry corresponding to a given treatment and a given
block. We shall suppose that there are c entries for every position; appropriate changes can be made
when the replication numbers are not all equal.
Because of replication, an appropriate model must be used to replace that given by equation (35).
We use
Xjkl ¼  þ j þ k þ jk þ "jkl
ð44Þ
where the subscripts j, k, and l of Xjkl correspond to the jth row (or treatment), the kth column (or
block), and the lth repetition (or replication), respectively. In equation (44) the , j, and k are deﬁned

as before; "jkl is a chance or error term, while the jk denote the row-column (or treatment-block)
interaction eﬀects, often simply called interactions. We have the restrictions
X
j
j ¼ 0
X
k
k ¼ 0
X
j
jk ¼ 0
X
k
jk ¼ 0
ð45Þ
and the Xjkl are assumed to be normally distributed with mean  and variance 2.
As before, the total variation V of all the data can be broken up into variations due to rows VR,
columns VC, interaction VI, and random or residual error VE:
V ¼ VR þ VC þ VI þ VE
ð46Þ
where
V ¼

Table 16.6. The F ratios in the last column of Table 16.6 can be used to test the null hypotheses:
Hð1Þ
0 : All treatment (row) means are equal; that is, j ¼ 0.
Hð2Þ
0 : All block (column) means are equal; that is, k ¼ 0.
Hð3Þ
0 : There are no interactions between treatments and blocks; that is, jk ¼ 0.
From a practical point of view we should ﬁrst decide whether or not Hð3Þ
0
can be rejected at an
appropriate level of signiﬁcance by using the F ratio ^S2
I = ^S2
E of Table 16.6. Two possible cases then arise:
1.
Hð3Þ
0
Cannot Be Rejected. In this case we can conclude that the interactions are not too large. We can
then test Hð1Þ
0
and Hð2Þ
0
by using the F ratios ^S2
R= ^S2
E and ^S2
C= ^S2
E, respectively, as shown in Table 16.6.
Some statisticians recommend pooling the variations in this case by taking the total of VI þ VE and
dividing it by the total corresponding degrees of freedom ða  1Þðb  1Þ þ abðc  1Þ and using this
value to replace the denominator ^S2
E in the F test.
2.
Hð3Þ
0
Can Be Rejected. In this case we can conclude that the interactions are signiﬁcantly large.
Diﬀerences in factors would then be of importance only if they were large compared with such inter-
actions. For this reason, many statisticians recommend that Hð1Þ
0
and Hð2Þ

I rather than those given in Table 16.6. We, too, shall use this alternative procedure.
The analysis of variance with replication is most easily performed by ﬁrst totaling the replication
values that correspond to particular treatments (rows) and blocks (columns). This produces a two-factor
table with single entries, which can be analyzed as in Table 16.5. This procedure is illustrated in
Problem 16.16.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The techniques of analysis of variance discussed above are employed after the results of an experi-
ment have been obtained. However, in order to gain as much information as possible, the design of an

experiment must be planned carefully in advance; this is often referred to as the design of the experiment.
The following are some important examples of experimental design:
1.
Complete Randomization. Suppose that we have an agricultural experiment as in Example 1. To
design such an experiment, we could divide the land into 4  4 ¼ 16 plots (indicated in Fig. 16-1 by
squares, although physically any shape can be used) and assign each treatment (indicated by A, B, C,
and D) to four blocks chosen completely at random. The purpose of the randomization is to
eliminate various sources of error, such as soil fertility.
2.
Randomized Blocks. When, as in Example 2, it is necessary to have a complete set of treatments for
each block, the treatments A, B, C, and D are introduced in random order within each block: I, II,
III, and IV (i.e., the rows in Fig. 16-2), and for this reason the blocks are referred to as randomized
blocks. This type of design is used when it is desired to control one source of error or variability:
namely, the diﬀerence in blocks.
3.
Latin Squares. For some purposes it is necessary to control two sources of error or variability at the
same time, such as the diﬀerence in rows and the diﬀerence in columns. In the experiment of
Example 1, for instance, errors in diﬀerent rows and columns could be due to changes in soil fertility
in diﬀerent parts of the land. In such case it is desirable that each treatment occur once in each row
and once in each column, as in Fig. 16-3. The arrangement is called a Latin square from the fact that
the Latin letters A, B, C, and D are used.
4.
Graeco-Latin Squares. If it is necessary to control three sources of error or variability, a Graeco-Latin
square is used, as shown in Fig. 16-4. Such a square is essentially two Latin squares superimposed on
each other, with the Latin letters A, B, C, and D used for one square and the Greek letters , , ,
and  used for the other square. The additional requirement that must be met is that each Latin letter
must be used once and only once with each Greek letter; when this requirement is met, the square is
said to be orthogonal.

Table 16.7 shows the yields in bushels per acre of a certain variety of wheat grown in a particular
type of soil treated with chemicals A, B, or C. Find (a) the mean yields for the diﬀerent treat-
ments, (b) the grand mean for all treatments, (c) the total variation, (d) the variation between
treatments, and (e) the variation within treatments. Use the long method. ( f ) Give the EXCEL
analysis for the data shown in Table 16.7.
SOLUTION
To simplify the arithmetic, we may subtract some suitable number, say 45, from all the data without
aﬀecting the values of the variations. We then obtain the data of Table 16.8.
(a)
The treatment (row) means for Table 16.8 are given, respectively, by
X1: ¼ 1
4 ð3 þ 4 þ 5 þ 4Þ ¼ 4
X2: ¼ 1
4 ð2 þ 4 þ 3 þ 3Þ ¼ 3
X3: ¼ 1
4 ð4 þ 6 þ 5 þ 5Þ ¼ 5
Thus the mean yields, obtained by adding 45 to these, are 49, 48, and 50 bushels per acre for A, B, and
C, respectively.
(b)
The grand mean for all treatments is
X ¼ 1
12 ð3 þ 4 þ 5 þ 4 þ 2 þ 4 þ 3 þ 3 þ 4 þ 6 þ 5 þ 5Þ ¼ 4
Thus the grand mean for the original set of data is 45 þ 4 ¼ 49 bushels per acre.

(a)
Referring to Appendix V, with 1 ¼ 2 and 2 ¼ 9, we see that F:95 ¼ 4:26. Since F ¼ 6 > F:95, we can
reject the null hypothesis of equal means at the 0.05 level.
(b)
Referring to Appendix VI, with 1 ¼ 2 and 2 ¼ 9, we see that F:99 ¼ 8:02. Since F ¼ 6 < F:99, we
cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal means at the 0.01 level.
(c)
By referring to the MINITAB output found in Problem 16.4, we ﬁnd that the computed value of F is
6.00 and the p-value is equal to 0.022. Thus the smallest pre-set level of signiﬁcance at which the null
hypothesis would be rejected is 0.022. Therefore, the null hypothesis would be rejected at 0.05, but not
at 0.01.
16.7
Use the shortcut formulas (10), (11), and (12) to obtain the results of Problem 16.4. In addition,
use MINITAB on the data, from which 45 has been subtracted from each value, to obtain the
analysis-of-variance-table.

Error in the MINITAB output. The variation between treatments is called Between Groups in the

A company wishes to purchase one of ﬁve diﬀerent machines: A, B, C, D, or E. In an experiment
designed to test whether there is a diﬀerence in the machines’ performance, each of ﬁve experi-
enced operators works on each of the machines for equal times. Table 16.11 shows the numbers of
units produced per machine. Test the hypothesis that there is no diﬀerence between the machines
at signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01. (c) Give the STATISTIX solution to the problem and
test the hypothesis that there is no diﬀerence between the machines using the p-value approach.

the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level and therefore certainly cannot reject it at the 0.01 level.

The data can be summarized as in Table 16.16, the analysis-of-variance table. Now for 2 and 9 degrees
of freedom, we ﬁnd from Appendix V that F:95 ¼ 4:26 and from Appendix VI that F:99 ¼ 8:02. Thus we can
reject the hypothesis of equal means (i.e., no diﬀerence between the three types of tubes) at the 0.05 level but
not at the 0.01 level.

In addition, give the SAS solution to the problem.

Note that SAS calls the variation between treatments model and variation within treatments it calls
error. The test statistic is called F value and equals 4.50. The p-value is represented Pr > F and this
equals 0.0442. At  ¼ 0:05 the lifetimes would be declared unequal.
TWO-WAY CLASSIFICATION, OR TWO-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS
16.11 Table 16.17 shows the yields per acre of four diﬀerent plant crops grown on lots treated with three
diﬀerent types of fertilizer. Using the long method, determine at the 0.01 signiﬁcance level
whether there is a diﬀerence in yield per acre (a) due to the fertilizers and (b) due to the crops.
(c) Give the MINITAB solution to this two-factor experiment.
SOLUTION
Compute the row totals, the row means, the column totals, the column means, the grand total, and the
grand mean, as shown in Table 16.18. From this table we obtain:
The variation of row means from the grand mean is
VR ¼ 4½ð6:2  6:8Þ2 þ ð8:3  6:8Þ2 þ ð5:9  6:8Þ2 ¼ 13:68
The variation of column means from the grand mean is

The random variation is
VE ¼ V  VR  VC ¼ 6:58
This leads to the analysis of variance in Table 16.19.
At the 0.05 signiﬁcance level with 2 and 6 degrees of freedom, F:95 ¼ 5:14. Then, since 6:24 > 5:14, we
can reject the hypothesis that the row means are equal and conclude that at the 0.05 level there is a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in yield due to the fertilizers.
Since the F value corresponding to the diﬀerences in column means is less than 1, we can conclude that
there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in yield due to the crops.

The data structure in the worksheet must correspond exactly to the data as given in Table 16.17. The
ﬁrst row, 1 1 4.5, corresponds to Crop 1, Fertilizer 1, and Yield 4.5, the second row, 1 2 8.8, corresponds
to Crop 1, Fertilizer 2, and Yield 8.8, etc. A mistake that is often made in using statistical software is to set
up the data structure in the worksheet incorrectly. Make certain that the data given in a table like Table
16.17 and the data structure in the worksheet correspond in a one-to-one manner. Note that the two-way
analysis of variance table given in the MINITAB output contains the same information given in Table 16.19.
The p-values given in the MINITAB output allow the researcher to test the hypothesis of interest without
consulting tables of the F distribution to ﬁnd critical values. The p-value for crops is 0.512. This is the
minimum level of signiﬁcance for which we could reject a diﬀerence in mean yield for crops. The mean yields
for the four crops are not statistically signiﬁcant at 0.05 or 0.01. The p-value for fertilizers is 0.034. This tells
us that the mean yields for the three fertilizers are statistically diﬀerent at 0.05 but not statistically diﬀerent
at 0.01.
The conﬁdence intervals for the means of the four crops shown in the MINITAB output reinforce
our conclusion of no diﬀerence in mean yields for the four diﬀerent crops. The conﬁdence intervals for
the three fertilizers indicates that it is likely that Fertilizer B produces higher mean yields than either
Fertilizer A or C.

Tests of Between-Subjects Effects
Note that the test statistic is given by F and for crops the F value is 0.857 with the corresponding
p-value of 0.512. The F value for fertilizer is 6.237 with the corresponding p-value of 0.034. These values
correspond with the values in Table 16.19 as well as the MINITAB output in Problem 16.11.
TWO-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS WITH REPLICATION
16.13 A manufacturer wishes to determine the eﬀectiveness of four types of machines (A, B, C, and D)
in the production of bolts. To accomplish this, the numbers of defective bolts produced by each
machine in the days of a given week are obtained for each of two shifts; the results are shown in
Table 16.20. Perform an analysis of variance to determine at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level whether

this is a diﬀerence (a) between the machines and (b) between the shifts. (c) Use MINITAB to
perform the analysis of variance and test for diﬀerences between machines and diﬀerences
between shifts using the p-value approach.
SOLUTION
The data can be equivalently organized as in Table 16.21. In this table the two main factors are
indicated: the machine and the shift. Note that two shifts have been indicated for each machine. The
days of the week can be considered to be replicates (or repetitions) of performance for each machine for
the two shifts. The total variation for all the data of Table 16.21 is
V ¼ 62 þ 42 þ 52 þ    þ 72 þ 102  ð268Þ2
40
¼ 1946  1795:6 ¼ 150:4
In order to consider the two main factors (the machine and the shift), we limit our attention to the total
of replication values corresponding to each combination of factors. These are arranged in Table 16.22, which
is thus a two-factor table with single entries. The total variation for Table 16.22, which we shall call the
subtotal variation VS, is given by

If we now subtract from the subtotal variation VS the sum of the variations between the rows and columns
ðVR þ VCÞ, we obtain the variation due to the interaction between the rows and columns. This is given by
VI ¼ VS  VR  VC ¼ 65:6  51:0  8:1 ¼ 6:5
Finally, the residual variation, which we can think of as the random or error variation VE (provided that we
believe that the various days of the week do not provide any important diﬀerences), is found by subtracting
the subtotal variation (i.e., the sum of the row, column, and interaction variations) from the total variation
V. This yields
VE ¼ V  ðVR þ VC þ VIÞ ¼ V  VS ¼ 150:4  65:6 ¼ 84:8
These variations are shown in Table 16.23, the analysis of variance. The table also gives the number of
degrees of freedom corresponding to each type of variation. Thus, since there are four rows in Table 16.22,

the variation due to rows has 4  1 ¼ 3 degrees of freedom, while the variation due to the two columns has
2  1 ¼ 1 degree of freedom. To ﬁnd the degrees of freedom due to interaction, we note that there are eight
entries in Table 16.22; thus the total degrees of freedom are 8  1 ¼ 7. Since 3 of these 7 degrees of freedom
are due to rows and 1 is due to columns, the remainder ½7  ð3 þ 1Þ ¼ 3 are due to interaction. Since there
are 40 entries in the original Table 16.21, the total degrees of freedom are 40  1 ¼ 39. Thus the degrees of
freedom due to random or residual variation are 39  7 ¼ 32.
First, we must determine whether there is any signiﬁcant interaction. The interpolated critical value for
the F distribution with 3 and 32 degrees of freedom is 2.90. The computed F value for interaction is 0.817
and is not signiﬁcant. There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between machines, since the computed F value for
machines is 6.42 and the critical value is 2.90. The critical value for shifts is 4.15. The computed value of F
for shifts is 3.06. There is no diﬀerence in defects due to shifts.
The data structure for MINITAB is shown below. Compare the data structure with the data given in

The command MTB > Twoway ‘Defects’ ‘Machine’ ‘Shifts’ is used to produce the two-way
analysis of variance. The p-value for interaction is 0.494. This is the minimum level of signiﬁcance for which
the null hypothesis would be rejected. Clearly, there is not a signiﬁcant amount of interaction between shifts
and machines. The p-value for shifts is 0.090. Since this exceeds 0.050, the mean number of defects for the

two shifts is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The p-value for machines is 0.002. The mean numbers of defects for
the four machines are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at the 0.050 level of signiﬁcance.

Figure 16-7 gives the interaction plot for shifts and machines. The plot indicates possible interaction
between shifts and machines. However, the p-value for interaction in the analysis of variance table tells us
that there is not a signiﬁcant amount of interaction. When interaction is not present, the broken line graphs
for shift 1 and shift 2 are parallel. The main eﬀects plot shown in Fig. 16-8 indicates that machine 1 produced
the fewest defects on the average in this experiment and that machine 2 produced the most. There were more
defects produced on shift 2 than shift 1. However, the analysis of variance tells us that this diﬀerence is not
statistically signiﬁcant.

Set the data up in the EXCEL worksheet as shown. The pull-down Tools ! Data analysis ! Anova:
Two-Factor with Replication gives the dialog box in Fig. 16-9 which is ﬁlled out as shown.

In the ANOVA, identify sample with shift and machine with column. Compare this output with the
MINITAB output of Problem 16.13.
LATIN SQUARES
16.15 A farmer wishes to test the eﬀects of four diﬀerent fertilizers (A, B, C, and D) on the yield of
wheat. In order to eliminate sources of error due to variability in soil fertility, he uses the
fertilizers in a Latin-square arrangement, as shown in Table 16.24, where the numbers indicate
yields in bushels per unit area. Perform an analysis of variance to determine whether there is a
diﬀerence between the fertilizers at signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01. (c) Give the
MINITAB solution to this Latin-square design. (d ) Give the STATISTIX solution to this
Latin-square design.
SOLUTION
We ﬁrst obtain totals for the rows and columns, as shown in Table 16.25. We also obtain total yields for
each of the fertilizers, as shown in Table 16.26. The total variation and the variations for the rows, columns,
and treatments are then obtained as usual. We ﬁnd:
The total variation is

Table 16.27 shows the analysis of variance.
(a)
Since F:95;3;6 ¼ 4:76, we can reject at the 0.05 level the hypothesis that there are equal row means. It
follows that at the 0.05 level there is a diﬀerence in the fertility of the soil from one row to another.
Since the F value for columns is less than 1, we conclude that there is no diﬀerence in soil fertility in
the columns.
Since the F value for treatments is 47:9 > 4:76, we can conclude that there is a diﬀerence between
fertilizers.
(b)
Since F:99;3;6 ¼ 9:78, we can accept the hypothesis that there is no diﬀerence in soil fertility in the rows
(or the columns) at the 0.01 level. However, we must still conclude that there is a diﬀerence between
fertilizers at the 0.01 level.

fertility from row to row at the 0.05 level but not at the 0.01 level. There is no diﬀerence in fertility from
column to column. There is a diﬀerence in the four fertilizers at the 0.01 level.

GRAECO-LATIN SQUARES
16.16 It is of interest to determine whether there is any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mileage per gallon
between gasolines A, B, C, and D. Design an experiment that uses four diﬀerent drivers,
four diﬀerent cars, and four diﬀerent roads.
SOLUTION
Since the same number of gasolines, drivers, cars, and roads is involved (four), we can use a Graeco-
Latin square. Suppose that the diﬀerent cars are represented by the rows and that the diﬀerent drivers are
represented by the columns, as shown in Table 16.28. We now assign the diﬀerent gasolines (A, B, C, and D)
to the rows and columns at random, subject only to the requirement that each letter appears just once
in each row and just once in each column. Thus each driver will have an opportunity to drive each car and to
use each type of gasoline, and no car will be driven twice with the same gasoline.
We now assign at random the four roads to be used, denoted by , , , and , subjecting them to the
same requirement imposed on the Latin squares. Thus each driver will also have the opportunity to drive
along each of the roads. Table 16.28 shows one possible arrangement.
16.17 Suppose that in carrying out the experiment of Problem 16.16 the numbers of miles per gallon are
as given in Table 16.29. Use analysis of variance to determine whether there are any diﬀerences at
the 0.05 signiﬁcance level. Use MINITAB to obtain the analysis of variance and use the p-values
provided by MINITAB to test for any diﬀerences at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level.

SOLUTION
We ﬁrst obtain the row and column totals, as shown in Table 16.30. We then obtain the totals for each
Latin letter and for each Greek letter, as follows:
A total:
15 þ 16 þ 15 þ 16 ¼ 62
B total:
19 þ 18 þ 21 þ 23 ¼ 81
C total:
16 þ 11 þ 11 þ 14 ¼ 52

The column labeled Seq MS in the MINITAB output is the same as the Mean Square column in
Table 16.31. The computed F values in the MINITAB output are the same as those given in Table 16.31.
The p-values for cars, drivers, gasoline brands, and roads are 0.214, 0.475, 0.019, and 0.429, respectively.
Recall that a p-value is the minimum value for a pre-set level of signiﬁcance at which the hypothesis of
equal means for a given factor can be rejected. The p-values indicate no diﬀerences for cars, drivers, or
roads at the 0.01 or 0.05 levels. The means for gasoline brands are statistically diﬀerent at the 0.05 level
but not at the 0.01 level. Further investigation of the means for the brands would indicate how the
means diﬀer.

Supplementary Problems
ONE-WAY CLASSIFICATION, OR ONE-FACTOR EXPERIMENTS
In all of the supplementary problems, the reader is encouraged to work the problems ‘‘by hand’’
using the equations given in the chapter before using the suggested software to work the problem. This
will increase your understanding of the ANOVA technique as well as help you appreciate the power
of the software.
16.21
An experiment is performed to determine the yields of ﬁve diﬀerent varieties of wheat: A, B, C, D, and E.
Four plots of land are assigned to each variety, and the yields (in bushels per acre) are as shown in Table 16.32.
Assuming that the plots are of similar fertility and that the varieties are assigned to the plots at random,
determine whether there is a diﬀerence between the yields at signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01. (c) Give
the MINITAB analysis for this one-way classiﬁcation or one-factor experiment.
16.22
A company wishes to test four diﬀerent types of tires: A, B, C, and D. The tires’ lifetimes, as determined from
their treads, are given (in thousands of miles) in Table 16.33, where each type has been tried on six similar
automobiles assigned at random to the tires. Determine whether there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
tires at the (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01 levels. (c) Give the STATISTIX analysis for this one-way classiﬁcation or
one-factor experiment.
16.23
A teacher wishes to test three diﬀerent teaching methods: I, II, and III. To do this, three groups of ﬁve

CHAPTER 17
Nonparametric Tests
INTRODUCTION
Most tests of hypotheses and signiﬁcance (or decision rules) considered in previous chapters require
various assumptions about the distribution of the population from which the samples are drawn. For
example, the one-way classiﬁcation of Chapter 16 requires that the populations be normally distributed
and have equal standard deviations.
Situations arise in practice in which such assumptions may not be justiﬁed or in which there is doubt
that they apply, as in the case where a population may be highly skewed. Because of this, statisticians
have devised various tests and methods that are independent of population distributions and associated
parameters. These are called nonparametric tests.
Nonparametric tests can be used as shortcut replacements for more complicated tests. They are
especially valuable in dealing with nonnumerical data, such as arise when consumers rank cereals or
other products in order of preference.
THE SIGN TEST
Consider Table 17.1, which shows the numbers of defective bolts produced by two diﬀerent types of
machines (I and II) on 12 consecutive days and which assumes that the machines have the same total
output per day. We wish to test the hypothesis H0 that there is no diﬀerence between the machines: that
the observed diﬀerences between the machines in terms of the numbers of defective bolts they produce
are merely the result of chance, which is to say that the samples come from the same population.
A simple nonparametric test in the case of such paired samples is provided by the sign test. This test
consists of taking the diﬀerence between the numbers of defective bolts for each day and writing only the
sign of the diﬀerence; for instance, for day 1 we have 47–71, which is negative. In this way we obtain
from Table 17.1 the sequence of signs

(i.e., 3 pluses and 9 minuses). Now if it is just as likely to get a þ as a , we would expect to get 6 of each.
The test of H0 is thus equivalent to that of whether a coin is fair if 12 tosses result in 3 heads (þ) and 9
tails (). This involves the binomial distribution of Chapter 7. Problem 17.1 shows that by using a
two-tailed test of this distribution at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we cannot reject H0; that is, there
is no diﬀerence between the machines at this level.
Remark 1:
If on some day the machines produced the same number of defective bolts,
a diﬀerence of zero would appear in sequence (1). In such case we can omit these sample
values and use 11 instead of 12 observations.
Remark 2:
A normal approximation to the binomial distribution, using a correction
for continuity, can also be used (see Problem 17.2).
Although the sign test is particularly useful for paired samples, as in Table 17.1, it can also be used
for problems involving single samples (see Problems 17.3 and 17.4).
THE MANN–WHITNEY U TEST
Consider Table 17.2, which shows the strengths of cables made from two diﬀerent alloys, I and II. In
this table we have two samples: 8 cables of alloy I and 10 cables of alloy II. We would like to decide
whether or not there is a diﬀerence between the samples or, equivalently, whether or not they come from
the same population. Although this problem can be worked by using the t test of Chapter 11, a non-
parametric test called the Mann–Whitney U test, or brieﬂy the U test, is useful. This test consists of the
following steps:
Step 1.
Combine all sample values in an array from the smallest to the largest, and assign ranks
(in this case from 1 to 18) to all these values. If two or more sample values are identical (i.e., there are
tie scores, or brieﬂy ties), the sample values are each assigned a rank equal to the mean of the ranks
that would otherwise be assigned. If the entry 18.9 in Table 17.2 were 18.3, two identical values
18.3 would occupy ranks 12 and 13 in the array so that the rank assigned to each would be
1
2 ð12 þ 13Þ ¼ 12:5:
Step 2.
Find the sum of the ranks for each of the samples. Denote these sums by R1; and R2, where
N1 and N2 are the respective sample sizes. For convenience, choose N1 as the smaller size if they are
unequal, so that N1  N2. A signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the rank sums R1 and R2 implies a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the samples.
Step 3.
To test the diﬀerence between the rank sums, use the statistic
U ¼ N1N2 þ N1ðN1 þ 1Þ
2
 R1
ð2Þ
corresponding to sample 1. The sampling distribution of U is symmetrical and has a mean and variance
given, respectively, by the formulas
U ¼ N1N2
2
2
U ¼ N1N2ðN1 þ N2 þ 1Þ

If N1 and N2 are both at least equal to 8, it turns out that the distribution of U is nearly normal,
so that
z ¼ U  U
U
ð4Þ
is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance l. Using Appendix II, we can then decide whether the
samples are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Problem 17.5 shows that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
cables at the 0.05 level.
Remark 3:
A value corresponding to sample 2 is given by the statistic
U ¼ N1N2 þ N2ðN2 þ 1Þ
2
 R2
ð5Þ
and has the same sampling distribution as statistic (2), with the mean and variance of
formulas (3). Statistic (5) is related to statistic (2), for if U1 and U2 are the values
corresponding to statistics (2) and (5), respectively, then we have the result
U1 þ U2 ¼ N1N2
ð6Þ
We also have
R1 þ R2 ¼ NðN þ 1Þ
2
ð7Þ
where N ¼ N1 þ N2. Result (7) can provide a check for calculations.
Remark 4:
The statistic U in equation (2) is the total number of times that sample 1
values precede sample 2 values when all sample values are arranged in increasing order
of magnitude. This provides an alternative counting method for ﬁnding U.
THE KRUSKAL–WALLIS H TEST
The U test is a nonparametric test for deciding whether or not two samples come from the same
population. A generalization of this for k samples is provided by the Kruskal–Wallis H test, or brieﬂy the
H test.
This test may be described thus: Suppose that we have k samples of sizes N1, N2, . . . , Nk, with the
total size of all samples taken together being given by N ¼ N1 þ N2 þ    þ Nk. Suppose further that the
data from all the samples taken together are ranked and that the sums of the ranks for the k samples are
R1, R2, . . . , Rk, respectively. If we deﬁne the statistic
H ¼
12
NðN þ 1Þ
X
k
j¼1
R2
j
Nj
 3ðN þ 1Þ
ð8Þ
then it can be shown that the sampling distribution of H is very nearly a chi-square distribution with k  1
degrees of freedom, provided that N1, N2, . . . , Nk are all at least 5.
The H test provides a nonparametric method in the analysis of variance for one-way classiﬁcation, or
one-factor experiments, and generalizations can be made.
THE H TEST CORRECTED FOR TIES
In case there are too many ties among the observations in the sample data, the value of H given by
statistic (8) is smaller than it should be. The corrected value of H, denoted by Hc, is obtained by dividing

the value given in statistic (8) by the correction factor
1 
P ðT3  TÞ
N3  N
ð9Þ
where T is the number of ties corresponding to each observation and where the sum is taken over all the
observations. If there are no ties, then T ¼ 0 and factor (9) reduces to 1, so that no correction is needed.
In practice, the correction is usually negligible (i.e., it is not enough to warrant a change in the decision).
THE RUNS TEST FOR RANDOMNESS
Although the word ‘‘random’’ has been used many times in this book (such as in ‘‘random sam-
pling’’ and ‘‘tossing a coin at random’’), no previous chapter has given any test for randomness.
A nonparametric test for randomness is provided by the theory of runs.
To understand what a run is, consider a sequence made up of two symbols, a and b, such as
a a j b b b j a j b b j a a a a a j b b b j a a a a j
ð10Þ
In tossing a coin, for example, a could represent ‘‘heads’’ and b could represent ‘‘tails.’’ Or in sampling
the bolts produced by a machine, a could represent ‘‘defective’’ and b could represent ‘‘nondefective.’’
A run is deﬁned as a set of identical (or related) symbols contained between two diﬀerent symbols or
no symbol (such as at the beginning or end of the sequence). Proceeding from left to right in sequence
(10), the ﬁrst run, indicated by a vertical bar, consists of two a’s; similarly, the second run consists of
three b’s, the third run consists of one a, etc. There are seven runs in all.
It seems clear that some relationship exists between randomness and the number of runs. Thus for
the sequence
a j b j a j b j a j b j a j b j a j b j a j b j
ð11Þ
there is a cyclic pattern, in which we go from a to b, back to a again, etc., which we could hardly believe
to be random. In such case we have too many runs (in fact, we have the maximum number possible for
the given number of a’s and b’s).
On the other hand, for the sequence
a a a a a a j b b b b j a a a a a j b b b j
ð12Þ
there seems to be a trend pattern, in which the a’s and b’s are grouped (or clustered) together. In such case
there are too few runs, and we would not consider the sequence to be random.
Thus a sequence would be considered nonrandom if there are either too many or too few runs, and
random otherwise. To quantify this idea, suppose that we form all possible sequences consisting of N1 a’s
and N2 b’s, for a total of N symbols in all ðN1 þ N2 ¼ NÞ. The collection of all these sequences provides
us with a sampling distribution: Each sequence has an associated number of runs, denoted by V. In this
way we are led to the sampling distribution of the statistic V. It can be shown that this sampling
distribution has a mean and variance given, respectively, by the formulas
V ¼ 2N1N2
N1 þ N2
þ 1
2
V ¼ 2N1N2ð2N1N2  N1  N2Þ
ðN1 þ N2Þ2ðN1 þ N2  1Þ
ð13Þ
By using formulas (13), we can test the hypothesis of randomness at appropriate levels of signiﬁcance. It
turns out that if both N1 and N2 are at least equal to 8, then the sampling distribution of V is very nearly
a normal distribution. Thus
z ¼ V  V
V
ð14Þ
is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1, and thus Appendix II can be used.

FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE RUNS TEST
The following are other applications of the runs test to statistical problems:
1.
Above- and Below-Median Test for Randomness of Numerical Data.
To determine whether numer-
ical data (such as collected in a sample) are random, ﬁrst place the data in the same order in which
they were collected. Then ﬁnd the median of the data and replace each entry with the letter a or b
according to whether its value is above or below the median. If a value is the same as the median,
omit it from the sample. The sample is random or not according to whether the sequence of a’s and
b’s is random or not. (See Problem 17.20.)
2.
Diﬀerences in Populations from Which Samples Are Drawn.
Suppose that two samples of sizes m
and n are denoted by a1, a2, . . . , am and b1, b2, . . . , bn, respectively. To decide whether the samples
do or do not come from the same population, ﬁrst arrange all m þ n sample values in a sequence of
increasing values. If some values are the same, they should be ordered by a random process (such as
by using random numbers). If the resulting sequence is random, we can conclude that the samples
are not really diﬀerent and thus come from the same population; if the sequence is not random,
no such conclusion can be drawn. This test can provide an alternative to the Mann–Whitney U test.
(See Problem 17.21.)
SPEARMAN’S RANK CORRELATION
Nonparametric methods can also be used to measure the correlation of two variables, X and Y.
Instead of using precise values of the variables, or when such precision is unavailable, the data may be
ranked from 1 to N in order of size, importance, etc. If X and Y are ranked in such a manner, the
coeﬃcient of rank correlation, or Spearman’s formula for rank correlation (as it is often called), is given by
rS ¼ 1 
6 P D2
NðN2  1Þ
ð15Þ
where D denotes the diﬀerences between the ranks of corresponding values of X and Y, and where N is
the number of pairs of values (X, Y) in the data.

THE SIGN TEST
17.1
Referring to Table 17.1, test the hypothesis Ho that there is no diﬀerence between machines I and
II against the alternative hypothesis H1 that there is a diﬀerence at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level.

The probabilities may be found by using EXCEL. The p-value corresponding to the outcome X ¼ 3
is 2P{X  3} which using EXCEL is ¼2*BINOMDIST(3,12,0.5,1) or 0.146. (The p-value is twice
the area in the left tail of the binomial distribution.) Since this area exceeds 0.05, we are unable to reject
the null at level of signiﬁcance 0.05. We thus conclude that there is no diﬀerence in the two machines
at this level.
17.2
Work Problem 17.1 by using a normal approximation to the binomial distribution.

For a normal approximation to the binomial distribution, we use the fact that the z score corresponding
to the number of heads is
z ¼ X

ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Npq
p
Because the variable X for the binomial distribution is discrete while that for a normal distribution is
continuous, we make a correction for continuity (for example, 3 heads are really a value between 2.5 and
3.5 heads). This amounts to decreasing X by 0.5 if X > Np and to increasing X by 0.5 if X < Np. Now
N ¼ 12,  ¼ Np ¼ ð12Þð0:5Þ ¼ 6, and  ¼

The p-value is twice the area to the left of 1:45. Using EXCEL, we evaluate ¼2*NORMSDIST(1.45) and
get 0.147. Looking at Figure 17-1, the approximate p-value is the area under the standard normal curve from
1:45 to the left and it is doubled because the hypothesis is two-tailed. Notice how close the two p-values are
to one another. The binomial area under the rectangles is 0.146 and the area under the approximating
standard normal curve is 0.147.

The PQR Company claims that the lifetime of a type of battery that it manufactures is more than
250 hours (h). A consumer advocate wishing to determine whether the claim is justiﬁed measures
the lifetimes of 24 of the company’s batteries; the results are listed in Table 17.3. Assuming the
sample to be random, determine whether the company’s claim is justiﬁed at the 0.05 signiﬁcance
level. Work the problem ﬁrst by hand, supplying all the details for the sign test. Follow this with
the MINITAB solution to the problem.

SOLUTION
Let H0 be the hypothesis that the company’s batteries have a lifetime equal to 250 h, and let H1 be
the hypothesis that they have a lifetime greater than 250 h. To test H0 against H1, we can use the sign test.
To do this, we subtract 250 from each entry in Table 17.3 and record the signs of the diﬀerences, as shown in
Table 17.4. We see that there are 15 plus signs and 9 minus signs.
Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, the z score is
z ¼ ð15  0:5Þ  24ð0:5Þ

24ð0:5Þð0:5Þ

¼ 1:02:
Note the correction for continuity ð15  0:5Þ ¼ 14:5 when 0.5 is subtracted form 15. The p-value is the area
to the right of 1.02 on the z-curve, also called the standard normal curve. (See Fig. 17-2.)
The p-value is the area to the right of z ¼ 1.02 or, using EXCEL, the area is given by
¼1-NORMSDIST(1.02) or 0.1537. Since the p-value 40.05, the companies claim cannot be justiﬁed.
The solution using MINITAB is as follows. The data in Table 17.3 are entered into column 1 of the
MINITAB worksheet and the column is named Lifetime. The pull-down Stat ! Non-parametrics !

A sample of 40 grades from a statewide examination is shown in Table 17.5. Test the hypothesis
at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level that the median grade for all participants is (a) 66 and (b) 75.
Work the problem ﬁrst by hand, supplying all the details for the sign test. Follow this with the
MINITAB solution to the problem.
SOLUTION
(a)
Subtracting 66 from all the entries of Table 17.5 and retaining only the associated signs gives us Table
17.6, in which we see that there are 23 pluses, 15 minuses, and 2 zeros. Discarding the 2 zeros, our
sample consists of 38 signs: 23 pluses and 15 minuses. Using a two-tailed test of the normal distribution
with probabilities 1
2 ð0:05Þ ¼ 0:025 in each tail (Fig. 17-3), we adopt the following decision rule:
Accept the hypothesis if 1:96  z  1:96.
Reject the hypothesis otherwise.

Subtracting 75 from all the entries in Table 17.5 gives us Table 17.7, in which there are 13 pluses and
27 minuses. Since
z ¼ ð13 þ 0:5Þ  ð40Þð0:5Þ
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ð40Þð0:5Þð0:5Þ
p
¼ 2:06
we reject the hypothesis that the median is 75 at the 0.05 level.
Using this method, we can arrive at a 95% conﬁdence interval for the median grade on the
examination. (See Problem 17.30.)
Note that the above solution uses the classical method of testing hypothesis. The classical method uses
 ¼ 0:05 to ﬁnd the rejection region for the test. ½z < 1:96 or z > 1:96. Next, the test statistic is computed
[z ¼ 1:14 in part (a) and z ¼ 2:06 in part (b)]. If the test statistic falls in the rejection region, then reject
the null. If the test statistic does not fall in the rejection region, do not reject the null.
The MINITAB solution uses the p-value approach. Calculate the p-value and, if it is 50.05, reject the
null hypothesis. If the p-value 40.05, do not reject the null hypothesis. The same decision will always be
reached using either the classical method or the p-value method.
The solution using MINITAB proceeds as follows. To test that the median equals 66, the output is

THE MANN–WHITNEY U TEST
17.5
Referring to Table 17.2, determine whether there is a diﬀerence at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level
between cables made of alloy I and alloy II. Work the problem ﬁrst by hand, supplying all the
details for the Mann–Witney U test. Follow this with the MINITAB solution to the problem.
SOLUTION
We organize the work in accordance with steps 1, 2, and 3 (described earlier in this chapter):
Step 1.
Combining all 18 sample values in an array from the smallest to the largest gives us the ﬁrst
line of Table 17.8. These values are numbered 1 to 18 in the second line, which gives us the ranks.

Step 2.
To ﬁnd the sum of the ranks for each sample, rewrite Table 17.2 by using the associated ranks
from Table 17.8; this gives us Table 17.9. The sum of the ranks is 106 for alloy I and 65 for alloy II.
Step 3.
Since the alloy I sample has the smaller size, N1 ¼ 8 and N2 ¼ 10. The corresponding sums of
the ranks are R1 ¼ 106 and R2 ¼ 65. Then
U ¼ N1N2 þ N1ðN1 þ 1Þ

Thus U ¼ 11:25 and
z ¼ U  U
U
¼ 10  40
11:25 ¼ 2:67
Since the hypothesis H0 that we are testing is whether there is no diﬀerence between the alloys, a two-tailed
test is required. For the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we have the decision rule:
Accept H0 if 1:96  z  1:96.
Reject H0 otherwise.
Because z ¼ 2:67, we reject H0 and conclude that there is a diﬀerence between the alloys at the 0.05 level.
The MINITAB solution to the problem is as follows: First, the data values for alloy I and alloy II are
entered into columns C1 and C2, respectively, and the columns are named AlloyI and AlloyII. The
pull-down Stat ! Nonparametrics ! Mann-Whitney gives the following output.

medians, the sum of the ranks for the ﬁrst named variable (W ¼ 106), and the two-tailed p-value ¼ 0.0088.
Since the p-value 50.05, the null hypothesis would be rejected. We would conclude that alloy 1 results in
stronger cables.

A professor has two classes in psychology: a morning class of 9 students, and an afternoon class
of 12 students. On a ﬁnal examination scheduled at the same time for all students, the classes
received the grades shown in Table 17.10. Can one conclude at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level that the
morning class performed worse than the afternoon class? Work the problem ﬁrst by hand,

The one-tailed p-value is given by the EXCEL expression ¼1-NORMSDIST(1.85) which yields 0.0322.
Since the p-value 50.05, we can conclude that the morning class performs worse than the afternoon class.
The MINITAB solution to the problem is as follows. First the data values for the morning and after-

The MINITAB output gives the median grade for each sample, a point estimate of the diﬀerence in
population medians, a conﬁdence interval for the diﬀerence in population medians, the sum of ranks for
the ﬁrst named variable (in this case, the morning class), and the one-tail p-value ¼ 0.0350. Since the p-value
is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis would be rejected. We conclude that the morning class performs worse
than the afternoon class.

17.9
Find U for the data of Table 17.13 by using (a) formula (2) of this chapter and (b) the counting
method (as described in Remark 4 of this chapter).
SOLUTION
(a)
Arranging the data from both samples in an array in increasing order of magnitude and assigning ranks
from 1 to 5 gives us Table 17.14. Replacing the data of Table 17.13 with the corresponding ranks gives
us Table 17.15, from which the sums of the ranks are R1 ¼ 5 and R2 ¼ 10. Since N1 ¼ 2 and N2 ¼ 3,
the value of U for sample 1 is
U ¼ N1N2 þ N1ðN1 þ 1Þ
2
 R1 ¼ ð2Þð3Þ þ ð2Þð3Þ
2
 5 ¼ 4
The value of U for sample 2 can be found similarly to be U ¼ 2.
(b)
Let us replace the sample values in Table 17.14 with I or II, depending on whether the value belongs to
sample 1 or 2. Then the ﬁrst line of Table 17.14 becomes
Data

I
II
II
I
II
From this we see that
Number of sample 1 values preceding first sample 2 value
¼ 1
Number of sample 1 values preceding second sample 2 value ¼ 1
Number of sample 1 values preceding third sample 2 value
¼ 2
Total ¼ 4
Thus the value of U corresponding to the ﬁrst sample is 4.
Similarly, we have
Number of sample 2 values preceding first sample 1 value
¼ 0
Number of sample 2 values preceding second sample 1 value ¼ 2
Total ¼ 2
Thus the value of U corresponding to the second sample is 2.
Note that since N1 ¼ 2 and N2 ¼ 3, these values satisfy U1 þ U2 ¼ N1N2; that is, 4 þ 2 ¼
ð2Þð3Þ ¼ 6.

17.10 A population consists of the values 7, 12, and 15. Two samples are drawn without replacement
from this population: sample 1, consisting of one value, and sample 2, consisting of two values.
(Between them, the two samples exhaust the population.)
(a)
Find the sampling distribution of U and its graph.
(b)
Find the mean and variance of the distribution in part (a).
(c)
Verify the results found in part (b) by using formulas (3) of this chapter.
SOLUTION
(a)
We choose sampling without replacement to avoid ties—which would occur if, for example, the value
12 were to appear in both samples.
There are 3  2 ¼ 6 possibilities for choosing the samples, as shown in Table 17.16. It should
be noted that we could just as easily use ranks 1, 2, and 3 instead of 7, 12, and 15. The value U in
Table 17.16 is that found for sample 1, but if U for sample 2 were used, the distribution would be
the same.
A graph of this distribution is shown in Fig. 17-4, where f is the frequency. The probability
distribution of U can also be graphed; in this case PrfU ¼ 0g ¼ PrfU ¼ 1g ¼ PrfU ¼ 2g ¼ 1
3. The
required graph is the same as that shown in Fig. 17-4, but with ordinates 1 and 2 replaced by 1
6 and

3, respectively.

Find the sampling distribution of U in Problem 17.9 and graph it.
(b)
Graph the corresponding probability distribution of U.
(c)
Obtain the mean and variance of U directly from the results of part (a).
(d)
Verify part (c) by using formulas (3) of this chapter.
SOLUTION
(a)
In this case there are 5  4  3  2 ¼ 120 possibilities for choosing values for the two samples and the
method of Problem 17.9 is too laborious. To simplify the procedure, let us concentrate on the smaller
sample (of size N1 ¼ 2Þ and the possible sums of the ranks, R1. The sum of the ranks for sample 1 is the
smallest when the sample consists of the two lowest-ranking numbers (1, 2); then R1 ¼ 1 þ 2 ¼ 3.
Similarly, the sum of the ranks for sample 1 is the largest when the sample consists of the two
highest-ranking numbers (4, 5); then R1 ¼ 4 þ 5 ¼ 9. Thus R1, varies from 3 to 9.
Column 1 of Table 17.17 lists these values of R1 (from 3 to 9), and column 2 shows the corre-
sponding sample 1 values, whose sum is R1. Column 3 gives the frequency (or number) of samples with
sum R1; for example, there are f ¼ 2 samples with R1 ¼ 5. Since N1 ¼ 2 and N2 ¼ 3, we have
U ¼ N1N2 þ N1ðN1 þ 1Þ
2
 R1 ¼ ð2Þð3Þ þ ð2Þð3Þ
2
 R1 ¼ 9  R1
From this we ﬁnd the corresponding values of U in column 4 of the table; note that as R1 varies from 3
to 9, U varies from 6 to 0. The sampling distribution is provided by columns 3 and 4, and the graph is
shown in Fig. 17-5.

(b)
The probability that U ¼ R1 (i.e., PrfU ¼ R1gÞ is shown in column 5 of Table 17.17 and is obtained by
ﬁnding the relative frequency. The relative frequency is found by dividing each frequency f by the sum
of all the frequencies, or 10; for example, PrfU ¼ 5g ¼ 2
10 ¼ 0:2. The graph of the probability distribu-
tion is shown in Fig. 17-6.

where the sum in equation (17) is obtained by writing the sum in (16) backward. Adding equations (16) and
(17) gives
2R ¼ ðN þ 1Þ þ ðN þ 1Þ þ ðN þ 1Þ þ    þ ðN þ 1Þ þ ðN þ 1Þ ¼ NðN þ 1Þ
since ðN þ 1Þ occurs N times in the sum; thus R ¼ ½NðN þ 1Þ=2. This can also be obtained by using a result
from elementary algebra on arithmetic progressions and series.
17.13 If R1 and R2 are the respective sums of the ranks for samples 1 and 2 in the U test, prove that
R1 þ R2 ¼ ½NðN þ 1Þ=2.
SOLUTION
We assume that there are no ties in the sample data. Then R1 must be the sum of some of the ranks
(numbers) in the set 1, 2, 3, . . . , N, while R2 must be the sum of the remaining ranks in the set. Thus the sum
R1 þ R2 must be the sum of all the ranks in the set; that is, R1 þ R2 ¼ 1 þ 2 þ 3 þ    þ N ¼ ½NðN þ 1Þ=2
by Problem 17.12.
THE KRUSKAL–WALLIS H TEST
17.14 A company wishes to purchase one of ﬁve diﬀerent machines: A, B, C, D, or E. In an experiment
designed to determine whether there is a performance diﬀerence between the machines, ﬁve
experienced operators each work on the machines for equal times. Table 17.18 shows the number
of units produced by each machine. Test the hypothesis that there is no diﬀerence between the
machines at the (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01 signiﬁcance levels. Work the problem ﬁrst by hand, supplying
all the details for the Kruskal–Wallis H test. Follow this with the MINITAB solution to the
problem.

SOLUTION
Since there are ﬁve samples (A, B, C, D, and E ), k ¼ 5. And since each sample consists of ﬁve values, we
have N1 ¼ N2 ¼ N3 ¼ N4 ¼ N5 ¼ 5, and N ¼ N1 þ N2 þ N3 þ N4 þ N5 ¼ 25. By arranging all the values in
increasing order of magnitude and assigning appropriate ranks to the ties, we replace Table 17.18 with Table
17.19, the right-hand column of which shows the sum of the ranks. We see from Table 17.19 that R1 ¼ 70,
R2 ¼ 48:5, R3 ¼ 93, R4 ¼ 40:5, and R5 ¼ 73. Thus

For k  1 ¼ 4 degrees of freedom at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, from Appendix IV we have 2
:95 ¼ 9:49. Since
6:44 < 9:49, we cannot reject the hypothesis of no diﬀerence between the machines at the 0.05 level and
therefore certainly cannot reject it at the 0.01 level. In other words, we can accept the hypothesis (or reserve
judgment) that there is no diﬀerence between the machines at both levels.
Note that we have already worked this problem by using analysis of variance (see Problem 16.8) and
have arrived at the same conclusion.
The solution to the problem by using MINITAB proceeds as follows. First the data need to be entered

THE RUNS TEST FOR RANDOMNESS
17.17 In 30 tosses of a coin the following sequence of heads (H) and tails (T) is obtained:
H T T H T H H H T H H T T H T
H T H H T H T T H T H H T H T
(a)
Determine the number of runs, V.
(b)
Test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level whether the sequence is random.
Work the problem ﬁrst by hand, supplying all the details of the runs test for randomness. Follow
this with the MINITAB solution to the problem.
SOLUTION
(a)
Using a vertical bar to indicate a run, we see from

H j T j H

that the number of runs is V ¼ 22.
(b)
There are N1 ¼ 16 heads and N2 ¼ 14 tails in the given sample of tosses, and from part (a) the number
of runs is V ¼ 22. Thus from formulas (13) of this chapter we have
V ¼ 2ð16Þð14Þ
16 þ 14 þ 1 ¼ 15:93
2
V ¼ 2ð16Þð14Þ½2ð16Þð14Þ  16  14
ð16 þ 14Þ2ð16 þ 14  1Þ
¼ 7:175
or V ¼ 2:679. The z score corresponding to V ¼ 22 runs is therefore
z ¼ V  V
V
¼ 22  15:93
2:679
¼ 2:27
Now for a two-tailed test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we would accept the hypothesis H0 of random-
ness if 1:96  z  1:96 and would reject it otherwise (see Fig. 17-7). Since the calculated value of z is
2:27 > 1:96, we conclude that the tosses are not random at the 0.05 level. The test shows that there are
too many runs, indicating a cyclic pattern in the tosses.
z = −1.96
z = 1.96
Area=0.025
Area = 0.025

If the correction for continuity is used, the above z score is replaced by
z ¼ ð22  0:5Þ  15:93
2:679
¼ 2:08
and the same conclusion is reached.
The solution to the problem by using MINITAB proceeds as follows. The data are entered into
column C1 as follows. Each head is represented by the number 1 and each tail is represented by the
number 0. Column 1 is named Coin. The MINITAB pull-down Stat ! Nonparametrics ! Runs Test

The value shown for K is the mean of the zeros and ones in column 1. The number of observations
above and below K will be the number of heads and tails in the 30 tosses of the coin. The p-value is
equal to 0.0235. Since this p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The number of runs is
not random.

Test the randomness of the sequence at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level. Also use SPSS to test the
randomness of the sequence.
SOLUTION
The numbers of D’s and G’s are N1 ¼ 10 and N2 ¼ 38, respectively, and the number of runs is V ¼ 11.
Thus the mean and variance are given by
V ¼ 2ð10Þð38Þ
10 þ 38 þ 1 ¼ 16:83
2
V ¼ 2ð10Þð38Þ½2ð10Þð38Þ  10  38
ð10 þ 38Þ2ð10 þ 38  1Þ
¼ 4:997
so that V ¼ 2:235.
For a two-tailed test at the 0.05 level, we would accept the hypothesis H0 of randomness
if 1:96  z  1:96 (see Fig. 17-7) and would reject it otherwise. Since the z score corresponding to
V ¼ 11 is
z ¼ V  V
V
¼ 11  16:83
2:235
¼ 2:61
and 2:61 < 1:96, we can reject H0 at the 0.05 level.
The test shows that there are too few runs, indicating a clustering (or bunching) of defective tools. In
other words, there seems to be a trend pattern in the production of defective tools. Further examination of
the production process is warranted.

The pull-down Analyze ! Nonparametric Tests ! Runs gives the following SPSS output. If the G’s are
replaced by 1’s and the D’s are replaced by 0’s, the test value, 0.7917, is the mean of these values. The other
values are N1 ¼ 10, N2 ¼ 38, Sum ¼ 48, and V ¼ 11. The computed value of z has the correction for
continuity in it. This causes the z value to diﬀer from the z value computed above. The term
Asymp. Sig. (2-tailed) is the two-tailed p-value corresponding to z ¼ 2:386. We see that the SPSS
output has the same information as we computed by hand. We simply have to know how to interpret it.

V, corresponding to each sequence.

FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE RUNS TEST
17.22 Referring to Problem 17.3, and assuming a signiﬁcance level of 0.05, determine whether the
sample lifetimes of the batteries produced by the PQR Company are random. Assume the life-
times of the batteries given in Table 17.3 were recorded in a row by row fashion. That is, the ﬁrst
lifetime was 217, the second lifetime was 230, and so forth until the last lifetime, 268. Work the
problem ﬁrst by hand, supplying all the details of the runs test for randomness. Follow this with
the STATISTIX solution to the problem.
SOLUTION
Table 17.23 shows the batteries’ lifetimes in increasing order of magnitude. Since there are 24 entries in
the table, the median is obtained from the middle two entries, 253 and 262, as 1
2 ð253 þ 262Þ ¼ 257:5.
Rewriting the data of Table 17.3 by using an a if the entry is above the median and a b if it is below the
median, we obtain Table 17.24, in which we have 12 a’s, 12 b’s, and 15 runs. Thus N1 ¼ 12, N2 ¼ 12, N ¼ 24,
V ¼ 15, and we have

Using a two-tailed test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, we would accept the hypothesis of randomness
if 1:96  z  1:96. Since 0.835 falls within this range, we conclude that the sample is random.
The STATISTIX analysis proceeds as follows. The lifetimes are entered into column 1 in the order in
which they were collected. The column is named Lifetime. The pull-down Statistics ! Randomness/

RANK CORRELATION
17.24 Table 17.25 shows how 10 students, arranged in alphabetical order, were ranked according to
their achievements in both the laboratory and lecture sections of a biology course. Find the
coeﬃcient of rank correlation. Use SPSS to compute Spearman’s rank correlation.
SOLUTION
The diﬀerence in ranks, D, in the laboratory and lecture sections for each student is given in Table
17.26, which also gives D2 and P D2. Thus
rS ¼ 1 
6 P D2
NðN2  1Þ ¼ 1

indicating that there is a marked relationship between the achievements in the course’s laboratory and
lecture sections.
Enter the data from Table 17.26 in columns named Lab and Lecture. The pull-down Analyze !
Correlate ! Bivariate results in the following output.

In addition to the simple statistics, SAS gives the Spearman correlation coeﬃcient as 0.74. The p-value,
0.0059, can be used to test the null hypothesis that the population coeﬃcient of rank correlation is equal to 0
versus the alternative that the population coeﬃcient of rank correlation is diﬀerent from 0. We conclude that
there is a relationship between the heights of fathers and sons in the population.

THE SIGN TEST
17.26
A company claims that if its product is added to an automobile’s gasoline tank, the mileage per gallon will
improve. To test the claim, 15 diﬀerent automobiles are chosen and the mileage per gallon with and without
the additive is measured; the results are shown in Table 17.30. Assuming that the driving conditions are
the same, determine whether there is a diﬀerence due to the additive at signiﬁcance levels of (a) 0.05 and
(b) 0.01.
17.27
Can one conclude at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level that the mileage per gallon achieved in Problem 17.26 is better
with the additive than without it?

6% in 1 month if followed precisely. To test the club’s claim, 36 adults undertake the program. Of these,
25 realize the desired loss, 6 gain weight, and the rest remain essentially unchanged. Determine at the
0.05 signiﬁcance level whether the program is eﬀective.
17.29
A training manager claims that by giving a special course to company sales personnel, the company’s annual
sales will increase. To test this claim, the course is given to 24 people. Of these 24, the sales of 16 increase,

CHAPTER 18
Statistical Process Control 
and Process Capability
GENERAL DISCUSSION OF CONTROL CHARTS
Variation in any process is due to common causes or special causes. The natural variation that exists
in materials, machinery, and people gives rise to common causes of variation. In industrial settings,
special causes, also known as assignable causes, are due to excessive tool wear, a new operator, a change
of materials, a new supplier, etc. One of the purposes of control charts is to locate and, if possible,
eliminate special causes of variation. The general structure of a control chart consists of control limits
and a centerline as shown in Fig. 18-1. There are two control limits, called an upper control limit or UCL
and a lower control limit or LCL.

Control charts are of two types (variable and attribute control charts).

When a point on the control chart falls outside the control limits, the process is said to be out of
statistical control. There are other anomalous patterns besides a point outside the control limits that also
indicate a process that is out of control. These will be discussed later. It is desirable for a process to be in
control so that its’ behavior is predictable.
VARIABLES AND ATTRIBUTES CONTROL CHARTS
Control charts may be divided into either variables control charts or attributes control charts. The
terms ‘‘variables’’ and ‘‘attributes’’ are associated with the type of data being collected on the process.
When measuring characteristics such as time, weight, volume, length, pressure drop, concentration, etc.,
we consider such data to be continuous and refer to it as variables data. When counting the number of
defective items in a sample or the number of defects associated with a particular type of item, the
resulting data are called attributes data. Variables data are considered to be of a higher level than
attributes data. Table 18.1 gives the names of many of the various variables and attributes control charts
and the statistics plotted on the chart.
The charts above the dashed line in Table 18.1 are variables control charts and the charts below the
dashed line are attributes control charts. We shall discuss some of the more basic charts. MINITAB will
be used to construct the charts. Today, charting is almost always accomplished by the use of statistical
software such as MINITAB.
X-BAR AND R CHARTS
The general idea of an X-bar chart can be understood by considering a process having mean m and
standard deviation . Suppose the process is monitored by taking periodic samples, called subgroups, of
size n and computing the sample mean, X, for each sample. The central limit theorem assures us that the
mean of the sample mean is m and the standard deviation of the sample mean is =
ﬃﬃﬃn
p . The centerline for
the sample means is taken to be m and the upper and lower control limits are taken to be 3 =
ﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð
Þ above
and below the centerline. The lower control limit is given by equation (1):

For a normally distributed process, a subgroup mean will fall between the limits, given in (1) and (2),
99.7% of the time. In practice, the process mean and the process standard deviation are unknown and
need to be estimated. The process mean is estimated by using the mean of the periodic sample means.
This is given by equation (3), where m is the number of periodic samples of size n selected.
X ¼
P X
m
ð3Þ
The mean,X, can also be found by summing all the data and then dividing by mn. The process standard
deviation is estimated by pooling the subgroup variances, averaging the subgroup standard deviations or
ranges, or by sometimes using a historical value of .
EXAMPLE 1.
Data are obtained on the width of a product. Five observations per time period are sampled for
20 periods. The data are shown below in Table 18.2. The number of periodic samples is m ¼ 20, the sample size
or subgroup size is n ¼ 5, the sum of all the data is 199.84, and centerline is X ¼ 1:998. The MINITAB pull-
down menu ‘‘Stat ) Control charts ) Xbar’’ was used to produce the control chart shown in Fig. 18-2. The
data in Table 18.2 are stacked into a single column before applying the above pull-down menu sequence.
The standard deviation for the process may be estimated in four diﬀerent ways: By using the average
of the 20 subgroup ranges, by using the average of the 20 subgroup standard deviations, by pooling the
20 subgroup variances, or by using a historical value for , if one is known. MINITAB allows for all four
options. The 20 means for the samples shown in Table 18.2 are plotted in Fig. 18-2. The chart indicates
a process that is in control. The individual means randomly vary about the centerline and none fall
outside the control limits.

As with the X-bar chart, several diﬀerent methods are used to estimate the standard deviation of the
process.
EXAMPLE 2.
For the data in Table 18.2, the range of the ﬁrst subgroup is R1 ¼ 2:000  1:975 ¼ 0:025 and the
range for the second subgroup is R2 ¼ 2:012  1:978 ¼ 0:034. The 20 ranges are: 0.025, 0.034, 0.038, 0.031, 0.028,
0.030, 0.054, 0.039, 0.026, 0.048, 0.026, 0.018, 0.012, 0.027, 0.030, 0.027, 0.049, 0.053, 0.047 and 0.020. The mean of
these 20 ranges is 0.0327. A MINITAB plot of these ranges is shown in Fig. 18-3. The R chart does not indicate any
unusual patterns with respect to variability. The MINITAB pull-down menu ‘‘Stat ! Control charts ! R chart’’ is
used to produce the control chart shown in Fig. 18-3. The data in Table 18.2 are stacked into a single column before

TESTS FOR SPECIAL CAUSES
In addition to a point falling outside the control limits of a control chart, there are other indications
that are suggestive of non-randomness of a process caused by special eﬀects. Table 18.3 gives eight tests
for special causes.
PROCESS CAPABILITY
To perform a capability analysis on a process, the process needs to be in statistical control. It is
usually assumed that the process characteristic being measured is normally distributed. This may be
checked out using tests for normality such as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, the Ryan–Joiner test, or the
Anderson–Darling test. Process capability compares process performance with process requirements.
Process requirements determine speciﬁcation limits. LSL and USL represent the lower speciﬁcation limit
and the upper speciﬁcation limit.
The data used to determine whether a process is in statistical control may be used to do the
capability analysis. The 3-sigma distance on either side of the mean is called the process spread. The
mean and standard deviation for the process characteristic may be estimated from the data gathered for
the statistical process control study.
EXAMPLE 3.
As we saw in Example 2, the data in Table 18.2 come from a process that is in statistical control.
We found the estimate of the process mean to be 1.9984. The standard deviation of the 100 observations is found
to equal 0.013931. Suppose the speciﬁcation limits are LSL ¼ 1.970 and USL ¼ 2.030. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test for normality is applied by using MINITAB and it is found that we do not reject the normality of the
process
characteristic.
The
nonconformance
rates
are
computed
as
follows.
The
proportion

the
USL ¼ PðX > 2:030Þ ¼ P½ðX  1:9984Þ=0:013931 > ð2:030  1:9984Þ=0:013931 ¼ PðZ > 2:27Þ ¼ 0:0116. That is,
there are 0.0116(1,000,000) ¼ 11,600 parts per million (ppm) above the USL that are nonconforming. Note that
P(Z42.27 ) may be found using MINITAB rather than looking it up in the standard normal tables. This is done as
follows. Use the pull-down mean Calc ! Probability Distribution ! Normal.
X ¼ 2.27 gives the following
x
P(X ( x)
2.2700
0.9884
We have P(Z52.27) ¼ 0.9884 and therefore PðZ > 2:27Þ ¼ 1  0:9884 ¼ 0:0116.
Similarly, the proportion below the LSL ¼ PðX5 1:970Þ ¼ PðZ5 2:04Þ ¼ 0:0207. There are 20,700 ppm below
the LSL that are nonconforming. Again, MINITAB is used to ﬁnd the area to the left of 2:04 under the standard
normal curve.
The total number of nonconforming units is 11,600 þ 20,700 ¼ 32,300 ppm. This is of course an unacceptably high
number of nonconforming units.
Table 18.3
Tests for Special Causes
1. One point more than 3 sigmas from centerline
2. Nine points in a row on same side of centerline
3. Six points in a row, all increasing or all decreasing
4. Fourteen points in a row, alternating up and down
5. Two out of three points more than 2 sigmas from centerline (same side)
6. Four out of ﬁve points more than 1 sigma from centerline (same side)
7. Fifteen points in a row within 1 sigma of centerline (either side)
8. Eight points in a row more than 1 sigma from centerline (either side)

Suppose ^m represents the estimated mean for the process characteristic and ^ represents the
estimated standard deviation for the process characteristic, then the nonconformance rates are
estimated as follows: The proportion above the USL equals
PðX > USLÞ ¼ P Z > USL  ^m

and the proportion below the LSL equals
PðX < LSLÞ ¼ P Z < LSL  ^m

Suppose that CPL ¼ 1:1, then the proportion nonconforming is PðZ < 3ð1:1ÞÞ ¼ PðZ < 3:3Þ.
This may be found using MINITAB as follows. Give the pull-down ‘‘Calc) Probability Distribution ) Normal.’’
The cumulative area to the left of 3:3 is given as:

There would be 1,000,000  0:00048348 ¼ 483 ppm nonconforming. Using this technique, a table relating noncon-
formance rate to capability index can be constructed. This is given in Table 18.4.
EXAMPLE 7.
A capability analysis using MINITAB and the data in Table 18.2 may be obtained by using
the following pull-down menus in MINITAB Stat ) Quality tools ) Capability Analysis (Normal). The
MINITAB output is shown in Fig. 18-4. The output gives nonconformance rates, capability indexes, and
several other measures. The quantities found in Examples 3, 4, and 5 are very close to the corresponding measures
shown in the ﬁgure. The diﬀerences are due to round-oﬀerror as well as diﬀerent methods of estimating certain
parameters. The graph is very instructive. It shows the distribution of sample measurements as a histogram.
The population distribution of process measurements is shown as the normal curve. The tail areas under the
normal curve to the right of the USL and to the left of the LSL represent the percentage of nonconforming
products. By multiplying the sum of these percentages times one million, we get the ppm non-conformance rate
for the process.

P- AND NP-CHARTS
When mass-produced products are categorized or classiﬁed, the resulting data are called attributes
data. After establishing standards that a product must satisfy, speciﬁcations are determined. An item not
meeting speciﬁcations is called a non-conforming item. A nonconforming item that is not usable is called a
defective item. A defective item is considered to be more serious than a nonconforming item. An item
might be nonconforming because of a scratch or a discoloration, but not be a defective item. The failure
of a performance test would likely cause the product to be classiﬁed as defective as well as nonconform-
ing. Flaws found on a single item are called nonconformities. Nonrepairable ﬂaws are called defects.
Four diﬀerent control charts are used when dealing with attributes data. The four charts are the
P-, NP-, C-, and U-chart. The P- and the NP-charts are based on the binomial distribution and the
C- and U-charts are based on the Poisson distribution. The P-chart is used to monitor the proportion
of nonconforming items being produced by a process. The P-chart and the notation used to describe it
are illustrated in Example 8.
EXAMPLE 8.
Suppose 20 respirator masks are examined every thirty minutes and the number of defective units
are recorded per 8-hour shift. The total number examined on a given shift is equal to n ¼ 20(16) ¼ 320. Table 18.5
gives the results for 30 such shifts. The center line for the p-chart is equal to the proportion of defectives for the
30 shifts, and is given by total number of defectives divided by the total number examined for the 30 shifts, or
p ¼ 72=9600 ¼ 0:0075:

The lower control limit is LCL ¼ 0:0075  3ð0:004823Þ ¼ 0:006969. When the LCL is negative, it is taken to
be zero since the proportion defective in a sample can never be negative. The upper control limit is UCL ¼ 0.0075 þ
3 (0.004823) ¼ 0.021969.
The MINITAB solution to obtaining the P-chart for this process is given by using the pull-down menus
Stat ! Control charts ! P. The P-chart is shown in Fig. 18-5. Even though it appears that samples 15 and
20 indicate the presence of a special cause, when the proportion defective for samples 15 and 20 ( both equal
to 0.021875 ) are compared with the UCL ¼ 0.021969, it is seen that the points are not beyond the UCL.

The P-chart monitors the percent defective.

The NP-chart monitors the number of defectives rather than the proportion of defectives. The
NP-chart is considered by many to be preferable to the P-chart because the number defective is easier
for quality technicians and operators to understand than is the proportion defective. The centerline for
the NP-chart is given by np and the 3-sigma control limits are

For the data in Table 18.5, the centerline is given by np ¼ 320ð:0075Þ ¼ 2:4 and the control limits are
LCL ¼ 2:4  4:63 ¼ 2:23, which we take as 0, and UCL ¼ 2.4 þ 4.63 ¼ 7.03. If 8 or more defectives are found
on a given shift, the process is out of control. The MINITAB solution is found by using the pull-down sequence
Stat ! Control charts ! NP
The number defective per sample needs to be entered in some column of the worksheet prior to executing
the pull-down sequence. The MINITAB NP-chart is shown in Fig. 18-6.
OTHER CONTROL CHARTS
This chapter serves as only an introduction to the use of control charts to assist in statistical process
control. Table 18.1 gives a listing of many of the various control charts in use in industrial settings today.
To expedite calculations on the shop ﬂoor, the median chart is sometimes used. The medians of the
samples are plotted rather than the means of the samples. If the sample size is odd, then the median is
simply the middle value in the ordered sample values.
For low-volume production runs, individuals charts are often used. In this case, the subgroup or
sample consists of a single observation. Individuals charts are sometimes referred to as X charts.
A zone chart is divided into four zones. Zone 1 is deﬁned as values within 1 standard deviation
of the mean, zone 2 is deﬁned as values between 1 and 2 standard deviations of the mean, zone 3 is
deﬁned as values between 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean, and zone 4 as values 3 or more
standard deviations from the mean. Weights are assigned to the four zones. Weights for points on
the same side of the centerline are added. When a cumulative sum is equal to or greater than the
weight assigned to zone 4, this is taken as a signal that the process is out of control. The cumulative
sum is set equal to 0 after signaling a process out of control, or when the next plotted point crosses
the centerline.

The NP-chart monitors the number defective.

The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA chart) is an alternative to the individuals or
X-bar chart that provides a quicker response to a shift in the process average. The EWMA chart
incorporates information from all previous subgroups, not only the current subgroup.
Cumulative sums of deviations from a process target value are utilized by a Cusum chart. Both the
EWMA chart and the Cusum chart allow for quick detection of process shifts.
When we are concerned with the number of nonconformities or defects in a product rather than
simply determining whether the product is defective or non defective, we use a C-chart or a U-chart.
When using these charts, it is important to deﬁne an inspection unit. The inspection unit is deﬁned as
the ﬁxed unit of output to be sampled and examined for nonconformities. When there is only one
inspection unit per sample, the C-chart is used, and when the number of inspection units per sample
vary, the U-chart is used.

An industrial process ﬁlls containers with breakfast oats. The mean ﬁll for the process is 510
grams (g) and the standard deviation of ﬁlls is known to equal 5 g. Four containers are selected
every hour and the mean weight of the subgroup of four weights is used to monitor the process for
special causes and to help keep the process in statistical control. Find the lower and upper control

Table 18.6 contains the widths of a product taken at 20 time periods. The control limits
for an X-bar chart are LCL ¼ 1.981 and UCL ¼ 2.018. Are there any of the subgroup means
outside the control limits?
SOLUTION
The means for the 20 subgroups are 1.9896, 1.9974, 2.0032, 1.9916, 2.0014, 1.9890, 1.9942, 1.9952,
2.0058, 2.0066, 1.9964, 1.9928, 2.0024, 1.9974, 2.0106, 2.0230, 1.9926, 1.9948, 2.0012, and 2.0044,
respectively. The sixteenth mean, 2.0230, is outside the upper control limit. All others are within the control
limits.
18.3
Refer to Problem 18.2. It was determined that a spill occurred on the shop ﬂoor just before
the sixteenth subgroup was selected. This subgroup was eliminated and the control limits were
re-computed and found to be LCL ¼ 1.979 and UCL ¼ 2.017. Are there any of the means other
than the mean for subgroup 16 outside the new limits.
SOLUTION
None of the means given in Problem 18.2 other than the sixteenth one fall outside the new limits.
Assuming that the new chart does not fail any of the other tests for special causes given in table 18.3, the
control limits given in this problem could be used to monitor the process.
18.4
Verify the control limits given in Problem 18.2. Estimate the standard deviation of the process by
pooling the 20 sample variances.
SOLUTION
The mean of the 100 sample observations is 1.999. One way to ﬁnd the pooled variance for the
20 samples is to treat the 20 samples, each consisting of 5 observations, as a one-way classiﬁcation.
The within or error mean square is equal to the pooled variance of the 20 samples. The MINITAB analysis
as a one-way design gave the following analysis of variance table.

TESTS FOR SPECIAL CAUSES
18.5
Table 18.7 contains data from 20 subgroups, each of size 5. The X-bar chart is given in Fig. 18-7.
What eﬀect did a change to a new supplier at time period 10 have on the process? Which test for
special causes in Table 18.3 did the process fail?
SOLUTION
The control chart in Fig. 18-7 shows that the change to the new supplier caused an increase in the width.
This shift after time period 10 is apparent. The 6 shown on the graph in Fig. 18-7 indicates test 6 given in
Table 18.3 was failed. Four out of ﬁve points were more than 1 sigma from the centerline (same side).
The ﬁve points correspond to subgroups 4 through 8.

PROCESS CAPABILITY
18.6
Refer to Problem 18.2. After determining that a special cause was associated with subgroup 16,
we eliminate this subgroup. The mean width is estimated by ﬁnding the mean of the data from the
other 19 subgroups and the standard deviation is estimated by ﬁnding the standard deviation
of the same data. If the speciﬁcation limits are LSL ¼ 1.960 and USL ¼ 2.040, ﬁnd the lower
capability index, the upper capability index, and the CPK index.

Refer to Problem 18.1. (a) Find the percentage nonconforming if LSL ¼ 495 and USL ¼ 525.
(b) Find the percentage nonconforming if LSL ¼ 490 and USL ¼ 530.
SOLUTION
(a)
Assuming the ﬁlls are normally distributed, the area under the normal curve below the LSL is found by
using the EXCEL command ¼NORMDIST(495,510,5,1) which gives 0.001350. By symmetry, the
area under the normal curve above the USL is also 0.001350. The total area outside the speciﬁcation
limits is 0.002700. The ppm nonconforming is 0.002700(1,000,000) ¼ 2700.

The lower control limit is 0:00613  0:01047 ¼ 0:00434, and is taken to equal 0, since proportions
cannot be negative. The upper control limit is 0:00613 þ 0:01047 ¼ 0:0166. The proportion of defectives on
day 17 is equal to P17 ¼ 10=500 ¼ 0:02 and is the only daily proportion to exceed the upper limit.

. The centerline is np ¼ 3:067.
The lower limit is 0 and the upper limit is 8.304.
18.10 Suppose respirator masks are packaged in either boxes of 25 or 50 per box. At each 30 minute
interval during a shift a box is randomly chosen and the number of defectives in the box deter-
mined. The box may either contain 25 or 50 masks. The number checked per shift will vary
between 400 and 800. The data are shown in Table 18.9. Use MINITAB to ﬁnd the control
chart for the proportion defective.
SOLUTION
When the sample sizes vary in monitoring a process for defectives, the centerline remains the same, that
is, it is the proportion of defectives over all samples. The standard deviation, however, changes from sample
to sample and gives control limits consisting of stair-stepped control limits. The control limits are

18.11 When measurements are expensive, data are available at a slow rate, or when output at any
point is fairly homogeneous, an individuals chart with moving range may be indicated. The
data consist of single measurements taken at diﬀerent points in time. The centerline is
the mean of all the individual measurements, and variation is estimated by using moving
ranges. Traditionally, moving ranges have been calculated by subtracting adjacent data
values and taking the absolute value of the result. Table 18.10 gives the coded breaking
strength measurements of an expensive cable used in aircraft. One cable per day is selected
from the production process and tested. Give the MINITAB-generated individuals chart and
interpret the output.

SOLUTION
The following pull-down menus are used: Stats ! Control charts ! individuals.
Figure 18-9 shows the individuals chart for the data in Table 18.10. The individual values in
Table 18.10 are plotted on the control chart. The 2 that is shown on the control chart for weeks 9 and
18 corresponds to the second test for special causes given in Table 18.3. This indication of a special
cause corresponds to nine points in a row on the same side of the centerline. An increase in the process
temperature at time period 10 resulted in an increase in breaking strength. This change in breaking
strength resulted in points below the centerline prior to period 10 and mostly above the centerline after
period 10.
18.12 The
exponentially
weighted
moving
average,
EWMA
chart
is
used
to
detect
small
shifts from a target value, t. The points on the EWMA chart are given by the following
equation:
^xi ¼ wxi þ ð1  wÞ^xi1
To illustrate the use of this equation, suppose the data in Table 18.7 were selected from a
process that has target value equal to 2.000. The stating value ^x0 is chosen to equal the target
value, 2.000. The weight w is usually chosen to be between 0.10 and 0.30. MINITAB
uses
the
value
0.20
as
a
default.
The
ﬁrst
point
on
the
EWMA
chart
would
be
^x1 ¼ w x1 þð1  wÞ ^x0 ¼ 0:20ð1:9896Þ þ 0:80ð2:000Þ ¼ 1:9979. The second point on the chart
would be
^x2 ¼ w x2 þð1  wÞ ^x1 ¼ 0:20ð1:9974Þ þ 0:80ð1:9979Þ ¼ 1:9978, and so forth. The
MINITAB analysis is obtained by using the following pull-down menu Stat ! Control charts
! EWMA. The target value is supplied to MINITAB. The output is shown in Fig. 18-10.
By referring to Fig. 18-10, determine for which subgroups the process shifted from the target
value.
SOLUTION
The graph of the ^xi values crosses the upper control limit at the time point 15. This is the point at which
we would conclude that the process had shifted away from the target value. Note that the EWMA chart has
stair-stepped control limits.

18.13
A zone chart is divided into four zones. Zone 1 is deﬁned as values within 1 standard deviation of
the mean, zone 2 is deﬁned as values between 1 and 2 standard deviations of the mean, zone 3 is
deﬁned as values between 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean, and zone 4 as values 3 or more
standard deviations from the mean. The default weights assigned to the zones by MINITAB are
0, 2, 4, and 8 for zones 1 through 4. Weights for points on the same side of the centerline are
added. When a cumulative sum is equal to or greater than the weight assigned to zone 4, this
is taken as a signal that the process is out of control. The cumulative sum is set equal to 0
after signaling a process out of control, or when the next plotted point crosses the centerline.
Figure 18-11 shows the MINITAB analysis using a zone chart for the data in Table 18.6.
The pull-down menus needed to produce this chart are Stat ! Control charts ! Zone. What
out of control points does the zone chart ﬁnd?
SOLUTION
Subgroup 16 corresponds to an out of control point. The zone score corresponding to subgroup 16 is 10,
and since this exceeds the score assigned to zone 4, this locates an out of control time period in the process.

18.14 When we are concerned with the number of nonconformities or defects in a product rather than
simply determining whether the product is defective or nondefective, we use a C-chart or a
U-chart. When using these charts, it is important to deﬁne an inspection unit. The inspection
unit is deﬁned as the ﬁxed unit of output to be sampled and examined for nonconformities. When
there is only one inspection unit per sample, the C-chart is used; when the number of inspection
units per sample varies, the U-chart is used.
One area of application for C- and U-charts is in the manufacture of roll products such as
paper, ﬁlms, plastics, textiles, and so forth. Nonconformities or defects, such as the occurrence of
black spots in photographic ﬁlm, as well as the occurrence of ﬁber bundles, dirt spots, pinholes,
static electricity marks, agglomerates in various other roll products, always occur at some level in
the manufacture of roll products. The purpose of the C- or U-chart is to make sure that the
process output remains within an acceptable level of occurrence of such nonconformities.
These nonconformities often occur randomly and independently of one another over the total
area of the roll product. In such cases, the Poisson distribution is used to form the control chart.
The centerline for the C-chart is located at c, the mean number of nonconformities over all
subgroups. The standard deviation of the Poisson distribution is
ﬃﬃﬃc
p
and therefore the 3 sigma
control limits are c  3
ﬃﬃﬃc
p
. That is, the lower limit is LCL ¼ c  3
ﬃﬃﬃc
p
and the upper limit is
UCL ¼ c þ 3
ﬃﬃﬃc
p .
When a coating is applied to a material, small nonconformities called agglomerates
sometimes occur. The number of agglomerates in a length of 5 feet (ft) are recorded for a
jumbo roll of product. The results for 24 such rolls are given in Table 18.11. Are there any points
outside the 3-sigma control limits?
SOLUTION
The mean number of agglomerates per jumbo roll is equal to the total number of agglomerates divided
by 24 or c ¼ 117=24 ¼ 4:875. The standard deviation is
ﬃﬃﬃc
p ¼ 2:208. The lower control limit is
LCL ¼ 4:875  3ð2:208Þ ¼ 1:749. Since it is negative, we take the lower limit to be 0. The upper limit is
UCL ¼ 4.875 þ 3(2.208) or 11.499. An out of control condition is indicated for jumbo roll # 20 since the
number of agglomerates, 13, exceeds the upper control limit, 11.499.
18.15 This problem is a follow up to Problem 18.14. You should review 18.14 before attempting this
problem. Table 18.12 gives the data for 20 Jumbo rolls. The table gives the roll number, the length
of roll inspected for agglomerates, the number of inspection units (recall from Problem 18.14 that
5 ft constitutes an inspection unit), the number of agglomerates found in the length inspected, and
the number of agglomerates per inspection unit. The centerline for the U-chart is u, the sum of
column 4 divided by the sum of column 3. The standard deviation, however, changes from sample
to sample and gives control limits consisting of stair-stepped control limits. The lower
control limit for sample i is LCL ¼ u  3
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
u=ni
p
and the upper control limit for sample i is
UCL ¼ u þ 3

using the control limits given in Problem 18.18. The new data are given in Table 18.15. Does it appear that
the variability has been reduced? If the variability has been reduced, ﬁnd new control limits for the X-bar

PROCESS CAPABILITY
18.21
Suppose the speciﬁcation limits for the frozen food packages in Problem 18.17 are LSL ¼ 450 g and
USL ¼ 458 g. Use the estimates of m and  obtained in Problem 18.17 to ﬁnd CPK. Also estimate the ppm
not meeting the speciﬁcations.
18.22
In Problem 18.21, compute CPK and estimate the ppm nonconforming after the modiﬁcations made in
Problem 18.19 have been made.
P- AND NP-CHARTS
18.23
A Company produces fuses for automobile electrical systems. Five hundred of the fuses are tested
per day for 30 days. Table 18.17 gives the number of defective fuses found per day for the 30 days.
Determine the centerline and the upper and lower control limits for a P-chart. Does the process
appear to be in statistical control? If the process is in statistical control, give a point estimate for the ppm
defective rate.
18.24
Suppose in Problem 18.23, the fuse manufacturer decided to use an NP-chart rather than a P-chart. Find the
centerline and the upper and lower control limits for the chart.
18.25

OTHER CONTROL CHARTS
18.26
Review Problem 18.11 prior to working this problem. Hourly readings of the temperature of an oven, used
for bread making, are obtained for 24 hours. The baking temperature is critical to the process and the oven is
operated constantly during each shift. The data are shown in Table 18.19. An individual chart is used to help
monitor the temperature of the process. Find the centerline and the moving ranges corresponding to using
adjacent pairs of measurements. How are the control limits found?
18.27
Review Problem 18.12 prior to working this problem. Use MINITAB to construct a EWMA chart
for the data in Table 18.14. Using a target value of 454 g, what does the chart indicate concerning the
process?
18.28
Review the discussion of a zone chart in Problem 18.13 before working this problem. Construct a zone chart
for the data in Table 18.16. Does the zone chart indicate any out of control conditions? What shortcoming of
the zone chart does this problem show?

18.30	 A Pareto chart is a special form of bar chart. It is a tool used by researchers to prioritize problems for 
solution. It was named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923). The bars of the Pareto 
chart are arranged in descending order. A Pareto chart for the data in Table 1.1 is shown in Fig. 18-13. The 
curve above the histogram is the cumulative curve of frequencies. The curve starts at a count of 15, or 30% 
(15 out of 50 is 30%), above the response “Fell from lap.” The curve continues and, above the tick mark 
for “Immersed in liquid,” it passes through 29, or 58%. This means that the responses “Fell from lap” and 
“Immersed in liquid” were given 29 times, or 58% of the time. The curve continues in this manner. The 
pull down Stat ⇒ Quality Tools ⇒ Pareto Chart is used to produce the Pareto chart shown in Fig. 18.13.

The pull-down ‘‘Statistics ) Randomness/Normality Tests ) Normality Probability Plot’’ leads to
the following plot. If the data are from a normally distributed population, the points in the plot tend
to fall along a straight line and P(W) tends to be larger than 0.05. If P(W)50.05, generally normality
is rejected.
The normal probability plot is shown above. The Shapiro–Wilk statistic along with the p-value
is shown. P(W) ¼ 0.7360. Since the p-value is considerably larger than 0.05, normality of the data is not
rejected.

The following histogram of the test scores in Table 7.11, produced by STATISTIX, has a U-shape. Hence,
it is called a U-shape distribution.

The normal probability plot is shown above. The Shapiro–Wilk statistic along with the p-value is shown.
P(W) ¼ 0.0034. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, normality of the data is rejected.
7.79
In addition to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in MINITAB and the Shapiro–Wilk test in STATISTIX, there
are two other tests of normality that we shall discuss that are available for testing for normality. They are
the Ryan–Joiner and the Anderson–Darling tests. Basically all four calculate a test statistic and each test
statistic has a p-value associated with it. Generally, the following rule is used. If the p-value is 50.05,
normality is rejected. The following graphic is given when doing the Anderson–Darling test. In this
case, the p-value is 0.006 and I would reject the null hypothesis that the data came from a normal
distribution.

The hypothesis cannot be rejected at either level.
12.27
The conclusion is the same as before.
12.28
The new instructor is not following the grade pattern of the others. (The fact that the grades happen to be
better than average may be due to better teaching ability or lower standards, or both.)

12.29
There is no reason to reject the hypothesis that the coins are fair.

There is no reason to reject the hypothesis at either level.
12.31
(a) 10, 60, and 50, respectively;
(b) the hypothesis that the results are the same as those expected cannot be rejected at the 0.05 level.
12.32
The diﬀerence is signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level.
12.33
(a) The ﬁt is good; (b) no.
12.34
(a) The ﬁt is ‘‘too good’’; (b) the ﬁt is poor at the 0.05 level.
12.35
(a) The ﬁt is very poor at the 0.05 level; since the binomial distribution gives a good ﬁt of the data, this is
consistent with Problem 12.33.
(b) The ﬁt is good, but not ‘‘too good.’’
12.36
The hypothesis can be rejected at the 0.05 level, but not at the 0.01 level.
12.37
The conclusion is the same as before.

The p-value is called sig. in SPSS. The p-value for blocks is 0.640 and the p-value for the type of
corn is 0.011, which is less than 0.05 and is therefore signiﬁcant. There is no diﬀerence in the blocks at
the 0.05 level. There are diﬀerences in the yield due to the type of corn at the 0.05 level. The SPSS analysis
is as follows.

In the following SPSS output, the p-value is called Sig. The p-value for hair is 0.453 and the p-value for
height is 0.260. These are the same p-values obtained in the EXCEL analysis in Problem 16.33. Since neither
of these are less than 0.01, they are not diﬀerent at level of signiﬁcance 0.01. That is, the scores are not
diﬀerent for diﬀerent hair colors nor are they diﬀerent for diﬀerent heights.

For a two-tailed alternative, the p-value is 0.0352. There is a diﬀerence due to the additive at the 0.05 level,
but not at the 0.01 level. The p-value is obtained using the binomial distribution and not the normal
approximation to the binomial.
17.27
For a one-tailed alternative, the p-value is 0.0176. Since this p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null
hypothesis that there is no diﬀerence due to the additive.
17.28
The p-value using EXCEL, is given by ¼1 - BINOMDIST(24,31,0.5,1) or 0.00044.
The program is eﬀective at the 0.05 level of signiﬁcance.
17.29
The p-value using EXCEL, is given by ¼1 - BINOMDIST(15,22,0.5,1) or 0.0262.
The program is eﬀective at the 0.05 level.
17.30
The p-value using EXCEL, is given by ¼1 - BINOMDIST(16,25,0.5,1) or 0.0539.

18.27
The EWMA chart indicates that the process means are consistently below the target value. The means for
subgroups 12 and 13 drop below the lower control limits. The subgroup means beyond 13 are above the
lower control limit; however, the process mean is still consistently below the target value.
18.28
A zone chart does not indicate any out of control conditions. However, as seen in Problem 19.20, there are
14 points in a row alternating up and down. Because of the way the zone chart operates, it will not indicate
this condition.
