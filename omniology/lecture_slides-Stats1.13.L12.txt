General Linear Model (GLM) 
•  GLM is the mathematical framework used 
in many common statistical analyses, 
including multiple regression and ANOVA 
– ANOVA is typically presented as distinct from 
multiple regression but it IS a multiple 
regression

Characteristics of GLM 
•  Linear: pairs of variables are assumed to 
have linear relations 
•  Additive: if one set of variables predict 
another variable, the effects are thought to 
be additive 
5 
Characteristics of GLM 
•  BUT! This does not preclude testing non-
linear or non-additive effects  
6 
Characteristics of GLM 
•  GLM can accommodate such tests, for 
example, by 
•  Transformation of variables 
–  Transform so non-linear becomes linear 
•  Moderation analysis 
–  Fake the GLM into testing non-additive effects 
7 
GLM example 
•  Simple regression 
•  Y = B0 + B1X1 + e 
•  Y = faculty salary 
•  X1 = years since PhD

GLM example 
•  Multiple regression 
•  Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + e 
•  Y = faculty salary 
•  X1 = years since PhD 
•  X2 = number of publications 
•  X3 = (years x pubs) 
9 
GLM example 
•  One-way ANOVA 
•  Y = B0 + B1X1 + e 
 
•  Y = faculty salary 
•  X1 = gender 
10 
GLM example 
•  Factorial ANOVA 
•  Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3X3 + e 
 
•  Y = faculty salary 
•  X1 = gender 
•  X2 = race 
•  X3 = interaction (gender x race) 
 
11 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
•  Appropriate when the predictors (IVs) are 
all categorical and the outcome (DV) is 
continuous 
– Most common application is to analyze data 
from randomized experiments 
12

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
•  More specifically, randomized experiments 
that generate more than 2 means 
– If only 2 means then use: 
•  Independent t-test 
•  Dependent t-test 
13 
General Linear Model (GLM) 
•  GLM is the mathematical framework used 
in many common statistical analyses, 
including multiple regression and ANOVA 
– ANOVA is typically presented as distinct from 
multiple regression but it IS a multiple 
regression

Characteristics of GLM 
•  Linear: pairs of variables are assumed to 
have linear relations 
•  Additive: if one set of variables predict 
another variable, the effects are thought to

Dummy coding 
•  A system to code categorical predictors in 
a regression analysis 
Dummy coding 
•  Example  
– IV: Area of research in a Psychology 
department 
•  Cognitive  
•  Clinical 
•  Developmental  
•  Social 
– DV: Number of publications
