●
A Boolean expression is a logical statement that is either True or False 
●
There are 3 boolean or logical operators in Python: and, or and not
●
The boolean and operator returns True if both expressions are True. If any expression is 
False the entire expression is evaluated to False.
●
The Boolean or operator returns True if any operand is True. It will return False only if 
both expressions evaluate to False.
●
The not operator will simply negate the “expression truth value”.
