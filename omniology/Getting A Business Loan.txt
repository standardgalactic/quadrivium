Introduction
Looking back, there were many times early in my career when the 
information in this book would have been invaluable as I struggled to fund 
my Main Street business ambitions. Hopefully, this will help you fuel yours.
In the first few chapters, I talk about finding the right bank and the right 
banker. I explain what to look for and how to foster the kind of relationship 
that gives loan officers a reason to make small business loan decisions based 
upon something more than your credit score. I’m a big supporter of the 
role community banks play within the Main Street business infrastructure. 
Although their numbers are dwindling, there are still many looking to 
partner with the small business community in their community to build 
strong local economies.
No discussion on small business lending would be complete without 
mentioning the Small Business Administration (SBA), which you can find in 
Chapter 5 of this book. Although the SBA loan guarantee program might 
not be the biggest source of small business capital, it is an important source 
and accounts for approximately $30 billion annually.
The remaining chapters discuss equity funding sources, like angels and 
venture capital, and other options like factoring, the merchant cash advance, 
and specialty loan products designed specifically for small business owners. 
If you’ve been into the bank and been turned down for a small business loan, 
you’re not alone. But you still have options. In this book, you learn what 
those options are, where to find them, and how to evaluate if they’re right 
for you and your small business. Over the last few years, non-traditional or 
alternative lenders have done a great job of filling the vacuum left behind by 
banks looking for greener pastures. As more and more such lenders enter 
the market, interest rates will continue to come down with the increased 
competition. Anything that makes access to capital easier for Main Street 
should be considered a good thing.
Regardless, if you persist in your quest for growth capital or simply want 
a solid line of credit to help you plug the cash shortfalls all businesses 
experience, you will find the money you need. As you’ll see, some deals 
are better than others, and some—the ones to avoid—are too good to be 
true. And there’ll be trade-offs regarding fees, collateral, and interest rates. 
Use this book to uncover options and don’t give up. That’s the American 
business spirit. Good luck!

Funding the 
American 
Dream
10 Percent Just Isn’t Good Enough
Every day, Main Street business owners wrestle with the challenges of 
finding the cash they need to finance growth or to use as working capital. 
Banks want a credit score of 720, three to five good years in business, 
and a fat savings account.
My small business career started as a 16-year-old driving the delivery 
truck for my father’s small industrial supply business. “If I had that,” he 
would say about the banker’s requirements, “I wouldn’t need a business 
loan.” 
Financing a Main Street business isn’t easy. Only 10% of loan applications 
made at the bank actually get approved, making it difficult for many small 
business owners to thrive and grow. Ironically, politicians like to talk about 
how important small business is to the economy. They just don’t put their 
money where their mouths are.
In fairness to Uncle Sam, part of the problem is how the government 
defines exactly what makes up a small business. What the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) defines as a small business and what you and I might 
describe as a small business are likely not the same thing.

What Is a Small Business?
This is how the SBA1 defines a small business:
• 
Manufacturing: Maximum number of employees may 
range from 500 to 1,500, depending on the type of 
product manufactured.
• 
Wholesaling: Maximum number of employees may 
range from 100 to 500, depending on the particular 
product being provided.
• 
Services: Annual receipts may not exceed $2.5 to 
$21.5 million, depending on the particular product 
being provided.
• 
Retailing: Annual receipts may not exceed $5.0 to 
$21.0 million, depending on the particular product 
being provided.
• 
General and heavy construction: General construction 
annual receipts may not exceed $13.5 to $17 million, 
depending on the type of construction.
• 
Special trade construction: Annual receipts may not 
exceed $7 million.
• 
Agriculture: Annual receipts may not exceed $0.5 to 
$9.0 million, depending on the agricultural product.
No wonder it’s so confusing. I’ve spent the last 30 or so years of my 
career in small business. I’ve worked in organizations with half a dozen or 
so employees in addition to a software company with over 240 employ-
ees. They were both very different animals; the latter felt more like a big 
business to me. Yet, the SBA considers them both “small” businesses.
Although I don’t want to get into an argument over semantics, I’m con-
vinced that when politicians are on the news talking about how they want 
to help small business, they aren’t talking about the same folks you and I 
think of as small businesses or small business owners.
My first job in a small business, working with my dad, was decidedly differ-
ent from working in a software company with nearly 250 employees.
Most of us identify with the small businesses on Main Street—the local 
restaurant, the barbershop around the corner, the dry cleaner, and the  
local plumber. Main Street businesses are decidedly different from the

concern

multimillion-dollar software company or widget manufacturer in the 
office building or industrial park off the freeway, even though they may 
have started out as small businesses.
Why Does Main Street Matter?
Collectively, Main Street hires a lot of people.
Although Main Street may not be the biggest employer in your area, or 
in the nation for that matter, collectively a lot of people depend on small 
businesses for jobs. That’s why politicians like to talk about small business 
owners so much.
When they talk about small businesses, what they really should be talking 
about is job creation, which is where small businesses really shine.
A 2010 study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, 
“Who Creates Jobs? Small vs. Large vs. Young,”2 suggests, “The younger 
companies are, the more jobs they create, regardless of their size.”
With that in mind, I find it ironic, from a jobs-creation standpoint, that 
although they are at the very fountain of job creation (something that 
politicians on both sides of the aisle claim they want to promote), these 
small businesses fail to qualify for loans at most banks. Is it possible to cre-
ate an environment in which young companies can thrive (and sometimes 
fail and struggle), create jobs (which they do best), and ultimately blossom 
into thriving enterprises?
“When politicians criticize government for small-business-stran-
gling regulation, they’re being disingenuous,” writes Gary Belsky in his 
Entrepreneurship column for TIME Business.3 “Most small businesses fail 
to grow because that’s the nature of the beast. What you want, from 
a jobs-creation perspective, is government to foster an environment in 
which starting a business—period—is easy. It’s a numbers game really; 
since most small businesses will fail or stall, you want to throw as many 
ideas on the pavement as possible so that the small percentage of startups 
that thrive is part of an increasing pool of new companies. The success 
rate may not change, but the absolute number of successes will.”
Although I don’t think there are any simple answers to the financing needs 
of Main Street business owners, I think it’s time politicians start thinking

in terms of creating a more “Main Street”–friendly environment so even 
companies that aren’t sexy SaaS4 startups in Silicon Valley have access to 
capital.
Belsky suggests that instead of arguing over who is more supportive of 
small businesses or harping about regulations, maybe it’s time politicians 
on both sides of the aisle “should explain how they’d help wannabe entre-
preneurs take the big leap. Because the more of those folks we can guide 
from fantasy to reality, the more jobs we’ll create down the line.”
I couldn’t have said it better myself.
What Would You Do with an Extra $40,000?
In a paper published by the University of Tennessee’s Rob Holland, he cites 
a Dun & Bradstreet report that claims, “…businesses with fewer than  
20 employees have only a 37% chance of surviving four years (in business) 
and only a 9% chance of surviving 10 years.”5 A lack of funding is part of 
what causes many small businesses to struggle and ultimately fail.
Several years ago, I started a small business providing digital prepress ser-
vices to professional portrait photographers. Our little business provided 
valuable color-correction and retouching services to a number of profes-
sional photographers in our market. If we prepared their digital files for 
printing, they received a discount for printing at one of the local labs.
We had loyal customers and were very busy, but as we started our third 
year of business, we were having cash flow problems. An extra $8,000 to 
$10,000 would have made all the difference in the world to us. But I had 
tapped out my personal savings and credit cards to keep things going and 
couldn’t get a business loan from the bank. Because we weren’t a sexy 
tech startup, equity funding was out of the question.
I eventually had to close shop. Telling my three employees we were done 
was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. I’ve since spoken with 
many entrepreneurs trying to keep a Main Street business alive who faced 
the same dilemma. Some survived; some did not.
Although financing woes weren’t the only cause of my company’s demise, 
a lack of adequate working capital kills many small businesses, just like 
mine, every year. We didn’t close our doors because we didn’t have cus-
tomers or business—we had more work than we could do with the staff

we had. I was often in the office until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. in those days.  
I can’t count how many times my wife called around midnight to see  
if I was coming home or to ask if I needed her to bring me a sleeping bag. 
(The fact that I hadn’t taken a regular paycheck during that time made the 
late hours particularly annoying to the rest of my family.)
Fortunately, there are a lot more options now for small business owners 
looking for financing.
What’s more, don’t forget that Main Street business startups all across the 
country are collectively creating a lot of jobs. My three employees were 
part of that job-creation statistic. Main Street needs capital to grow and 
create jobs. The more options for financing they have, the stronger they’ll 
make our communities and the more jobs they’ll be able to create.
There Are Other Financing Options
Most small business owners have no other choice but to bootstrap 
their businesses to get them going. Finding investors for most Main 
Street businesses carries about the same odds as this 53-year-old beating 
Olympic Gold Medalist Usain Bolt in the 100-yard dash. It just isn’t going 
to happen.
Like my dad and thousands of other entrepreneurs, I turned to a second 
mortgage and credit cards to get my business off the ground. Fortunately, 
many small business owners today have other options to fund work-
ing capital or finance growth. Although bankers are still a critical part 
of small business financing, business owners aren’t as dependent on them. 
Banks are no longer the only place to find the money needed to develop 
new products and services, grow, and hire people.
Note
■
■
  You have many more options than bank financing to get money to grow, add 
employees, or launch new initiatives. This book outlines them all.
For many entrepreneurs, the aversion to alternative, unfamiliar funding 
sources can be more of a handicap than hearing “no” from the bank. The 
coming chapters cover in detail some of those options. In the meantime, 
here is a list of just a few of the alternative loan options available to small 
business owners (even if they have less than perfect credit, haven’t been in 
business for three to five years, and don’t have a big bankroll):
• 
Accounts receivable (AR)/purchase order (PO) financing: 
Many small business owners can leverage their AR or 
a current PO for short-term working capital loans.

Chapter 1 | Funding the American Dream

• 
Cash advance or merchant cash advance: Small busi-
nesses with regular credit card transactions can bor-
row against future earnings. Repayment is made by a 
daily withdrawal from the business merchant account. 
Repayment terms are typically six months to a year.
• 
Commercial real estate loans: These loans are based 
upon the value of the real estate offered as collateral 
and can include office buildings, warehouse space, 
retail storefronts, industrial facilities, and stand-alone 
buildings.
• 
Equipment financing: When you finance equipment 
to be used exclusively for the business, the equip-
ment purchased is considered collateral for the loan. 
Although equipment financing is used exclusively 
to acquire business-use equipment, it is sometimes  
used to obtain cash by borrowing against business 
equipment you already own.
• 
Franchise loans: Franchise loans are similar to common 
business and commercial loans, but they are designed 
to finance the purchase of a franchise that can dem-
onstrate an established history of profitability.
• 
Peer-to-peer loans: Individuals with money to invest for 
profit participate in P2P lending networks and offer 
loans to those who may not qualify elsewhere.
• 
SBA microloans: The Small Business Administration 
Microloan program provides very small loans to new 
businesses or for small business growth. The lenders 
are non-profit organizations that offer government 
funding in specific U.S. counties.
Although some banks and credit unions offer alternative financing options 
to their customers, a willingness to step outside of the bank or credit union 
is where small business owners will likely find this type of financing.
Amazon.com and Small Business Financing
A resourceful small business owner can find alternative financing in what 
just a few short years ago would have been considered unconventional 
places.
For example, many of the merchants that are part of the Amazon mar-
ketplace are small and lack the capital of larger retailers. “Small merchants 
who generally lack capital to buy the inventory they would like to sell can

apply for loans through the service [Amazon Lending],” reports Great 
Speculations (a team of MIT engineers and Wall Street analysts) via Forbes.6 
“The merchant whose application is approved would have the funds trans-
ferred to his/her Amazon Seller Account. After that, a monthly payment 
will be taken out of their account until the loan gets paid off.”
As with most non-traditional financing, the interest rate is a little higher 
than what you might expect from a bank (13%), but then again, it’s pos-
sible some of these small business owners wouldn’t qualify for a bank 
loan. Amazon Lending approves loans within four days and stipulates that 
the capital be deployed solely for the Amazon sales channel, but I applaud 
Amazon for seeing a need among their online venders and coming up with 
a creative solution to keep the wheels of e-commerce turning.
The Great Speculations group postulates that this could lure sellers from 
eBay and increase online sales as merchants list more items for sale with 
increased capital at their disposal. This sounds like a good option for 
Amazon’s merchants and good deal for Amazon.
Although banks and credit unions still provide traditional small business 
lending, Main Street business owners are finding alternatives (like this pro-
gram at Amazon) very attractive. The challenge is making the right con-
nection to the lender best suited to the financing needs of the business.
Small Business Isn’t for the Faint Hearted
There comes a time in the life of every small business owner when he or 
she needs more cash for working capital, expansion, or to avert a crisis. 
Mark Twain supposedly once said, “A banker is a fellow who lends you his 
umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins 
to rain.” Although the best time to get a loan is when you don’t need one, 
many of us don’t plan that far ahead. If you’re reading this book, hopefully 
that isn’t the case for you.
The challenge of keeping customers, employees, and spouses happy (all at 
the same time) is no small feat. Hopefully you will find the following pages 
helpful to keep the wheels of your small business turning. The Chinese 
master Lao Tzu said, “The journey of a thousand miles begins with the 
first step.” Since most small business owners start with a trip to the bank  
(or credit union), this book starts there too.

Plan of the Book
Building a good working relationship with your banker is critical. I talk 
about how to get off on the right foot, how to prepare for your visit to 
the bank, when it’s time to pop the question (ask for a loan), and how to 
make sure you get the right loan for your needs.
Figuring out what loan products are offered by the SBA is no small task 
either. I talk about what it takes to qualify, where to apply for a loan, and 
some of the things you can do to improve your chances of getting an SBA 
loan.
As mentioned, the harsh reality of financing a small business is that 
only 10% of business owners who make the trip to the bank get a loan. 
Although leaving the familiar world of the bank waiting room might feel 
a little like leaving Kansas, I talk about the other options that are avail-
able in what might feel like Oz.
No discussion of funding a business venture would be complete without 
talking about angels, venture capital, and the myth of the shark tank, but I 
won’t stop there. I talk about finding investors, how to evaluate if you’re a 
good fit for VC funding, and what most venture capitalists want in return.
If it doesn’t look like you’re a fit for equity funding (a fancy term for 
taking money from a venture capitalist and the associated requirement to 
share equity that goes along with it), you learn how to make an honest 
evaluation of your situation and where to go from there. I cover a number 
of non-traditional financing options in detail, including where and how to 
apply, what to expect, and how to prepare. I also talk about what to do 
should a crisis arise and you need cash fast.
There are no easy answers to the financing challenges faced by Main Street 
business owners, but taking that first step is the only way to start.

Building a  
Relationship 
with the Bank
Date Before You Marry
Business is personal. I once worked with a guy who didn’t think that way, 
and he worked very hard to avoid having personal relationships with his 
customers, his employees, and his vendors. That attitude didn’t serve him 
or his business very well, because doing business is a personal endeavor. 
Just like any worthwhile business relationship, the same holds true for the 
relationship with your bank. It’s important to get to know your banker.
Tip

  Get to know your banker. You’re far more likely to get help when you need it.
Many larger credit unions provide the same types of services that were 
originally provided only by banks (much to the chagrin of bankers, I might 
add). Although I refer to banks more often than credit unions in this 
chapter, most of what applies to one applies to the other. My hope is that 
neither bankers nor those who offer small business services at a credit 
union will be offended by my offhanded use of the term “bankers” to 
describe them both. (However, I know that a couple of my credit union 
friends might have a thing or two to say about it.)

When my wife and I were first married, we were members of a small 
credit union that had only a few branches. The branch manager knew and 
trusted me. Whenever I needed a little extra cash, I could easily borrow 
a couple thousand dollars against my signature. Even though these types 
of relationships don’t exist much anymore, it doesn’t mean that building a 
good relationship with your banker is any less important.
Over the years, I’ve seen countless ads from major banks in my area and 
around the country claiming that, unlike the other banks, their bank takes 
their partnership with small businesses seriously. In all honesty, over the 
years I haven’t known too many bankers who treated me as a personal 
associate, but I’ve had the chance to work with a few.
Getting to Know Your Banker
Several years ago, my partners and I decided to buy a photography supply 
business. Although it had been around for a while, it was struggling. We 
thought we could turn things around with a little time, a good dose of 
marketing, and some elbow grease. Unlike in a traditional camera store, 
our focus was less on cameras and more on the albums, film, equipment, 
backdrops, and props a professional photographer uses in the studio 
every day. We sold cameras, but it wasn’t the focus of our business. In 
many respects it was more of a B2B (business-to-business) enterprise 
than a traditional camera store.
We had a good local clientele that included the professionals in our area, 
but we also sold a lot of goods at tradeshows and industry events around 
the country. At the time, the idea of selling goods online was so new that 
we had just started to experiment with online sales. Most of our business 
was generated through the tradeshows and the other events we attended. 
In fact, there were a couple of guys on our team who spent most of their 
time on the road every month.
Because our business was so different from a traditional camera store, our 
relationship with the bank was a little different too. Our banker took the 
time to learn about our business—in fact, over the years he had become 
a photography business specialist and worked with a number of the pro-
fessional photographers in our area. I’m not sure how he stumbled into 
that particular niche, but he understood what we were doing and over 
time he became a trusted member of our team. He even made a point of 
dropping into the store on a regular basis just to say hello and see how 
we were doing. Like all small business owners, we sometimes had issues 
with cash flow and needed to increase our line of credit. I don’t remember 
ever going into the bank or jumping through hoops to increase our credit 
line. He was a real asset to us—and the only banker I’ve ever known who 
took the time to get to know our business.

I wish I could tell you there’s a secret to getting to know your banker, but 
there isn’t. I can tell you that many banks have bankers whose job it is to 
keep their small business owners happy (some even have special branches 
that cater to the needs of small businesses). So the first step to building a 
healthy and productive business relationship with your banker is to visit 
the branch and introduce yourself. In my experience, you could be waiting 
a long time if you’re waiting for the bank to reach out to you.
With that said, some bankers are taking the relationships they have with 
their small business clients seriously.

  Walk into your local bank and introduce yourself. Ask to speak to a lender. Just say  
hi and tell her about your business and that you may need her help in the near future.
It’s All About Relationships
Bob Coleman is a small business banking expert and a frequent guest on 
Fox Business news. He is oft quoted by The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, 
Forbes, CNNMoney, and The New York Times regarding small business 
financing. He also publishes a number of small business loan-underwriting 
guides in addition to a small business-lending newsletter. In his book, Money, 
Money Everywhere But Not a Drop for Main Street,1 Coleman suggests:
You can imagine how difficult it is for a lender to judge your character 
when they first eyeball you from across the desk.
The landscape is littered with businesses, Fortune 500 companies, 
corner coffee shops, and lenders that have gone bankrupt. You have 
to convince them that you are smarter than companies like General 
Motors, CIT, Lehman Brothers, and Joe’s Coffee Shop.
There are a lot of smart business owners who, for one reason or another, 
are part of the group Coleman is talking about. That’s why so many bank-
ers focus on credit score, time in business, and annual revenues. Those 
criteria are important, but your character and experience is becoming 
more and more important to many bankers. You need to make sure you 
put your best foot forward in that regard, too.

As mentioned earlier, most banks want a credit score of 650 or better, 
several years in business, and a fat bankroll before they’ll talk to you about 
a loan. However, there are some bankers who are looking for long-term 
relationships with business owners just like you.
Vicky Beaudry of First Coast Community Bank in Jacksonville, Florida 
understands what she calls the “new normal” since the financial melt-
down. She says:
I understand that every loan can be structured differently and I’m 
giving you the perspective of a community bank where we’re looking 
for the deposit relationships, merchant services, and the personal 
banking needs.
We’re trying to know that customer, know their credit, and finally their 
collateral. But make sure you get character, then collateral.2
Beaudry isn’t the only banker who takes the time to get to know her 
customers on a more personal level than their credit score and time in 
business. When you’re shopping around for a loan, I suggest you look for 
a banker who wants to build that kind of relationship with you. It should 
be an important factor in choosing a bank.
It makes sense that building a good relationship with your banker requires 
convincing him that you have good character, that you have a thriving busi-
ness, and that there is potential for your business to grow. However, the 
same is true for Mr. or Ms. Banker. It’s also up to the banker to convince 
you that a relationship with them is in your best interest. If they can’t do 
that, they likely shouldn’t be your banker.
10 Questions to Ask Your Potential Banker
Some time ago I stumbled upon this great list of questions. Because all 
banks are not created equal (particularly where small business is con-
cerned), these questions are a good way to determine if you’re in the 
right bank. Mary Goodman and Rich Russakoff, co-founders of Bottom 
Line Enterprises, originally published the list in The Money Dept column for 
BNET.3 I have adapted their list and added my own two cents.

Is the bank healthy with strong financials?
In light of the events of the last few years, I think it 
goes without saying that this isn’t a given, and cer-
tainly shouldn’t be taken lightly. Regardless of whether 
they have a fancy lobby and expensive furniture, you 
should verify the bank’s financial health. The FDIC 
(Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) doesn’t 
publish a list of troubled banks—imagine the panic 
if your bank was on the list and you and your fellow 
customers found out. However, asking the following 
questions will help you determine whether the bank 
you’re considering is in good financial shape:
Have the last 12 months been profitable?
• 
Are earnings increasing or decreasing?
• 
Are they in the middle of a merger or have they 
• 
recently been acquired?
Do they have adequate liquidity?
• 
Your banker should be willing and able to answer 
these questions to your satisfaction before you estab-
lish a relationship with him. If he can’t or won’t give 
you a straight answer, you should probably look for 
another bank and another banker.
Even when you have a long-standing relationship 
with your current bank, don’t take that relation-
ship for granted. Even some established banks are 
struggling these days. What’s more, the things they 
let small business owners get away with just a few 
short years ago (such as floating an overdrawn 
account for a couple of days), they don’t any-
more. Recent economic times have forced bank-
ers to be more dogmatic in how they enforce the  
policies listed in the fine print.

  Consider it a red flag when the loan officer won’t discuss the bank’s financial health. 
Look elsewhere for a long-term relationship.

• 
Does the bank have a business division focused on ­lending 
to small- and medium-sized companies?
Don’t take for granted that they do. Even more 
important might be determining the percentage of 
small business customers they have. One of the easi-
est ways to do this is to determine if they have a 
small business-specific listing in the phone book or 
on their website. The banker you’re interviewing (yes, 
treat this the same way you would any interview with 
a potential employee or partner) might have a bro-
chure or other literature that highlights their busi-
ness banking services.
Most banks are very “old school” when it comes 
to their marketing and advertising. In other words, 
their billboards and the type of events they sponsor 
tell you a lot about the banking customers they are 
looking for. Driving into work every day, I see sev-
eral billboards for different banks and credit unions 
advertising for small business banking customers.  
I know it’s not very high tech, but it can be a great 
way to start looking. (I offer more suggestions on 
where to find a list of potential banks later in this 
chapter.)
In my area, a certain bank has been recognized as the 
small business loan leader for several years. In the 
months before those statistics come out, they always 
push for SBA (Small Business Administration) loans. 
The number two small business lender in the area is 
one of the bigger credit unions. I’ve often wondered 
why the bank spends so much time and money in the 
month or two leading up to the ranking trying to con-
vince small business owners to borrow at their bank, 
and the credit union doesn’t. Maybe number two is 
doing a better job of consistently providing great busi-
ness services and small business lending throughout 
the year. If I were looking for a new banking relation-
ship in this market, I might check out number two.
If you can’t find the information you’re looking for any-
where else, it never hurts to ask the banker whether 
small business banking is one of their specialties.

• 
Is the bank on the SBA’s current list of top small business 
lenders?
Information on the top SBA lenders in the country 
is available from the Small Business Administration,4 
which also provides a downloadable PDF of the top 
lenders in every state.5 Goodman and Russakoff also 
recommend Entrepreneur magazine’s list of the Best 
Banks for Entrepreneurs.6
• 
Is the bank familiar with your industry?
Although you might think that one small business 
relationship or loan is the same as any other, they 
are different. My partners and I enjoyed the bene-
fits of a banking partner who understood our busi-
ness. Because every industry is a little bit different, 
some banks and bankers focus on particular types of 
small businesses. When looking for a loan or other 
financial services, it’s not unreasonable to expect the 
banker or loan officer to be able to answer your 
industry-specific banking questions, as well as tell you 
how she will provide better services to your business 
than another financial institution. If she can’t do this, 
ask for a recommendation of a bank or credit union 
in your area that knows your industry. (Most local 
bankers have a pretty good handle on their competi-
tors and are usually willing to help you find a match.) 
In very small markets, the local bank might have to 
be a jack-of-all-trades. In this case, you may need to 
look outside your local market to find the right bank.  
I know several software companies local to my area, 
for example, with banking relationships in Silicon 
Valley because they feel that a Bay Area bank better 
understands their industry. Don’t be afraid to bank 
out of town if that best suits your needs.

• 
Does the bank offer the mix of services and products  
you want?
Depending on the business you’re in, you’ll likely want 
merchant services, a checking account, and maybe 
even a business credit card. But don’t stop there. You 
may also want a line of credit or access to capital via 
a real estate loan or equipment financing. Depending 
on the type of business and the industry you’re in, 
some banking services are more important than oth-
ers. Don’t be afraid to ask about the services you 
think you’ll need before you need them. Finding out 
too late that your bank doesn’t offer the particular 
services you need can handicap your success.
• 
Does your desired loan amount fit within the bank’s lend-
ing limits?
I’m going to assume, since you are reading this book, 
that one of your primary objectives is to learn how 
to best obtain financing for working capital or funding 
growth. It’s reasonable and smart to ask your poten-
tial banker about the average loan size his bank offers 
small businesses. This is even more important when 
you consider what your future needs might be as 
your business grows. Will this bank be able to grow 
with you as your needs increase?
Some smaller banks have ceilings on how much they 
can loan any one business. I know a business owner 
who had great credit, had been with the same bank 
for several years, and had successfully paid off sev-
eral small loans over the course of doing business 
with that bank, but couldn’t get financing because the 
new loan would exceed the ceiling his bank lends any 
single business. He had to look elsewhere for financ-
ing and ultimately ended up going through the pain of 
finding a new banker because his current bank wasn’t 
big enough to accommodate his needs.
• 
Is the decision-maker someone you can meet with?
When the time comes to secure a loan, will you be 
able to meet with the bank officers who ultimately 
make the lending decisions? Of course, this is no 
guarantee that you’ll get the loan, but it doesn’t hurt 

Getting a Business Loan
17
to know the bank president or other senior execu-
tives who can vouch for you and your relationship 
with the bank. As mentioned earlier, most banks are 
more interested in your credit score, years in busi-
ness, and your account balance, but there are bank-
ers like Ms. Beaudry who consider reputation and 
character just as important as credit score. (This is 
particularly true with smaller banks, where the bank 
president makes it a point to know all of her small 
business customers.)
• 
Is the banker willing to meet with you at your company?
I would have never known this was a big deal until I 
had a banker who regularly met with us at our place of 
business. If the only thing your banker does to under-
stand your business is look at your balance sheet, he 
is getting only a part of the picture. For example, if 
your business presents well (in other words, it looks 
good to outsiders or visitors), it’s a good idea to have 
your banker visit the office. There’s something about 
seeing your customers, or the volume of merchan-
dise you ship, that makes a difference in how you’re 
perceived. There’s nothing wrong with trying to con-
duct business with your banker on your turf. Doing 
business at the bank is a lot like getting bad news 
and advice about your health from your doctor when 
you’re in your underwear, with a flimsy gown on, vul-
nerable, and uninformed about what’s going on. Your 
banker, like the doctor, has more of the control and 
authority when you’re sitting across his desk inside a 
nicely furnished bank office.
Speaking from experience, I know that the banker 
I’ve previously mentioned felt more invested in the 
success and health of our business because he was 
often there when customers were in the store. 
He saw firsthand that we had a loyal customer 
base and a thriving business—which made it a lot  
easier to get help when we needed it. What’s more,  
I don’t remember even going into his office in those 
days—we always conducted business in our store.

and treasure that person.

• 
Are loan decisions made locally?
If the ultimate decision about your small business loan 
application goes to a loan approval board that may or 
may not be in the same city (or even the same state 
for that matter), the only information they’ll have 
to make a decision about your loan is your balance 
sheet and how well you look to them on paper (credit 
score, time in business, and account history). Even 
some homegrown banks don’t give lending authority 
to their individual branches. In fact, the credit union 
I’ve been a member of for years no longer allows 
individual branch managers to make those decisions, 
as they did in years past. However, some of the larg-
est national and international banks still leave lending 
decisions to each branch. Don’t assume because the 
bank is local that they will have local lending author-
ity or that the national bank won’t. Ask.
• 
How long has the loan officer been with the bank?
Regardless of how old she may be, I advise you to 
work with someone who has experience as they help 
you with your small business loan. It’s important that 
she has the experience she needs not only to help 
you through the paper work, but also to add value to 
the process. I understand that everyone has to learn 
at some point—they just don’t have to learn at your 
expense. If your loan officer seems to be fumbling 
around and unsure of what she should do, it’s not 
unreasonable to ask if there’s someone with more 
experience who can help you.
Which Local Bank Is Courting Small 
Businesses?
As mentioned earlier, some banks are more interested in courting small 
businesses than others. Or, rather, some banks will be more interested in 
doing business with you than others. The trick is determining which banks 
they are. As promised, here are a few more suggestions to finding the 
right bank. Russakoff and Goodman7 suggest a few places where you might

find banks that are courting small businesses. Treat your search for a bank 
much like a prospecting exercise. Start with a list, do your homework, 
and prepare to ascertain the information noted previously. Then narrow 
down your list to a few banks that look like a good fit, and interview them 
all before you make a decision. I call this the “Beauty Pageant method” and, 
much like the Miss America Pageant, the interview carries a lot of points. 
Here are some ways to build your list:
Talk to your business peers (Russakoff and Goodman

Ask your biggest customers where they bank

Never Forget: Banking Is a Business
While you’re standing in the lobby waiting for someone to help you, it’s 
easy to forget that banking is a business and you are a potential customer. 
I’ve met with bankers who tried to make me feel like I was fortunate they 
were even talking to me. The truth is, regardless of how big the bank is 
or how small your business is, one of the biggest challenges facing many 
bankers every day is finding new customers. 
As mentioned earlier, most bank marketing is old school. When looking 
for new business, many bankers rely on a referral network of CPAs, the 
Chamber of Commerce, insurance agents, and traditional marketing like 
billboards, radio, and the events they sponsor. When you go into the bank 
to open an account or to apply for a loan, they are looking for good cus-
tomers every bit as much as you want to be one.

Remember, even though you are going to be the bank’s customer, you 
need to make sure you put your best foot forward. I don’t think that 
means you need to wear a suit and tie or your Sunday best, but you do 
need to look professional, have your financial records in order, and be 
ready to make them salivate to do business with you.
Summary
Despite how it might feel when a banker or two turns down your loan 
request, finding someone you can build a good working relationship with 
isn’t a pipe dream. In fact, it can make the difference down the road. The 
next chapter discusses how the banker looks at you when you first sit 
down across the desk and talk about your financing needs.

Keeping Your 
Relationship 
Personal
When the Honeymoon Is Over
Once upon a time there was a very motivated banker. He was my banker.  
I mentioned him earlier. 
My partners and I had a great relationship with our bank and that banker. 
His unique understanding of what we were doing made him a very valu-
able asset to us.
He went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. In fact, other 
than making deposits at the drive-through, I don’t think we ever did any 
business inside the bank—he would visit us at our store. I had his personal 
cell number and could call him anytime I had questions. Our relationship 
with this banker worked, because he worked for us.
Unfortunately, not all bankers are like this and in most cities around the 
country, this isn’t what banks really want their loan officers doing any-
way (at least that’s how it feels). Nevertheless, I still believe a personal 
relationship with your banker is important. When we were starting out, 
our relationship with the banker often determined whether we got the 
financing we needed. Although that might not be true anymore, a good 
banker can still help you navigate some of the myriad options available

(even if he or she can’t determine whether you get a loan). Remember, 
in big national banks and regional banks, a loan committee usually makes 
those decisions.
It’s likely no surprise to anyone reading this book that, following the financial 
meltdown of 2008, securing the financing needed for working capital and fuel-
ing growth has been difficult for small business owners. This clampdown on 
the local bank’s ability or willingness to lend money to Main Street hurt a lot 
of small business owners. However, it’s also created an opportunity for alter-
native lenders who have stepped in and offered sometimes unique options 
to businesses looking for alternatives (which you learn about in detail in 
subsequent chapters).
It also has some bankers thinking about how to keep their best customers 
in their bank.
In my opinion, this is good for small business owners. I don’t know if the 
percentage of small business owners who apply for a loan at the local 
bank will increase anytime soon, but I believe anything that gets bankers 
out from behind their collective desks and into the offices of their cus-
tomers, to help them be successful, is a good thing.
Like any other vendor, small business owners need to start looking at 
their bankers as strategic partners. As easy as it might be to blame the 
lack of relationship on the bank, there are some things a Main Street busi-
ness owner can do to build a more personal relationship with his or her 
banker.

hand; ask their advice when you need help. They see a lot of businesses, successful and 
otherwise. An insightful banker is valuable to your business.
Five Ways to Maintain a Great Relationship 
with Your Banker
Like any good relationship, a personal working relationship with your 
banker doesn’t just happen. It all comes down to communication.
• 
Personally communicate with your banker at least once 
every quarter: This is a great time to share positive 
company news. You might also want to add her 
e-mail address to your mailing list. That way, when 
press announcements are made or when you make 
a new product announcement, she will hear about it. 

Getting a Business Loan
23
Over time, your banker will get accustomed to hear-
ing from you and will appreciate your willingness to 
treat her like a partner. Most people don’t like to 
be the person who gets a call only when somebody 
wants something—neither does your banker.
• 
Invite your banker over to “your” turf : A couple of years 
ago, Kraft’s Dana Anderson spoke at a Forrester 
Marketing event about the importance of creating 
an effective environment to foster cross-departmen-
tal collaboration. One of the major takeaways was 
the idea of inviting collaboration partners to spend 
time on your turf and sharing with them what you’re 
doing. Sharing your success, she said, is crucial to 
initiatives that require cross-departmental buy-in.  
I believe this is relevant to building a personal relation-
ship with your banker. I think meeting us on our turf 
gave our banker a better understanding of what we 
were doing at the photography supply business. He 
watched us answer the phones and talk to custom-
ers. He witnessed first-hand the positive relationship 
we had with our photographers. He saw what we 
were doing and had a greater understanding when 
we needed to increase our business credit line for a 
special situation.
• 
Don’t forget holidays and birthdays: Set yourself apart 
from all the other small business clients by remem-
bering your banker’s birthday, or holidays, with a 
personalized greeting card. If for no other reason 
than nobody else is doing it, take advantage of the 
opportunity to stay top-of-mind with your banker. 
You’re likely sending greeting cards to customers 
already; one more card to your banker is a very small 
investment.
• 
Don’t fudge the numbers: Even if you have a good rela-
tionship with your banker, you have to make sure the 
numbers jibe. Even a small mistake on your P&L could 
wreak havoc down the road if your financial informa-
tion isn’t accurate. Your banker will be less likely to 
help you find the loan you need if your financial infor-
mation is traditionally filled with mistakes. Nobody 
wants to make excuses for what might be considered 
sloppiness on your part.

Chapter 3 | Keeping Your Relationship Personal
24
• 
Don’t make your banker the last to know: When you 
have bad news, don’t let your banker find out through 
the grapevine. Make sure your banker hears your side 
of the story before he reads about it in the news or 
hears about it from someone else. Years ago, one of 
my dad’s suppliers was distributing faulty products to 
their network of distributors. The negative press and 
the subsequent fallout impacted a number of busi-
nesses within their distribution network, including 
my father’s business. When his banker read about 
it in the news—and perhaps because he didn’t hear 
anything from my dad—he assumed the worst and 
called a loan due immediately. This was a tough blow 
for the business to be sure. I can’t help but wonder if 
the situation would have been different if the banker 
hadn’t been the last to know. He didn’t have a chance 
to hear my dad’s story or his contingency plans. The 
banker had no other information upon which to base 
a decision than the news reports.
Don’t forget that your banker is your banker. Although you want a per-
sonal and cordial relationship, it might not be a good idea to become an 
“open book.” He or she is part of the decision-making team at your bank, 
not your best friend, your therapist, or your clergy. Don’t air your dirty 
laundry at the bank. Be selective about any relevant bad news you share; 
and never whine, moan, or complain about your business or the negative 
effects of the economy to your banker.
Note

■
  Remember that your banker is . . . your banker. Your banker is not your shrink or your 
bar buddy. Keep it professional.
You Better Shop Around
As a young man growing up in the 1970s, I’m almost embarrassed to admit 
that I occasionally listened to the Captain and Tennille. For some rea-
son, thinking about finding the right bank reminds me of their tune, “You 
Better Shop Around.” (Although The Miracles recorded the same tune in 
the 1950s, the version I’m most familiar with is the former.)
That song offers good advice when it comes time to find a lender. The 
local bank is likely the best place to start, but don’t let your search end 
there.

Getting a Business Loan
25
It goes without saying that you’ll need some kind of checking account, 
maybe even a credit card or line of credit, but there’s a lot more to finding 
the right bank (and banker for that matter). Although most banks look 
the same on the outside, and maybe even on the inside, some focus on 
different things. You may even find bankers who specialize in one type of 
business over another.
Many high-tech companies where I live (Utah) choose to use a Silicon 
Valley-based bank. They feel the banks in the Bay Area are better equipped 
and more experienced working with tech firms than the local banks. I’m 
not suggesting you do that, but you could. Technology makes it possible 
for you to do your banking almost anywhere in the country—much to 
the chagrin of the local bank. You’re not married or limited to the ser-
vices they offer “around the corner.”
With that said, in most markets you have options—even if you choose to 
bank locally. In fact, many credit unions offer small business banking ser-
vices. Additionally, the biggest bank in your market might not be the best 
for you. You better shop around.
Good Relationships Start with Good 
Choices
Before you begin, make sure you have a good idea what you’re looking 
for. Does your Main Street business have specialized financing needs 
or are you looking for a banker who can give you investment advice? 
If you have highly specialized needs, jumping online might be the best 
place to start. You can search for local (or not so local) banks that 
specialize in what you’re looking for.
Some banks offer incentives for maintaining an average daily balance above 
a certain threshold. Will large amounts of cash be flowing through your 
account? Are there fees or penalties for large numbers of transactions? If 
you don’t already have a cash flow–management plan, it’s a good idea to 
have one before you start comparing banks. Some banks even offer those 
services and can offer information about your specific industry.
My first small business banking relationship was a business checking 
account. I didn’t give much thought to the other services I might need in 
the future, and it caused me grief down the road. Look down the road five 
or ten years to identify the services you may need over time.
Tip
■
■
  Think of where you want your business to be in 5 or 10 years. Make sure you pick a 
bank that will be able to service your needs at that point in the life of your business.

Chapter 3 | Keeping Your Relationship Personal

Apples and Oranges in Banking
If all you’re looking for are basic services like a checking account, you 
might even look into online banking. Many brick-and-mortar banks offer 
online services that are accessible wherever you are. I’m amazed at the 
number of simple banking services I can access via my smart phone.
Nevertheless, if you see the need for financing to fund working capital, 
purchase equipment, or other similar needs, a face-to-face relationship 
with a live banker offers value you can’t find if you do all your banking 
online or by phone. Additionally, if easy access to deposits and cash 
is important to you, multiple branches and an extensive ATM network 
could be what you’re looking for.
Don’t forget, at most banks, the services you use often come with asso-
ciated fees. For example, the fees small businesses pay are often differ-
ent (and usually higher) than those associated with a personal checking 
account. Sometimes there are fees associated with the number of trans-
actions you process or whether you use online banking services. Don’t 
be shy to ask about any associated fees. They add up. If you’re looking 
for free banking services, make sure you talk about it before you make 
a commitment. After all, the bank is there to serve your needs, not the 
other way around.
In a Relationship, Does Size Matter?
I mentioned this conversation earlier, but it’s worth repeating. I recently 
had a conversation with a small business owner who unsuccessfully went 
to the bank he’d been a faithful customer at for many years. He had a repu-
tation as a good customer and had even taken and successfully paid off a 
number of small business loans during his lifetime as a customer. He had 
plenty of cash in the bank, his business was healthy, and he had a wonderful 
credit rating—but he couldn’t get the loan he needed to fund a very excit-
ing expansion opportunity.
When he discussed this with his banker, with whom he had a great rela-
tionship, he was told that the loan he wanted would make him too big a 
customer for their community bank. Basically, they couldn’t put so many 
of their eggs into his basket.
Does size matter? Yes.
He needed an alternative funding source to finance his immediate needs 
for expansion while he began the search for a new, and bigger, bank.
That doesn’t mean a bigger bank with a national footprint is the right 
bank for you. In the post-credit crisis, many Main Street businesses have 

Getting a Business Loan
27
turned to smaller banks because they are traditionally more likely to 
offer financing to local businesses. You might be interested to know that 
although small and midsize banks are only 22% of the market, in 2009 
they accounted for 54% of small business lending according to the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Company1 and the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.
Note
■
■
  Smaller banks occupy 22% of the market, but make 54% of the loans to small 
business. In many cases, the big guys just won’t care about you as much.
What’s more, you’re likely to garner a little more attention from the com-
munity bank down the street than from a national bank. After all, part 
of the charter that governs a community bank’s mission is to help the 
local neighborhoods thrive. If you want a personal relationship with your 
banker, a community bank could be the place to look. You should know, 
however, that the bank and banker I described in the first part of this 
chapter was a very large bank with a national footprint. We just happened 
to get a very good banker, and the same thing could happen to you with 
a large bank. 
Do You Need to Redefine the Relationship?
As time goes on and your business grows, changes, and expands, it’s a 
good idea to test the waters periodically and see if there’s an opportunity 
to do better. Just like the small business owner I described earlier, you may 
discover that you’ve outgrown your current bank.
You may be surprised to find, as a more established business, you have a 
lot more clout when it comes to negotiating interest rates or eliminating 
bank service fees. That’s because you’ll be viewed as a less risky bet. If 
you’re meeting with your banker every quarter as suggested, you’ll have 
plenty of time to discuss your changing business needs, your track record 
as a customer, and what you expect from your banker and the bank. This 
is a great time to discuss any additional services you might need and 
whether your current bank will be able to provide them.
You may also decide that you need different accounts with different banks 
for different reasons. For example, it’s not uncommon for a small business 
to have a separate payroll account at a different bank. Many banks main-
tain a separate merchant account for processing credit card transactions.

Chapter 3 | Keeping Your Relationship Personal
28
Managing my credit card transactions felt like one of the most  complicated 
and cumbersome banking experiences I ever had to deal with, so I liked 
keeping my merchant transactions in a separate account. 
Your Best Interests at Heart
It might be easy to assume that a banker who agrees with you and always 
gives you what you want has your best interests at heart, but that might 
not be the case. I’ve tried to tell my wife that capitulating to my every 
whim is a good idea for over 30 years, but I have yet to convince her. In 
fact, she often gives me news I don’t like and opinions that are contrary 
to mine. Some of those traits might be worthwhile in a banker too—here 
are three of them:
• 
She encourages me to interact with others: I’m not in 
the least bit anti-social, but my sweet wife sometimes 
thinks the time I spend on my motorcycle alone is 
excessive (although I consider it valuable battery-
recharging time). She encourages me to spend more 
time socializing with our friends and adult children. 
This is sometimes problematic, since few of them 
ride motorcycles. In the same vein, a banker with 
your best interests at heart will make sure you have 
an opportunity to meet and network with people 
who can help your business. Bankers know a lot of 
people. People you likely don’t know. Hopefully your 
banker is invested in your success and is always 
looking for ways to provide value to you and your 
business. Sometimes that means helping you make 
connections with people who can help you meet 
your financial objectives. This is a potential win/win 
situation for everyone, provided you’re willing to let 
them broaden your circle of influence.
• 
My wife wants me to be successful: We’ve been married 
for a long time and she feels the impact of my success 
on a daily basis. A banker who has your best inter-
ests at heart wants you to be successful in the same 
way. Lest you think that requires bankers to be totally 
altruistic, your success bodes well for them too. The 
more successful you are, the more likely your banker 
will be able to provide the services you need and 
generate revenue for the bank. You should expect 
the financial strategies your banker recommends to 
be mutually beneficial—and that is a good thing.

My wife tells me the truth: She might not always tell me 
what I want to hear, but I can always trust that she 
is telling me what she thinks I need to hear. Honest 
feedback is often difficult to accept. If your banker 
really has your best interests at heart, he will give 
you honest feedback. Of course, he’ll share your opti-
mism for the future, but there may be times when he 
also shares frank and honest concerns about what he 
sees as risks. Your banker may even uncover poten-
tial problems that he can help you solve.
It’s doubtful that you’ll ever feel like your banker is your BFF—she is your 
banker after all. However, it’s not unreasonable to expect she will treat 
your relationship the same way you treat it—as an investment.
Keeping the Honeymoon Alive
There are as many suggestions for nurturing a good banking relation-
ship as there are bankers. Mitch Hurley, formerly a Vice President at First 
Security Bank of Utah, used to call them the three Ts:
• 
Talk: Communication is critical for any relationship to 
thrive. Have you ever had a spouse or close friend say 
something like, “Talk to me.” I’m ashamed to admit if 
I’ve been “focused” on work or some other distrac-
tion, I sometimes need to be reminded that commu-
nication is important. The same is true regarding your 
relationship with your banker. The conversations need 
to be frank and regular.
• 
Time: Nothing happens overnight. It took a while 
for my wife to realize that I was awesome, just like 
it might take you and your banker time to build a 
strong relationship. Don’t force things and don’t 
assume that simply because you’re a customer at the 
bank, the banker is going to love you instantly. Don’t 
rush things. Take your time.
• 
Trust: Honest Communication + Time = Trust. Trust 
is the foundation of any worthwhile relationship.  
I suggest you spend the same time and energy with 
your banker that you spend creating these types of 
relationships with your vendors and customers.

  Trust isn’t born overnight. It takes a combination of honesty and time to develop trust. 
Establishing this kind of trust puts you in a position of strength when you visit the bank.
Improve Your Odds of Success
Having a good working relationship with your banker is all fine and good, 
but if we’re honest, the reason we do it is to improve our odds at those 
times when we need capital to cover a cash-flow issue, fuel expansion, 
or to help a customer with a special project. Bankers are typically very 
conservative. Relationship building is about giving your banker as many 
reasons to have confidence in you as possible.
Bankers are risk averse (derivatives scandals aside). A good relation-
ship with your banker combined with an understanding of how credit 
works will help you in the long run. Here are a couple of suggestions 
that will help you maintain a good relationship with the bank and relate 
in terms you banker understands:
• 
Avoid surprises: Don’t wait until the last minute to let 
your banker know you need a loan. If you have a good 
relationship with your banker and are communicat-
ing with him regularly, there should be no reason to 
make the panicked, “I need a loan tonight or I’m going 
to have to close my doors” phone call. If you have a 
good relationship, your banker will want to help you, 
but he also has a responsibility to protect depositor 
assets. It’s amazing how much easier this process is if 
you are regularly communicating with your banker, he 
regularly visits you on your turf, and he understands 
what you do and why your request for a loan is a 
good idea.
• 
Don’t limit yourself to just one bank (or banker): Although 
this might sound counterintuitive (and your banker 
will likely not admit it), this spreads the risk around, 
making you a safer investment. Like every other work-
ing relationship, bankers move around, change roles, 
and get promoted. It’s a good idea to foster good 
relationships with more than one banker at your pri-
mary bank. If you nurture positive relationships with 
more than one banker at more than one bank, you’ll 
have more options when you’re in a pinch.

Don’t expect your banker to make the first move, but most will appreci-
ate your efforts to initiate a good working relationship. It might sound 
one-sided, but if your banker trusts your character, knows you are cred-
ible, and you’ve spent the time to build a good working relationship, you 
might find yourself one of the 10% of customers who walks out of the 
bank with a loan.
Summary
Although most small business owners today don’t have the same kind of 
relationships that owners had with their bankers 50 years ago, I believe 
that developing that relationship is still important. Despite the fact that 
many banks and bankers spend more time evaluating your bottom line, 
there are those like Dana Anderson who speak out about how important 
relationship building is for bankers and their small business customers. 
The next chapter talks about getting the right bank loan.

Getting the Right  
Bank Loan
My Porridge Is Too Hot!
As a little boy, I loved the story called The Three Bears, but it also frustrated 
me. I didn’t think Goldilocks was that bright. Who would eat the porridge, 
break the chair, and then crash in the bed upstairs? Nevertheless, the 
story teaches us that one size does not fit all—a lesson that is particularly 
relevant to small business financing.
When looking for a loan at the bank, you’ll likely hear about term loans 
and lines of credit. It’s important to determine which option is “just right” 
for you and your situation.
Term Loans
This is probably the type of loan most Main Street business owners think 
of when they head to the bank looking for a loan. In its simplest terms, a 
term loan is repaid in regular payments over a period of time. Auto loans 
and home mortgages are both great examples. Amounts and repayment 
terms vary depending upon the amount borrowed and the credit worthi-
ness of the borrower, but both loan types are term loans.

CREDIT WORTHINESS AND PERSONAL 
GUARANTEES
As a small business owner, it’s important that you pay attention to your personal 
credit as well as your business credit. For example, if you’re the sole proprietor, 
your personal credit and your business credit are closely linked in the eyes of 
your bank. However, many Main Street business owners rely too heavily on their 
personal credit to run their businesses. This can put your personal assets at risk 
should you find your business in trouble.
When you’re starting out, or if your business is very young, your banker might ask 
for a personal guarantee (in fact, you should expect it). Basically, you’re telling your 
banker that you will be personally liable should your business default on your loan.
I recently heard from a small business borrower who fell behind on a substantial 
loan and is now facing foreclosure. The commercial property that was used as 
collateral has been substantially devalued over the last few years and will likely 
cover only 50–60% of the loan amount. His personal guarantee put his personal 
assets at risk, and his attorney is telling him that he will likely lose everything.
It’s Usually Buried in the Small Print
They call it “mouse type” in the biz. It’s the itty-bitty type at the bottom 
or backside of the page that only a mouse can read. It outlines all the 
terms and conditions associated with a term loan. This is true for any 
loan not just term loans, and it’s a good idea to read it and make sure you 
understand it. Unfortunately, it’s usually filled with a lot of legal jargon and 
the size of the type is actually designed to make it difficult to read. But 
regardless of your desire to gloss over it, ignoring the fine print can cost 
you a lot of money and heartache down the road.
Two questions you’ll want to answer in the fine print are:
Is your interest rate fixed or floating? A fixed rate of interest means the per-
centage of interest will never change over the term of your loan, regard-
less of the financial markets. A good time to take out a fixed rate loan 
is when interest rates are low. Floating interest rates fluctuate with the 
market. When interest rates are generally low, you will enjoy a lower 
interest rate on your business loan. When rates go up, so will the interest 
rate on your loan. So having an adjustable rate loan could be good or bad 
depending upon what happens with the economy.
Is it simple or compounding interest? It’s amazing how such simple concepts 
can be so confusing and expensive if you don’t fully understand them.  
In a nutshell, simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount.  

35
Getting a Business Loan
In other words, interest is computed on the amount of the loan that remains 
unpaid at any given time. The formula looks like this:
Principal (Loan) Amount x Interest Rate x Time in Years = Simple 
Interest  
(Total)
For example, imagine you have a $1,000 loan for equipment. The  
interest rate is 5% per annum and the loan is to be repaid in 24 months. 
That formula looks like this:
$1,000 x .05 x 2 = $100
Why 2 instead of 24? Because the interest rate is an annual rate of 5%, so 
you need to turn the payment terms into years as well.
Compounding interest, on the other hand, requires the borrower not 
only to pay on the principal amount, but it includes any outstanding inter-
est at any given point in time. Consider the same scenario to understand 
the difference:
Simple Interest
Year 1: $1,000 x 1 year x 5% = $50 in interest
Year 2: $1,000 x 1 year x 5% = $50 in interest
Total amount of interest paid: $100
Total of principal and interest: $1,100
Compounding Interest
Year 1: $1,000 x 1 year x 5%  = $50 in interest
Year 2: $1,050 x 1 year x 5%  = $52.50 in interest
Total amount of interest paid: $102.50
Total of principal and interest: $1,102.50
Although this is a very simple example, notice that in year two of the 
compounding interest, you must pay interest on your principal as well as 
on the outstanding $50 in interest due. It is expected that regular pay-
ments will be made over the course of the loan; the calculations would 
reflect a monthly payment schedule rather than a yearly payment schedule.  
Typically, in the beginning, most of the payment is applied toward paying 
the interest, with a smaller percentage going toward the principal. As the 
loan matures over time, this ratio changes and more of the principal is 
paid off with each payment.

Chapter 4 | Getting the Right Bank Loan 
36
As you might guess, if you anticipate paying off your loan early, a simple 
interest loan is better. Principal and interest are paid off at the same rate. 
Because a compounding interest loan is weighted with more interest at 
the front end of the loan, it may feel as if you are being penalized for 
prepayment.
Note
■
■
  Although it might make sense—and can even look good on your credit report—to 
pay off a loan early, the bank wants your interest payments, and truth be told doesn’t want you 
to pay off your loan early.
Hopefully you can see that the type of interest you pay is every bit as 
important as the interest rate. It’s natural to ask about the interest rate, 
but just make sure you also ask about the type of interest you’ll be paying. 
It might not feel like it, but don’t forget, you are the bank’s customer. If 
your banker is unwilling to go through this information with you, there are 
other fish in the sea. Maybe it’s time for a new banker.
Could a Term Loan be Just Right for You and Your 
Business?
Goldilocks taught us that one size does not fit all, which is why a term 
loan might not be the right fit for your business. That being said, there are 
some great advantages to term loans:
• 
Immediate access: Most people are familiar with an 
auto loan or home mortgage. The entire loan amount 
is immediately available to purchase equipment, fund 
working capital, fuel growth, and so on. 
• 
It’s like clockwork: Budgeting is a piece of cake. You can 
anticipate your payment and make sure your business 
allocates funds every month to pay the monthly obli-
gation. There are seldom surprises.
• 
Nothing is arbitrary: Your bank will charge you the 
agreed-upon rate. There are no arbitrary-feeling 
interest rate hikes regardless of what’s happening in 
financial markets.

37
Getting a Business Loan
• 
The books are easy: Accounting entries for loan pay-
ments are straightforward and easy to reconcile. This 
isn’t an accounting nightmare.
• 
Slow and steady wins the race: This is a great way to 
establish or improve your company’s business credit. 
Making regular payments over time demonstrates 
your credit-worthiness to the bank for subsequent 
(and potentially greater) access to financing.
Despite some of the advantages of a term loan, it isn’t all peaches and 
cream. There are some disadvantages too:
• 
Change is hard: If you get in a bind, or for any reason 
need to change the terms of your loan, you will need 
to go through the process of applying and qualifying 
for a new loan. Waiting until you’re in dire straits to 
go through this process is not a good idea. If you have 
a good relationship with your banker, he may have 
ideas as to how to approach the bank before things go 
completely south (see previous chapter).
• 
You could be left holding the bag: If interest rates go 
down, you could be paying a higher-than-market 
interest rate for your loan. Make sure you can live 
with the interest rate and are willing to either bite 
your tongue or find another loan should rates drop.
• 
Another loan might not be an option: Even if you’re pre-
pared to find another loan, some loans include pre-
payment penalties that make jumping ship for a lower 
interest rate problematic.
Tip
■
■
  Use any loan opportunity as a way to show your banker you are reliable. Paying off 
your loan on time and without hiccups makes getting the next one easier.
A Line of Credit
Although most people are looking for a term loan, a line of credit probably  
comes in a close second. Unlike a term loan, a line of credit is a source  
of funds that you can draw against when the need arises. Additionally, 
interest is paid only on the amount of funds used. For example, if you have 
a $10,000 line of credit but access only $5,000 to purchase a new piece 
of equipment, you pay interest and make payments only on the $5,000 
you used.

Chapter 4 | Getting the Right Bank Loan 
38
Although it’s not exactly the same, this type of financial instrument is not 
that different from how trade was conducted in the early days of banking 
when Italian, Dutch, and English bankers offered a line of credit to interna-
tional traders buying and selling goods throughout the world. You might 
also be interested to know that this type of financing was once the most 
common currency in international trade finance.
Today, a line of credit comes in many different forms. The most relatable 
is your bank overdraft protection. I don’t think most people think of it 
as a line of credit, but fundamentally, when you overdraw your personal 
checking account and the bank covers the amount, they do it with a loan. 
It’s likely you have a fixed amount over which your bank or credit union 
won’t honor your checks. It might be $800, $1,000, or more. In reality, 
that’s a line of credit associated with your checking account.
Most of the time, a line of credit is accessed at the borrower’s discretion, 
but not always. The overdraft credit line described previously is a good 
example of your line of credit being accessed for you.1
The term “line of credit” is also used to describe the amount of money 
the bank is willing to loan you at any given time. If I were to walk into my 
bank seeking a personal loan, my banker would look at the outstanding 
balance (if any) on my credit cards, overdraft protection, and auto loan to 
determine whether I’ve exceeded my “line of credit.” However, generally 
speaking, a line of credit is a predetermined amount of funds available for 
access as needed.
In a previous chapter, you learned about a small business owner I knew 
who was denied a loan by his local bank because it would have exceeded 
the limit they could loan to any one bank customer. In the simplest terms, 
that particular loan would have exceeded his “line of credit.”
Secured or Unsecured, That Is the Question
Not all lines of credit are created equal. Depending on the type of credit 
line, your credit history, and your relationship with your bank, you might 
not need to secure your line of credit with collateral. I mentioned previ-
ously that early in my career, I regularly accessed $1,000 to $2,000 when 
needed on my signature. Although it wasn’t a formal line of credit as 
defined today, those amounts fell within the line of credit the bank was 
willing to lend me and my business without any collateral (other than  
my signature).
1I suppose you could argue that overdrawing your account is accessing your line of 
credit, but I don’t think many people think of it that way.

39
Getting a Business Loan
A home equity credit line is a great example of a secured line of credit. 
Basically, it is a second mortgage that is available on demand for home 
improvements. The same type of credit line exists for small businesses.
Some banks will consider a CD or other savings vehicle as security (read 
“collateral”) for a line of credit, but real estate, equipment, accounts 
receivable, or the company’s operating business assets are more com-
monly used as collateral.
Unlike an unsecured line of credit, a secured line of credit often provides 
access to a greater amount of cash at a lower interest rate. Credit limits 
can sometimes be as much as 10 times higher when you’re seeking a 
secured line of credit. Don’t forget, your banker wants to minimize risk. 
When you put “skin in the game” with collateral, that loan is less risky.
Note
■
 A secured line of credit will give you better rates and access to a larger amount of 
cash. But never forget that your assets are on the line.
Is a Line of Credit Just Right for You and Your 
Business?
Like a term loan, there are advantages and disadvantages associated with 
a line of credit. Some of the advantages include:
• 
It’s There When You Need It: Unlike a term loan, a line 
of credit is there when you need it, and it doesn’t cost 
you interest when you don’t. Many businesses use their 
credit line to manage the ups and downs of cash flow. 
• 
“I’m not worthy”: A line of credit is a good way to dem-
onstrate your credit-worthiness for potentially larger 
cash needs down the road. Using your credit line builds 
a positive credit history as you access the credit when 
you need it and make regular payments to repay it.
• 
You gotta be flexible: Most business credit lines have 
variable interest rates that fluctuate with the rise and 
fall of the financial markets. In reality, this is a double-
edged sword. You may have inexpensive access to 
capital when rates are low, but it can feel like a mill-
stone is tied around your neck when rates go up.
• 
It’s simple: Many banks offer simple interest on busi-
ness credit lines, so it’s always good to ask upfront if 
this is the case. 

Chapter 4 | Getting the Right Bank Loan 
40
There are also disadvantages:
• 
A loan by any other name is still a loan: Although a line 
of credit can be used to soften the pain of short-term 
cash-flow needs, don’t forget that it’s still a loan. It’s a 
debt that has to be paid. Far too many overly optimis-
tic small business owners tap out their line of credit 
month after month during tough times because they 
think happier days are just around the corner. When 
times are tough, making regular payments on your 
credit line can become a real burden. I speak from 
experience here. At best, a line of credit can some-
times do nothing more than put off the inevitable 
when times are tough, but it can also pound a few 
additional nails in the coffin if used unwisely.
• 
Interest might not be the only expense: It’s not uncommon 
for some banks to charge up-front fees to establish the 
line. Most of us don’t pay a lot of attention to the fees 
we are charged—a little here for credit card processing 
and a little there for check handling. Unnoticed fees add 
up. Don’t forget the mouse type here. Make sure you 
understand any fees and are prepared to pay them.
• 
Should the worst happen: Your business is liable for any 
unpaid credit line, the same as any other loan should 
your business flounder and fail. What’s more, if your 
line of credit is secured with some form of collateral, 
it’s at risk and the bank will likely take it. Additionally, 
if your bank required a personal guarantee, the bank 
will come after your personal assets.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t ignore the fees associated with your loan. Little costs add up over time. You 
might be able to find a better deal at the bank around the corner.
When Is the Timing Just Right?
Once I decided she was the girl for me, I wanted to make sure the timing 
was right before I got down on one knee and proposed to my future wife. 
More importantly, I wanted to make sure I knew what the answer would 
be before I asked the question (30+ years into this, I don’t think she sec-
ond guesses herself too often). It might not work the same way with your 
banker, but it does make sense to stack the deck in your favor. Part of that 
involves asking at the right time.

41
Getting a Business Loan
What Are Interest Rates Doing?
Rates for small business loans vary widely. When rates are low over-
all, application costs are usually lower too. Before you visit your banker, 
research the current interest rates for the type of loan you want. That 
way, when you visit your banker, you’ll know whether her bank is charg-
ing higher or lower interest rates than the average. Sir Francis Bacon said, 
“Knowledge is power.” Chatting with your banker about a loan is a per-
fect example of when this is true. Know the markets before you sit down 
with your banker and you’ll have more power to negotiate.
Can You Repay the Loan?
This isn’t as easy a question to answer as you might think. Do-or-die situ-
ations are not the best time to visit your banker. Timing is seldom right 
for a brand new business; banks view them as too risky. Market factors 
can impact a small business’s ability to repay a loan. What’s more, if com-
petition has pushed prices for your goods or services down, the interest  
rate on your loan could exceed your margins—making repayment 
problematic.
Apply at the Beginning of the Month
Believe it or not, the best time to apply for a loan is influenced by the time 
of the month. Although they don’t consider themselves to be salespeople, 
the first of the month is when your banker is working to obtain new loan 
accounts. Sometimes this could even mean a better deal for you and your 
small business. The end of the month is when they’re trying to close out 
and push through as many loans as they can. New loans that cross their 
desk at the end of the month are likely to be ignored (or will get less 
attention) as bankers try to get their already-outstanding loans funded.
These aren’t hard-and-fast rules by any stretch of the imagination, but if 
you can improve your odds when talking to the bank, you may be one of 
the 10% who leaves the bank with a loan.
Tip
■
■
  Apply for your loan at the beginning of the month. Bankers will be hungrier for new 
business then. At the end of the month they will be busy digesting the business they’ve rustled up.

Chapter 4 | Getting the Right Bank Loan 
42
One More Thing
Ultimately, the best time to apply for a loan is when you’re prepared. If 
“your ducks are in a row,” as my grandmother used to say, other timing 
considerations become secondary. In my opinion, your ability to repay 
the loan is the single most important timing consideration. With that in 
mind, I wrap up this chapter by covering the factors your banker consid-
ers as you prepare your business case. In other words, the reasons why 
you need the loan, how you’re going to repay the loan, and what you’ll do 
should something unforeseen happen:
• 
Projected revenue: Your banker will likely want to see 
that A + B = C. If he extends a line of credit or a term 
loan to your business, how is that infusion of cash 
going to impact your bottom line? For example, if you 
are borrowing to facilitate expansion, where will you 
spend the loan amount and what is your expected 
return? A small business owner I know wanted to 
expand into a new and bigger space. He wasn’t look-
ing for buckets of cash; actually it was a rather small 
loan by most people’s standards. But the $10,000 he 
was looking for would allow him to lease a new space, 
and it included some cash for additional marketing 
to ensure they were also finding new customers.  
He could demonstrate a reasonable return on the 
investment and his loan was funded. A + B = C is 
what your banker wants to see.
• 
Projected expenses: You banker will also want to know 
the total cost of your plans. If you can’t justify your 
expenditure of borrowed money with a positive ROI 
(return on investment) that demonstrates your ability 
to repay your loan, you’ll likely leave the bank empty 
handed. The world of finance is a world of projec-
tions, assumptions, and best guesses as much as any-
thing else. If you’re not prepared to show the bank 
what you expect to happen, the timing isn’t right.
• 
Having skin in the game: You read about this in an ear-
lier chapter, but it bears repeating. You banker wants 
to know the total cost of what you want to do and 
whether you’ve invested your own assets—that you 
have skin in the game.

43
Getting a Business Loan
• 
If the market will respond: Your banker will want to 
know that this isn’t a crap shoot. Even when you’ve 
made some personal investment in this endeavor, if 
you can’t convince your banker that the market will 
respond and you have a reasonable chance of suc-
cess, they’ll likely pass. Nobody likes to throw good 
money after bad, particularly your banker.
• 
Having a contingency plan: If things in the market  
turn south, what then? Contingency plans and  
risk-mitigation strategies resonate with bankers. If you 
can demonstrate that you have a plan should things 
go south, you’ll have a better chance of securing the 
financing you need. What’s more, it’s always good to 
imagine “what if?” scenarios when you’re looking to 
the future. It forces you to take off the rose-colored 
glasses and realistically look into your crystal ball.
Although it probably feels like the time is right when you don’t need the 
loan (and you could be right), don’t despair. Benjamin Disraeli, a British 
politician, writer, and aristocrat of the nineteenth century, said, “The 
secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when 
it comes.” In other words, be prepared for your visit with the banker.
Summary
What’s the best type of loan for your small business? It’s still too early to 
tell. You’ve read about only two of the most common bank loans—you’re 
just getting started. The next chapter talks about the maze that is the SBA 
(the Small Business Administration).

Navigating the 
Maze of the SBA
Are We There Yet?
When the U.S. government talks about small business, what they’re saying 
might not be what we’re hearing. They tend to look at small businesses 
differently than most of us do. You might be surprised to learn that Uncle 
Sam considers a $30 million company with over 200 employees a small 
business, but I doubt most Americans would. Needless to say, the financing 
needs of the local bookstore or barbershop around the corner are very 
different from a tech firm with hundreds of employees.
Nevertheless, Karen Mills,1 head of the Small Business Administration, 
announced that during her tenure at the SBA, she oversaw $106 billion 
in loans to more than 193,000 small businesses and entrepreneurs. That 
included $30.5 billion in loan guarantees in 2011 and $30.25 billion in 2012.
It might be a little easier to get an SBA loan today than it was in 2008, but 
it’s not a simple process by any standard. Let’s take a deeper look.

Guaranteed Loan Programs
According to the SBA, they don’t actually make loans. That’s the job of 
your local bank or other lending institution. The SBA:
[S]ets the guidelines for loans, which are then made by its 
partners (lenders, community development organizations, and 
microlending institutions). The SBA guarantees that these 
loans will be repaid, thus eliminating some of the risk to the 
lending partners. So when a business applies for an SBA loan, it 
is actually applying for a commercial loan, structured according 
to SBA requirements with an SBA guarantee. SBA-guaranteed 
loans may not be made to a small business if the borrower has 
access to other financing on reasonable terms.2
In other words, even if you receive an SBA loan, you will still be working 
with a local banker. And you are not eligible for an SBA loan if there are 
other reasonable alternatives. The goal of the SBA is to assume some of 
the risk associated with small business lending by guaranteeing a percent-
age of any particular loan. This reduces the risk to your bank.
Other Programs Offered by the SBA
The SBA’s financial assistance programs aren’t limited to their guaranteed loan 
programs. There are other programs designed to meet key financial needs:
• 
Bonding program (surety bonds): A surety bond is a 
three-party financial instrument among contractors, 
project owners, and someone who agrees to be 
responsible for the debt or obligation (a surety, who 
in this case is partially guaranteed by the SBA’s Surety 
Bond Guarantee program). It bonds the contractor 
to comply with the terms and conditions of the con-
tract. Should the contractor fail to perform as agreed, 
the surety assumes the contractor’s responsibilities 
and ensures that the project gets completed. When 
the SBA assumes a percentage of any potential loss, 
this guarantee gives the surety an incentive to pro-
vide bonding for eligible contractors, strengthening 
the contractor’s ability to obtain bonding and oppor-
tunities. The SBA can guarantee bonds for contracts 
up to $5 million in most instances or even up to $10 
million, depending on the contract.

Venture capital program: The SBA’s Small Business 
Investment Company (SBIC) program is a public-
private partnership created to help small businesses 
find access to the capital they need to fund growth. 
The SBA doesn’t invest directly in small businesses. 
Instead, it invests in private investment funds licensed 
as SBICs and supplements the capital they raise with 
access to low-cost, government-guaranteed debt. 
These SBICs operate much the same way as traditional 
venture capital firms, but they limit their investments 
to qualified small businesses as defined by the SBA.
To apply for an SBA loan, start at a bank in your area that participates 
in SBA programs. Don’t assume they all do, because they don’t. You still 
want to consider whether they specialize or have experience with your 
industry. Additionally, SBA guaranteed loans are structured to meet cer-
tain requirements to be eligible for the program. At the end of this chap-
ter, there is a copy of the SBA loan application checklist. It lists the forms 
and documents you and your lender need in order to create a loan pack-
age you can submit to the SBA.3
Starting and Expanding Businesses
There are a number of SBA loan products available, depending upon the 
type of business you operate and your loan objectives. To make it simple, 
I use the categories outlined by the SBA.
Basic 7(a) Loan Program
A 7(a) loan4 is intended to help specific businesses financially and is the most 
popular SBA loan. It can be used for a variety of business purposes, but 
there are some restrictions. Some of the basic uses include the following:
Long-term working capital to pay operational expenses, 
• 
accounts payable, or to purchase inventory
Short-term working capital, including seasonal financing,  
• 
contract performance, construction financing, and 
exporting
3The list is current as of this printing and is subject to change by the SBA at any time.

Revolving funds based on the value of existing inven-
• 
tory and receivables (under certain conditions)
Equipment, machinery, furniture, fixtures, supplies, or 
• 
materials
Real estate, including land and buildings
• 
New building construction or renovation on an  
• 
existing building
Funds to establish a new business, contribute to the 
• 
purchase of an existing business, or expand an exist-
ing business
Funds to refinance existing business debt under certain 
• 
conditions
Proceeds from an SBA loan cannot be used for any of the following 
purposes:
To refinance existing debt when the lender would 
• 
sustain a loss and the SBA would take over that loss 
through financing
To enable a partial change of business ownership or a 
• 
change that wouldn’t positively benefit the business
To reimburse funds owed to any owner, including any 
• 
equity or capital invested to provide a bridge to an 
SBA loan
To pay any delinquent state or federal withhold-
• 
ing taxes or any other funds that should be held in 
escrow
To fund anything that would not be generally con-
• 
sidered a sound business purpose as determined by 
the SBA
7(a) Loan Amounts, Fees, and Interest Rates
The SBA doesn’t set a minimum loan amount, but $5 million is the maxi-
mum amount it will guarantee. The SBA reports that the average 7(a) loan 
amount in 2012 was $337,730.
The SBA charges a loan guarantee fee to the lending institution based 
upon the loan’s maturity and the dollar amount guaranteed, not the total 
loan amount. The lender you work with has the option to pass that fee 
along to you at closing if they choose.

49
Getting a Business Loan
On any loan with a term of one year or less, the fee is 0.25% of the 
guaranteed portion of the loan. On loans with longer terms, the normal 
fee is 2% of the SBA-guaranteed portion on loans up to $150,000, 3% on 
loans of $150,000 to $700,000, and 3.5% on loans of more than $700,000. 
There is an additional fee of 0.25% on any guaranteed portion over  
$1 million.
The interest rate you pay is negotiated between you and the lender—subject 
to SBA minimums. Both fixed and variable rates are available. The maxi-
mum rate is based upon a base rate and an allowable spread. The SBA 
recognizes the following as acceptable base rates:
The prime rate published in a daily national newspaper
• 
The London InterBank one month prime, plus 3%
• 
The SBA peg rate
• 
A few definitions are probably in order here. The prime rate is probably 
the most widely used benchmark for setting interest rates. It originally 
indicated the interest rates banks offered to their best customers—those 
with the best credit. The basis for the prime rate is the federal funds rate, 
which is set by the Federal Reserve Board and is the rate commercial 
banks use to lend to each other. The prime rate is typically slightly lower 
or higher than 3% above the rate set by the Federal Reserve.
The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is established much the same 
way. The British Banker’s Association sets the rate on a daily basis and it’s 
derived from a filtered average of the world’s most creditworthy bank’s 
interbank deposit rates for larger loans with maturities between 24 hours 
and a full year.
The SBA peg rate is similar to the LIBOR rate in how it’s calculated. It’s the 
weighted average of rates the U.S. federal government pays for loans with 
maturities similar to the average SBA loan. The amount of the spread is 
negotiatied between the lender and the borrower, which is added to the 
base rate.
Even though lenders are allowed to add a spread to these base rates, the 
maximum spread can be no more than 2.5% on loans with maturities 
shorter than seven years and no more than 2.75% with maturities seven 
years or longer. However, the spread on loans of less than $50,000, and loans 
that are processed through express procedures, have higher maximums.
The SBA Express program allows approved lenders to use their own 
documentation and procedures for an SBA guaranteed loan—making 
it possible for the borrower to get approved without waiting for SBA 
approval. As you might guess, the express procedures have the potential 
of shortening the process for small business borrowers.

CDC 504 Loan Program
A CDC (Certified Development Company) 504 loan is designed to pro-
vide growing businesses with long-term, fixed-rate financing for major 
assets like property and buildings.
A CDC is a nonprofit corporation set up to contribute to the economic 
development of a community. CDCs across the country work with the 
SBA and private-sector lenders to provide loans to small businesses in 
a position to help develop local economies by creating local jobs, for 
example. CDC loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, as opposed to 
the 7(a) loan program described previously (the SBA guarantees up to 
85% on loan amounts of $150,000 or less and 75% on loan amounts over 
$150,000 on a 7(a) loan).
Some of the things a 504 loan can be used for include:
The purchase of property, including existing buildings
• 
Physical improvements, including grading, street 
• 
improvements, utilities, parking lots, and landscaping
The construction of new facilities or modernizing, 
• 
renovating, or converting existing facilities
The purchase of long-term machinery and equipment
• 
Proceeds from a 504 loan cannot be used for any of the following:
Working capital or inventory
• 
Consolidating, repaying, or refinancing debt
• 
Speculating or investing in rental real estate
• 
CDC 504 Loan Amounts, Fees, and Interest Rates
How the funds will be used and which of the following three categories 
the funds are intended to support determine maximum loan amounts:
• 
Job creation: The maximum loan amount for meeting 
a job creation criteria or community development 
goal is $1.5 million. Your business must create one 
job for every $65,000 provided by the SBA. Small 
manufacturers must have a $100,000 job-creation or 
job-retention goal.

51
Getting a Business Loan
• 
Public policy: The maximum loan amount for meeting 
a public policy goal is $2 million. According to the 
SBA, the following are examples of acceptable public 
policy goals:
Revitalizing a business district
• 
Expanding exports
• 
Expanding minority business development
• 
Developing rural areas
• 
Increasing productivity and competitiveness
• 
Restructuring because of federally mandated 
• 
standards or policies
Addressing changes necessitated by federal 
• 
budget cutbacks
Expanding small business concerns owned and 
• 
controlled by veterans
Expanding small businesses owned and controlled 
• 
by women
• 
Small manufacturing: The maximum loan amount for 
small manufacturers is $4 million. To qualify for a 
$4-million 504 loan, your business must meet the 
definition of a small manufacturer5 and accomplish 
one of the following:
Create or retain one job for every $100,000 
• 
guaranteed by the SBA6
Improve the economy of the locality or achieve 
• 
one or more public policy objectives7
The assets being financed are typically used for collateral along with a 
personal guarantee of the principal owner(s). Loan terms of 10 and 20 
years are available, with interest rates pegged to an increment above the 
current market rate for 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury issues. Fees are 
approximately 3% of the loan and may be financed with the loan.

Microloan Program
Very small loans are available for newly established or growing small  
businesses. The SBA makes these funds available to nonprofit community-
based lenders. A maximum of $50,000 is available to eligible borrowers. 
Applications and credit decisions are all made on the local bank level.
Microloans can be used for:
Working capital
• 
Inventory or supplies
• 
Furniture or fixtures
• 
Machinery or equipment
• 
Loan proceeds cannot be used to pay existing debts or to purchase  
real estate.
Loan-repayment terms vary according to several factors, including the 
amount of the loan, what the loan proceeds will be used for, requirements 
determined by the intermediary lender, and the needs of the borrower. 
The maximum allowed repayment term is six years.
Interest rates vary, depending upon the lender and the costs to the lender 
from the U.S. Treasury. These rates are normally between 8 and 13%.
Tip
■
■
  At rates of between 8 and 13%, an SBA microloan shouldn’t be at the top of your list. 
Exhaust other sources of money first.
Disaster Loans
Disaster loans come in a few different varieties.
Disaster Assistance Loans 
These loans provide financial assistance to victims of disasters in a declared 
disaster area. Disaster loans can be used to repair or replace the following 
items damaged or destroyed in a natural disaster:
Real estate
• 
Personal property
• 
Machinery and equipment
• 
Inventory
• 
Business assets
•

Getting a Business Loan
Economic Injury Loans
If your small business has experienced substantial economic injury in a 
declared disaster area, you could be eligible for an SBA Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan (EIDL). The SBA defines “substantial economic injury” as 
your business’s inability to meet its obligations and to pay ordinary and 
necessary operating expenses. EIDLs are designed to provide working 
capital to help small businesses survive a national disaster until normal 
operations can be resumed. 
The interest rates on EIDLs will not exceed 4% per year, with terms no 
longer than 30 years. The repayment term is determined by your ability 
to repay the loan. This type of financing is available only when the SBA 
determines there are no other options to obtain credit elsewhere.
Export Assistance Loans
The SBA offers a few loan products specifically to assist small businesses 
in the export business. These loans are targeted at businesses that need 
additional capital to support export opportunities. An export business 
enages in trading goods produced in the United States, and shipped to 
another country, for future sale or trade. 
Export Express: To support export activities, the Export Express loan 
is designed to streamline the process for obtaining financing and lines 
of credit up to $500,000. Borrowers are bound by the lender’s current 
loan-approval process, but exporters get access to the funds faster. The 
SBA provides an expedited eligibility review with a response in less than 
24 hours.
Export Working Capital: This loan type is designed to provide work-
ing capital to exporters who are able to generate export business, but 
don’t have the working capital to support the transactions.
International Trade: These are term loans designed for businesses that 
plan to start or continue exporting—and can also be used by exporters 
that have been negatively affected by competition from importers. The 
proceeds of the loan must enable the borrower to be in a better competi-
tive position.
Veteran and Military Community Loans
Are you a veteran of the armed forces? If so, you have some additional 
options with the Patriot Express loan. There’s also help for businesses 
that employ reservists who are called up for active duty, when that results 
in economic hardship.

Chapter 5 | Navigating the Maze of the SBA
54
Patriot Express
To be eligible for a Patriot Express loan, the business must be owned and 
controlled by eligible veterans and members of the military community 
who want to establish or expand their business. To the SBA, “owned” and 
“controlled by” means at least a 51% ownership in the small business.
Eligible military community members include:
Veterans
• 
Service-disabled veterans
• 
Active-duty service members eligible for the military’s  
• 
Transition Assistance Program
Reservists and National Guard members
• 
Current spouses of any of these, including any service 
• 
member
Widowed spouses of service members or veterans 
• 
who died during service or of a service-connected 
disability
The maximum loan amount on any Patriot Express loan is $500,000 and can 
be used for the same purposes as a 7(a) loan, including start-up and expan-
sion costs, equipment purchases, permanent working capital, and inventory 
or business-occupied real estate purchases. The option to access loan 
proceeds as a line of credit is also available, subject to the lender’s terms.
There is no collateral requirement for loans under $25,000, but the same 
collateral requirements for other SBA loans apply up to $350,000. For 
loans over $350,000, lenders are required to obtain either all collateral or 
enough collateral so the value is equal to the loan amount.
The local SBA district office has a current list of Patriot Express lenders 
in your area.
Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan
The purpose of this loan is to assist small businesses to meet obligations 
they are now unable to meet because a key employee was called-up to 
active duty in their role as a military reservist.
The maximum loan amount available is $2 million and is limited to the 
actual injury as calculated by the SBA. The amount is also limited by  
business interruption insurance and whether the business owner has  
sufficient funds to operate. If the business is a major source of employment 
in the community, the SBA has the authority to waive the $2 million  
statutory limit.

55
Getting a Business Loan
The purpose of the loan is to recover lost income or profits and may not 
be used for regular commercial debt, to refinance long-term debt, or to 
expand business operations.
Businesses that have the ability to fund their own recovery are not eligible 
for this assistance. Federal law requires the SBA to perform an evaluation 
to ensure that no other source of funds is available to the business with-
out creating undue hardship.
Collateral is required for any loan over $50,000. The SBA will not deny a 
loan if the borrower doesn’t have sufficient collateral to ensure the entire 
loan amount, but it does require the borrower to pledge whatever col-
lateral is available.
The interest rate is 4% with up to a 30-year term, based on the SBA’s 
determination of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.
Improving the Odds of SBA Loan Success
As described earlier in this chapter, the SBA doesn’t make loans; your local 
bank or other lender does. The SBA simply eliminates some of the risk so 
that the lender can approve your application with more confidence.  
Although the SBA’s mission is to eliminate some of the risk their lender 
partners take on, they don’t treat the process like a trip to Vegas. Like any 
other banker, they are anxious to avoid any risk they can—which makes 
acquiring an SBA loan challenging for many small business owners. With 
that in mind, here are five ways to improve your chances:
• 
Understand the jargon: Make sure you know what 
you’re talking about when you visit your banker to 
discuss a potential loan. The most popular and flex-
ible SBA loan is the 7(a) loan described earlier in the 
chapter. Make sure you’re familiar with and under-
stand the definitions and descriptions of each of the 
loans described in this chapter.
• 
Cross your T’s and dot your I’s: Make sure you bring your 
business and personal financial statements, includ-
ing tax returns, accounts receivable and accounts 
payable aging, a short business plan, and reference  
letters. Basically, bring anything that a banker might 
be interested in to ensure that you are a good loan  
prospect. You want to show the bank that you’re 
a smart investment rather than a risky one. The 
background information allows bankers in the  

Chapter 5 | Navigating the Maze of the SBA
56
decision-making process who’ll never meet you to get 
a complete picture of your business and your profes-
sionalism. Don’t assume that your most recent tax 
return or P&L is sufficient—you will be making a sales 
presentation to the banker in an effort to convince 
him that you are a great candidate for an SBA loan.
• 
Show that you have skin in the game: Prior to 2008, it 
might have been a little easier to get an SBA loan, but 
it’s still possible. Although the SBA might not require 
the entire loan to be collateralized, they do expect 
the borrower to put up all the collateral they have, 
including equity in your home. As you might expect, 
this scares off some prospective borrowers. If your 
business has enough assets to put forward as col-
lateral, you’re in good shape. If not, you’ll likely be 
required to use your home or other personal assets.
• 
Be prepared to answer the tough questions: Although 
industry success averages might not apply to you, 
your banker will want to know what your odds of 
success are. Most industry groups supply that kind 
of information to their members. If you feel like your 
business idea is doing (or will do) better than the 
industry average, your banker will want to know why 
you think that way. Remember, when all is said and 
done, bankers want to avoid risk. The more informa-
tion you provide that helps them do that, the better 
your chances of success.
• 
Avoid the very appearance of risk: If you have a good 
business plan and can make a good case for an SBA 
loan, the last thing you want to do is give your banker 
the idea that you are willing to make risky decisions 
(even if they are calculated risks). Traditional lenders  
hate risk—and the SBA works with traditional 
lenders.
Tip
■
■
  You don’t want your banker to perceive you, or the reason you want funds, as risky in 
any way, shape, or form. Show your banker that you are trustworthy, and that your plan for the 
money makes good financial sense.

SBA Loan Application Checklist
Use this checklist to compile all the documents and other information 
you’ll need in order to submit a compelling application. Nevertheless, if 
there is additional information that will help the bank and the SBA better 
understand your business and your ability to turn an SBA loan into busi-
ness profit, by all means add those documents to this list.
• 
SBA loan application: Use the application for a business  
loan—SBA Form 4.8
• 
Personal background and financial statement: The SBA 
requires you to complete a statement of personal 
history—SBA Form 9129—and personal financial 
statement—SBA Form 413.10
• 
Business financial statement: Your business financial 
statement should demonstrate your ability to repay 
the loan. Prepare and include the following:
• 
Profit and loss (P&L) statement: This must be 
current within 90 days of your application. You 
will also need to include any supplementary 
schedules from the last three fiscal years.
• 
Projected financial statements: Include a one-year 
detailed projection of income and expenses, 
along with a written explanation of how you plan 
to achieve these objectives.
• 
Ownership and affiliations: Disclose any other businesses 
you have a financial interest in, including subsidiaries 
and affiliates, as well as any business you have a con-
trolling interest in, in addition to any stock owner-
ship, franchises, proposed mergers, and so on.
• 
Business certificate/business license: You need to pro-
vide your original business license or certificate of 
doing business. If you run a corporation, stamp your 
corporate seal on the SBA loan application form.
• 
Loan application history: Include records of any loans 
you have applied for in the past.

58
• 
Income tax returns: Include signed personal and busi-
ness federal tax returns from the previous three 
years (for all principals in the business).
• 
Resumes: Include a personal resume for each principal 
in the business.
• 
Business overview and history: Provide a brief written 
history of the business. Include successes as well as 
challenges, along with an explanation of why you are 
applying for an SBA loan.
• 
Business lease: Include a copy of your business lease, 
if you are renting property, that explains the terms of 
the lease (a note from your landlord will also work).
• 
If you are purchasing an existing business: If you’re pur-
chasing an existing business, you also need to include 
the following:
Current balance sheet and P&L of the business 
• 
to be purchased
The previous two years federal income tax 
• 
returns of the business
Proposed bill of sale, including terms of sale
• 
Asking price with schedule of inventory, including 
• 
machinery, equipment, furniture, and fixtures
Summary
Although the SBA is not the only source of financing for Main Street busi-
ness owners, the interest rates and terms are some of the most attractive 
for traditional financing. Larger banks and community banks are part of 
the network of SBA lenders, and you should investigate more than one 
lender before jumping into what is typically a months-long process.
Last year the SBA made approximately $30 billion in loan guarantees to 
small business owners. One of the success stories highlighted by the SBA 
is PeakEnergy LLC.11

Angels and 
Venture Capital
The Myth of the Shark Tank
There’s a lot of talk in the media about venture capital (VC), usually   
associated with startups. Television makes it look like VC firms and angel 
investors are lining up to take your great idea and give you the money you 
need to get it going. Although there might be investors looking for something 
like your business, the truth is, an angel or VC firm is typically looking for 
a sexy tech startup that could turn into the next Facebook—not your 
Main Street business.
Although only about two percent of small businesses actually have what the 
VCs are looking for, no discussion of capitalizing Main Street business own-
ers would be complete without addressing the topic. Hopefully by the end   
of this chapter, you’ll have a good idea of whether VC funding is right for you.
What Is a Venture Capital Firm?
Venture capital is usually an investment of funds into early-stage, high-
potential startups that offer some kind of unique technology. Unlike a 
loan, the venture capital fund makes money by owning equity in the com-
panies in which they invest. Most of the time, the VC isn’t involved in the 
early stages of a company’s lifecycle,1 but participates in what is usually 
called a growth round of funding.

C H A P T E R 
1That’s more the role of the angel, to be discussed later in the chapter.

Chapter 6 | Angels and Venture Capital
62
Because their investment buys equity in the business, the payoff takes place 
when the business is either sold or goes public in an IPO (Initial Public 
Offering). Unlike a loan, VC funding doesn’t require a monthly payment, 
but it usually does require the business owner to relinquish some own-
ership (sometimes even a controlling interest) in their business. I often 
chuckle at the small business owners on ABC’s Shark Tank, who want the 
financial backing of Barbara Corcoran, Kevin O’Leary, or Mark Cuban, but 
don’t want to give up any ownership.
Years ago I had a close friend who was able to attract some interest in 
his business by some potential equity investors who were convinced they 
could turn his small business into a multimillion-dollar company. At the 
time he had other partners, but he maintained the controlling interest in 
his company. When they finally came to terms, his ownership went from 
around 70% to 10%. He remained the president of the company, but he 
now had a major shareholder with an incredible amount of clout when it 
came time to make decisions.
When I asked him why he was willing to give up so much to an equity 
investor, he showed great savvy for such a young guy. “Right now I have a 
big huge piece of a really small pie,” he said. “Although I might have a much 
smaller piece of the pie, it’s going to be a very big pie.”
Not too many years later, he proved me right when his business sold. He 
was living the dream and walked away with somewhere between $10 and 
$20 million. He knew his new equity partners had the industry knowledge 
to take his business to the next level and make some serious money. For 
him, it was worth giving up all that equity.
Even if your business is something a VC is interested in, you might 
not want to give up ownership, but there are a lot of entrepreneurs 
who do.
This is something you need to determine for yourself, but it’s been reported 
that venture capital accounts for about 2% of U.S. Gross Domestic 
Product2 (U.S. GDP) and creates a lot of jobs for high-tech businesses in 
the growth phase of their businesses. According to the National Venture 
Capital Association, 11% of private sector jobs come from venture-backed 
companies.3

The Pitfalls of VC Funding
I don’t think giving up equity is necessarily a pitfall if the investors have the 
savvy and wherewithal to help you build a thriving and growing business. 
My concerns are at more of a basic philosophical level.
Knowing ahead of time that VC companies don’t reap the rewards of their 
investment until a businesses is sold or goes public, you should realize that 
the focus of your new business partner is to flip your company for as big 
a return as they can as quickly as they can. That’s the way they and their 
investors make profits. Very few—and I’m not aware of any—are willing 
to invest in companies for the long term. If you want to build a company 
that will last 100 years or more, you likely won’t be very appealing to an 
equity investor (even though that will make you a very appealing business 
generally).
Other than my personal distaste for what is sometimes called “taco chip” 
companies—companies with a long-term value of a taco chip—there are 
a few challenges associated with venture funding. Most of time, they aren’t 
content with earning interest rates on par with bank rates. They want a 
little more. Here are a few examples:
• 
Management position: Most of the time, VCs want to 
be added as a member of your company’s executive 
team. You might not look at it this way, but they want 
to ensure that your company is headed down a path 
that will reap their anticipated financial reward.
• 
Funds might not immediately be available: Unlike a tra-
ditional term loan, the promised funds might not 
immediately be available. Many VCs set goals and 
milestones for the release of funds. Most of the time, 
funding is released in stages and is usually allocated 
for growth and expansion. I’m editorializing here, but 
expansion with an eye toward sale or public offering 
might not always be the best kind of growth.
• 
The term “equity” funding implies that you will be giving 
up equity for funding: Most VC firms require you to 
give up an equity position. It won’t be small potatoes 
either. It’s not uncommon to see a VC firm looking 
for 60% or greater, depending on the investment.

Your business plan could become public: When you 
approach a bank or other small business finance 
company, it’s customary to expect that they will sign 
a non-disclosure agreement regarding your business 
plan and what you want to do. This is seldom the 
case with venture funding. VCs almost always refuse 
to sign such agreements.
• 
Decisions might not be yours to make any longer: At least 
you won’t have carte blanche to make decisions. 
One of the biggest challenges faced when accept-
ing venture funds is giving up many of the key deci-
sions you would otherwise make. VCs usually want a 
lot of influence over key decisions—and they don’t 
always agree with the founder. Their equity position 
gives them a seat at the table when it’s time to make 
important decisions.
That being said, there are benefits to working with VC firms. Many of which 
have the potential to turn a young, struggling startup into an incredibly 
profitable business.

have for your company are compatible.
Benefits of VC Funding
If you have a business that might be interesting to a venture firm, you 
could have access to an incredible amount of business savvy to help you 
succeed:
• 
Management consulting could be part of the package:  
I don’t think it’s any secret that not all entrepreneurs 
are good business managers. Great ideas, a strong 
business plan, and a killer product don’t always come 
from the same entrepreneur with the skills to suc-
cessfully run a business. If you don’t have those skills 
or you don’t have a partner who does, a VC interested 
in your company could fill the gap. Because most VC 
firms will have equity in your firm, their desire to help 
manage your company could be a boon to entrepre-
neurs who don’t have those skills.

• 
Specific business discipline expertise can help you ramp 
things up: Many VC firms have expert business con-
sultants on their payroll who can help with things like 
marketing, distribution, research, and more. Having an 
open channel to an organization filled with the exper-
tise your organization might lack can improve your 
ability to compete in your space. I once worked with 
a number of highly qualified people from Harvard and 
MIT who were at our disposal as part of our company’s 
VC firm. We often turned to them for research into 
our market and advice on special projects. They 
were a great resource. Looking back, I don’t think 
we took advantage of that expertise as much as we 
could have.
• 
Human resource expertise and recruiting capability: 
Recruiting key talent is a challenge for startups and 
young firms looking to grow. Many VC firms can help 
you find people with the specialized skills needed 
to help your business grow. Some firms even have 
HR people to help the companies they’ve invested in 
staff key rolls. This can be of huge benefit to business 
owners who want to mitigate the risks associated 
with hiring the wrong people for key rolls.
• 
But wait, there’s more: Starting a business, or taking 
a young company to the next level, is not for the 
faint hearted. Legal concerns, payroll matters, and tax 
issues are just a few of the concerns faced as a com-
pany grows. It’s not uncommon for a venture firm to 
take an interest in providing resources to help deal 
with these issues, because they have a vested interest 
in your success.
Although your banker or other financing source has an interest in your 
success—they certainly don’t want you to default on your loan—because 
a VC firm has invested in your future, they’re likely going to do everything 
they can to ensure that you succeed in a timely matter.
Equity funding is basically exchanging capital for ownership in your business. 
It isn’t right for everyone.

Chapter 6 | Angels and Venture Capital

Before You Pitch Your Business to a VC
Even if you find yourself within the two percent of small businesses a 
venture fund might be interested in, don’t expect them to come knocking  
on your door. More than likely you’ll need to sell them on the idea.  
Before you start looking through the phone book for your local VC firm, 
there are a few concepts you need to have nailed down. As obvious as 
these questions sound, you might be surprised at how many small busi-
ness owners don’t have their ducks in a row.
What’s Your Elevator Pitch?
I once attended a local Q&A with some pretty experienced entrepreneurs 
who, when asked, couldn’t explain what their company did. I’m not sug-
gesting they didn’t know, they just couldn’t articulate it very well. Before 
you pitch a venture capitalist, you better have your elevator pitch down.
I like the idea of starting with a piece of paper or a Word document. This 
gives you a chance to live with it, change it, and clearly identify what you 
do. Start with a page. Take the full page or two—somewhere around  
600 or 700 words—to describe what you do. Work with the page for a 
few days; make sure you’ve accurately described what you do and why.
Once you’re done with the page, move on to the next step—the para-
graph. The challenge here is to distill the essence of everything you’ve 
written into 100 words or less. Live with it for a while; make sure 
you’ve written a good description and then move to the next step—the  
sentence. By this time you’ve likely noticed that writing the paragraph was 
decidedly more difficult that writing the page. Expect the sentence to be 
even more difficult. This is what many people call your elevator pitch.
If you can’t articulate what you do in a single sentence that puts a spotlight 
on your unique idea, you’re not ready to pitch your idea to a VC firm. 
What’s more, if you haven’t written the page and distilled it down to a 
paragraph, you probably won’t be able to accurately describe what you do 
in a sentence. Working through the exercise is valuable, even if you never 
refer to the page or paragraph again. However, I’m pretty sure you will.
Do You Know Your Market?
Most products or services are designed to address a need in the market. 
Can you clearly articulate that need? What is the problem you’re trying 
to solve? Do your potential customers recognize the problem? What are 
they willing to pay to solve the problem? Will your product actually solve 
the problem?

67
Getting a Business Loan
Years ago, as a much younger version of myself, I was job hunting and was 
ultimately recruited by a major insurance company. Although I knew life 
insurance was a tough way to make a living, I also knew that people who 
were good at it made a lot of money. I was interested enough that I was 
giving it some serious consideration. My brother-in-law had successfully 
sold insurance for a while, so I gave him a call to see what he thought of 
the company. I was surprised by his response.
“Ty, if you want to be a salesperson, why not sell something people either 
know they need or something that most people want. Life insurance isn’t 
either one.”
He then explained that most of the people I would talk to wouldn’t give 
the purchase of life insurance the importance it deserved and I would 
likely spend most of my time trying to explain why it was important. 
“When was the last time you called up a life insurance salesperson and 
asked her to come tell you about her product?” he asked.
Bottom line—if you have a product or service that doesn’t resonate with 
your market (even if it’s a fantastic product), a VC firm isn’t going to be 
interested in what you have to offer.
Who Are You Talking To?
In marketing terms, this is the first and most important question you 
need to ask yourself. Many companies spend countless hours defining the 
who. I’m a big fan of articulating who my buyer (in this case, the VC) is, 
who influences the buying decision, and who the user of my product will 
likely be. Odds are they are not the same person. If you can accurately  
and persuasively articulate “who,” you greatly increase the odds of a  
successful pitch—especially when you have a product that resonates with 
the market and solves a real market need, and have potential customers 
who will pay for your solution.
Having spent a good portion of my career in marketing, I’m always sur-
prised to see how many companies can’t identify “who” they’re talking 
to. They have a good idea, but they don’t spend the time to make sure 
they know. Remember, if you’re courting venture funding, you’re looking 
for a partner. They want to know that your company knows who they’re 
products are designed for.

Chapter 6 | Angels and Venture Capital
68
Is this VC Firm Right for You?
Once you know your market, you know how to articulate what your 
product does, and you know who your customers or potential customers 
are, you’re still not quite done. You need to prepare your pitch and make 
sure you’re ready to do the “song and dance.” However, the pitch process 
is also a great time to make sure you want to work with them.
Lendio founder and CEO Brock Blake talks about the process he went 
through with Lendio. Blake is a pretty dedicated family man and makes 
sure he sets aside time to spend with his wife and children. I wish I had 
been as dedicated to this idea when I was his age. He often talks about 
how we dedicate time to those things we think are most important—and 
for him, it’s his family.
During a meeting with a potential VC investor, the investor said something 
like, “I don’t know how you can have a family and still be an entrepreneur. 
To be successful, you just have to dedicate way too much time focused on 
work. A family just isn’t compatible with that.”
Because Blake’s primary focus is his family, this was a huge red flag—this 
particular investor just wasn’t right for him and his business.
Sometimes small business owners are so focused on raising a successful 
round of venture funds, they don’t ask themselves the critical question, “Do 
I really want to work with these guys?” Remember, taking money from a 
VC is different than taking out a loan at the bank. You’re taking on a new 
partner—a partner with a lot of say regarding how you run your business.

  Don’t ignore the importance of your pitch to any potential VC. You may need to 
customize every presentation for each specific VC. Taking shortcuts with your pitch will handicap 
your ability to find the funding you need.
Pitching Your Business to a Venture Firm
Although every venture firm is a little different, there are some common 
things they all seem to look for. In addition to your understanding of the 
market, your customers, and the problem you solve, they’ll also want to 
know or hear about:
• 
The team: Who is your leadership team and why are 
they qualified to execute your idea? Is the organiza-
tion you’ve built more capable than your top four 
or five competitors? They’ll want visibility into work  
history, networks, skills, and any previous successes.

69
Getting a Business Loan
• 
Demo: Most  VCs insist on a demonstration, or 
“demo,” that shows how your product works. 
Investors want to make sure they understand how 
your product works compared to similar products 
they may already be familiar with before they invest. 
At the very least they’ll want to see a mockup.
• 
Business model: How does your business make money? 
Who pays? How much do they pay? And, when do 
they pay?
• 
Your competition: Do you know everyone who could 
be considered a competitor? Do you know what 
they’re offering to address your market? Are they 
successful? A VC will want a list of competitors with 
some analysis of what you believe they are doing right 
and where you think they are weak. What are your 
competitive advantages?
• 
Financial overview: What are your expected revenues 
and expenses? How long do you anticipate this round 
of funding to last?
• 
Funding: How much capital are you trying to raise, 
and what are you going to do with it? Are you look-
ing for money to develop your team, for overhead, or  
to expand?
• 
The future: What is your vision for the future? Have 
you established milestones for the next two or three 
years? Most VC firms will keep track of those mile-
stones and hold you accountable for meeting them.
Although there is nothing more exciting than the phone call or e-mail that 
lets you know you have a new VC partner, having a good idea isn’t enough 
to make it happen. Many entrepreneurs aren’t prepared to answer some 
of these hard questions and wind up stumbling right out of the gate. If 
venture funding makes sense for you and your business, with a little bit of 
preparation, you’ll improve your odds of success.
Many VCs are located near major universities or in the high-tech centers 
of the country like Silicon Valley, New York, and Boston. You can search 
online, where there are a number of directories. Before you reach out to 
a venture firm, do enough research to know whether the VC you’re inter-
ested in working with will be interested in you and your type of business.
Don’t be afraid to talk to others in your industry where they obtained 
their financing, if they are venture-backed. Referrals can make it much 
easier to get a meeting with a VC.

The Angel Down the Street: When Local 
Investors Come to the Rescue
Angel investors are typically affluent individuals who provide capital for 
small business ideas they personally believe in. Like a VC, they are typically 
looking for an equity position, but they will sometimes provide capital in 
the form of a private business loan.
Although the term originates from Broadway, where wealthy individuals  
provided money needed to fund theatrical productions, it’s used in a 
broader context now. Many “angels,” as they are sometimes called, tend to 
devote their wealth to fund businesses and initiatives that are of personal 
interest or represent an industry familiar to the investor.
Unlike VCs, angel investors use their own funds to invest—which can 
make them expensive. Depending upon the investor, funds can range from 
a few thousand to millions of dollars.
Where to Look for Angel Investors
Angels are usually in larger metropolitan areas and can be hard to find, but 
looking in the right types of places is a good start:
• 
Colleges and universities: Many angels like to watch the 
technological developments that come out of major 
universities. A good place to look for angel investors 
is an entrepreneurship program supported by a local 
university.
• 
Business incubators: There are hundreds of business 
incubators all across the country that offer entre-
preneurs inexpensive rent, access to shared services, 
and the opportunity to work with successful business 
professionals in an atmosphere of entrepreneurship. 
Some of these incubators also offer formal access to 
angel investors.
• 
VC clubs: Because of the success of many high-tech 
firms, large numbers of angel investors have started 
to formalize their efforts by creating investment 
groups or clubs. These people are actively look-
ing for ventures to invest in and want to hear from 
entrepreneurs with the next great idea.

71
Getting a Business Loan
• 
Angel confederacies: Some angels don’t like the idea of 
formalized investments within the confines of a VC 
club, but nevertheless band together within informal 
groups to discuss potential deals and share informa-
tion. Although many of them prefer to invest indi-
vidually, they sometimes will join together for specific 
opportunities. These groups aren’t easy to find, but 
once you meet one of them, you’ll likely have access 
to them all.
A great place to start looking for these groups might be with a call to your 
local chamber of commerce, because these investors often have a con-
nection to the chamber. You can also reach out to your accountant, your 
attorney, or even a VC firm. You might also be able to find the information 
you need by talking to your banker.
I was speaking with a couple of bankers recently. They both mentioned 
how angels and VC firms were taking some of the small business loan busi-
ness away from their bank. Although they didn’t seem too happy about 
it, they acknowledged that many of the people who couldn’t get funding 
through a traditional bank loan because they were either very young com-
panies or startups were finding success with equity financing.
I have to admit, I wouldn’t have thought equity funding would be much of 
a competitor for the bank, but they even suggested that some large banks 
were offering VC services. I have heard of a fairly large bank in Oklahoma 
that recently purchased a very large alternative funding company a couple 
of months ago. They felt like it enhanced the small business lending ser-
vices they could offer to business owners who might otherwise leave 
their bank looking for options someplace else.
Summary
In most cases, funding from angels or venture capitalists isn’t in the cards 
for Main Street business owners. The following chapters discuss some 
unique and very specialized financing options that level the playing field for 
many small business owners.

The Sun Will

Tomorrow
You Have Options
The last few chapters discussed the challenges associated with financing 
your small business at the bank and how only 10% of Main Street business 
owners actually leave the bank with the financing they’re looking for. You 
read about what I call the “myth of the shark tank” and learned why so 
few businesses attract a venture capitalist or angel investor.
If you’ve been turned down by a bank (which might be why you’re reading 
this book), you’re certainly not alone. What’s more, you still have options. 
I think the hardest part for most Main Street business owners is facing 
the reality that the bank isn’t interested in them and that they need to 
find alternative sources of financing. If you find yourself walking back to 
the car rejected by your banker, take an honest look at where you are and 
consider your options.
Remember, you do have options. 
Over the last several years, many small business lenders have entered 
the market, which is good news for small business borrowers. These are 
smaller community bankers who understand the importance of a healthy 
small business community or single-branch banks that serve a limited

geographic area. In addition, many non-bank lenders have entered the 
market in recent days.
These lenders typically specialize in different types of loans. They include 
commercial real estate lenders, factoring companies, credit card issuers, 
merchant cash advance lenders, and even lenders who specialize in fran-
chise loans, or loans for women in buisness. You’ll read about these in 
greater detail throughout the rest of this book.
Regardless of whether you go back to the bank that turned you down 
or decide to try one of the alternative lenders discussed throughout the 
book, you should start with what you’re presenting to the lender. Although 
alternative lenders are unlikely to hold you to the same standards as your 
local bank, they do expect you to be prepared to talk about your business, 
including what you intend to do with the proceeds of your loan and how 
you plan to repay it.
With that in mind, let’s revisit some of the information you need to pre-
pare your loan “package.”
Tip

  Alternatives to a loan from the local bank might be in places that small business 
owners wouldn’t normally investigate. Keep your mind open; the chapters to come discuss 
many alternatives.
Preparing Your Loan Package
Since the following information applies to any type of loan you might 
need—traditional bank loan or alternative financing—I describe a typical 
loan package. Your lender might not need all of this information, but it 
certainly doesn’t hurt to be prepared.
Because there is a substantial amount of paperwork associated with 
this process, you need to give some thought as to how you’ll organize 
your paperwork. I suggest a professional-looking notebook with sections 
divided by tabs, including a table of contents. The goal is to make it as easy 
as possible for the loan officer to find all the information she needs to 
process your application. The easier you make it for her, the more likely 
your application will get the attention it deserves.
Tip

■
  Come to the loan meeting with a professional-looking binder. It should contain all the 
information required for the lender to answer any/all questions about your application. It will also 
reflect well on you.
o

75
Getting a Business Loan
You might be interested to know that most loan officers don’t have the 
luxury of technology to help them through the loan process. Much of 
the paperwork is created and managed manually, which can make smaller 
loan amounts expensive to process. One lender confided to me that loan 
amounts under $250,000 were difficult for his bank because the paper-
work was so expensive it wasn’t worth the effort. It’s true that alternative 
lenders often do larger (and smaller) loans, but their bread and butter is 
often in the $40,000 to $50,000 range.
In addition to a tabbed binder of some kind, you might also want to think 
about scanning or otherwise including these same documents digitally. 
The digital soft copy will allow your loan officer to easily print any extra 
copies he might need for others involved in the decision-making process.
Here’s a rundown of what you need in your loan package. 
The Loan Summary
The loan summary should be the first section of your loan package. This 
document should stand alone and act as an executive summary of your 
loan proposal. It should be designed to create interest in your loan request. 
Think of the loan summary the same way you think of an executive sum-
mary of a business plan. It should include all the facts of the overall loan 
package. It’s best to create the loan summary after you’ve compiled the 
completed package. That way you don’t forget anything. 
Typical loan summary contents:
Company information
• 
Project description
• 
Company/project principal’s experience summary
• 
Sources and uses of funds
• 
Requested loan terms
• 
Summary of assets and collateral
• 
Project financial summary
• 
Current company/project financial summary
• 

Chapter 7 | The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow
76
Loan Package Format
Here’s what you need in the rest of the package: 
• 
A description of your business: Include background infor-
mation regarding how long you’ve been in business, 
and be sure to list all the owners. (For example: “My 
parents are not only my parents, they are also my 
business partners.” A lender wants to know all the 
players in the business who have any ownership.)
• 
The amount you are seeking and the reason(s):  This may 
be obvious, but the lender wants to know the amount 
you’re looking for, what you plan on doing with it, 
your plans for repayment, and any collateral that you 
can use to secure the loan (remember, lenders like to 
see skin in the game).
• 
Profiles of the business owners: Lenders, even alterna-
tive ones, like to mitigate risk as much as possible, 
so your lender will want to know the credentials of 
all the owners, their experience, and the roles they 
play within the organization. Your lender will likely 
also want to see their personal financial history—
including income tax statements, credit references, 
and a list of debt they carry.
• 
A detailed description of your product or service: Along 
with the description of your product or service, 
include a list of materials required to produce your 
product and any information you have regarding con-
sumer demand. Remember, the goal is to give lenders 
anything that will make it easier for them to approve 
your loan. The more information they have, the bet-
ter they’ll be able to understand and mitigate the 
risks associated with working with you.
• 
Forms and other paperwork: Before you submit your 
package, make sure you have all the applicable forms, 
including:
Any lease or mortgage agreements
• 
Proof of insurance coverage
• 
Profit-and-loss statements for the most recent 
• 
three years

77
Getting a Business Loan
Business federal income tax statements for the 
• 
past five years
Cash flow statements for a minimum of two 
• 
years
Copies of any licenses or permits
• 
Assessment of any inventory or equipment
• 
• 
Market research: Because so many businesses fail, your 
lender will probably ask you to demonstrate that you 
have a complete understanding of your business and 
the market. He will want to see any demographic 
research you’ve done, including why you think your 
product or service resonates with the marketplace, 
whether it meets a market need, if it’s something 
your customers are willing to pay for, and how you 
intend to market/sell to them.
• 
Industry analysis: Include what you know about your 
competition. List all of your competitors, including 
their addresses, how close they are to your business, 
their products or services, and how they compare to 
you (see the following sidebar, “Performing a SWOT 
Analysis”).
• 
Use of funds: Provide an outline of what you intend 
to do with the funds and what you expect the impact 
to be. A loan that facilitates growth is usually treated 
more favorably than a loan intended to keep your 
business afloat.
• 
Breakeven analysis: If your business is profitable and 
the loan is intended to capture additional market 
share, increase capacity, or hire additional employees, 
make that clear. If your business is not currently profit-
able, you need to indicate when you expect profits to 
equal expenses. 

Chapter 7 | The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow

PERFORMING A SWOT ANALYSIS
A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis helps identify 
the strengths and weaknesses of your business and of your competition. It helps 
illuminate opportunities to capture additional market share. It also helps you identify 
where your competition might capture market share from you. 
—	 Strengths: Ways in which your product or service is superior to the 
competition.
—	 Weaknesses: Ways in which your product or service needs 
improvements to compete better with its competitors.
—	 Opportunities: Advantages that you can exploit to capture additional 
market share.
—	 Threats: Situations, competitors, or products that could be a threat to 
your market position.
Why Alternative Lenders Might Be Better 
for You
Part of the reason that lending to very small businesses is so difficult for 
community bankers is because these businesses are competing for atten-
tion with firms doing up to $35 million in annual revenues and up to 1,500 
employees. Because the SBA considers such companies small businesses, 
so does your local bank. 
Although political candidates love to talk about how they’re trying to help 
the local plumber, hair salon, mechanic, or other Main Street business (the 
kind of establishments most Americans identify as small businesses), they’re 
actually doing the most good for the bigger firms described previously.
What’s more, after the financial meltdown of 2008, many banks abandoned 
the Main Street business owners who had been their bread-and-butter 
customers and moved upstream to service more established businesses 
looking for larger loan amounts.
Part of that decision is due to regulatory restrictions regarding whom they 
can lend to, but another part of the decision is due to the cost of underwrit-
ing and processing the loans. Despite the technology that otherwise perme-
ates the way we communicate with each other, interact with our favorite 
companies, and keep in touch with our customers and friends, bankers are 
still using manual processes when making decisions about your business 
and funding your small business loan. That means it’s just as expensive to 
process the $45,000 loan amount commonly requested by business ­owners 

79
Getting a Business Loan
on Main Street as it is to process the $250,000 or more loans needed to 
finance the working capital and growth needs of bigger firms.
Despite the negative impact on their local communities, it’s hard to blame 
the banker who chooses to lend to the $20 million dollar software com-
pany looking for $500,000 to increase their marketing efforts and hire 
another 200 or so employees instead of Jimmy’s Barbershop because 
Jimmy needs $10,000 to remodel his barbershop and upgrade to a new 
barber chair.
That’s not to say your local community bank (or even a community bank 
across the country) is never a good place to get a loan. Some savvy bankers  
have decided that doing business online is a good idea and they are  
working hard to make their small business loan products attractive to 
business owners who might never step into their bank. Some of them 
focus their online efforts within their current geographical footprint, but 
that’s not true of all of them. In fact, over the last couple of years many 
bankers are jumping into online small business lending regardless of where 
the business is located. 
Just What Is an Alternative Lender?
In fairness, alternative lender is a pretty broad term used to describe any 
non-bank lender. Although they have been considered financing resources 
of last resort by some business owners, as more and more alternative 
lenders enter the market to fill the vacuum left by the traditional banks, 
their terms and rates are getting more competitive.
I think this is a good thing for the roughly 90% of Main Street business 
owners who end up leaving the bank empty-handed.
Alternative lenders turn to often overlooked sources of collateral to 
secure a loan to a small business owner—real estate, accounts receiv-
ables, or even the monthly volume of credit card transactions. I don’t 
want to imply that your credit rating isn’t important to these lenders. 
It is, but it’s not the go/no-go metric used at most banks. Alternative 
lenders are typically more flexible than banks regarding repayment terms 
and loan-approval requirements. What’s more, they’re often much faster 
at processing your paperwork and funding your loan—hours or days 
as opposed to weeks or months. I recently spoke to one lender that 
prides itself on the number of loans they’re able to fund before the end of  
the day.
Some of these loan types have been around for hundreds of years. Much 
of the early exploration of the new world was funded by this type of 
investment financing, and although interest rates are typically higher than 

Chapter 7 | The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow

with traditional term loans, these lenders fill the gap for many Main Street 
business owners who don’t qualify for traditional bank loans. What’s 
more, although they do sometimes deal with much larger amounts, their 
bread and butter is the smaller loan amounts that Jimmy’s Barbershop or 
Bert’s Plumbing are looking for.
I recently spoke with a small book publisher who needed some cash to 
print a children’s book for a seasonal promotion. With a $35,000 advance 
on his monthly credit card transactions, he was able to go to market, meet 
his customer demand, capture a substantial profit, and repay his loan over 
the space of about six weeks. Had he relied on his local bank instead of 
non-traditional financing, he probably would have still been waiting for 
approval over the same six weeks. The quicker access to funding makes 
it possible to ramp up quickly and capture revenue that might otherwise 
be lost.

your particular financing needs and determine the best fit for your situ-
ation. A one-size-fits-all approach to this type of lending doesn’t fit, so 
make sure you ask questions and understand what you’re signing up for. 
Regrouping and Rethinking Your Desire for 
a Loan
Although non-traditional or alternative funding is sometimes a nearly per-
fect solution for a specific situation, turning to a merchant cash advance 
or other type of alternative financing to satisfy a long-term capital need 
is usually too expensive in the long haul. Too often, “hope-ium” and opti-
mism get confused and business owners think that an influx of cash will 
solve all of their problems. Perhaps instead, there are some fundamental 
issues within the business that you need to address before you try to get a 
loan. Sometimes just because you can get a loan with an alternative lender 
doesn’t mean you should. 
There are times when a loan is not a good idea. Sometimes the higher 
interest rates and terms of financing are simply too expensive. What’s 
more, there are situations when financing of any kind just isn’t a good idea. 

81
Getting a Business Loan
If you’re in any of the following situations, you might want to regroup and 
ask yourself whether financing your venture now is a good idea. In these 
cases, your business might be better served by exercising patience and 
waiting before borrowing:
• 
Your business is only an idea and not yet a business: You 
may have a really great idea for a business, but if that’s 
all you have, a loan probably isn’t a good idea right 
now. As already discussed, the bank wants to see a 
few years of business records, and ideas don’t create 
credit card receipts or accounts receivables, so a 
merchant cash advance or accounts receivable fac-
toring isn’t a realistic possibility. There are hard asset 
lenders, who are willing to take any hard assets you 
or your business own (jewelry, luxury cars, watches, 
equipment, and so on) and lend against a percentage 
of the value of those items, but you should consider 
them the same way you consider a pawn loan. They 
insist on holding your asset and the interest rate is 
untenable as a long-term solution.
If this describes your situation, you may need to turn 
to family, friends, or some sort of crowd-funding 
to secure financing. You might also consider find-
ing a partner with the ability to fund your venture. 
However, regrouping and waiting until you have busi-
ness income that you can secure a loan with is likely 
the best answer.
• 
You have no business income: Even if you have assets 
to borrow against, unless your product or service is 
going to be the next Facebook or Instagram, it might 
not be a good idea to put your assets at risk. I know 
there are a lot of small business owners who have 
pulled rabbits out of their hats, but the odds are not 
in your favor. If you’re getting your business started 
by taking on debt, remember you really are rolling 
the dice. 

Chapter 7 | The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow
82
• 
Your business is a startup and you have bad personal 
credit: In this case, it’s very unlikely you will ever 
get a loan. You need to spend the next 12 months 
rebuilding your credit and getting some legs under 
your business. Of course, there are payday loans and 
hard asset loans, but you need to accept that you 
won’t get a loan from a bank. Unless you are doing 
enough business to have other assets that an alter-
native lender would consider as collateral, there is 
no loan in your immediate future. The good news 
is, once your credit improves and you have another 
year or two under you, your odds of getting a loan 
dramatically improve.

 Don’t take out a business loan unless you have income and a plan for repayment.
Summary
The following chapters outline many of the most popular alternative 
options available to small business owners looking for capital. As more 
and more non-bank lenders enter the market, more Main Street business 
owners are finding the resources they need to grow and thrive. Even 
better, as the market has become more competitive in the last few 
years, interest rates are coming down and terms are improving for small   
business owners.
Although the idea of turning to alternative lending sources for capital 
might not be something you would have considered in the past, there are 
thousands of small business owners who have successfully leveraged unique 
and different options to build very successful businesses. The challenge 
is for borrowers to get used to this new paradigm.

Asset-Based 
Lending
Need a Piece of New Equipment?
When you’re applying for a loan, it helps to be specific. If the reason for 
the loan is to purchase machinery or tools (work vehicles, manufactur-
ing tools, computer hardware/software, and so on) needed to conduct 
business, there are lenders willing to use the purchased equipment as 
collateral. Many lenders like these asset-based loans and will finance 100% 
of them.
You can also acquire loans against equipment your business already owns.
What Qualifies for an Equipment Loan?
For the purpose of an equipment loan, any tangible asset that is essential 
to a company’s operations, and even equipment that is not essential but 
nonetheless necessary, qualifies. Equipment is generally moveable and may 
be more or less expensive than other fixed assets such as a building or 
real estate, but it is costly enough that it usually requires financing to 
purchase.
Trucks for transporting materials as well as telephones and computers 
are all examples of equipment. The forementioned examples of equip-
ment might be integral to doing business while other items—counting 
scales, work benches, or a pallet jack—might not be integral, but could be 
considered necessary. So they also also qualify.

Every major bank—and many alternative lenders—offer equipment loans. 
Some lenders specialize in different types of equipment loans. There are 
asset loans specific to construction equipment, farming and ranching, and 
computers and other high-tech equipment.

  Tech companies, farmers, contractors, and others can all find loans customized for 
their industry. These more specialized loans take into consideration industry conditions that 
might not apply elsewhere.
How the SBA Approaches Equipment Loans
This section describes the SBA’s CDC/504 loan program and explains 
how it applies to financing equipment. I briefly described this program 
­earlier, in Chapter 5, but let’s dig in a little deeper here.
To qualify for a CDC/504 loan, the small business must meet certain 
­eligibility requirements that include the following:
Must be a for-profit company
• 
Must do business in the United States
• 
Must have a net worth of less than $15 million and an 
• 
average net income of less than $5 million after taxes 
for the last two years
Cannot use the loan for speculation or rental real 
• 
estate
Must meet the general SBA eligibility requirements 
• 
discussed in Chapter 5
Must use the proceeds for an approved purchase—
• 
fixed assets like real estate or equipment
Must not have funds available from other sources
• 
Must have the ability to repay the loan on time from 
• 
the business’ projected operating cash flow
Must be able to demonstrate a historic willingness 
• 
and ability to pay their debts and that they have 
abided by the laws of their community
Must demonstrate relevant management expertise 
• 
and experience
Must have a feasible business plan in place
• 

Getting a Business Loan
85
You can use proceeds from a CDC/504 loan to purchase equipment, 
machinery, land, and existing buildings. You can even use them to make 
improvements to property, including such projects as grading, updating 
utilities, paving parking lots, and landscaping. Proceeds from the loan can 
also be used for the construction of new facilities, modernizing aging 
­facilities, renovating, or converting existing facilities.
Like most SBA loans designed for a specific purpose, loan proceeds can-
not be used for working capital or inventory, consolidating or refinancing 
another debt, or speculating or investing in rental property.
As with any SBA loan, if you want to apply for a CDC/504 loan, you 
need to find a local SBA lender and complete the appropriate paperwork 
­outlined in Chapter 5.
Tip
■
■
  A CDC/504 loan from the SBA can be a good deal—rates are pegged at slightly above 
the current yield on 5- and 10-year Treasury securities. The fee is 3% of the total amount,  
but that can be financed as well.
Other Types of  Asset-Based Lending
Another way to acquire the equipment you need to operate your business 
is to lease instead of buy. There are options for leasing just about any-
thing you need to operate a business—computers, heavy equipment, even 
complete offices. Whether you purchase or lease your equipment largely 
depends on the type of business and the nature of the equipment.
The Equipment Leasing Association of America claims that about 80% of 
U.S. companies lease some or all of the equipment they use. Depending on 
your circumstances, leasing can be problematic or can offer some pretty 
attractive advantages:
There is usually a lower monthly payment when  
• 
compared to a loan.
You can get a fixed versus floating interest rate in 
• 
some cases.
Lease payments can generally be expensed rather 
• 
than amortized, potentially reducing your taxes in the 
short term (you should consult your tax advisor to 
determine if that’s the case for you).

Chapter 8 | Asset-Based Lending
86
You may be able to avoid tying up cash flow with a 
• 
down payment.
You can utilize the most up-to-date business 
• 
equipment.
Note
■
■
  In many cases, you can expense your lease payments rather than amortize the asset 
purchase over many years. This will reduce your taxes in the short term. Check with your 
accountant to ensure you can take advantage of the opportunity.
Of course, you should also consider some of the disadvantages:
You will probably pay a higher price for the equip-
• 
ment in the long term (depending on the terms of 
the lease).
You are making a commitment to keeping the equip-
• 
ment for at least the term of the lease, which can 
be problematic if your need for the equipment  
fluctuates or diminishes.
If you decide to keep any leased equipment, you may 
• 
need to purchase it after the lease terms are met.
Every lease decision is unique. Make sure you compare the short-term 
and long-term costs when determining whether to lease or purchase. You 
want to ask questions like:
What is the cost of the lease?
• 
What am I saving as a result of the lease?
• 
How do those numbers compare to the cost of 
• 
­purchasing the equipment?
What costs are associated with getting out of the 
• 
lease early?
Much like the financing options available when purchasing equipment, 
there are many ways to acquire a lease:
• 
Banks: Not all banks offer equipment leasing, but the 
ones that do typically offer lower interest rates. Be 
sure to verify whether they service the lease after 
you’ve signed on the dotted line.

Getting a Business Loan
87
• 
Equipment dealers: In much the same way your auto 
dealer can finance your new car, equipment dealers  
can help you secure a lease on a new piece of  
equipment. They can also help you with other financing 
options. These agreements are usually with an inde-
pendent leasing company.
• 
Independent leasing companies: Much like banks, inde-
pendent leasing companies come in all shapes and 
sizes and offer a number of leasing options.
• 
Captive leasing companies: These are subsidiaries of 
the equipment manufacturers.
• 
Brokers: Much like mortgage or real estate brokers, 
brokers charge a fee to act as an agent between the 
lessor and the lessee. They are a small percentage of 
the market.
“Personal Asset” Lenders: Keep Your Eyes 
Wide Open
As banks and other traditional lenders tightened credit requirements 
over the last couple of years, hard asset or personal asset lenders (basi-
cally business pawnbrokers) found a niche with small business owners 
who needed quick cash for special projects or cash flow.
Just like pawning your diamond ring (in fact, depending on the ring, you 
could find luck using a ring as collateral for a small business loan), these 
personal asset lenders will take jewelry, luxury cars, and equipment. Unlike 
traditional pawnbrokers, these lenders claim they cater to a higher-end 
clientele and offer loans up to $1 million, depending on the collateral.
I recently spoke with a personal asset lender who suggested that this type 
of financing is a good way for small business owners to fill short-term 
capital needs.
This new source of money can be obtained from online lenders who 
will allow you to use your personal luxury assets as collateral. Interest 
rates are typically 6% per month, so they are too expensive for long-term 
financing. However, they are proving to be popular with some entrepre-
neurs who need quick cash to take advantage of a special offer or seize an 
unexpected opportunity to grow their business.

Chapter 8 | Asset-Based Lending
88
Some of the items typically used as collateral to secure a short-term, 
hard-asset loan include:
Gold and diamond jewelry
• 
Luxury watches like Rolex, Breitling, and Piaget
• 
Classic cars like a 1972 Mercedes Benz or even a 
• 
1960 Ducati motorcycle
You should also be aware that personal asset lenders expect to hold the 
collateral as security (like a pawnbroker). So if the lender is not close, they 
will require you to ship the merchandise to them or they will arrange to 
hold it in a secure location.
Note
■
■
  Personal asset lenders charge as much as 6% a month on loans. Be sure you have 
a short-term need for cash and a solid plan to pay the loan back quickly.
Some of the advantages touted by personal asset lenders include:
The entire transaction can take place in less than  
• 
24 hours
There are no credit checks or lengthy loan 
• 
applications
The personal asset loan allows you to tap into the 
• 
equity of your luxury assets to secure capital
You do not need a personal guarantee: your asset 
• 
fully supports the loan as collateral
This type of financing isn’t the best option for everyone, but if you need 
short-term cash in a hurry, don’t have a line of credit, or your credit isn’t 
the best, this is one way to fill the need. Just make sure you have a plan for 
repaying the loan—6% per month adds up quickly.
Is an Equipment Loan a Good Option  
for You?
Fueling growth is one of the primary reasons most small business  
owners turn to the bank for help. I spoke with a small business owner 
from California not long ago. His business had been steadily growing prior 
to 2008, but following the financial meltdown, his bank recalled the line of 
credit he was using to fund his growth.

Getting a Business Loan
89
Even though he had a healthy business and a good credit rating, the  
tightening of credit by his bank hamstringed his ability to grow. Cash  
flow kept his business going, but didn’t allow for growth. This is not an 
uncommon scenario on Main Street.
If you need capital equipment to grow your business, an equipment loan 
might be your best financing option. There can also be tax incentives to 
financing the equipment you need to do business—including a potential 
one-time write-off and depreciation throughout the economic life of the 
equipment.
Equipment loans for specific industries make it relatively simple to acquire 
the financing you need. There are specialized loans for the following:
Restaurants
• 
Construction
• 
Entertainment
• 
Dental and medical practices
• 
Landscaping
• 
Machine tools
• 
Technology
• 
Heavy equipment
• 
Farm equipment
• 
Office equipment
• 
Equipment financing or leasing makes it possible for small business owners 
to purchase the equipment they need, optimize depreciation, and maintain 
liquidity of other financial resources to manage cash flow.
Note
■
■
  When you actually purchase certain equipment—like computers, machinery, office 
furniture, and so on—these purchases can be written off entirely in the current year rather than 
amortized over time. Talk with your accountant about Section 179 tax deductions (and also 
bonus depreciation) to determine which option makes sense in your situation.
Finding a Lender
Your small business might start with an SBA CDC/504 loan with an affili-
ated bank and include the other options listed earlier. If the SBA option 
isn’t for you, don’t fret that financing provided at the dealership is your 
only option.

Chapter 8 | Asset-Based Lending
90
A quick Google search for “equipment loans” returned 109,000,000 
results. Many of them include traditional large banks and community banks. 
Some specialize in farm equipment or medical equipment, for example, 
but there are a lot of options.
Just like when choosing the right bank, it’s important to choose the right 
partner to help you with your equipment-financing needs. I use the word 
“partner” intentionally, because although an equipment loan is usually 
considered an intermediate term loan (it will probably be 15 years or 
less), you’ll still be connected to that lender over the course of the loan. 
With that in mind, consider these questions when looking for an equip-
ment loan provider:
Do they understand my industry and the equipment 
• 
I need to do business?
Are they local, or will I be working with someone 
• 
online? (There are some very attractive online 
options today.)
If my lender is online, are they available if I have 
• 
questions?
Are the loan terms competitive?
• 
Have I shopped around enough to know that I’m  
• 
getting the best deal for my situation?
Do they have any happy customers in my area?
• 
Do they publish customer testimonials?
• 
Do I like working with them?
• 
In addition to researching the costs and terms of your equipment pur-
chase, make sure you research the company you’re going to finance that 
purchase with. You should do this regardless of whether you choose to 
work with a bank, a dealer, or even decide to lease.
Standard Equipment Loan Terms
Approvals are typically based on credit scores, collateral (usually the 
equipment being financed), financial history, and the market value of  
the equipment.
Typical interest rate: 8%–25%
• 
Typical time to funding: 1–3 months
•

In addition to providing the loan package described in Chapter 7, be sure 
to include specifics about the equipment you’re purchasing, what you’ll be 
using it for, and how it will improve your ability to increase revenue.
Summary
This chapter described how to secure financing in order to purchase 
equipment needed for your business. Many small business owners find 
that equipment financing is a very successful way to acquire the financing 
they need.
Factoring, covered in Chapter 9, is the chosen finance method for many 
businesses and has been around for a long time. Although it was once con-
sidered a financing option of last resort, factoring is becoming a ­popular 
solution for small businesses with short-term capital needs.

Factoring
Tap Into Your Accounts Receivable
Factoring, which involves offering your accounts receivable (AR) to 
another party at a discount in exchange for immediate cash, has been 
around for a long time. Its origins lie in international trade and it’s said to 
have started in the ancient world. The Europeans were factoring AR prior 
to 1400 and the idea came to America with the pilgrims. It’s the financial 
tool that wealthy financiers used to fund shipping companies to make the 
long voyages to the Orient or the New World to bring back goods like 
spices, cloth, tobacco, and other precious commodities.
In the truest sense, factoring isn’t a loan. The factor (the person or com-
pany who assumes the liability of the AR) isn’t as interested in the credit 
worthiness of the small business owner as they are in the credit worthi-
ness of the small business’ customers. In non-recourse factoring, the factor 
assumes the liability of the AR, but that isn’t always the case. In the United 
States, if the factor doesn’t assume the credit risk and is unable to collect, 
courts will recharacterize the transaction as a secured loan—putting the 
risk squarely back on the shoulders of the small business owner. Make 
sure you understand all the terms and fine print before you sign on the 
dotted line.
There are basically three parties directly involved in a factoring 
agreement:
The small business owner who sells the receivable
• 
The customer of the seller (the account debtor)
• 
The factor
•

Chapter 9 | Factoring
94
Many small business owners turn to factoring when their current cash 
flow doesn’t meet their needs, but their AR would be enough if they 
had immediate access to the funds. Although factoring was traditionally 
considered an option of last resort, it’s become less expensive for the 
small business owner in recent years. It’s grown in popularity as banks 
and other traditional small business financing options have tightened up 
the money supply, making traditional financing problematic for small  
business owners.
There are also some industries, like textiles and apparel, that use factoring 
because it’s the historic method of financing such businesses.
Invoice f inancing (another name for factoring) is relatively easy to get, 
although it can be more expensive than traditional financing. Nevertheless, 
the terms are less restrictive and the funds are available much more 
quickly—making it an attractive option for many business owners.
Note
■
■
  The terms for factoring are less restrictive than traditional financing, and the cash is 
available much more swiftly.
Not too long ago I was speaking with a consultant who had landed a fairly 
substantial contract. Like many small businesses in this situation, the com-
pany needed a short-term loan or another line of credit to bridge the gap 
between the time the contract was initiated and when they would start 
seeing cash flow from the contract. Unfortunately, they were turned down 
by all the banks they approached.
Sometimes the problem with securing a large contract is that the com-
pany then needs to ramp up employee hiring or buy new equipment 
to fulfill it. That was the case for this business owner. When the banks 
said no, the company had to turn to other sources of cash flow to fulfill  
the contract.
They weren’t able to get a short-term loan from the bank, but they were 
able to factor their AR. They acquired the short-term financing they 
needed to do business. Although this type of financing isn’t for every-
one, it does fill a real need for small businesses that banks aren’t filling  
right now.

95
Is Factoring a Good Choice for Your 
Situation?
If you use a factor to handle all your accounts receivable, it does come 
with a cost (usually 2-6% of the invoice). Some factors charge more, which 
can eat into profit margins pretty quickly. To determine whether factoring 
is right for you, there are a few questions you need to ask yourself.
Is Your AR Stretched and Causing Cash Flow 
Problems? 
Offering terms to your customers may be a way to increase sales, but net 
30-day terms sometimes end up being 40–45 days. If your small business is 
running on thin margins, things can be painful at the end of the month.
In my own experience, it didn’t take long for me to understand that if a 
customer took over 45 days to pay an invoice, I lost whatever profit I had 
in that invoice. I didn’t turn to factoring, because I was afraid of the costs. 
Because I didn’t really understand factoring at the time and didn’t consider 
the cost of the time I wasted in collections, it hurt my profitability. Not to 
mention how it diverted me from what was really important—running my 
business. The 2–6% I would have spent on a factor would probably have 
been cheaper for me in the long run. My customers always paid me; they 
just didn’t always pay me within 30–45 days.
Do You Miss Out on Opportunities to Grow  
Because Cash Flow Is Too Tight? 
It’s been said, “It takes money to make money.” That may be true, but it 
doesn’t tell the entire story. For a Main Street business owner, it takes 
cash flow to seize opportunities and grow. Many small businesses run into 
cash flow issues when a big order or a new contract opportunity presents 
itself and cash is tied up in AR.
Earlier in 2013, the National Small Business Association (NSBA) released 
its 2013 Mid-Year Economic Report.1 It claimed, “Today, just two-thirds of 
small businesses (65%) report they are able to obtain adequate financing, 
down from 73% six months ago.”

Chapter 9 | Factoring
96
When Main Street business owners struggle to find the cash they need 
to capitalize on a special opportunity through traditional means, they  
have only a couple of options. They can pass on the new opportunity or 
look for alternatives. In many cases, factoring is the alternative they’re 
looking for.
Are You Spending a Lot of Time in Collections?
When AR is stretched and cash flow is tight, it’s not unusual for small 
business owners to spend more and more time trying to collect from 
customers instead of spending the time they need selling to customers. 
Granted, back-office tasks like collecting are critical to your small business 
success, but every minute spent doing administrative tasks like collecting 
from customers is time you can’t spend in front of customers solving 
problems or selling.
Most of us don’t start a small business with the idea of being an accoun-
tant or collection agent (unless that’s your business). Factoring your AR 
when cash flow is tight helps alleviate these distractions so you can focus 
on other, maybe more important, parts of your business.
Would Quicker Access to Your Cash Flow Allow 
You to Take Advantage of Supplier Discounts? 
Many suppliers offer discounts to customers who pay their invoices in 
10 days or less. You may even be able to negotiate better terms, with the 
cash in hand, and pay your accounts payable quickly. You may even be able 
to cancel out the cost of capital—or at least a portion of it.
Are Other Credit Accounts Maxed Out? 
Because factoring your AR is not the same thing as a loan or revolving line 
of credit, your ability to acquire cash is not based on the same criteria. 
When you’re behind the eight ball with cash flow, it doesn’t take long to 
max out credit cards or a line of credit. If your business is doing well and 
you have a healthy accounts receivable, a factor will allow you to borrow 
against 80% and sometimes even 90% of your AR. If your AR supports the 
transaction, the terms are the same whether you’re borrowing $5,000, 
$10,000, $100,000, or even $10,000,000 or more.

The Nuts and Bolts of Factoring
Consider this example of how factoring works, which is pretty simple. 
Because the textile industry has been using factors to finance the  
manufacture and distribution of clothing, they provide a pretty straight-
forward example. When a clothing manufacturer sells a line of clothing 
to a department store chain, they deliver the clothes and send an invoice. 
The factor (sometimes a bank, but many times an alternative lender who 
specializes in factoring AR) pays the manufacturer a portion of the invoice 
immediately (typically around 80%, but sometimes more).
Tip
■
■
  Need money fast? A factor, after assessing the creditworthiness of your customers, 
might give you as much as 80% of the value of your receivables immediately.
The factor then collects the invoice from the department store chain, 
deducts their fees, and forwards the rest of the invoice to the manufac-
turer. So if the factor paid you 80% of an invoice of $100,000, the transac-
tion might look like this:
The factor pays 80% of your original invoice ($80,000) now. Once the 
factor collects the invoice from the customer, they deduct the amount 
you’ve already been paid ($100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000) and then deduct 
their fee (if you are paying 5% to the factor, $100,000 – 5% or $5,000 = 
$15,000), forwarding to you the additional $15,000.
If you’re working with margins greater than 5%, this scenario could be a 
great option—depending on how much it costs you to collect the money 
yourself or your need to have quicker access to the lion’s share of your 
invoice.
Factoring Doesn’t Carry the Same Stigma  
It Once Did
There was a time when your customers may have looked down their 
noses at you for using a factor, but that’s not the case these days. Factoring 
has become a legitimate source of capital for many small business owners 
since 2008 and the subsequent credit crunch. In fact, many national banks 
act as factors in some industries and consider it part of their “asset-based 
commercial lending” portfolio. Banks and other non-bank factors recog-
nize that a small business owner might not be able to afford to wait 
around for a large company like Walmart to pay an invoice, but they know 
that Walmart will eventually pay.

Chapter 9 | Factoring
98
What’s more, the accounts receivable departments in most companies 
aren’t going to think any less of you if you choose to use a factor. It’s 
become just another part of doing business.
Unlike the bank, a factor is more interested in your future than your 
credit history. Basically, if a factor is willing to work with you, you can be 
confident they see money in your future.
A factor can also provide insight into the creditworthiness of your  
customers. Because they are more interested in your customer’s ability 
to pay their debts, they’ll likely do credit research on anyone who owes 
you money—giving you a valuable look into the creditworthiness of your 
customers. If the factor isn’t interested in purchasing your invoices, it’s a 
possible indication that you might have trouble collecting down the road.
Picking the Right Factor
Just as with any important financial transaction, it’s important to know 
what you’re looking for before you sign on the dotted line—particularly 
when the financial health of your business is concerned. Here are a few 
questions you should ask a potential factor to help you pick the right one:
• 
Do they understand your market? This sounds like a 
pretty basic question, but you need someone who 
understands enough about your market to ensure 
they can quickly and successfully evaluate the cred-
itworthiness of your customers and approve the 
highest number of them as possible. If a factor won’t 
work with your customers, he isn’t going to do you 
much good. Some factors are more comfortable in 
some industries than others; this is something you 
need to know before you choose a factor. 
• 
What is the cost of the services? Although there are 
some pretty standard fees and interest rates, some-
times factoring can feel like buying a used car. The 
quality and financial stability of your customers can 
determine your fees and interest rates.

the last minute about a fee or charge that wasn’t discussed. As always, read the fine print.

Can you see their references? Any reputable factor 
will be more than willing to share references with 
you—but I wouldn’t stop there. Your banker, your 
accountant, your lawyer, or maybe even one of your 
friends at the Chamber of Commerce might have a 
recommendation.
Finding a Reputable Factor
A Google search for “accounts receivable factoring” reveals more than 
500,000 results. A good place to start, but I wouldn’t stop there. Your tax 
accountant, attorney, or banker are also good resources. Some factors 
specialize in particular industries, so you’ll want to make sure you find out 
if they are familiar with your industry, they seem like people you’d want 
to work with, and have terms you can afford and feel comfortable with. 
You may also find that the same bank that turned you down for a small 
business loan is interested in factoring your AR.
Standard Terms for AR Factoring
Although you’ll likely pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 2%–6%, don’t 
forget it’s a lot like buying a used car—rates are sometimes negotiable 
depending on the credit health of your customers, the amount receivable 
on the invoices, and the factor. Make sure you understand all the costs, 
because they aren’t all the same.
Summary
This chapter discussed leveraging your accounts receivable to meet  
short-term capital needs. The next chapter covers financing designed for 
purchasing commercial real estate.
Many lenders, including banks and credit unions, will provide a commercial 
real estate loan to a small business owner whom they would not lend to 
otherwise. This long-term financing option can be used to purchase new 
real estate or as collateral for other purposes.

Loans
Location, Location, Location
Many alternative loan products are designed to fill a specific need. 
Commercial real estate loans are designed to help small business owners 
finance office buildings, warehouse space, retail shops, industrial buildings, 
or other stand-alone buildings. Like a home mortgage, this type of loan 
typically has longer payment terms than the other small business loans 
you’ve read about.
Start with the CDC/504
A good place to start a discussion about commercial real estate loans 
is with the SBA’s CDC/504 loan program, introduced in Chapter 5. The 
short answer to the question of what a 504 loan can be used for is the 
purchase of land (including existing buildings), improvements (including 
grading, street improvements, utilities, parking lots, and landscaping), and 
the construction of new facilities or modernizing, renovating, or convert-
ing existing facilities. A borrower cannot use proceeds from a 504 loan for 
working capital, inventory, consolidating or refinancing debt, or specula-
tive investment in rental real estate.

Unlike many of the other alternative financing options available to small 
business owners, the 504 loan program provides the same type of long-
term, fixed-rate financing enjoyed by larger firms, with interest rates simi-
lar to the bond market. (I provide more details about the 504 near the 
end of the chapter.)
Just as with any other traditional bank loan, your chances of qualifying 
depend on your credit score, your annual revenues, your ability to repay 
the loan, and your collateral. Let’s take a closer look.
The Three Cs of Commercial Real Estate 
Lending
An easy way to look at the qualifying process for a real estate loan is 
to use the Three Cs. Your lender will likely be using this or something 
similar.
Collateral
Prior to 2007, most lenders would regularly approve commercial loans at 
75% loan-to-value. Some lenders even went higher than that. Unfortunately, 
property values plummeted 45 to 50% during the 2008 recession, and 
these lenders lost a lot of money. Today, the loan-to-value ratios on com-
mercial real estate are closer to 60%. To illustrate the problem, I recently 
spoke with a borrower who was defaulting on an SBA loan he had secured 
with roughly $1 million in commercial real estate. Although the loan was 
collateralized with the real estate, the property lost about 50% of its 
value—not enough to satisfy the loan. After speaking with his attorney, 
he got the bad news that he would probably lose his home and all his 
personal property, which still wouldn’t come close to satisfying the debt. 
The original loan likely had too high a loan-to-value ratio, leaving him and 
his banker in the lurch. That’s not to say you can’t get approved at higher 
than 60%, but you need impeccable credit, strong revenues, and a superior 
track record in business.
Note
■
■
  If the real estate is occupied, the lender might provide up to 75% of the appraised 
value. If the real estate is improved but not occupied, you can expect 50%. If the real estate is 
vacant and unimproved, it will likely be much less.

Cash Flow
One of the primary questions you need to answer is whether your busi-
ness cash flow can accommodate the monthly obligations associated with 
the loan. Although there are a number factors that impact the way any 
particular lender evaluates your business’ cash flow numbers, a good 
starting point is a 1.15:1 ratio of available cash to debt payments. This is 
not a hard and fast ratio used by every bank.
The most important cash flow question your lender will want answered is 
whether your business’ ongoing sales and collections represent a reliable 
source of cash that can be used to successfully repay the loan.
Note
■
■
  A business’ cash flow is not limited to the money that goes in and out of a business 
checking account to operate the business. It also includes any cash flow from investments or 
other financial activities (payments and receipts or interest and dividends, long-term contracts, 
insurance, sales, or purchases of machinery, leases, and so on).
Credit Rating
It’s been a tough few years for small business owners, particularly those 
on Main Street. Robbing Peter to pay Paul may keep the doors open this 
month, but it takes its toll on individual and business credit ratings. Some 
lenders will accept a lower credit rating than others, but the first thing 
every lender wants to know is your credit score(s). And yes, if you own 
a Main Street business, it’s likely they’ll look at your business score and 
your personal score.
Additionally, the younger your company is, the more weight they give to 
your personal credit score. For example, idea-stage startups, and those 
with only a couple of years in business, can expect the lender to give more 
weight to personal credit scores. If you have great personal credit, that’s 
not a problem. Conversely, a startup at the idea stage with a founder who 
has no track record, no income, and bad personal credit is not likely to 
get a loan.

Here are some ideas for increasing the amount and speed of cash flowing into your 
business while at the same time limiting the flow outward:
• 
Pay off or refinance debt and renegotiate with creditors. If 
possible, pay off the debt or refinance the debt for a longer 
term with lower payments. You may also be able to renegotiate 
some payment terms with other creditors.
• 
Focus on collecting receivables. I discovered that whatever 
profit was in a particular invoice was lost if collections went 
longer than 45 days. What’s more, the older the invoices 
became, the less likely they were to be paid.
• 
Give your customers incentives for paying cash. If you can 
tighten your credit terms without losing customers, you’ll 
increase the amount of cash on hand. Offer a discount to 
customers who pay their invoices quickly (within 10 days, for 
example).
• 
Increase revenues. Although this is certainly easier said than 
done, poor cash flow is a red flag to lenders (and should be to 
you) that you need to increase your sales volume.
• 
Reduce inventory. Many businesses utilize a “just in time” 
inventory strategy to keep their inventory to a minimum. Many 
suppliers are willing to help you more efficiently manage 
inventory by supporting your inventory with theirs. Creating 
an efficient supply chain helps businesses at many levels, 
including a reduction in your cash flow needs. 
• 
Review tax strategies that could improve cash flow. Tax credits 
are often available for renovating qualified buildings. You may 
also be able to take advantage of accelerated depreciation 
on certain equipment and tangible property to increase your 
short-term tax deductions.
These are just a few ideas for putting your business on a better footing before you 
visit your banker or lender.
Important Questions to Ask Before You 
Sign on the Dotted Line
If this is your first time seeking a commercial real estate loan, you should 
know it’s not the small business equivalent of a home mortgage. Because 
commercial lenders are a lot more risk averse, they’re likely going to dig 
SIX TIPS TO IMPROVE YOUR CASH FLOW

Getting a Business Loan

into your business financials as well as the commercial property that will 
be the collateral for the loan. In other words, don’t go into this transac-
tion with the same expectations you have for a home mortgage.
Before you apply for the loan, make sure you ask these questions and 
know the answers:
• 
How will you repay the loan? It’s not uncommon for a 
commercial real estate loan to include a balloon pay-
ment at the end of the loan. If you haven’t set aside 
enough savings to pay the balloon payment, you might 
need to acquire another loan to pay off the balance. This 
can be problematic if cash flow is poor during the years 
leading up to the final payment, making it difficult to 
acquire a loan. You could ultimately risk foreclosure.
Depending on your industry, if the lender perceives 
a higher risk in your industry (remember, all lenders 
are risk averse), he may decide to deny future lending 
to anyone in your industry—including you.
There are non-bank, alternative commercial lenders 
who will make a commercial real estate loan without 
a balloon payment. Such loans typically incur a point 
or two higher interest, but work more like a tradi-
tional mortgage. It might feel like you’re looking into 
a crystal ball to determine what your business’ finan-
cial position will be at the end of your loan, but it’s 
something to consider before you close your loan.
• 
Can you wait out the loan process? Most borrowers start 
by visiting their local bank. A commercial real estate 
loan from a traditional bank normally includes more 
stringent requirements and takes the longest time to 
close when compared to an alternative lender.
Banks typically go through several phases of review 
before they approve a loan. They look at your historical 
income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow. They 
also want at least the last five years of tax returns of 
any of the owners who will guarantee the loan.
You can expect the process to take several weeks 
before you receive a verbal or written commitment 
from the bank. Yet, there is still time for the bank’s 
credit committee to veto the loan. If you have great 
credit and a good relationship with your bank, you 
might be able to streamline the process, but be aware, 
the bank is in no rush to process your loan. In other 

Chapter 10 | Commercial Real Estate Loans
106
words, the process takes a long time, regardless of 
your desire to get things accomplished quickly. That’s 
true even if you have solid earnings and a good track 
record with the bank.
You are likely to get the lowest interest rate from a 
bank. Although non-traditional lenders can respond 
quicker and might even pre-qualify you in a couple of 
days, the interest rate will be higher.
• 
What types of covenants and conditions are required? 
A commercial real estate loan often requires more 
than simply making timely payments. In addition to 
monthly payments, some lenders require a quarterly 
annual income statement, balance sheets, and tax 
returns on a regular basis over the lifetime of the 
loan. They may even require a specified debt-to-cash 
flow ratio, which can become problematic during a 
downturn.
Even when you make your monthly payments on 
time, if you don’t comply with the other covenants 
and conditions, your bank might determine you are in 
default. This triggers a number of penalties, including 
having to pay back the loan immediately.
This happened to our family business several years 
ago. My parents purchased a warehouse and were 
making payments when an industry downturn threat-
ened to impact their business along with a number of 
their competitors in the area. In a knee-jerk reaction 
to the bad news, their banker gave them 10 days to 
pay off their loan or lose the property. Instead of run-
ning their business, they had to drop everything and 
work to find another lender willing to finance their 
building.
Different lenders require different conditions, so be 
sure you understand exactly what will be required of 
you over the course of the loan. In addition to some 
of the differences already outlined, some alternative 
lenders will waive any other conditions except for 
the timely repayment of the loan.
If your financials aren’t regularly audited by a CPA 
firm, you may want to consider an alternative lender 
and pay the higher interest rate. It might relax the 
reporting requirements.

Getting a Business Loan

• 
What type of documents are required? Most lenders 
require at least three to five years of financial state-
ments, income tax returns, any current leases, asset 
statements, relevant corporate documents, and per-
sonal tax returns of the business owners. Putting 
together a loan package similar to the one described 
in earlier chapters is a great place to start.
It’s always a good idea—before meeting with the 
lender—to find out what documentation he requires 
so you can go into the meeting prepared.
• 
What happens if you decide to sell the property? Unlike 
with a home mortgage, there are usually pre-payment 
penalties. However, some lenders will allow the new 
buyer of your property to assume your loan (if they 
qualify), potentially making it easier to sell the prop-
erty and get out from under the loan.
• 
Are there hidden costs? In this regard, a commercial 
real estate loan is a lot like a home mortgage. There 
are a number of hidden costs you’ll need to be aware 
of. I remember when I purchased my first home, in 
addition to the interest rate I was quoted, there were 
fees and charges due at closing that amounted to an 
extra percent or two. Some of the fees you should 
watch for include:
a.	
Legal fees
b.	 Survey charges
c.	 Loan application fees
d.	 Appraisal charges
Each of these fees and charges must be either 
charged against your loan or pre-paid. Depending on 
the property, some of these charges can amount to 
tens of thousands of dollars. Because some of these 
fees must be paid before your loan is approved or 
rejected, be sure to confer with your banker as to 
your chances of getting the loan.
Be sure you know whether the interest rate will 
change with the prime rate, the bond market, or 
some other indicator. There are advantages to fixed 
rates and variable rates, but rates seldom go down.

sure you ask potential lenders all these questions beforehand so you can make an informed 
decision.
Is a Commercial Real Estate Loan a Good 
Idea for Your Small Business?
There are a number of reasons a commercial real estate loan could be a 
good idea for your business.
A Real Estate-Secured Line of Credit
Many banks allow small business owners to establish a line of credit 
secured against the real estate the business owns. This can enable the 
business owner to leverage the equity in their property for a higher line 
of credit than might otherwise be available.
A Real Estate-Secured Loan
Although the SBA CDC/504 loan program doesn’t allow you to use the 
proceeds for other purposes, there are other lenders who will allow you 
to use the equity of your business property for other purposes, including 
working capital, inventory, and consolidating or refinancing debt.
A Real Estate-Secured Loan to Refinance  
an Existing Commercial Mortgage
Business owners who want to take advantage of a lower interest rate or 
better covenants or conditions might opt to refinance their current real 
estate loan.

Getting a Business Loan
109
A Real Estate-Secured Loan for the Purpose  
of Purchasing Commercial Property
This is the primary intent of the SBA’s 504 loan program. These loans 
are designed to enable small business owners to purchase property to 
conduct business. What’s more, if this is the reason you are seeking a 
commercial real estate loan, the 504 program is a great option. The SBA 
CDC/504 loan program has many advantages, including:
• 
Unlike most commercial real estate loans, a 504 loan is 
designed to finance the total project cost. That includes 
existing structures, construction/renovation costs, 
furniture, fixtures, and equipment. The ability to roll 
these costs into the loan instead of pre-paying them 
can be beneficial to Main Street business owners.
• 
504 loans have lower equity requirements than conven-
tional commercial financing options. This keeps less of 
the borrower’s capital tied up and more of it available 
for running the business.
• 
The 504 loan terms are often more attractive. The rates 
are usually below market. For example, in 2013, they 
were between 4.2 and 5.2%.
Where Should You Look for a Loan?
Banks, credit unions, brokers, and a number of alternative lenders offer 
commercial real estate loans. Depending on your credit rating, the 
nature of the loan, and other factors listed in this chapter, you can make  
a choice.
If you’re not sure where to start, a quick search on Google will intro-
duce you to over 30 million potential lenders. If you want to narrow it 
down from there, commercial real estate brokers can recommend their 
favorite lenders. Additionally, your attorney or CPA can probably make 
recommendations.
Standard Terms for Commercial Real Estate 
Loans
Other than the terms already discussed in this chapter, most commercial 
lenders will offer loan terms up to 10 years with a balloon payment or 
up to 15 years with full amortization. Interest rates are difficult to quote 
as they fluctuate so much, but expect to pay around 0.5% of the amount 
financed up front (it could be more or less, depending on the lender).

Summary
Commercial real estate loans can help business owners acquire long-term 
financing to purchase property or help them leverage the equity in cur-
rently owned property to obtain capital. The next chapter discusses the 
merchant cash advance, which is a distant cousin of factoring.
Like factoring, which leverages a small business’ accounts receivables, a 
merchant cash advance leverages a small business’ regular and predictable 
credit card transactions to access capital for short-term capital needs.

The Merchant 
Cash Advance
Credit or Debit?
Young businesses, even thriving ones, often struggle to find the cash they 
need to grow and operate. If they’ve been in business less than five years, 
they don’t have a track record. If they’ve been operating on a shoestring, 
they probably don’t have the best credit rating. I know several young 
entrepreneurs who used their personal credit cards to keep the doors 
open—which can sometimes be problematic from a credit-management 
perspective.
A merchant cash advance (MCA) isn’t really a loan. It is an advance based 
on the volume of cash that flows through a company’s merchant cash 
account—in other words, the monthly flow of credit card transactions 
you have each month. A regular, predictable flow of credit card transac-
tions can be all a young and thriving company needs to secure financing 
for working capital or expansion, even when they don’t have a 720 credit 
score or a big wad of cash in the bank.
Note
■
■
  Although it’s not technically a loan, a merchant cash advance is often referred to as 
an MCA loan by those who offer this type of financing.
11
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 11 | The Merchant Cash Advance
112
That doesn’t mean MCA lenders don’t look at your credit rating. They 
do. In fact, just as with any other loan, the lender will ask you about your 
credit rating, time in business, monthly revenues, and so on. They just 
happen to rate the number and amount of your credit card transactions 
as more relevant.
Where Did MCAs Come From?
AdvanceMe, then based out of Kennesaw, Georgia, was the first (and only) 
such lender a decade or so ago. Since that time, dozens more have entered 
the market, which has bloomed from less than $10 million to well over 
half a billion dollars a year. Because capital has been so difficult for Main 
Street businesses to acquire in recent years, MCA lenders are aggressively 
looking for (and finding) borrowers who meet the right profile.
Although it’s not uncommon to hear this type of financing referred to as a 
“business payday loan,” it all depends on the particular lender and how you 
approach the transaction. Traditional lenders like banks and credit unions 
are regulated by a number of state and federal agencies, while MCA lend-
ers don’t face that same scrutiny. That means it’s very important to spend 
the time to investigate the lenders before you make your decision. I don’t 
recommend going with the first MCA lender you come across; be sure to 
speak to three or so first.
When I was a young entrepreneur, I wasn’t aware of this type of financing.  
However, I remember what it’s like to need cash quickly. Despite how 
much you might need the financing, don’t leap into a relationship before 
you look.
If a lender offers you a lot more money than you are asking for and isn’t 
very concerned about your ability to repay the advance, this should raise 
many red flags. That being said, there are a number of great MCA lenders 
worthy of consideration. My advice is to treat looking for an MCA lender 
the same way you treat buying a used car—do the research and be 
prepared to walk away from a deal that just doesn’t seem right.
Qualifying for a Merchant Cash Advance
An MCA is similar to accounts receivable factoring (covered in Chapter 9).  
It isn’t for everyone. Like factoring, it’s anywhere from a little more  
expensive to a lot more expensive than a traditional term loan. 
Nevertheless, there are situations when tapping into your credit card 
transactions makes sense for you and your business.
w

Getting a Business Loan
113
The terms and requirements for an MCA are a lot less stringent than a 
traditional loan, and there are other requirements an MCA lender will 
consider in addition to your credit score, time in business, and annual 
revenue. Like some of the other alternative financing sources you’ve read 
about, most MCA lenders are non-bank lenders. You’ll want to investigate  
and compare a few before you settle in and make a choice. Although  
they are looking for similar things, there might be some variation, so 
consider the following items as a starting place for comparison rather than  
hard-and-fast rules.
• 
You need to maintain at least $2,500 to $5,000 in 
monthly credit card transactions. Although every lender 
is different, this is a good range to consider before 
you go to an MCA lender. You should also be aware 
that an MCA lender will debit your payment directly 
from your merchant cash account—this makes your 
credit rating less important if you have the monthly 
transactions to support their terms. Because they 
won’t be waiting for you to make a payment and have 
access to your merchant account, they’re more confi-
dent they’ll get paid. And, unlike the bank that wants to 
see a track record of four years or longer, you’ll likely 
qualify if you’ve been in business for around a year.
• 
You can’t already be working with another MCA lender. 
This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. Although it’s 
possible to have a couple of small business loans or 
lines of credit open simultaneously, if you already 
have a merchant cash advance in place, you can’t get 
another one until the current advance is paid off.
• 
There can’t be current liens on business-owned property. 
This is another stipulation that should make sense. 
Although the risk tolerance of an MCA lender is dif-
ferent than that of a banker, like any other loan, there 
are red flags that will kill the deal.
• 
You need to provide financial data to validate sales and 
monthly credit card receipts. An MCA lender may be less 
interested in your credit score than your banker, but 
they are very interested in your merchant account. 
They’ll want to see your merchant account state-
ments for several months to validate that you have 
enough transaction volume to support the advance.

Chapter 11 | The Merchant Cash Advance
114
Like a factor, an MCA lender will be looking at your future receipts as 
collateral. Some lenders want to know how the loan will be used (which 
makes sense) and others will work only with businesses that have been 
around for a year or more. You should also remember that an MCA is 
more expensive than other traditional financing. However, if you don’t 
qualify for a term loan or line of credit at the bank, this could be a viable 
option.
Another benefit of an MCA is time to funding. I recently spoke with a 
banker who stated that he doesn’t even look at an application for an SBA 
7(a) loan for six weeks. He suggested the typical time to funding was six 
months or more. In many cases, a merchant cash advance is approved in 
hours and even funded in hours or days. So if you need cash right away, 
an MCA can be a viable option.
What Types of Businesses Are Good 
Matches for a Merchant Cash Advance?
Fortunately, some of the businesses that typically struggle to find tradi-
tional financing are exactly what MCA lenders are looking for. An MCA 
is often a good match for:
Service businesses
• 
Restaurants
• 
Retail businesses
• 
Just about any business that does a lot of credit card transactions is 
a good candidate for an MCA. Some MCA lenders will advance up to 
$500,000—depending on your Visa/MasterCard volume over the last 90 
to 120 days. A good rule of thumb is that you can receive about 125% of 
your monthly transaction volume averaged over the previous 120 days.
Note

 Restaurants and retail business that regularly take credit cards are often a good 
match for an MCA.

How Do You Determine Which MCA 
Lender Is Right for You?
Like most alternative lenders, MCA lenders come in all shapes and sizes. 
You want to make sure the lender you choose is right for your situation. 
Fortunately, this is a very popular vehicle for acquiring funds and, as more 
of these lenders enter the market, the costs are becoming more reason-
able. Nevertheless, I doubt the rates they charge will ever favorably com-
pete with a traditional term loan.
Here are a few things you’ll want to make sure you have a handle on 
before you sign on the dotted line:
• 
Make sure you understand all the fees upfront. Don’t 
assume that because you understand the fees at one 
MCA lender you understand them all. I’ve spoken to 
more than one borrower who was surprised by an 
unexpected fee. If you have a lender who refuses to 
explain everything before you sign, it’s time to start 
looking for another lender. Don’t settle for a bad deal; 
there are a number of very reputable MCA lenders 
who are willing to explain how they work—including 
explaining all the fees they charge.
• 
Make sure you understand the terms. Depending on the 
lender, some advances involve a daily fixed amount 
taken from your account while others take a percent-
age of your credit card sales each day. One lender 
might take 10% of your transactions every day until 
you’ve paid back the entire advance, whereas oth-
ers might take a fixed amount, such as $100. If your 
lender takes 10% every day, don’t confuse that with 
the interest rate—sometimes they can be substan-
tially higher.
I recently spoke to one borrower who expected to 
have his loan paid off in 90 days. He didn’t notice in 
the fine print that if it wasn’t paid off in that time, 
the lender would take all of the cash in his merchant 
account until he had paid the balance in full. He was 
using his MCA as a short-term solution to take 
advantage of a unique opportunity to pre-sell some 
special merchandise, but he neglected to account for 
the extra month required to collect from his custom-
ers. When he didn’t pay the balance of his MCA off 
within the agreed-upon 90 days, his lender did just 

Chapter 11 | The Merchant Cash Advance
116
as stipulated within the contract and proceeded to 
drain his merchant account each day. This was not 
only an unwelcome surprise; it caused serious cash 
flow issues for his business.
• 
Make sure your lender gives you at least an estimate of a 
projected annual percentage rate (APR). Although there 
are a number of advantages to an MCA, a low inter-
est rate doesn’t happen to be one of them. This will 
make it much easier to avoid comparing apples and 
oranges when comparing MCA lenders. There are 
definitely lower-cost alternatives to an MCA if you 
qualify for them.
• 
Don’t use the first MCA lender willing to work with you. 
Over the last couple of years there have been a num-
ber of new lenders enter the market, pushing rates 
and fees down, and making it more attractive for 
small business owners. Make sure you’ve shopped 
several lenders before you decide. The differences 
between lenders can be surprising. Shopping around 
is the only way to ensure you get the best possible 
rates and the lowest fees.
Tip
■
■
  Shop around to get the best MCA rate and read that fine print carefully. You’re 
probably eager for the advance and may let your guard down as a result. Don’t. You can 
make a mistake that has the potential to put you out of business.
If your merchant cash advance is like most, the lender deducts a percent-
age of your credit card transactions until the balance is paid—this makes 
it easier for you to get through a cash flow crunch if business slows down 
for some reason. When times are good, the advance is paid off quicker, 
and when times are tight, they take less.
It’s true, an MCA is a higher-cost alternative to a loan from the bank, but 
the duration of this type of financing is typically short term and, when 
used wisely, it can be a powerful financial tool for small business owners. 
In fact, many borrowers use an advance as a bridge to a larger term loan 
because the time to funding is so short.
Three of the biggest advantages of a merchant cash advance are:
• 
It’s quick and relatively easy to qualify. Unlike with a 
term loan, you can get the cash you’re looking for in 
72 hours or less. Some lenders can underwrite and

approve your advance in less than 24 hours. If you 
need cash to address an immediate need, this could 
be a good option for you.
• 
Quick access to additional cash can enable you to take 
advantage of opportunities. Many small business own-
ers will use an advance to leverage short-term oppor-
tunities into long-term expansion.
• 
There are fewer restrictions on how you can use the 
advance. Unlike with an SBA loan or other traditional 
loan, once you have the cash there are fewer restric-
tions on how you can use it.
A couple things to watch out for when considering an MCA:
• 
Pay attention to the interest rate. Some MCA lenders 
charge up to 20 or 30%, or even more. A merchant 
cash advance can be a great short-term solution to 
a cash flow problem, a way to take advantage of a 
special offer from a supplier, or even a bridge to a 
traditional term loan. When any particular advance 
becomes a long-term solution to a need for cash, 
they get expensive—very expensive. Over time, it 
becomes less about the monthly obligation and more 
about the cost of capital. 
• 
Even though you didn’t put any collateral at risk, beware. 
Although you might not be required to put up any 
collateral to obtain an MCA the same way a young 
entrepreneur might second-mortgage his home at 
the bank, your home could still be at risk. It’s true 
that if your business fails, you have no legal obligation 
to repay the advance. That is, unless you don’t strictly 
follow the terms of the contract. For example, you 
can’t encourage your customers to pay in cash or 
switch credit card processors. If an MCA lender sus-
pects that you have broken the terms of the contract, 
they may aggressively pursue you for repayment—
including going after personal assets.
Despite some of the folklore surrounding merchant cash advances, it’s not 
the harbinger of financial ruin that some think it is. Over the last couple of 
years, even as credit restrictions have relaxed for “bigger” small business 
owners, the smallest small businesses are still struggling to find cash. More 
and more business owners are successfully turning to products like the 
merchant cash advance to find the funding they need.

■
  An MCA—arranged with eyes wide open—can be a good way to bridge a short bout 
of poor cash flow. But don’t let it become a vehicle for long-term financing. That’s a situation 
bound to end in tears.
Where Should You Look for a Merchant 
Cash Advance?
Most MCA lenders have a strong presence online, so start with search on 
Google. When I searched for “Merchant Cash Advance Companies,” I got 
over 4 million hits. If you know a business owner who has used this type 
of financing, a personal recommendation goes a long way. If you reach out 
to any particular lender, ask for references who you can call and speak 
with about their experience. Don’t be content with the testimonials on 
their website.
Standard Terms for a Merchant Cash Advance
Although there are no industry standards, it’s not uncommon for an MCA 
lender to advance up to 125% of monthly credit card sales. Most advances 
are for terms of six to ten months. Expect the lender to take 5–10% (or 
more, depending on the lender) of every credit card and/or debit card 
transaction every month until the balance is paid. Although 5–10% might 
not sound like much, remember it’s 5–10% per month, making the annual 
percentage rate quite high. This is not a long-term solution.
Summary
A merchant cash advance is one of the more popular alternative methods 
of financing short-term capital needs today. Because there are so many 
MCA lenders (terms and conditions vary), make sure to speak to more 
than one lender to compare terms and ensure you have the right loan for 
your business.
As described in this chapter, the wise use of an MCA can be an excellent 
source of capital. Just as with a business credit card, which is the topic of 
the following chapter, it’s important to make sure you completely under-
stand the fine print and use the resource intelligently.

They Call It  
a Credit Card 
for a Reason
Don’t Leave Home Without It
I couldn’t help but think of the actor Karl Malden when I got my first 
credit card. I remember him as kind of a hard-nose cop on the TV show, 
The Streets of San Francisco.1 His co-star was a very young Michael Douglas. 
I remember watching the show as a teenager. Malden had enough street 
cred from the series; I can still remember an American Express ad that 
featured him as their spokesperson. Although Malden was talking about 
Travelers Checks when he said, “Don’t leave home without them,” the tag 
line eventually applied to the American Express card too.
A business credit card is probably the easiest entry into establishing credit 
at a traditional small business lender like a bank or credit union. And, as 
mentioned, I’ve known quite a few young entrepreneurs who have used 
credit cards to finance operations in the early years. But I wouldn’t rec-
ommend it. Early in my career, I worked for someone who had a dozen 
credit cards in his wallet and used them to purchase supplies, fund proj-
ects, and augment cash flow. He was one of the most disciplined people

I’ve ever met. He seldom let anything go over 30 days and rarely carried 
a balance. He paid very little interest, but using credit cards in this way, 
for most people, can be much like walking a knife’s edge—one slip can 
spell disaster.
That’s not to say a business credit card isn’t a valuable tool when used 
appropriately.
Why Would You Want a Business  
Credit Card?
The National Small Business Association (NSBA) reports2 that 31% 
of the small businesses they surveyed had used a credit card in the 
previous 12 months to finance a business need. In fact, it shouldn’t be 
a surprise that credit cards are at the top of the list for most Main 
Street business owners who need quick cash. Many businesses, like the 
disciplined friend I described previously, are likely to use a combina-
tion of business and personal credit cards, but a business-specific card 
has its advantages.

  One of the first things my accountant told me was to keep my personal finances and 
my business finances separate. This is much easier said than done, especially when you’re 
using the same credit card to buy a necessary piece of equipment for the office that you use to 
take your family to Disneyland. A business credit card makes it much easier for your accountant, 
and the IRS, to tell the difference between personal and business expenditures.
Here are a few of the benefits a business credit card provides:
• 
Keeps track of employee expenditures and serves as an 
audit trail. Most of the Main Street business owners 
I know don’t give credit cards to their employees 
willy-nilly, but there are scenarios where it makes 
a lot of sense. Along with the ability to monitor 
monthly statements and balance expense accounts 
with those statements, some business credit cards 
even allow you to set limits on the amount employ-
ees can spend.

I also know credit card providers who promote busi-
ness credit cards as a way to reduce the cost of writing  
a purchase order for smaller business purchases. 
Instead of creating a P.O. for purchases of less than 
$100 or $200 (depending upon what you believe is a 
smaller purchase), buyers are authorized to use the 
credit card to make the purchase. The statement 
from the credit card company acts as an audit trail.
• 
Offers higher spending limits. Some business credit 
cards offer limits far greater than a typical Gold or 
Platinum card and some larger banks give business 
owners access to well over a hundred additional 
cards (for employees).
• 
Can offer attractive rewards programs. Not unlike your 
personal credit card, many business credit cards offer 
incentives to use their card. Depending on the card, 
they offer cash back, discounts on office supplies, travel 
benefits, and discounts on other business services.
• 
Provides terms designed for businesses. As a business 
owner, you might not be able to pay the balance 
at the end of the month. Some card providers, like 
American Express, offer discounts for those who pay 
their balance early or up to 60 days without interest 
(the Plum card offers this benefit). Sixty days without 
interest can be a great way to meet a short-term 
cash flow need. 
Tip

  Use your card to improve your business credit. If you’re running a startup or are an early 
stage entrepreneur, most lenders will look at your personal credit score to determine if you’re 
a good credit risk. In much the same way that you’ve used credit to build your personal credit 
score, a business credit card can build business credit. (And, yes, you need to pay attention to 
your business credit score as well as your personal credit score.)
Personal Credit Cards and Business Credit 
Cards Are Not the Same
There are certainly advantages to a business credit card, but there are also 
some disadvantages that you can’t ignore. Many of the consumer protections 
that have been legislated over the years for consumer credit cards don’t 
apply to business credit cards. I learned about one of them the hard way.

Chapter 12 | They Call It a Credit Card for a Reason 
122
Like most Main Street startups at the time, my access to credit included a 
second mortgage on my house and a couple of business credit cards. My 
business lived or died on the cash flow we generated doing our day-to-day 
sales. I used the cards to buy equipment and pay for any business-related 
supplies we needed. For the most part, I kept on top of my monthly 
obligations, but there were times when I would rob Peter to pay Paul. 
One month I had a small balance on one of the cards. I think it was a 
couple hundred dollars. Because the amount was relatively insignificant, 
I put off paying the card balance that week. The low interest rate they 
originally offered on the card shot through the roof—basically making the 
card far too expensive to use. Because I wasn’t paying attention to the 
small print, I was also hit with a fee or two that I wasn’t too excited about 
paying. Although I didn’t (and still don’t) agree with that practice, it was 
my lack of attention to the fine print, and stupidity, that cost me.
Note
■
■
  In an earlier chapter, I mentioned how the “mouse type” is so small that only a mouse 
can read it. Card providers make it difficult to read so you will skip over it. Don’t make that 
mistake. Make sure you read and understand it before you get the card.
The following sections outline a few other differences between personal 
and business credit cards.
You Aren’t Protected from Arbitrary-Feeling/ 
Surprise Rate Increases
The CARD Act3 protects the average consumer from what can feel like 
an arbitrary-feeling rate increase by requiring a 45-day notice before 
increases take effect. This isn’t the case for business credit cards.
Not only can business credit card lenders raise the interest rate any time 
they want, they can also apply those interest rates to any older charges—
something they can’t do on a consumer credit card.
Some credit cards comply with the CARD Act even on business 
credit cards, which I think they should. Others retroactively apply 
new interest rates to old purchases, but give their cardholders the 
45-day notice. Make sure you understand what happens when your 
bank or credit card provider raises their interest rates—because it 
will eventually happen.
3The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act

Getting a Business Loan
123
Don’t Expect to Have 30 Days to Pay Your  
Credit Card Bill
The CARD Act requires that lenders mail the credit card statement to 
consumers at least 21 days before the bill is due. This doesn’t apply to 
business credit cards and, what’s more, payment doesn’t have to fall on 
the same day each month. You need to pay attention to when your credit 
card bill is due and make timely payments—it’s up to you to know if the 
due dates are on different days.
Some credit card providers do give their business card holders at least 21 
days and have the same due date every month for payment, even though 
it’s not required by the CARD Act. This is another reason to shop around 
for your business credit card provider.
Caps on Late Fees? Fugedaboudit
Although the CARD Act caps late fees for consumer cards at $25 or the 
minimum payment, business credit card late fees are not regulated. Fees 
can add up pretty quickly.
There isn’t a limit on over-limit fees, either. Many business card issuers 
automatically let you go over your limit and in some cases the over-limit 
fees can amount to more than your charges. Personal credit card holders 
must opt in to over-limit fees.
You’ve already read about some of the benefits of a business credit card 
over a personal credit card, but it’s not all peaches and cream. Make 
sure you understand all the terms and conditions before you take the 
new card. If the business card offer came to you in the mail, look for, 
read, and understand all the disclaimers before you apply. If you’re going 
to the local bank, make sure you take the time to go through that same 
document with someone at the bank who can explain everything to you 
in simple-to-understand language.
How to Avoid Credit Card Surprises
Earlier in this chapter I suggested it was my laziness or stupidity that caught 
me holding the bag for a jump in interest rate and fees I wasn’t expecting. 
My cavalier attitude forced me to pay additional fees that I shouldn’t have. 
With a little bit of diligence on my part, I could have avoided the surprise. 
I took for granted that the same rules applied to my personal credit card 
as my business card. There are some other things you should know that 
will help you avoid a surprise or two yourself.

Chapter 12 | They Call It a Credit Card for a Reason 
124
• 
Make sure you understand the gobbledygook. Every 
industry has its own acronyms and vocabulary. Credit 
cards have a unique vocabulary too. Learning the 
unique language of credit cards will help you avoid 
surprise charges and fees.
• 
APR (annual percentage rate): As you might 
expect, this is the interest rate you pay annually 
on any unpaid balance you carry on your card. In 
other words, this is the interest rate you pay if you 
don’t pay the balance on the due date.
• 
Promotional or introductory:  The “introductory”  
interest rate on a new credit card may be very 
low, but it’s only temporary. This is a marketing 
tactic used by credit card providers to entice 
you to sign up for their credit card. Those rates 
are temporary and the rate will go up after the 
promotional period is over. If you sign up for a 
credit card with a promotional rate, it’s important 
that you know how long the rate will last so 
you don’t get surprised with an unexpected rate 
increase.
• 
Grace period: This is a very important term and 
describes the time you have to pay your credit 
card bill without incurring interest. On consumer 
credit cards, the grace period is required to be 
at least 21 days and some providers even allow 
30 days. Don’t automatically expect it to be the 
same with business credit card providers. Make 
sure you ask.
• 
Break out the magnifying glass. Some content is writ-
ten to be read and understood, but most of the time 
that isn’t true of the small print on the back of your 
credit card application. Although the fine print might 
be a lot easier to understand than it once was, brace 
yourself. The text is small, it’s not in a very readable 
typeface, and there’s a lot of it. But don’t quit because 
it’s tough; you need to understand all of it.
Make a list of all the terms you don’t understand 
so you can look them up or ask what they mean. 
Assuming you’re okay with something you’re not100% 
sure about could cost you through surprise fees or a 
jump in interest rate down the road.

125
• 
Don’t be afraid you’re going to ask a dumb question. Once 
you’ve read the agreement and have your list of ques-
tions, talk to the card provider. Visit your bank branch 
or call the customer service line and go through all 
the questions you have. Ask them to explain what is 
unclear, and if it’s still unclear, ask again. 
If they aren’t willing to explain their terms, it’s time to 
find another lender. Period. If this is how they treat you 
before you’ve signed on the dotted line, imagine how 
they are going to treat you once you owe them money.
• 
Google the provider. Believe me when I tell you, if 
there’s anything negative about your potential busi-
ness credit card provider, you’ll probably find it online. 
Every provider, even the good ones, have disgruntled 
folks bashing them online. If there are more than a 
few complaints, it should throw up a red flag.
Treat negative online reviews the same way you do 
the purchase of anything else online. Read them, 
balance them against the good reviews, and make a 
decision. Whenever I read reviews, I automatically 
eliminate the most positive and most negative review 
(there are always outliers). I try to look at the folks 
in the middle of the curve. Keep in mind that unhappy 
customers are more likely to publish reviews than 
satisfied ones. Take that into consideration.
Paying attention and following these simple suggestions won’t guarantee  
that you’ll never get a surprise charge or fee, but they will definitely 
help. I wish I had been aware and paid more attention to these four 
suggestions.
Walking the Razor’s Edge
Earlier in this chapter I mentioned my friend who used several different 
credit cards to finance his business operations. Although there are suc-
cess stories out there, I thought I’d share a few reasons why I think this 
is a horrible idea:
• 
Many of these stories are exaggerated. Even if their 
credit cards were the only real source of credit 
they had early in their business, it’s more likely they 
survived on good old cash flow, not their credit 
card balance. Years ago, two friends who were also 

Chapter 12 | They Call It a Credit Card for a Reason 
126
professional colleagues would joke about how you 
could only believe 43% of what the other said. Sadly, 
over the years I found that to be true about one of 
them. He really liked to embellish the facts when he 
described how he started his business.
• 
I wish I had a nickel for every time I’ve heard the story of 
a successful company launched on the back of maxed-
out credit cards. I’ve been there. And yes, aside 
from my second mortgage, credit cards were the 
only type of credit I had. I used those credit cards 
to finance special purchases that I couldn’t make 
any other way. Credit cards are a pretty expensive 
(although convenient) way to finance purchases, and 
just aren’t practical as a sole means of financing your 
business. You don’t hear about the companies who 
failed when they bet everything on the idea they 
could pay off the credit cards just before the lend-
ers lowered the boom.
• 
Most people, myself included, just aren’t disciplined 
enough. It’s far too easy, and likely a part of human 
nature, to pay the minimum balance every time the 
statement is due. The only reason it worked for my 
friend is because he had the discipline to pay the bal-
ance off when the statement arrived every month. 
If you don’t have that type of discipline, it doesn’t 
take long for your business credit card balance to 
spiral out of control. Once that happens, and once 
you carry a significant unpaid balance each month, it 
makes it more difficult if not impossible to acquire 
other forms of financing when you really need them.
Finding the Right Business Credit Card
Although your local bank or credit union usually offers a business credit 
card, don’t feel like that is your only option. It is convenient to sit across 
the desk from someone you already know to ask questions and make sure 
you understand the terms, but there are other credit card providers who 
specialize in business credit cards.
Your accountant or CPA might also be able to offer some insight into 
good credit card providers. Just as with the other financing sources you’ve 
read about, the Internet is a great place to look. I Googled “business credit 
card providers” and got over 51 million results. Needless to say, you have 
a lot of options.

Standard Terms for a Business Credit Card
Bankrate.com4 reports that, as of September 2013, the average APR 
for variable-rate credit cards is 15.36%. It’s not uncommon for this rate 
to change over the course of a year. The rate on a fixed-rate card  
is 13.02%.

  Business credit cards are good for buying almost anything your business needs, 
provided you pay off the bill every month to avoid interest charges. That said, it sometimes 
makes sense to pay the interest fee when you absolutely need something important to generate 
revenue and can’t secure a conventional business loan.
Summary
This chapter explained some of the differences between a personal and 
business credit card and discussed why a small business owner might 
choose to use a business card. As with any line of credit, the wise use of a 
business credit card not only provides capital to fill a quick and short-term 
need, it provides an opportunity for early-stage business owners to build 
their business credit rating and demonstrate their credit-worthiness.
The next chapter discusses peer-to-peer lending and what are commonly 
called “3F” loans.

Peer-to-Peer 
Loans
Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?
One of the toughest stages for an entrepreneur to find financing is during 
the startup phase. It’s even tougher if your startup is in the idea stage, has 
no revenues, and doesn’t even have a real product yet.
Although I’m not a regular viewer, I enjoy the occasional episode of the 
ABC TV show, Shark Tank.1 In one show, a pair of entrepreneurs excit-
edly pitched what they believed was a slam dunk (if only one or more 
of the sharks would join them). They had a working prototype, they had 
researched the market, and they had a fairly compelling pitch. What they 
didn’t have was a track record, any revenue, or any distribution. They 
couldn’t understand why none of the sharks were interested.
The investors on Shark Tank are angel investors. In a lot of ways, angels 
act a lot like what are known as peer-to-peer lenders (although they do 
want some equity in the venture). Peer-to-peer lending bypasses the bank 
and puts borrowers in front of individuals with money to lend. Unlike 
the angels on Shark Tank, however, most peer-to-peer lenders are average 
folks whose investment is combined with the money other investors just 
like them put in the project. Although there are a number of web sites 
that match potential peer-to-peer lenders with borrowers, getting a loan 
from your rich uncle Fred can also be considered a peer-to-peer loan.

Chapter 13 | Peer-to-Peer Loans

Lending Club2 is a great example of how a peer-to-peer lending organi-
zation works:
1.	 Borrowers apply for loans, and investors on the net-
work invest.
2.	 Borrowers get funded and investors create a portfo-
lio of investments.
3.	 Borrowers repay the loan and investors earn interest 
and reinvest.
Most peer-to-peer loans are unsecured personal loans. Unlike traditional 
loans, and many alternative loans, the transaction is between individuals 
and not companies. Interest rates are determined by the individual inves-
tor, but like other lenders, the interest rates are determined based upon 
the lender’s risk tolerance and the perception of how risky a loan to any 
particular borrower might be.
On most peer-to-peer web sites, lenders compete for borrowers and the 
lowest rate using a reverse auction model. In other words, the rolls of the 
buyer and seller are reversed. The seller, in this case the lender, competes 
with other lenders to woo individual borrowers.
When I first entered the workforce, I participated in many reverse auc-
tions in an effort to secure government contracts for the company I was 
working for at the time. Although we didn’t call it a reverse auction, the 
bidding process is a good example. The procurement officer would make 
a request for bid, and if our price was the lowest price to honor the terms 
of the contract, we won the bid. Unlike a traditional auction similar to 
those conducted on eBay,3 where many buyers bid on a single item, there 
are some peer-to-peer lending sites that use the reverse auction model. 
Imagine an eBay auction where sellers bid against each other to sell you 
their item at the lowest possible price.

Peer-to-Peer Lending vs. Traditional Lending
In many respects, the main difference between peer-to-peer lending and 
traditional lending lies in the parties involved. Like most traditional or 
alternative loans, a peer-to-peer loan is made to create a profit. However, 
there are differences you’ll want to be aware of as you consider this type 
of funding:
It is unlikely there will be a prior connection between 
• 
the borrower or the lender.
The transaction usually takes place online and is 
• 
intermediated by a peer-to-peer lending company.
Individual investors choose which borrowers they 
• 
will invest in.
The loans are unsecured and are not protected by 
• 
any government insurance.
The loans are treated as securities that may be sold 
• 
to other investors.
The History of Peer-to-Peer Lending
Although in its most basic form peer-to-peer lending has been going on 
since ancient times, I limit this conversation to the modern version. The 
Internet has given peer-to-peer lending a set of legs, making it possible for 
borrowers from all over the world to connect with individual investors. 
Today, peer-to-peer lending takes place in the United States and Great 
Britain, and is also gaining popularity in the Far East.
Social networks are also a big part of the phenomenon, because they 
enable borrowers and investors to connect via social media. The emer-
gence of peer-to-peer lending is likely a reaction to the need for options 
normally unavailable at the local bank.
Imperfect Credit?
Most Main Street business owners don’t turn to peer-to-peer lenders if 
they can walk into the bank with an application and leave with a loan. Like 
the other types of funding discussed in this book, peer-to-peer loans are 
an option for small business owners who have been forced to make some 
pretty tough decisions over the last few years and have less than perfect 
credit. Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean you must have sketchy credit to 

Chapter 13 | Peer-to-Peer Loans
132
participate; some borrowers and lenders choose peer-to-peer lending for 
philosophical reasons. Here are some other reasons why a peer-to-peer 
loan might be a good option:
• 
Peer-to-peer lenders often look at more than your credit 
score. Most peer-to-peer lending companies utilize 
the Internet to collect a more complete profile of 
the potential borrower. Although credit score is an 
important metric, it’s only one measure of a business’ 
viability. Because they also have access to the profiles 
of thousands of previous loans (many just like yours), 
investor networks have a lot of data with which to 
compare and make decisions about any small busi-
ness, including yours.
• 
Reasonable interest rates. Although the interest rates 
are higher than with a traditional loan, they are more 
favorable than some of the other alternative financ-
ing options. Depending on how high the risk for your 
loan is rated, you can expect to pay between 7–8% 
or even as much as 30%. Much depends on your 
credit rating, the health of your business, and the loan 
amount you’re looking for.
• 
Peer-to-peer loans are sized right for Main Street busi-
nesses. Most peer-to-peer loans would be considered 
micro loans by the SBA, because the maximum loan 
amount is closer $35,000, rather than $350,000. 
• 
Quick access to cash. It’s not uncommon to wait six 
weeks before you’re even able to talk to anyone 
about an SBA loan, and likely months before your 
loan would be funded. With peer-to-peer loans, 
everything is done online. Therefore, many people 
who apply for a loan have the money deposited in 
their bank account within 10 days.
• 
No penalty for prepayment. Although peer-to-peer 
lenders lose a little interest when a borrower pays off 
their balance early, there are no penalties. Prepayment 
fees at a bank can get expensive, but that’s not some-
thing you need to worry about with a peer-to-peer 
lender.
• 
Real people, not institutions, do the lending. Community 
banks talk a lot about community lending, but this is 
grassroots community lending unlike anything a bank 
can provide.

  Investigate peer-to-peer loans when the bank has turned you down. You may well find 
ready acceptance at an interest rate you can live with.
Successfully Finding Peer-to-Peer Funding
Although it might sound pretty simple to log in to a peer-to-peer funding 
site, fill out a profile, and watch the money roll in, don’t be deceived. There 
are a lot of small business owners who never get the funding they need on 
these sites. Here are a few suggestions that might improve your odds:
• 
Don’t be greedy. Although peer-to-peer lending isn’t 
the same as going into a bank, most of these folks 
are pretty savvy lenders. If you’ve been turned down 
by the local bank because your credit score was too 
low, don’t expect these folks to ignore your credit 
score. They may be more risk tolerant than the bank 
(which is one reason you pay a higher interest rate), 
but they’re not anxious to throw their money away. It 
might be wise to be conservative about the amount 
you ask for.
• 
Location, location, location. Make sure you take some 
time to research the right peer-to-peer lending site to 
work with. Some sites are geared more toward start-
ups whereas others are for specific industries—make 
sure you’re making your pitch in the right place.
• 
Don’t make people guess. Make sure you explain what 
you need the funding for. If you plan on updating your 
web site, redesigning packaging, or ramping up your  
marketing, spell it out. These investors want to know  
as much about who you are and what you’re going  
to do with the financing as they can to make an 
informed decision.
• 
The devil is in the details. Not only do these lenders 
want to know what you’re going to do with the cash, 
they want to know about you and your company. The 
more information you share (including an explanation 
about why you might have a poor credit score), the 
more likely you’ll get the financing you need.

  With the exception of borrowing from friends and family, peer-to-peer lending is usually 
done online. A search for “peer-to-peer lending companies” reveals lots of information about 
peer-to-peer lending in general, but also identifies a number of lenders.
Caveat Emptor: Let the Borrower Beware
Although peer-to-peer lending might be just the right option for your 
small business, there are some potential pitfalls you should be aware of. 
Although many of these lending companies have been around for a few 
years now and many small business owners just like you are getting fund-
ing this way, this type of funding isn’t for everyone.
• 
You might not get what you’re asking for. Most of the 
time, a peer-to-peer loan is an aggregate of several 
individuals whose funds are pooled to finance your 
requested loan amount. Say you take the time to cre-
ate a pitch, spend the effort you’ll need to promote 
the purpose of your loan, and make a case success-
fully. If there aren’t enough individuals willing to invest 
in your cause, you might fall short of your goal.
• 
Peer-to-peer loans aren’t regulated by any government 
agency. Because individuals are the lenders and the 
Internet is the connection between the lenders and 
the borrowers, funds can come from anywhere in 
the country (or around the world, for that matter). 
Make sure you read all the documentation on the site 
before you jump in with both feet.
• 
You’ll likely pay a higher interest rate. As you might 
expect, you’ll probably pay a higher interest rate for 
a peer-to-peer loan. You’ve read about some of the 
advantages of a peer-to-peer loan, so if you can stand 
the idea of a higher interest rate, this type of loan 
could be a good fit for you.
A Borrower’s Success Story
Because I’ve had no personal experience with any borrowers who’ve 
turned to peer-to-peer lending to financing, I decided to go to one of the 
biggest peer-to-peer lenders (Prosper) to see if they had any stories to 
share. Yes, they did.

Getting a Business Loan

After six years, a young fashion designer needed some funds to keep up 
with demand and expand her business (sound familiar?). She borrowed 
from family and friends along with tapping her personal credit cards. Just 
like many small business owners, she didn’t have the credit history or col-
lateral needed to get a bank loan.
At the advice of a friend, she visited Prosper’s site, created a listing, and 
almost immediately had eight investors interested in her loan. Like many 
of the small business owners I talk to, it doesn’t always take a lot to keep 
the small business engine running. Her first loan was for $3,000 at 10% 
interest. Since this first loan, she’s been back a couple of times to fund a 
new web site and grow her business.4
Visit the Prosper site to read other stories like this one. Earlier in this 
chapter, I suggested that these loans were “right-sized” for Main Street 
businesses. I think this story is a great example of how sometimes it 
doesn’t take much to keep a small business growing and thriving.
Note
■
 Typical terms for unsecured peer-to-peer loans vary, but you should treat them as 
short-term financing options. You can expect interest rates from 6–7%, up to 35% or more, and 
terms from 1 to 5 years.
Borrowing from Mom and Dad or Your  
Rich Uncle Fred
Borrowing from mom and dad isn’t a peer-to-peer loan in the same sense, 
but I put it in the same category. Some people lump it into what’s been 
called the three Fs—friends, family, and fools. People have been borrowing 
money from their rich uncle Fred, a very successful old college roommate, 
or mom and dad since there were rich uncles, college roommates, and 
moms and dads.
Most of the time it’s a young entrepreneur’s startup that is the recipient 
of all the good will, but most of the time these “loans” aren’t repaid and 
should be considered more like a gift. Unfortunately, many small busi-
nesses fail, even those started by entrepreneurs with great parents and 
great ideas. That makes it difficult for the nephew/niece, friend, or child 
to repay the loan.

Most of the time, it starts with generous parents (or other fool?) saying, 
“We believe in your idea. You can start making payments to us once you 
get profitable.” It devolves into avoiding Thanksgiving dinner and skipping 
out on family parties when two years becomes five and everyone loses 
track of the last time they saw a payment on “the loan.”
I once knew a very talented guy who had an opportunity to purchase a 
very successful Main Street business. Annual revenues were good, there 
was a steady flow of repeat customers, and the business was complete 
with all the equipment it needed to conduct business. The previous owner 
was even willing to work as an employee to help keep things going. All 
that was needed was the funding to make it come together.
Because the buyer didn’t have a very good track record or credit history, 
a bank loan was out of the question, but he did have a very successful 
father-in-law. He found the money he needed to buy the business with 
a 3F loan. Unfortunately, although he was a very talented guy, his talent 
wasn’t running the business and he eventually ended up walking away. The 
previous owner had to take it over and try to salvage something from 
what he thought would be his retirement nest egg. The buyer had to face 
his father-in-law and his wife for squandering the loan from “daddy.” This 
is not an uncommon tale.
Of course, there are families who can successfully pull it off. Before he 
passed away, my father-in-law had a knack for keeping loans to his children 
“strictly business.” This is my advice to anyone considering a 3F loan. Here 
are some of the things he did, along with a few additional suggestions:
• 
Create an agreement. It could be as simple as, “Ty bor-
rowed $1,000 on September 17, 2013, and will pay 
$100 each month without interest for 10 months.” 
My father-in-law kept a ledger and made a monthly 
accounting. There was no question in anyone’s mind 
that the “loan” was an actual loan. There was an 
expectation they would be repaid, and for the most 
part I think they were. That’s not to say a more for-
mal document shouldn’t be prepared. In the case of 
larger amounts, something more formal probably 
should be drawn up. I have a close friend with family 
members who, over the years, borrowed from aging 
parents, basically decimating their assets and estate. 
Even though all the siblings knew what happened, 
because there was nothing to suggest those funds be 
repaid, the siblings who weren’t “borrowing” wound 
up on the short end of the inheritance stick. 

Getting a Business Loan

• 
Consider putting up collateral. Although I’ve not expe-
rienced it, there are times when collateral might be 
part of a 3F loan. I’m not suggesting that asking for 
collateral is (or isn’t) appropriate, but if it’s part of 
the agreement, it needs to be itemized and included 
in the agreement.
• 
Talk to your accountant. As with any financial transac-
tion, depending on the scope of your 3F loan, there 
could be tax consequences for the borrower or the 
lender. Make sure you have a complete understanding 
of what they are on both sides of the transaction.
• 
Is equity involved? This doesn’t necessarily mean that 
you’ll be making your friend or family member a true 
business partner, but you could be giving them a way 
to make a profit if you’re successful without making 
regular payments to them. They treat the arrange-
ment like an investment in you and your business, 
and you treat them like an investor. This is a sticking 
point for many who borrow from friends or family. In 
my opinion, it’s best to treat this type of financing the 
same way you would a loan—whether or not Uncle 
Fred is inclined to take action should you default. 
• 
Don’t take them for granted. You might not have a formal 
agreement. You might not offer collateral or equity. But 
never take a loan for granted. Do your best to treat the 
loan the same way you would a formal loan from the 
bank. Something to be repaid, with interest, on time. 
It’s been said that 3F loans should be considered business financing of last 
resort. I tend to agree. Borrowing money from family and friends to finance 
a business idea can put a strain on even the strongest relationships. I’ve even 
heard advice that suggests you shouldn’t borrow from friends and family 
unless you are willing to walk away and never see them again. Definitely not 
something to be taken lightly, and not something I recommend.

Summary
According to Pepperdine University’s quarterly private Capital Access 
Index5 for the second quarter of 2013, 44% of the small businesses sur-
veyed turned to family and friends to finance their small businesses. What’s 
more, although that was listed as number five behind going to the bank, 
business credit cards, personal credit cards, and a personal loan—71% of 
those surveyed (number one on the list) found success there, well ahead 
of all the other capital sources mentioned.
Particularly for early-stage, small startups, peer-to-peer lending has the 
potential to make capital available to many small business owners who 
have no other options. The next chapter covers the financing designed to 
help small business owners purchase an existing business.

Business   
Acquisition  
Loans
When You Need Money Now
Many entrepreneurs, including a lot of Main Street business types, opt to 
purchase an existing business rather than build their business from the 
ground up. As I mentioned earlier, growing up in a family with a small 
business, there were a lot of conversations around the dinner table about 
the nature of small business—including the virtues of starting your own 
business as opposed to buying an established one. Because my dad had 
been successful at starting his business with nothing but a hope and a 
prayer (in addition to a pretty hefty second mortgage on our home), he 
didn’t think much of buying an existing business. Although I respect his 
opinion, my forays into business ownership have included purchasing a 
business already established with a clientele.
Although buying an existing business isn’t all a bed of roses, it can be a 
wise move in some curcumstances. Once you’ve identified your tolerance 
for risk and you know what type of business you want to be in, the 
following three questions can help you decide how you want to finance 
the business.
14
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 14 | Business  Acquisition Loans

Do You Have  Any Experience?
There’s no question, starting your own business carries a certain amount 
of risk. What’s more, if you have some technical expertise in your field, but 
don’t have any experience actually running a business, believe me, running 
a business is much harder than you might think. In fact, if you start your 
own business from the ground up, you’ll likely spend as much time doing 
the books, dealing with payroll, creating relationships with vendors, and 
other similar administrative tasks, as you do working in your business.
Purchasing an existing business often enables you to work with the exist-
ing owner for a time to learn the ropes. What’s more, you don’t want  
to ignore the importance and value of existing vendor and customer  
relationships—relationships you don’t need to build from scratch. You’ll 
likely already have employees, a functioning business plan, a market  
strategy, insight into current market conditions, and a tutor (the former 
business owner) who is motivated to make sure the business is a success.
Note
■
■
  One of the advantages of buying an existing business is the opportunity to work 
side by side with the current owner, who can show you the ropes, make introductions, provide 
wisdom related directly to the business you’re buying, and more.
What Kind of Business  Are  You Looking For? 
Are you looking for a business that is strongly identified with your per-
sonal brand? Or are you looking for a business that has already built a suc-
cessful brand? Although this is a book about how to finance a Main Street 
business, how you approach these questions will make a big difference in 
how you approach the challenges of financing a new enterprise.
After my dad passed away, my mother sold the family business to one of 
the employees. During the sale, he bought the inventory at a discount 
and immediately changed the name. In reality, what he was buying was the 
nearly 30 years of brand equity my father had created (which could have 
given the new owner a little bit of a head start). By immediately changing  
the name, he spent the money to purchase a business and start from 
scratch all at the same time.
Early in my career, I worked for a Main Street business that had just been 
purchased by a new owner. I worked with both of them for a couple of 
years under the name of the old owner, after which the new owner added 
his name to the marquee after the old owner’s name. A few years later, 
after the old owner completely retired, the new owner renamed the

company. He enjoyed several years of postive brand equity created by the 
old owner while at the same time building his own.
So once again: what kind of business are you looking for?
What Is  Your Risk  Tolerance? 
Although the upfront costs of acquiring an existing business are higher 
than starting from scratch, the bank is usually much more willing to loan 
money to an existing business with a successful track record than to a 
startup with no track record. Remember, time in business is one of the 
major criteria lenders want to know when considering a small business 
loan. Basically, this is not only a question of your risk tolerance, but also 
your bank’s.
In addition to time in business, lenders will also want to know annual rev-
enues and your projections for the future. It’s much easier to demonstrate 
these projections with an existing business with a history. Even if the busi-
ness is currently struggling, a smart buyer will have a plan in place to ramp 
up sales and turn the business around.
What’s more, you’ll already have employees in place, a predictable cash 
flow, instant customers, and products on the shelves, thus making your 
new business much more attractive to a potential lender.
Once you’ve asked yourself these questions and answered them to your 
satisfaction, it’s time to start looking for ways to finance your business. 
And yes, you have a few options.
The First 20 to 50 Percent Is On  You
Most lenders will expect you to come up with the first 20–50%. Lenders 
like to see skin in the game. Like my dad, I’ve always turned to the equity 
in my home to finance my entrepreneurial ventures. This is also a source 
of funds should your savings be insufficient.
A 3F loan—family, friends, and fools—can also be a source of funds. 
Depending on the type of business you’re purchasing, you might also 
look into angel investors. I read just this morning that a lot of the tech 
millionaires in Silicon Valley have turned to angel investing to put at least 
some of their cash to work. Of course, most angels invest in ventures 
they know something about, so if your business is in the Bay Area and 
happens to be a technology company, you just might be in the right place 
at the right time.
Regardless of the type of business you plan to purchase, don’t be surprised 
if the lender expects you to show up with some of the cash yourself.

Chapter 14 | Business  Acquisition Loans  
142
Is the Seller  Willing to Finance?
You might be surprised to learn that many sellers are not only willing to 
offer at least some of the financing, but they prefer it. In the story of my 
friend shared previously, with the exception of the down payment, the 
former business owner didn’t want the tax consequences of a large lump 
sum payment. He was looking at future monthly payments as a way to fuel 
his retirement and distribute the tax burden over the course of a couple 
of years. Of course, he did a lot of research into who was buying his 
business—to discover whether he thought the buyer would be successful 
as well as the buyer’s credit worthiness.
I did the same thing, making my payment out of the monthly cash flow 
generated by the business, in addition to borrowing some of the equity 
in my home to make the down payment. Having a current, monthly cash 
flow is one advantage to purchasing an existing business, and I tried to 
take advantage of it.
Note
■
■
  Current cash flow is one of the big advantages of buying an existing business. If you 
buy the right business and run it well, it can finance its purchase, and then some.
In addition to borrowing from the owner at what is often a very reason-
able interest rate (even if she is able to finance only a portion of the 
sale), seller financing can sometimes entice other lenders (like the bank) 
to invest.
The SBA 7(a) Loan Program
Chapter 5 discussed a number of loan programs offered by the SBA1 
(Small Business Administration). The 7(a) loan program is another source 
of funds the SBA has determined are appropriate to “…assist in the 
acquistion, operation, or expansion of an existing business.”
When you’re applying for a 7(a) loan, the same rules exist whether you’re 
purchasing an existing business or starting a new one. Be prepared to 
spend some time working with your banker. Remember, it’s not uncom-
mon to wait several weeks before you even speak with the banker and 
another several months before the loan is funded. This can definitely 
throw a monkey wrench into the works, depending upon how anxious 
the seller is to finalize the sale.

SBA lenders are a good place to turn if you intend to leverage cash flow 
to pay for the purchase of the business. The SBA looks favorably upon 
a business changing hands if it has the potential to increase sales and to 
hire more employees. That’s why the SBA encourages financing when the 
acquisition has enough cash flow to grow the business and cover borrow-
ing costs, even if the deal is low on assets for security.
Banks and Other Financial Institutions
There’s no question we are still experiencing a tight financial market, and 
the smallest businesses are still suffering the most. But there are lenders 
willing to offer financing to borrowers who can demonstrate:
A positive cash flow
• 
Solid management expertise
• 
Industry expertise
• 
A good credit history
• 
The key is to look for a lender who currently finances acquistions in your 
target industry. You may also be able to build a relationship with the bank 
that the seller uses.
Be aware, too, that alternative lenders have come to fill a niche in financing  
business acquisitions over the last few years. Some have been covered 
already, but here’s a brief rundown:
• 
Asset-based loans:  These are business acquisition loans 
that can be secured by any available collateral within 
the business being purchased as well as any collat-
eral the buyer has. This can include structures, inven-
tory, accounts receivable, equipment, and other fixed 
assets. Loans are typically 65 to 80% of asset value.
• 
Equity financing: Most private equity firms are inter-
ested only in multi-million dollar deals. They’re typi-
cally not on the lookout for a great deal on business 
with revenues less $2–$3 million. Additionally, if your 
business has the revenues an equity firm is looking for, 
they will likely want some control of your business—
maybe even as much as 51%. What’s more, they also 
expect a rate of return somewhere in the neighbor-
hood of 25% or more upon the sale of your busi-
ness. This is not the way to go if you intend to buy 
the business and pass it down to your kids.

Chapter 14 | Business  Acquisition Loans  
144
• 
Mezzanine financing: In a nutshell, mezzanine financing 
is basically a hybrid of debt and equity financing (bank 
financing and equity financing). As a result, you don’t 
need to give up as much equity—likely around 20%.
Before  You  Visit the Lender
It’s important to have your ducks in a row before you sit across from the 
loan officer. Be sure you have the answers to these questions when you’re 
ready to ask for financing:
• 
How much is the business going to cost? Don’t go to the 
banker if you don’t know. This isn’t the type of trans-
action where you want to test the waters. Make sure 
you’re “all in” before you visit the lender.
• 
Is the seller willing to finance any portion of the purchase? 
As mentioned earlier, this sometimes will entice 
other lenders to become part of the deal. When you 
sit across from the loan officer, he will likely want to 
know how much the seller is willing to finance along 
with the terms.
• 
Do you have any personal collateral? Every lender 
wants to see some skin in the game. Even though the 
business you’re purchasing likely has inventory, equip-
ment, and other fixed assets, the lender sees your 
collateral as an indication that you won’t just walk 
away if things go south. They may need a lien on your 
home or other property to act as collateral.
• 
Are your ducks in a row? Complete the loan package 
outlined in earlier chapters. Don’t take shortcuts. 
Make sure you have a complete application with all 
the information the lender requires.
• 
Have you talked with several lenders? Don’t feel like 
you’re stuck with the first lender to say yes (although 
I know that’s tempting). Make sure you speak with 
several lenders. Show them your loan package, have 
them quote terms and an interest rate, and choose 
the lender who offers you the highest chance of 
approval and the best terms.
• 
Can you follow up with due diligence? Although it might 
feel like a pain every time the lender calls with another 
question about your loan application, be prepared. 

Getting a Business Loan
145
Protesting isn’t going to help you get the loan you 
need. Don’t fudge or misrepresent anything on your 
application or on any of the follow-up questions. 
They’ll find out and your loan will be in jeopardy.
Pie in the Sky or the  American Dream?
I completely understand the desire to own your own business and buying 
an existing business is a great way to satisfy that desire. However, there 
are a few pitfalls to watch out for. I share them here because you must 
consider these pitfalls before you sign on the dotted line.
• 
Make sure your expectations are realistic. For example, 
it’s not very realistic to purchase a company, manage 
employees, and satisfy customers as an absentee 
owner. Make sure you don’t put on rose-colored 
glasses before you jump in with both feet. You need 
to maintain a practical and balanced perspective.
• 
Make sure you ask the right questions. I’m the first to 
admit that I don’t know what I don’t know. If you 
haven’t been through this before, make sure you have 
a trusted advisor (hopefully someone who has been 
through this process) to help you ask the right ques-
tions and understand the answers. Even if you have 
been through this before, it’s a good idea to get input 
from someone who isn’t as emotionally attached to 
the idea of buying the business.
• 
Don’t get emotional. Don’t let your love of any particu-
lar business make you sloppy. Make sure your dispas-
sionately look at the core metrics of the potential 
purchase before you make an offer to buy the busi-
ness and head over to the bank. If you don’t, the bank 
will. In fact, they will probably do it anyway.
• 
Don’t trust a handshake. Make sure it’s in writing.  
I learned this the hard way. It’s similar to being hired 
and promised, “If you do a good job and demonstrate 
your ability to contribute at a high level, we’ll give you 
a raise down the road.” I wonder how many times 
“down the road” actually comes. The same is true 
when negotiating the purchase of a business. If it isn’t 
in writing, it doesn’t exist.

Chapter 14 | Business  Acquisition Loans  
146
Tip
■
■
  Don’t trust a handshake. Get it in writing. Despite the best of intentions, people 
sometimes fail to follow through on promises.
 
• 
Trust but verify. Before you buy any business, make sure 
the company’s financials verify their claims. You might 
need to hire an accountant to go through everything 
to verify, but that is money well spent. Don’t be in 
such a hurry that you fail to make sure you’re getting 
what you’re buying.
• 
Don’t succumb to the “paralysis of analysis.” If you have 
a hard time deciding whether to buy the business, 
how will you be able to make decisions when you’re 
actually running it? Part of successful business own-
ership is the ability to make decisions—sometimes 
even with imperfect or incomplete information.
It’s Part of Being a Small Business Owner
Money may be tight and finding the money to purchase a new business 
isn’t the easiest thing in the world. But let’s face it, part of being a busi-
ness owner is finding the capital you need to fund (or purchase) your 
business. It shouldn’t be a surprise that the challenges of finding capital 
prohibit many would-be entrepreneurs from starting (or buying) their 
own businesses.
Purchasing an existing business may be easier to finance than starting from 
scratch, but it isn’t for the impatient or the faint hearted. Take your time, 
make sure you know what you’re buying, and then head to the bank.
Where Should  You Look for a Business 
Acquisition Loan?
This is one time I recommend a visit to the bank. Prepare your applica-
tion documents, make sure you have up-to-date financial information, and 
search for a banker willing to work with you. A community bank located 
near the area of the business you want to buy is a great place to start. It’s a 
good idea to try to build a relationship with the bank that the seller uses. 
The seller may even be able to give you a warm introduction.
Don’t forget: an SBA guaranteed loan is a great vehicle for purchasing a 
business, if you qualify.

Summary
For many, purchasing an existing business as the initial foray into entre-
preneurship is a good idea. For others, purchasing an existing small busi-
ness can prove to be a good strategy for expanding a business. The good 
news is, there are lenders who focus on helping your business acquisition 
strategy become a reality.
The next chapter covers a related topic: buying a franchise and finding the 
financing to do so. As you’ll see, there is financing specifically designed to 
help entrepreneurs purchase franchises.

Franchises
There’s a Loan for That
Many entrepreneurs decide to buy a franchise rather than start a new 
business for a number of reasons. Some of them are more obvious than 
others, but here are a few of them:
They can start with a ready-made client base
• 
The already have brand recognition
• 
They have a parent company to train them on successful 
• 
best practices
They have access to marketing resources they wouldn’t 
• 
have starting from scratch
The company has a proven business model (or at least 
• 
they say they do)
If you own or are thinking about purchasing a franchise, one or more of 
these reasons might be why. Did you know, depending on the franchise, 
it might also be easier to acquire the financing you need to get things 
started? Not only does the SBA offer small business loans targeted at 
franchises, they also offer advice regarding SBA-approved franchises.
Franchises approved by the SBA are business opportunities that have 
agreements accepted by the SBA. In other words, before you sign on the 
dotted line, the SBA has reviewed the agreement and it complies with 
SBA guidelines. If you purchase a franchise on the SBA-approved list, the 
loan process is quicker and easier. Because the franchise agreement has 
been preapproved, the loan review process is less complex, allowing you 
and the lender to focus on the specific aspects of your business plan 
rather than whether or not the franchise is viable.

Note
■
■
  Being on the SBA’s approved franchiser list doesn’t mean the SBA endorses 
the particular franchise. It simply means that it has reviewed and vetted the franchiser’s 
agreement, making it easier for you to get an SBA loan.
The SBA Approved List
Not being on the approved list doesn’t mean a franchise is a bad risk. 
There are numerous reasons any particular franchise might not be on the 
list. Some franchises decide that they don’t want to be included on the 
list. If you’re interested in a franchise that isn’t on the list, you’ll probably 
go through a little more complicated review process, but it doesn’t mean 
an SBA loan is out of the question. In fact, according to the SBA,1  “Being 
on or off the list is not an endorsement or indication of quality and profit-
ability, so you should still thoroughly research for your potential franchise 
opportunity.”
What’s more, even if your franchise is on the list, an SBA loan isn’t a slam 
dunk. You’ll still need to qualify for the loan. The same qualifying stan-
dards outlined in Chapter 5 regarding any SBA loan still apply.
Finding an approved francise isn’t difficult. In partnership with the SBA, 
the Franchise Registry2 publishes a list of approved franchises. You can 
visit the Registry and search by name to see whether the franchise you’re 
considering is on the list.
If the franchise is on the approved list, in addition to qualifying financially 
for the loan, you’ll still need to identify:
The purpose of the loan
• 
The history of the business
• 
Financial statements for three years (if you’re pur­
• 
chasing an existing franchise)
Aging accounts receivable and payable (if you’re pur­
• 
chasing an existing franchise)
Schedule of term debts (if you’re purchasing an existing 
• 
franchise)
Projected opening-day balance sheet (for new franchises)

Lease details
• 
Amount of investment in the business by the owner(s) 
• 
(the SBA and the lending institution will still want to 
see some skin in the game)
Projections of income, expenses, and cash flow
• 
Signed personal financial statements
• 
Personal resume(s) for each of the owners and principals
• 
Once you’ve decided on the franchise you want to purchase, the SBA 
suggests the following steps:
• 
Make sure you understand the SBA review process. This 
will minimize the amount of time it takes to complete 
the review. If you know what you need to submit and 
make sure you comply in a timely manner, it makes 
the process a little easier (this applies to any SBA 
guaranteed loan).
• 
Be prepared. Make sure you have all the documents 
needed to process your loan request.
• 
Pick a lender.  All across the country there are lenders 
who regularly work with the SBA and are familiar  
with the process. You’re not required to use a  
preferred lender, but anything that streamlines the 
process is a good idea.
Tip
■
■
  Be sure you understand the loan process, whether you’re going for an SBA loan 
or any other type of franchise financing. If you look like you know what you’re doing—rather 
than like a rookie—you’ll inspire more confidence in your potential lender.
The SBA’s Advice for Picking a Good 
Franchise
Franchises are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), so 
the government supplies some useful resources and advice designed 
to help prospective franchisees determine whether they’re buying into 
a legitimate and viable franchise. Even if you don’t pursue an SBA loan, 
they offer good information to help avoid some common scams.

Chapter 15 | Franchises
152
Detailed Disclosure Is the Law 
Franchise owners (franchisers) are required to provide you with specific 
information to help you make an informed decision. It’s called the Federal 
Trade Commission’s Franchise and Business Opportunity Rule.3 The franchisor 
is required to provide a “detailed disclosure document” during the pre-sale  
stage of your negotiations. It is required to include:
Contact information for at least 10 previous franchise  
• 
purchasers in your area
An audited financial statement
• 
Executive profile information
• 
A true view of the business startup and maintenance costs
• 
An outline of respective franchisee and franchiser 
• 
responsibilities
They are required to provide this document at least 10 days before you 
commit to a purchase or exchange any money. They take this seriously 
enough they have established a hotline should you feel a potential fran-
chiser is being less than forthcoming: 1-877-FTC-HELP.
Make Certain You Do Your Homework 
My dad used to say, “Locks are for honest people.” In other words, locks 
won’t keep out a crook if he really wants to get in, but they will keep an 
otherwise honest person from making a mistake if given the opportunity.  
I think this is true when evaluating a franchise opportunity too. Make sure the 
franchiser you’re about to deal with is truthful in how it reprepresents itself.
• 
The disclosure document: Make sure you read it and 
understand it. Call all 10 of the references. If you can 
meet with them in person, even if you have to travel to 
do so, it’s well worth the effort. Compare their responses 
to what was included in the disclosure document.
• 
Investigate success stories: The franchisor will likely 
insist that you can be as successful as you want to 
be. If they identify success stories on their web site 
or within their promotional materials, follow up. Do 
some detective work. Make sure the stories they’re 
telling are the real stories of franchise owners.

• 
Shop around: You’ll learn a lot by investigating several 
franchises. Reviewing several opportunities will help 
you make an informed decision about which fran-
chise is right for you.
• 
Don’t give in to a high-pressure sales pitch: The FTC 
requires a seller to wait at least 10 business days 
after giving you the required documents before  
making an agreement. Use those 10 days to make 
sure the franchise is right for you.
• 
Compare the contract to the sales pitch: The SBA’s 
advice? “Don’t sign any contract that doesn’t mirror 
the promises that have been made to you at the pre-
sale pitch.” Verbal and contractual promises should 
be exactly the same.
• 
Don’t forget your attorney: All the better if she is expe-
rienced with franchise law. It might cost a little more 
up front, but having a professional who is paid to 
protect your interests is a smart idea.
Financing Options Outside of the SBA
The SBA isn’t the only place to look to finance your franchise; there are 
other options you might want to consider, depending on the amount of 
cash you need and your current financial condition.
• 
Traditional financing: If you have a great credit rating,  
collateral, some cash of your own, and a strong  
business plan, a traditional term loan isn’t out of the 
question. The guidelines for application required by 
the SBA are still a good place to begin. Remember, 
your local banker will want to see how you plan 
to mitigate risk, so make sure your business plan is 
convincing.
• 
Retirement funds: Some companies will help you roll 
your 401k or other retirement funds into a business 
loan. In my opinion, this should be a financing vehicle 
of last resort, but there are no financial penalties 
associated with this type of financing. In other words, 
this can be a legal use of a retirement account and 
therefore won’t result in financial penalties, but you 
should consult your tax advisor to see if it is appro-
priate in your particular situation.

Chapter 15 | Franchises
154
• 
Leverage your home equity: You’re basically putting 
up your home as collateral if you choose to finance 
your franchise purchase this way, but this is not an 
uncommon way for many small business owners to 
get started.
• 
Alternative financing: There are also non-bank financ-
ing options available if you look online. Like other 
alternative financing, the application process is a little 
easier and loan approvals are a little quicker. You 
might pay a few percentage points more though, so 
make sure you investigate all your options.
• 
Franchiser financing: Many franchisers offer financing 
or partner with lenders who are familiar with their 
franchise, making the process a little easier. If the 
franchise you’re considering offers financing, and you 
qualify, this could be the easiest way to get started.
Bankers like brand names. Remember, bankers are generally risk averse. 
Depending upon the franchise, the brand’s reputation, and the number of 
franchisees around the country, franchises can be easier (or more difficult)  
to get funding for.
STANDARD TERMS FOR A FRANCHISE  
ACQUISTION LOAN
Expect to negotiate interest rates and terms depending upon the amount 
financed, your credit score, and collateral. Revisit Chapter 4 for more information 
about the terms and interest rates of traditional financing. You may also want to 
revisit Chapter 5 to read more about the SBA 7(a) loan program as well as visit 
SBA.gov to read more about their franchise loan program.
Avoid  These Franchise Funding Mistakes
Here are a few financing mistakes that many would-be franchise owners 
make:
• 
You get impatient: You’ve done your research, you’ve 
picked the franchise you want to buy, and you may 
have even met with a lender. Don’t let your emotions 
overcome you. You need to make sure the financing 
is as right as the franchise.

Getting a Business Loan
155
• 
Your financial house isn’t in order: Even if the last few 
years have been good to you, now is not the time to 
go out and buy the new car or a cabin in the woods. 
Make sure your credit report is accurate and up to 
date. Make sure you know your credit score and are 
ready to explain anything negative.
• 
You don’t avoid unnecessary credit purchases: Every  
time you purchase a big-ticket item on credit, a credit 
check is run. If this happens too often, it negatively 
reflects on your credit report. While you’re working  
to obtain financing to buy your franchise (or any 
small business loan for that matter), avoid any 
unnecessary purchases that require a credit check.
• 
You don’t avoid risky options: Like other small business 
financing, there are many options—your local bank 
isn’t the only place to get a loan. Some are more 
expensive than others and some are downright 
sketchy. Make sure you’ve done your homework 
before you jump in with both feet. The SBA’s list of 
approved franchises is a great place to start, even if 
you aren’t going to seek an SBA loan.
Tip
■
■
  Investigate the franchiser’s own loan program. If you’re a good credit risk, you might 
find speedy approval. And the terms might be slightly easier to negotiate. The franchiser, after 
all, wants you to succeed.
Where Should You Look for a Loan to 
Purchase a Franchise?
This is one time I recommend a visit to the bank and the SBA program. 
Prepare your application documents, make sure you have up-to-date 
finanical information, investigate whether they are on the SBA’s approved 
franchise list, carefully review the disclosure document all that franchises 
are required to give you, and search for a banker willing to work with 
you. A community bank near the business you want to buy is a great 
place to start.

Summary
Purchasing a franchise is many entrepreneurs’ entrée into small business 
ownership. And, many Main Street businesses just happen to be fran-
chises. Because there are loan products specifically designed to finance 
the purchase of a franchise, it’s often a little easier to access the capital 
you need to get up and running.
The next chapter covers funding a startup, one of the most challenging 
types of businesses to fund—regardless of the industry. Startup funding is 
not for the faint of heart.

Startup Funding
Crawl, Walk, Run!
One of the biggest challenges facing most budding entrepreneurs is finding 
enough capital to get things rolling. Finding a lender willing to fund an untested 
business model or an untested entrepreneur is a challenge. Although there 
are funds available for starting new businesses, finding the money may consist  
of a combination of the options mentioned in this book.
The Cold, Hard Facts
Finding the money to fund your startup isn’t easy. It’s even tough for the 
sexiest of the sexy tech companies with incredibly scalable business models.  
The successful startups that get funding from an angel or venture firm 
get talked about in the news, but there are many more who aren’t able to 
successfully woo an equity investor. The CEOs who are successful spend 
countless hours building presentations, searching for likely equity inves-
tors, pitching their young companies, and finding an investor who believes 
in them. The truth is, nothing is easy about startup funding—including 
equity funding.
Even if you recognize that equity funding is not a possibility for your 
business (which is true for 98% of Main Street businesses), most people 
headed to the bank around the corner soon realize their local banker isn’t 
interested in helping your “great idea” get off the ground either. Many 
Main Street businesses get startup funding the same way I did, my father 
did, and many of my friends did—they turn to the equity in their home or 
they bootstrap it until the startup starts making money.

Chapter 16 | Startup Funding

Funding a startup takes creativity. In fact some entrepreneurs, in industries 
like construction, landscaping, or similar businesses are able to fund an 
enterprise with sweat equity. Although this might not work for a high-tech  
firm, it’s common practice in many industries for established business 
owners to help new business owners “work” their way into the purchase 
of an existing business or get a new start.
Tip
■
■
  If you’ve come to the conclusion that your local bank is not going to fund your 
startup, it’s time to get creative. If you have a good idea, you persist, and you broaden your 
view of what constitutes a funding source, you will find the money you need to get a business 
off the ground.
One Way or Another, You Need to Have a 
Little to Make a Little More
If there’s a common theme throughout this book, it’s the four things every 
lender wants to know:
Your credit rating
• 
Your time in business
• 
Your annual revenues
• 
Your collateral
• 
It’s true that some lenders weigh some of this criteria differently than 
others, and even though they are willing to provide a loan if you have less 
than stellar credit, there are extra costs associated with it. Some lenders  
may be less concerned about a 550 credit rating than others, but the  
borrower makes up for it with a few years in business and a strong cash 
flow of credit card receipts or accounts receivable. What the borrower 
lacks in credit rating he makes up for in collateral (the credit card receipts 
or AR). Even then, an MCA (merchant cash advance) lender wants to see a 
year or two in business. Without a predictable monthly volume of credit 
card transactions, this isn’t an avenue you can turn to.
It’s a Lot Like the NBA
I remember watching the 1986 NBA Slam Dunk Champion Anthony 
“Spud” Web wow the crowd and win the title against guys much bigger  
than he. At five foot seven, Webb was a very unlikely professional  
basketball player, let  alone a superstar. Nevertheless, even Spud Webb 
never started as center for the Atlanta Hawks.

There are entrepreneurs who are able to successfully start, build, and 
thrive without the need of any financing, but it isn’t easy. Over the years 
I’ve known a number of small business owners who were able to build a 
business without financing. They start slow, maybe even have another job, 
and build the business over time. But starting a business from scratch, at 
least one that achieves significant revenues in just a few years, is a lot like 
asking a five foot seven guy to start as center for the Lakers. He’s probably 
gonna get creamed, no matter how talented he is.
Finding capital to fuel growth or fund working cashflow is one of the skills 
a successful entrepreneur needs to have. Spud may have made it in the 
NBA, but he’s the only guy that small I’ve ever seen in my lifetime do it. In 
some circles, the ability to find capital is considered the cost of entrance 
into the entrepreneurial game.
What’s Your Personal Credit Score?
If you don’t know, you need to know.
For any startup, every lender is going to make their initial assessment of 
your business credit worthiness based upon your personal credit wor-
thiness. In fact, even if you’ve been around for a few years, many lenders 
will still insist upon a personal guarantee. In other words, if your business 
fails to meet its obligations, they expect you to take those obligations on 
personally. Consider it another way lenders expect you to have skin in 
the game. 
This can work to your benefit if you have a pretty good credit score 
(680 or higher). Although you might not be able to convince a bank 
or other lender to fund your idea-stage startup, you might be able to 
secure a loan, obtain a credit card, or find other financing based upon 
your personal credit. The challenge is to make sure that you can meet 
those personal credit obligations—otherwise you’ll not only have a 
nonexistent business credit score, but your personal score will be 
damaged, making it even harder to acquire the money you need to 
run your business.
That’s one of the reasons small business lenders want visibility into your 
annual revenues. If there are no revenues, you need to demonstrate 
another way you are going to meet your obligation to the lender. No 
revenues usually means no way to repay the loan.

Chapter 16 | Startup Funding

Passion for Your Idea Just Isn’t Enough
My entire life, I’ve heard well meaning people suggest that following 
your passion is the way to be successful. Unforntuately, I’m not convinced 
that’s very good advice. It takes a lot more than passion to run a success-
ful business and sometimes the search to find your “passion” can even 
handicap an entrepreneur.
Brian Cohen, Chairman of The New York Angels,1 said:
Launching a business is about applying good business 
principles, finding what problems there are for disrup-
tion in the marketplace, applying innovative solutions, 
and—this may be the critical step—executing flaw-
lessly. The quest for passion hurts students when it 
stops them from taking action simply because they are 
unsure of their passion. Some more pertinent questions 
are: Is there a need in the marketplace? Can I actually 
meet that need? What do I need to learn to implement 
those ideas into action?2
As suggested by Mr. Cohen, I’m convinced the most successful small 
businesses see an unmet need in the marketplace and develop a product 
or service to meet the need. It’s true, many of them have a passion for 
what they’re doing, but meeting a marketplace need with a product cus-
tomers and potential customers are willing to pay for is the pathway to 
financing most startups—passion just isn’t enough.
One more question every new business owner should ask is, “Can I put 
together the money I’ll need to get through the first few years and help 
my business grow after that?”
Speaking from experience, it’s a lot easier said than done. What’s more, 
I’m not ashamed to admit I had to shut the doors on a business once 
because I just wasn’t able to find enough capital to keep it going. I started 
the business by leveraging some equity in my home and personal credit 
cards (like many Main Street business owners). Unfortunately, because 
I was unaware of other financing options available to me at the time, when 
my personal credit was maxed out, and my savings was long gone, I was 
forced to close up shop, let three people go, and start looking for a job.
Now, years later, there are a number of things I would have done ­differently. 
For starters, I would have paid more attention to the financing needs of 
my young company.

Note
■
■
  When you start a business, think deeply about your long-term funding needs on a 
regular basis. Identify the kind of money you’ll need at startup, a year down the road, five years, 
ten years, and so on. Reality will probably not reflect your projections, but it’s good to get in the 
habit of anticipating your needs.
When You Need More Money to Start than 
You Have Personal Credit
You’re not alone. There are many startup entrepreneurs just like you.
In recent years, many startups turn to crowdfunding. If you’re not familiar 
with the concept yet, you will be. The Internet is a hotbed of crowdfunding  
platforms. The traditional crowdfunding model solicits donations to an 
idea in exchange for access to the eventual product, such as a T-shirt. 
Some of these platforms focus on a particular geography while others 
focus on particular industries. Some are interested in any type of startup. 
Social networks are also starting to get into the mix, giving entrepreneurs 
even greater access to potential investors.
Although crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter3 (probably the best known 
crowdfunding site) have been around for a while, newer sites are making 
it possible for investors to trade equity, much like an angel or venture firm, 
for an investment in your company.4 Of course, that means you will have 
dozens, if not hundreds, of investors in your fledgling startup.
Most experts agree that making it easier for startups to raise capital 
this way will increase the amount of capital available for entrepreneurs. 
Although I’ve not personally invested in or received investment from 
a crowdfunding source, I believe almost anything that helps early-stage 
entrepreneurs is a good thing. Although I don’t believe it will change the 
failure rate of young companies, I’m convinced we need to throw as much 
spaghetti against the wall as possible, realizing that small business success 
is often a numbers game. Small businesses will likely continue to fail, but 
if there is capital that allows more businesses to start, the net gain will be 
more small business successes.
3http://www.kickstarter.com/
4 The regulations that allow entrepreneurs to sell equity or debt through crowdfunding 
sites have not been finalized as of the writing of this book, but the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission is expected to have them in place by the end of 2013. Be sure 
to get knowledgeable advice before embarking on this path—there are many rules 
you will need to pay strict attention to.

Other Sources of Funding
I’ve mentioned bootstrapping and tapping into your home equity. Here 
are some other sources worth considering if you’re looking for cash 
to get your startup off the ground. I’ll admit, some are more attractive 
than others.
• 
Friends and family: According to Pepperdine University’s 
Second Quarter Private Capital Index report for 
2013,5 71% of the small business owners turned to 
the “three Fs” for capital in the second quarter of 
this year.
You read about friends, family, and fools in Chapter 13. 
When all other sources of capital lead to a dead end, 
this is a source of capital for many entrepreneurs.
• 
Small business grants: As much bad press as the presi-
dent seems to get regarding his commitment to 
helping small businesses, the Obama administration’s 
initiative to encourage alternative energy sources 
and other technology provides grants for small 
businesses in that industry.6 Grants associated with 
other industries or geographic regions may be highly 
specialized, but if you happen to be in that industry  
or happen to be starting your business in an area 
where business development grants are available, it 
could be a source of capital. That’s not to say it’s an 
easy source of capital. Be prepared to jump through 
some hoops.
• 
Incubators: Companies, universities, or other entities  
provide everything from laboratories, office space, 
consulting, cash, and marketing in exchange for equity  
in your companies. Like any equity investor, you’ll be 
giving up a portion of ownership and profits down 
the road should your business go public or be sold. 
Incubators are more likely to be interested in tech-
nology startups and less likely to invest in a new 
barbershop.

• 
Bartering: I know what you’re thinking, but then again, 
maybe it’s my own personal bias when considering 
bartering a legitimate way to fund a small business. 
However, that same Pepperdine study revealed that 
57% of small business owners use trade credit to 
finance their small businesses, so I guess it’s a legiti-
mate funding option after all. A strategic partner 
within your market might have an interest in helping 
your startup and even provide funding. 
• 
Major customer funding: Depending upon the indus-
try, some customers are willing to invest in a young 
startup if it means they have access to your ­products 
before anyone else in the market. This also gives 
them some control over your product development, 
­production process, and dedicated support. Many 
large companies even look to their customers to 
fund new projects.
Tip
■
■
  When all else fails, turn to friends and family for help funding your business. Nearly 
three quarters of all founders do. But keep your eyes wide open and understand that failure to 
repay can cause rifts that never heal.
Avoiding the Startup Funding Pitfalls
Because startup funding is difficult for even the savviest entrepreneurs, 
you have to make sure all your ducks are in a row before you hit the 
streets looking for money.
• 
Don’t look for money with a half-baked business plan. 
There’s no substitute for a well-reasoned business plan 
when looking for startup cash. Treat startup funding 
the same way you approach the bank. Build a compel-
ling package that will convince any potential investor 
that your startup idea isn’t a whim, but a thoughtful 
approach to the market.
• 
Don’t ignore management. It’s easy to get wrapped up in 
the idea and spend all your time talking about your won-
derful new product. You also need to make sure you 
have all the players needed to make your idea a ­profitable 
reality. Investors want to know that you’ll be able to  
execute your idea and make a profit. They want to know 
who you’ll have in place to help make it happen.

Chapter 16 | Startup Funding
164
• 
Make sure you ask for enough money. The vast ­majority  
of great ideas fail because they run out of capital. Look 
at the worst-case scenario for your capital needs and 
try to fund that.
• 
Get an attorney. Every investor will want to reap the 
rewards of their investment just like every banker 
wants to make interest. Make sure any agreement 
you have with every investor is accompanied with a 
legal document covering the terms. 
• 
Cash flow is king. Beware the temptation to blow through 
your seed capital too quickly, and make sure you’re 
paying close attention to your payables and receivables. 
I’ve found out the hard way that once receivables 
aged past 60 days most—if not all—of the profit 
was gone. Investors expect you to stay on top of that 
part of your startup.
Startup funding is not easy. In fact, it’s tough enough to keep many hopeful  
entrepreneurs from starting a new business in the first place. If you’ve 
been smart with your personal credit, have done your homework, and are 
willing to think outside the box, you just might be able to find the cash you 
need to get your great idea off the ground.
Summary
This chapter covered the challenges associated with financing a startup. 
You read about many of the options available for finding funds for starting 
a new business. It’s definitely not for the faint of heart.
This next chapter discusses the options for finding funds during a crisis.

Crisis Borrowing
Help!
Growing up in a small business family, the ups and downs of my Dad’s busi-
ness was a regular topic of conversation around the dinner table. It didn’t 
help that my Mom worked in the business and that, as a teenager, I drove 
the delivery truck and worked in the warehouse. As I got older, I started 
working on the road as an outside salesman. My dad often expressed the 
opinion, “The only time the bank seems interested in lending me money 
is when I don’t need it.”
With the exception of the SBA’s disaster loans, which are available for 
small businesses in the aftermath of a declared disaster, there really isn’t 
much help for a struggling company in the midst of a crisis. If it feels like 
your banker is unwilling to stick her neck out to help in your time of 
need, you’re probably right. Remember, your banker is risk averse and 
isn’t going to be excited about throwing good money after bad. In fact, 
if he senses that you are in serious trouble, you might get a notice that 
your loan is due right now.
The best time to plan for a disaster is before the disaster.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t count on your banker to bail you out when you are in the midst of a cash 
crunch, especially if it appears they would be throwing good money after bad. Bankers are 
not in the bailing business. Do your best to identify possible sources of cash for surviving an 
emergency—before you need the money.

Slow and Steady Wins the Race
I love the story of the tortoise and the hare. Just in case you’re unfamiliar 
with this famous Aesop fable, I’ll share it here:
The once was a very speedy hare who always boasted 
about how fast he could run. Tired of his constant 
bragging, a tortoise challenged him to a race.
Thinking the tortoise would be no match for his 
speed, the hare accepted.
Not long after the race began, the hare (well ahead 
of the tortoise) stopped for a nap. While he slept, 
the tortoise crept by. Just as the tortoise was 
about to cross the finish line the hare awoke, but 
it was too late.
After that the hare had to admit it wasn’t his speed 
but rather slow and steady that won the race.
It’s far too easy to put off crisis planning or ignore potential risks when 
things seem to be smooth sailing. However, that’s the time to do it.
Responding to a Small Business  
Financial Crisis
I can’t think of a single small business owner I’ve spoken to who wants to 
think about having setbacks resulting in a serious financial crunch. However, 
if you haven’t thought about what you’d do in such a situation, and instead 
wait until you are in the middle of a crisis, it might be too late.
I recently spoke to a very savvy woman who’s successfully been at the 
helm of her construction-related business for over 20 years. When I 
asked her what she thought made her successful, I don’t think she even 
took a breath before she responded, “I had a business plan that addressed 
good times and bad.”
I couldn’t help but admire her thoughtful approach. Because she had no 
illusions regarding the likelihood that her business would go through good 
times and bad, she gave serious thought as to how her company would 
prepare for bad times. Much like saving for a rainy day, her company set 
aside funds each month to bolster revenue if income took a temporary 
dip—regardless of the reason.
When a crisis happens, here are a couple of suggestions that might help 
your business survive the setback.

• 
Take an honest look at the situation. Sometimes things 
aren’t as dark as they appear. Most of the time, a 
financial setback is a temporary situation. You may 
need to adjust your spending priorities and access 
any capital set aside for such a situation, but take 
some time to regroup and dispassionately analyze 
the situation.
• 
Activate your plan. If you’ve given the situation advance 
thought and included those thoughts in a business 
plan, activate the plan. If you haven’t created a business 
plan that includes disaster planning, you’ll need to cre-
ate one. The immediate concern is to fill the gap left 
by the lost income. If you haven’t put aside any capital 
for such an event, you might need to explore other 
financing options. The trick is to accurately evaluate 
whether you expect this to be a temporary setback 
or a long-term challenge. Temporary setbacks can 
often be overcome by reducing spending, where long-
term challenges force some pretty tough decisions. 
For most small business owners, it’s tough to finance 
your way out of a long-term financial crisis.
• 
Determine your financial priorities. Start by categorizing 
your expenses on a scale from “Can’t do without it” 
to “We can survive without it.” Anything in the sec-
ond category should be cut immediately. I know one 
small business owner who, upon the death of a key 
partner—about the same time the economy came 
to a grinding halt in 2008—waited too long to let go 
of employees the company couldn’t afford and didn’t 
need during the recession. Instead, he spent their 
reserves on “We can survive without it” projects to 
keep the staff busy. Eventually, it was obvious they 
needed to reduce staff, but it was too late. They had 
spent their reserve funds keeping employees they 
couldn’t afford busy instead of keeping the business 
alive. After almost 40 years, they eventually had to 
shut the doors.
• 
Be flexible. A financial crisis will often force you to make 
decisions you wouldn’t otherwise make. Sometimes 
you need to set new goals, commit to doing whatever 
it takes, and readjust your expectations.

Disaster Loans
You read about the SBA’s disaster loans in Chapter 5. If your financial 
crisis is the result of a declared disaster, such as Hurricane Sandy, which 
took place in the fall of 2012, the SBA provides low interest loans that 
assist small businesses that have experienced physical damage due to the 
disaster. There are also loans for businesses experiencing economic injury 
in the aftermath of a disaster. You can learn all about government help for 
businesses hit by a disaster here:

grants/small-business-loans/disaster-loans
Other Disaster Financing Options
If you have a good relationship and track record with your banker, she might 
make some capital available, but remember, bankers won’t throw good 
money after bad. Before you talk to the banker, make sure you’re prepared 
to explain how you will turn your financial situation around. “We’re going 
to go out and sell more,” might not be enough. You need to convince your 
banker that your current situation is a temporary setback that can be 
remedied with the extra time a small business loan may afford.
Unfortunately, most businesses in 2008 and 2009 quickly discovered that 
there just wasn’t capital available, following the meltdown in the financial 
sector and the beginning of the Great Recession.
You may need to access your personal lines of credit—your home equity 
or your credit cards. Even if you’ve been in business for several years, 
depending on your industry and the nature of the crisis, you may find 
yourself “untouchable.” Small business financing organizations are still 
digging out of the mess created by events of the last four or five years.

  Bankers may work with you to bridge capital shortfalls if they believe you can get on 
your feet again. It’ll help if you have a new win to bolster your case—such as a major new client, 
a big order, and so on.
Have You Considered Throwing in the Towel?
There comes a time when the unthinkable decision is the only one left. 
Having had to close a business myself, I understand how difficult it is to 
announce to your employees your intention to close the doors. I don’t 
think I’m unique when I say that I stuck it out much longer than I probably 
should have.

About that time, one of my sons gave me a picture of Abraham Lincoln 
I still have hanging up in my home office. Lincoln endured a steady stream 
of failure, before he was elected president of the United States:
1832	 Lost his job and was defeated in a bid for the 
state legislature
1833	 His business failed
1835	 His sweetheart passed away
1836	 He had a nervous breakdown
1838	 He was defeated in a bid to become speaker 
in the Illinois House of Representatives
1843	 He was defeated in his nomination for 
Congress
1848	 He was defeated in a bid for U.S. Senate
1856	 He was defeated as a candidate for vice presi-
dent of the United States
1858	 Again defeated in a bid for the U.S. Senate
1860	 He was elected president of the United 
States
I’ve always admired President Lincoln—his ability to bounce back after 
defeat has inspired me for many years. Although allowing a business to 
give up the ghost is never easy, it isn’t the end. There are countless stories 
of highly successful entrepreneurs who did the same.
Summary
Previously you read about how financing a startup is likely the most 
difficult funding challenge a small business will have. In reality, it’s even 
more difficult to finance your business in the midst of a crisis. My grand-
mother always talked about setting something aside for a rainy day. 
She canned vegetables, put up fruit, and stocked the shelves of her fruit 
cellar every summer in preparation for the winter months—and the 
rainy day. The most savvy small business owners do the same thing.
The next chapter talks about the unique opportunities for funding a 
woman-owned business.

It’s No Longer a Man’s World
Former SBA Administrator Karen Mills suggested in March of 2012,1 
“Today, women-owned businesses are the fastest-growing segment of new 
businesses in our economy.”
Citing analysis conducted by American Express, Mills said, “[T]he number 
of women-owned businesses has risen by 200,000 over the past year 
alone, which is equivalent to just under 550 new women-owned firms 
created each day.”
What was almost exclusively the domain of men seems to be changing. 
Not long ago I had the opportunity to speak with two very successful 
women who have been in business for over 20 years. One owns what 
many people consider a stereotypically woman-owned business—a dance 
studio. The other woman operates a business that would more likely be 
identified with men. She runs an industrial sign manufacturing company.
Both women have been in business for over 20 years, and I consider them 
successful. Having survived the Great Recession strong and healthy, I’d call 
them wildly successful.

As I talked with these women about the challenges they’ve faced over 
the last 20 years, there were many similarities in their stories. This is 
despite the fact that their backgrounds and the nature of their businesses 
are different. Both graduated from college and both have experienced 
the challenges associated with finding capital. Like many small businesses, 
the dance studio was initially capitalized with home equity. “Originally, the 
bank didn’t take me very seriously,” she said. “The only way I could find 
capital was to get a second mortgage on my home.”
Capitalizing the sign company, although challenging, was a little easier 
because this owner had some mentors and partners who helped bolster  
her credibility. Over the last 20 years, both businesses have found it  
easier to obtain the capital they’ve needed. That’s due in part because of 
the strength of their individual businesses, but also because the attitude 
toward a woman-owned business is different today than it was 20 years 
ago. Writes Mills2:
As Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA),  
I travel all around the country meeting with small business owners 
and entrepreneurs. I see how their businesses are transforming their 
industries and rebuilding their communities following the economic 
downturn.
These are businesses like UEC Electronics in South Carolina. Rebecca 
Ufkes, an engineer and the company’s president, is laser focused on 
growing her successful electronics manufacturing business. She is 
supplying products to major manufacturers, such as Boeing, Cummins 
Engine Co, as well as the U.S. Marines and Air Force. And she is 
creating good American manufacturing jobs in the process.
UEC employs 194 workers, an increase of 49 percent since August 
2011. And Rebecca is part of a growing American supply chain 
of innovative small businesses that is driving large multinational 
manufacturers to bring more production back to the U.S.
The days when companies like UEC were exclusively the domain of men 
is fast coming to an end. Lenders are starting to appreciate the fact. That 
doesn’t necessarily mean that lenders are falling all over themselves to 
lend to women-owned businesses, but then again, acquiring capital is a 
challenge for any Main Street business owner. However, the SBA has made 
more than $12 billion available to women-owned businesses through 
35,000 or more loans to women-owned businesses since President 
Obama took office.

As discussed, the SBA is not a lender, but they do guarantee what is 
arguably the largest pool of capital available for women-owned businesses. 
With that in mind, the SBA’s definition of what makes a woman-owned 
business is probably the best place to start.
What Is a Woman-Owned Business?
As you might expect, the SBA is pretty specific when it comes to identifying 
exactly what is a woman-owned business and what is not.3
Women-owned small business concern means a small business 
concern—(a) which is at least 51 percent owned by one or more 
women; or, in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 
percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more women; and 
(b) whose management and daily business operations are controlled 
by one or more women.
—Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 19.001 Definitions
SBA Guaranteed Financing for  
Women-Owned Businesses
Although the federal government does not offer grants to women (and 
minorities) for funding a business, through their loan guarantee program they 
help fund many women-owned businesses. The SBA claims that SBA-backed 
loans to women- or minority-owned businesses are three to five times more 
likely than other bank loans. Your local SBA office4 is a great place to find a 
certified lender in your area who can help you through the SBA process.
Other Resources for Woman-Owned 
Businesses
In addition to the SBA, there are other avenues for women entrepreneurs. 
Here are just a few:
• 
The Women’s Funding Network:5 This network matches 
women seeking funding with investors and interested 
parties to provide capital. Members of the network 
invest about $65 million annually.

• 
The Ada Project for Women:6 Like most grants, many 
of these are earmarked for specific industries. This 
grant is oriented for women in computer science. 
The group offers fellowships, scholarships, confer-
ences, and other opportunities to network.
• 
Grants.gov:7 Although the federal government does 
not offer grants specifically to women, they can’t dis-
criminate either. This site lists several governmental 
grants with a searchable database.
• 
American Association of University Women:8 The AAUW’s 
goal is to help women get ahead in areas where they 
are underrepresented, such as business ownership. 
This organization does not offer specific loans or 
grant programs for women starting in business, but 
helps a potential women get a higher education and 
provide funding for graduates at crucial times during 
their careers.
This list is by no means comprehensive, and a Google search reveals 
millions of other likely links. Lest you start thinking the “free?” money 
associated with a grant trumps a small business loan from the bank, you 
might want to consider that such grants are not easy to come by—at 
least not any easier than a loan. There are numerous options for obtaining 
financing. Were I a woman entrepreneur, the success rate claimed by the 
SBA would be appealing to me. Nevertheless, you will still need to qualify 
with the same basic credit requirements found in Chapter 5 of this book 
and delineated on the SBA web site.9

Minority-Owned Businesses
The SBA’s 8(a) Business Development program can help qualifying 
minority-owned businesses develop and grow their companies through 
a number of services that include counseling, training workshops, manage-
ment, and technical guidance. Although the 8(a) program isn’t intended 
to certify minority-owned businesses generally, it does certify businesses 
considered to be socially and economically disadvantaged under its nine-
year 8(a) Development Program.
This is not a loan program, but it does provide access to government 
contracting opportunities, which amounted to $18.4 billion in 2010.
It shouldn’t be surprising that minority-owned business owners, like every 
other Main Street business owner, struggle finding the capital they need. 
The Minority Business Development Agency,10 part of the U.S. Department 
of Commerce, provides a number of resources that include access to  
contracts, capital, and other tools to help minority business owners.
To help minority business owners find the capital they need, they have 
MBDA Business Centers11 all over the country. These centers offer finan-
cial counseling to help minority-owned businesses grow.
The MBDA doesn’t provide loans or grants, but rather provides grants to 
the Minority Business Centers mentioned previously. The Business Centers 
provide consulting and financial assistance to minority-owned firms.
Alternative Funding for Women-Owned and 
Minority-Owned Businesses
Alternative-funding sources like MCA loans, factoring, and peer-to-peer 
financing offer strong alternatives to bank loans. Savvy business owners 
who qualify can follow some of the advice mentioned here as well as tap 
into the resources provided by the SBA and the MBDA to help them 
better prepare for their chat with a lender. In my opinion, anything that 
improves your odds is a good thing.

Summary
This chapter covered the funding options available for women entrepre-
neurs. In recent years, more and more women have been starting and 
very successfully running their own businesses—some in industries that 
have traditionally been considered the domain of men.
In the next chapter, which is the final chapter, you’ll learn why small 
business is so important to the American economy and why access to 
capital is so important.

Small Business
The Backbone of America
There are nearly 30 million small businesses in this country—six million   
of them with 20 or fewer employees. These are the businesses you and   
I identify with when we think of small businesses. It’s where we all go to 
buy groceries, gas up our cars, get a haircut, and have our shirts pressed. 
When politicians want to talk about small business, these are the folks they 
talk about. I think it’s past time they stopped talking about how important 
these businesses are to our economy and started doing something to help 
them. Writes Gary Belsky:
The [SBA] defines a loan to small business as any business loan of 
$1 million or less. So a $1.1 million loan to a chain of dry cleaners 
with $5 million in revenues doesn’t get counted, while a $500,000 
loan to a 150-worker auto parts wholesaler does.1
Is it any wonder it’s so hard for anyone, including small business owners, 
to understand what the politicians are talking about when they talk about 
small business?
Washington does understand (or at least they should) the value of Main 
Street businesses. According to the SBA, “Today, there are more than   
28 million small businesses in the United States, and those firms create   
two out of every three net new jobs and employ half of America’s 
workforce.”2

  Small businesses in the United States create two out of every three new jobs. They 
deserve more attention—and more capital—from financial institutions and from the government.
What’s a Small Business?
The definition of what constitutes a small business is somewhat convo-
luted in my opinion. You learned about the confusing definition of a small 
business in Chapter 1. I agree with Karen Mills, speaking as administrator 
of the SBA, “[W]hen you dive into the data, you see that not all small busi-
nesses are the same.”
She continued, “Some are startups that are poised to revolutionize their 
industries. Others are innovative small suppliers that make large corpora-
tions more productive. There are also Main Street businesses that are 
critical to our communities and the sole proprietors who have used their 
experiences to launch their own firms.”3
Each of the groups Administrator Mills identifies as small businesses—
sole proprietorships, Main Street businesses, high-growth businesses, and 
suppliers—all have different capital needs and can’t be dumped into the 
same bucket or lumped into the same category. If the country is really 
interested in job growth, I think it’s time to start investing in the very 
companies Mills identifies as the biggest job creators.
Unfortunately, It Isn’t Happening
At the end of the second quarter of 2013, the National Small Business 
Association (NSBA) released its 2013 Mid-Year Economic Report.4 One 
of the data points applies to the discussion regarding Main Street and the 
challenge associated with finding the capital those business owners need 
to create jobs and fuel local economies:
Today, just two-thirds of small businesses (65 percent) report they 
are able to obtain adequate financing, down from 73 percent six 
months ago.
The report also suggests that many business owners may be feeling more 
confident about the economy generally, but they don’t see a positive out-
look for their own businesses.

Forty percent of survey respondents have fewer than five employees and 
66% of respondents report 19 employees or fewer. The vast majority 
sound like the Main Street-type businesses this book was written for. The 
inability of these businesses—the very businesses that are the real job 
creators in this country—to find the capital they need to thrive and grow 
is something we need to pay attention to if we expect to create jobs and 
grow local communities. Sixty-five percent just isn’t enough.
The report authors also point out, “Small business plays a huge role in 
economic growth, specifically when it comes to hiring. Unfortunately, just 
18% report increasing their employee size, while 26% report decreases in 
employee size, resulting in negative net employee growth.”
I believe a failure of the system to help small business doesn’t look good 
for job growth down the road. However, for the smallest small businesses, 
the challenge of finding capital isn’t a new phenomenon.
We Need to Stop Blaming the Recession—It  
Was Only Part of the Problem
Not too long ago the Cleveland Federal Reserve5 published a paper sug-
gesting, among other things, that small businesses would continue to 
struggle to find the capital they need for at least the foreseeable future.
Please don’t interpret what I’m about to say as an indictment against banks in 
general, because it isn’t. I just don’t think we can ignore the fact that traditional 
small business lending is in decline and many small business owners can’t turn 
to the local community bank for a small business loan. What’s more—as 
much as the recent recession did to exacerbate the situation—it looks like 
there has been a steady decline in small business lending since 1995.
Recent declines in small business lending also reflect longer-term 
trends in financial markets. Banks have been exiting the small business 
loan market for over a decade. This realignment has led to a decline 
in the share of small business loans in a bank’s portfolios.
The 15-year long consolidation of the banking industry has reduced the 
number of small banks, which are more likely to lend to small businesses. 
Moreover, increased competition in the banking sector has led bankers 
to move toward bigger, more profitable loans. That has meant a decline 
in small business loans, which are less profitable (because they are 
banker-time intensive, are more difficult to automate, have higher costs 
to underwrite and service, and are more difficult to securitize).

In a nutshell, there are fewer community banks and many bankers are 
moving upstream to potentially bigger and more lucrative fish. The finan-
cial crisis caused by the Great Recession hasn’t done anything to help the 
plight of Main Street business owners looking for capital, but the climate 
that exists today didn’t start there.
There Is Hope, One Lender at a Time
The focus of this book has been to highlight the options small business 
owners have to finance their businesses when the bank says no, but that 
doesn’t mean there isn’t hope at the bank. Not too long ago I met with 
the vice president of a local community bank to talk about what they 
were doing differently than other banks to help the small business owners 
in their community. We both agreed the lifeblood of every community is 
the health and strength of local small businesses.
Her bank doesn’t have a national footprint. In fact, they don’t even have 
multiple branches; they are a single branch within a very defined com-
munity. You should also know they are that way by design, and have been 
since 1974. Their mission is to serve their local community, which is still 
their mission today.

  Small community lenders in many towns are doing a great job responding to the 
capital needs of local businesses. The problem is, not every community has such a bank. 
Thanks to consolidation, larger regional banks, who could step up to serve small businesses, 
instead have their eyes set on larger firms and the more lucrative loans they can make in the 
mid-sized sector.
For nearly 40 years, the bank’s small business lending focus has been 
real estate-backed loans, and they’ve become known for that exper-
tise. In recent years, they started making more traditional SBA-backed 
small business loans within the 7(a) program. When I asked what they 
were doing differently from other 7(a) lenders in the area, she said, 
“We work with a lot of small business owners who have good, healthy 
businesses, but aren’t perfect. They might not meet the restrictive 
standard of norms and requirements set by bigger small business 
lenders in our area, but they have proven to be great small business  
loan customers.”

181
When I asked her to be more specific about their approach, she said there 
were four key items they look for when targeting customers:
• 
Character and history. The last few years have been tough 
for everyone on Main Street. If you’re in a business that 
hasn’t felt the pinch, consider yourself very fortunate. 
Because this banker wants to help the businesses in 
her community, even those who have less than perfect 
credit, she looks at the management team, whether the 
business is now current with their monthly obligations, 
if they have a good product, how competitive they are 
their market, and so forth. Sometimes these indicators 
can mitigate a less-than-perfect credit history.
“If there’s a good management team and these other 
factors are in place, we can make a case to the lend-
ing board that the business is a good candidate for 
a loan,” she said. “Of course there is a credit score 
threshold we won’t go below, but we want to make 
sure we’re doing the best we can for all the small 
businesses in our community.”
• 
Appreciation for what it’s like to be a small business. “Main 
Street business customers are what we’ve built our 
business on,” she said. “Although we do a lot of big-
ger loans, I’m just as happy to help the small business 
owner who is looking for a $50,000 loan. To a lot of 
the Main Street businesses in our community, that’s a 
big loan. We understand what it’s like to be the little 
guy—in some respects, we’re the little guy too.”
Processing the paperwork for a $50,000 loan is 
just as cumbersome and costly to the bank as with 
a $500,000 loan. It’s hard to argue against the logic 
of avoiding the smaller loan amounts. Unfortunately, 
Main Street isn’t often looking for anything more. In 
fact, my experience at Lendio6 is relevant here. Of 
the thousands of small business owners who visit 
the web site every month, 59% are looking for loans 
of $50,000 or less. As long as regulations make it 
unprofitable to lend to Main Street, the banking indus-
try isn’t going to do it. Streamlining the process for 
what the SBA considers micro-loans (loans of less 
than $50,000) would be a good start.

• 
The documentation burden of small business lending. It’s 
not uncommon for the months-long approval pro-
cess to take its toll on a small business owner. What’s 
more, “most banks are six weeks out before they’ll 
even talk to you about an SBA loan,” says our com-
munity banker. “Instead of sending the 20-page packet 
to the borrower and wishing them luck, I try to 
meet with potential borrowers right away. Instead of 
expecting the small business owner to plow through 
a bunch of unfamiliar documents, I digest their finan-
cial statements and other documents and start the 
SBA forms myself. That way, the next time we meet, 
we can fill in the blanks and try to shorten a very 
lengthy approval process.” 
• 
Community lending decisions are made in the community. 
Of course this is problematic for bigger banks, but 
the approval process begins and ends within the walls 
of a single branch. Everyone involved in the lending 
process is under one roof, part of the same team, 
and invested in helping the small business community 
in their community. Although this particular commu-
nity bank is on the smaller end of the small business 
lending continuum, I think they’re on to something. 
It reminds me of what it was like when our banker 
took this kind of interest in us—he was familiar with 
our industry, he knew my partners and myself, and he 
liked to do business at our office. When we needed 
cash, he made it happen.
I think this is a great example of what community banks all over the coun-
try should be doing to encourage small business growth. Before our con-
versation ended, she shared a great example of what their bank is doing 
differently. She described a member of their lending board who wasn’t 
very positive about a small business loan to a local restaurant. In fact, he 
was going to vote against the loan.
Before the vote, he decided that it didn’t make sense to vote against the 
restaurant until he had eaten there. After his visit to the restaurant, he 
became one of its biggest advocates. Because he made the extra effort 
to see for himself, the less-than-perfect potential borrower (if measured 
exclusively by credit score, time in business, and collateral) gave him 
another data point to mitigate some of the potential risk, enabling the 
bank to make the loan.

It’s Really Sad When Even Small Business 
Advocates Don’t Get It
Early in September of 2013, Ray Hennessey, the editorial director of 
Entrepreneur.com, a popular source of information for small business 
owners all around the country, blithely suggested, “It’s high time to elimi-
nate the SBA altogether.”7
I wish I could say that Hennessey was alone in this opinion. As I speak and 
write about this topic, there are many in certain sectors of the business 
community who remind me that they agree with him.
I don’t happen to be one of them.
I agree that there are problems at the SBA. I just don’t think throwing 
the baby out with the bath water is a good idea. Hennessey suggests, 
“The SBA’s loan programs are designed to fund businesses that can’t 
find funding elsewhere.” He suggests private equity and venture firms 
raise billions of dollars to fund the good ideas.
I’m not sure what Hennessey is thinking. As you read about earlier in this 
book, only a very small percentage of small businesses (even fewer Main 
Street businesses) are likely to have a scalable-enough model to interest a 
private investor or venture firm. It seems naïve to suggest that a new dry 
cleaner or hardware store would have any luck convincing a venture firm 
to invest in its business.
The SBA, banks, and other small business-focused lenders fill an important 
niche to the very businesses you and I consider small.
It sounds like Hennessey is suggesting that any business that isn’t interesting  
to a private equity investor or venture firm is a bad business?
Mr. Hennessey does point out that lumping sexy tech startups, Main Street 
businesses, and larger small businesses into the same category just doesn’t 
make sense. Nevertheless, labeling the company that presses my shirts as 
unworthy of credit because a venture firm is likely uninterested in funding 
their company is kind of shortsighted.
The SBA does have some problems, but guaranteeing (remember, it’s local 
banks that really do the lending) too much capital to Main Street doesn’t hap-
pen to be one of them. The smallest small businesses are still struggling for 
capital as banks remain anxious about lending to them. Does that imply they 
are bad companies or their ideas are bad ideas? Heavens no. It does suggest 
that the way we approach lending to Main Street needs to be re-evaluated to 
better serve that segment of the small business borrower market.

Mr. Hennessey suggests the SBA has a horrible track record and funds 
risky ventures. He may have missed Deborah Gage’s piece in the Wall 
Street Journal8 late in 2012. “[T]here is evidence that venture-backed start-
ups fail at far higher numbers than the rate the industry usually cites,” she 
says. “About three-quarters of venture-backed firms in the United States 
don’t return investors’ capital, according to recent research by Shikhar 
Ghosh, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School.”
Note
■
■
  Bad loans are the bane of every lender, from the local bank to the richest venture 
fund. Regardless of rigorous pre-loan due diligence, a large percentage of businesses will fail 
no matter who lends the money. And private equity and venture capital firms are not as adept 
as they think at picking the winners.
Although venture capitalists like to laud their success rates, “The National 
Venture Capital Association estimates that 25 to 30% of venture-backed 
businesses fail,” she writes.
What’s more, the likelihood the average small business would be interesting 
to an equity investor is only around 2%. They just don’t have the potential 
to scale big enough to make investors interested in the rate of return.
If there’s a problem with small business lending, it’s the definition of what 
we call small businesses. I’ve spent my entire career working in small busi-
ness. I’ve worked in a Main Street business with fewer than five employ-
ees, along with a software company with almost $30 million in revenues 
and more than 250 employees, and the venture-backed startup I work at 
now. They are all categorized as “small businesses” but have very different 
capitalization needs.
I don’t know how anyone can suggest that banks aren’t facing risks and are 
making bad decisions with money backed by the SBA when the success 
rate of venture capitalists and other equity investors isn’t much to sing 
and dance about. Some startups fail. There’s not much we can do about 
that, regardless of how much research we’ve done into their potential 
viability. I’m not convinced it’s irresponsible bankers foisting bad loans 
onto the SBA. I think it’s just a part of the same small business environ-
ment that causes 35% of venture-backed businesses to fail, too.
Hennessey also writes, “[The SBA is] not as important as you think.” He 
argues, “In short, large businesses, in industries that matter most, get only a  
negligible amount of funding from SBA-backed loans. That means shutting

down the program would have a negligible effect on lending. Why keep a 
government agency in place if most of the market wouldn’t notice it is gone?”
Main Street is what keeps communities alive, where most of U.S. jobs 
exist, and where most jobs are created. Based on the sheer number of 
employers, then, the majority of the market would in fact notice if the SBA 
disappeared.
If anything, I think the SBA should be encouraging the banks within its 
system to step up and make more loans to Main Street business own-
ers. They could do this by streamlining the process for loans of less than 
$50,000, for starters. Big businesses in major industries don’t need the 
SBA, that’s true. What’s more, the SBA wasn’t created to help big busi-
ness. It’s the businesses you and I rely on to fix our cars, provide childcare 
to our children, and do our dry cleaning.
There Are No Easy Answers
Although there are community banks all over America that are anxious 
to lend to small business, alternative lenders who are making capital 
available to thousands of small business owners who need the cash to 
grow and thrive, and equity investment for the lucky few who qualify, 
we’re a long way from getting the job done. Unfortunately, there’s no easy 
answer either.
It is time for politicians on both sides of the aisle to come to the table 
with ideas that will help the very entrepreneurs that are most likely to 
fuel the economy. Hopefully, there will come a time when there won’t be 
a need for a book like this.
Until then, don’t take “no” from your banker as a legitimate answer. You 
have options.

To the Main Street business owners who create the 
jobs and keep our local communities alive

Preface
I’ve spent the 30 or so years of my career in small business. Most of that time 
has been spent working with the Main Street–type businesses that feed us, 
do our dry cleaning, service our automobiles, and perform dozens of other 
services. Largely underappreciated, these Main Street businesses create the 
lion’s share of new jobs and employ about half of the workforce in the United 
States.
Although politicians and community leaders like to laud the achievements of 
the successful business leaders within their communities, it sometimes feels 
like the deck is stacked against them. Ask any small business owner, and he 
or she will likely acknowledge that access to capital is one of the biggest 
challenges they face every day. 
Recent years have been tough for everyone. Since the financial meltdown, 
subsequent recession, and the plodding recovery, our friends on Main Street 
have taken a beating. Regulators, along with an overall tightening of credit,  
have made it difficult for business people to find the capital they need to 
grow, hire employees, and strengthen local communities. What’s more, many 
risk-averse bankers have even moved upstream to what they claim are more 
profitable customers, leaving the businesses that have traditionally relied on 
them as a vital part of the Main Street business community out in the cold.
It hasn’t been that long ago that a small business owner could walk into 
the bank with an opportunity and walk out with the financing to make it a 
reality—those days are gone. Credit score, time in business, annual revenues, 
and collateral rule the day. Bankers want perfect borrowers. Unfortunately, 
most of us aren’t perfect.
Fortunately for small business owners, there are still community banks and 
other non-bank lenders still interested in helping Main Street thrive and grow. 
You simply need to know where to look. This book should help.

Acknowledgments
It would have been impossible to finish this work without the support of 
my wife Sue. Her encouragement and support made it easy to devote the 
time required to finish. I also need to thank my editor Jeff Olson for his 
help, advice, and support. He always seemed to know just the right thing 
to say to help move the book along. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge the work of Brock Blake and my 
colleagues at Lendio, who spend every day helping small business owners 
find the financing they need to fuel their American Dream. It’s a great 
pleasure to be engaged in such a worthy endeavor.
