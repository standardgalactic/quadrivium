Dedication
This book is dedicated to my most steadfast supporters — my family. You have
always been there for me when I needed you and have always supported
me in every endeavor I decide to undertake. I would not have been able to
accomplish half the things I’ve done without your tremendous support, and
for that I am deeply grateful. 
Author’s Acknowledgments
I was completely thrilled when Wiley approached me about working on a
second book for the For Dummies series. I knew right off the bat that this
was going to be a very ambitious project that would require a lot of focus.
The challenges in writing a book of this scope were numerous and enormous.
First, both Wiley and I sought to create the most comprehensive guide on the
subject available to investors. I believe we succeeded because Commodities
For Dummies covers over 30 commodities; besides the Commodity Research
Bureau Yearbook, no other introductory book includes coverage of so many
commodities. Second, Wiley and I also wanted to bring this book to market
sooner rather than later. Working pretty much around the clock, seven days a
week, I was able to hand in the manuscript in four months (five months total
when editing and reviewing are factored in). 
Every author who takes on a project of this size realizes very quickly that the
undertaking cannot possibly be done alone. Despite romantic clichés about
writers locked up in attics writing feverishly and not communicating with the
outside world for months on end, one quickly realizes that writing a book of
this kind is really a team sport. Fortunately, I had the pleasure of working with
a wonderful team of dedicated professionals, both in publishing and in finance. 
First, I’d like to acknowledge the first-rate editorial team at Wiley for their
input and assistance through every stage of this process. Every writer hopes
for nothing more than to have a team of editors who will support their gen-
eral creative vision, and I was extremely fortunate to have been able to follow
through on my vision for the book — from the drafting of the Table of Contents
down to the inclusion of technical charts and figures — with the guidance of
a knowledgeable group of editors. Specifically, I’d like to thank Laura Peterson
Nussbaum, my project editor, for providing valuable insight through every step
of the way. I’d also like to express thanks to Stacy Kennedy for helping launch
the project early on and for her continuous input throughout the writing period.
And I would also like to show my gratitude to the graphics department for
helping me express my ideas and illustrate my points with the help of charts,
graphs, and other helpful visuals. Finally, I would like to thank Noel Jameson
who served as technical editor. 

Because the financial markets in general, and the commodities markets in
particular, are so broad and deep, getting insight on all the different aspects
of the markets is absolutely critical. I was very fortunate that I could turn to
some of the sharpest minds in finance for their insight on the markets. I’d like
to thank Dr. Scott Pardee at Middlebury College for providing me with cutting-
edge analysis on the cyclicality of the markets. I’d also like to acknowledge
the contributions of Ray Strong at Goldman Sachs regarding all aspects of the
energy markets. Thanks to Karen Treanton at the International Energy Agency
in Paris for providing me with all the vital statistical information on the energy
industry. I would like to express my appreciation to John D. Phillips and Neil
McMahon at Alliance Bernstein for their world-class research. Kevin Rich at
Deutsche Bank shared with me his knowledge of managed funds, and thanks
to everyone at the NYMEX for their support — Jim Newsome, Madeline Boyd,
Sam Glasser, Linda Rapacki, and Jenifer Semenza. Additional thanks goes to
Frank Ahmed at Bear Stearns and Richard Adler for their general guidance.
I also need to acknowledge the contributions of Elisa Castro, Heather Balke,
and, of course, my agent Mark Sullivan. 
Finally, I’d like to express  my gratitude to my family, whose support was
instrumental throughout this process.

Introduction
C
ommodities, as an asset class, are going through a transformational
period. What was long regarded as an inferior asset class is quickly
moving to the investing mainstream. The reason? Good performance. Investors
like to reward good performance, and commodities have performed very well
lately. For instance, while I was writing this book, gold prices reached an all-
time high; copper prices hit a 25-year high; oil companies, led by Exxon
Mobil, posted some of the best quarterly and yearly performances in the 
history of corporate America; and a plethora of new investment vehicles,
from Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) to Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs),
have been introduced to satisfy investor demand to invest in this asset class.
I expect commodities to maintain this solid performance in the medium to
long term, for reasons I outline throughout the book. 
As commodities have been generating more interest, there’s a large demand
for a product to help average investors get a grip on the market fundamentals.
Commodities as an asset class have been plagued by a lot of misinformation,
and it’s sometimes difficult to separate fact from fiction from outright fantasy.
The aim of Commodities For Dummies is to help you figure out what commodi-
ties are all about and, more importantly, to help you develop an intelligent
investment strategy to profit in this market. 
About This Book
My aim in writing Commodities For Dummies is to offer you a comprehensive
guide to the commodities markets and show you a number of investment
strategies to help you profit in this market. You don’t have to invest in just
crude oil or gold futures contracts to benefit. You can trade ETFs, invest in
companies that process commodities such as uranium, buy precious metals
ownership certificates, or invest in Master Limited Partnerships. The com-
modities markets are global in nature and so are the investment opportuni-
ties. My aim in this book is to help you uncover these global opportunities
and to provide you with the investment ideas and tools to help you unlock
and unleash the power of the commodities markets. And, best of all, I do all
this in plain English!

Commodities For Dummies 
Anyone who’s been around commodities, even for a short period of time,
realizes that folks in the business are prone to engage in linguistic acrobatics.
Words like molybdenum, backwardation, and contango are thrown around like
“hello” and “thank you”. Sometimes, these words seem intimidating and con-
fusing. Don’t be intimidated. Language is a powerful thing, after all, and get-
ting a grip on the concepts behind the words is critical, especially if you want
to come out ahead in the markets. That’s why I use everyday language to
explain even the most abstract and arcane concepts. 
Here are some of the trading and investing ideas you will discover in the
book:
 Get more bang for your buck by investing through Master Limited
Partnerships, investment vehicles used by only the most sophisticated
investors. Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), which invest in energy
infrastructure such as pipelines and storage facilities, are a unique
investment because they trade publicly, like a corporation, but they
offer the tax benefits of a partnership. Unlike corporations, which are
subject to double taxation (on the corporate and shareholder level),
MLPs are able to pass through their income to shareholders tax free,
who are then responsible for taxes only on the individual level. Because
MLPs’ primary mandate is to distribute practically all their cash flow
directly to shareholders, you can’t afford not to invest in these hybrid
vehicles. Find out how in Chapter 6. 
 Capitalize on the increasing popularity of nuclear power by investing
in uranium, an investment grade material. The use of nuclear power to
generate electricity is on the rise. As a result, the price of uranium, the
primary fuel used in nuclear power plants, has been in an extended —
albeit quiet — bull market for over a decade, quadrupling from $10 in
1994 to $40 in 2006. Find out which companies mine this unique com-
modity and how to profit from this trend in Chapter 13. 
 Benefit from the commodity trading craze without trading a single
futures contract. As more investors flock towards the commodities mar-
kets, the exchanges that provide futures contracts, options, and other
derivatives to commodity traders have seen their business expand expo-
nentially. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (NYSE: CME), one of the
largest commodity exchanges, has seen its stock price rise from $40
since its 2003 IPO to almost $500 in 2006 — performing even better than
Google! (See Chapter 8 for more on how to capitalize on the success of
exchanges.)
 Capitalize on the relationship between digital cameras and the silver
markets. You may be surprised to find out that the photographic indus-
try is a major consumer of silver, accounting for almost 20 percent of
total silver consumption. That is because traditional cameras use silver
halide, a silver and halogen compound, to create photographic film.

However, the introduction of digital cameras, which don’t require silver
halide, has meant that demand for silver in photography has decreased.
Find out how to profit from this by betting against the price of silver,
using a trading technique known as going short, which I cover in Chapter
9. (Turn to Chapter 15 for more on the silver markets.) 
 Generate a gushing stream of dividend income by investing in oil
tanker stocks. It’s one of the best kept secrets on Wall Street, but oil
tanker stocks provide some of the highest dividend yields in the market.
Average dividend yields for some of the industry’s top performers are
well over 12 percent, higher than even diversified and electric utilities
(which I cover in Chapter 13). Frontline (NYSE: FRO), a seaborne trans-
porter of crude oil that operates routes between the Persian Gulf and
Asia, offers a $6.00 dividend per share. For a stock that trades within a
narrow $40 range, that’s a dividend yield of 15 percent. (Check out
Chapter 14 for more on Frontline and other companies.)
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you make the best use of this book, I use the following conventions:
 Italics are used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms.
 Boldfaced text is used to indicate key words in bulleted lists or the
action parts of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used to make Web addresses stand out for your ease.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing Commodities For Dummies, I have made the following assumptions
about you:
 You have some previous investing experience but are looking to diver-
sify your holdings.
 You’re familiar with commodities trading but want to brush up on your
knowledge.
 Your traditional investments (stocks/bonds/mutual funds) have not per-
formed according to your expectations, and you’re looking for alterna-
tives to maximize your returns.
 You’re a new investor or someone with minimal trading experience, and
you’re interested in a broad-based investment approach that includes
commodities and other assets.

Introduction

 You understand the attractiveness of commodities and want a compre-
hensive and easy-to-use guide to help you get started.
 You’re skeptical about the benefits of commodities but want to read
about them anyway. Please do, I’m confident this book will change your
mind!
 You have little or no investment experience but are eager to find out
more about investing. This book not only explores investing in com-
modities but also includes explanations of general investing guidelines
that can be applied to any market.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve organized the book in a way that helps you look up essential information
and analysis on the world’s most important commodities and trading tech-
niques. The first two parts of the book cover general portfolio construction
methodologies and investment strategies to help you incorporate commodi-
ties in your financial life. Parts III, IV, and V then cover each specific commod-
ity sub-asset class: energy, metals, and agricultural products. Finally, the last
two parts of the book include the legendary For Dummies Part of Tens chap-
ters along with a useful appendix to help you look up the technical terms dis-
cussed throughout the book. 
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts
The first part of Commodities For Dummies gives you good, old general invest-
ing principles. Whether you’re an experienced trader or a new investor, having
a good grasp on basic portfolio allocation methods is crucial for your success.
Find out how to create and design an investing road map that’s specifically tai-
lored to your financial needs and goals. You also discover how commodities
stack up against other investment vehicles, such as stocks and bonds. 
In addition, I explain and dispel some of the common misconceptions regard-
ing the commodities markets, particularly relating to risk and volatility
issues. I also include a whole chapter on identifying, managing, and overcom-
ing risk, which may be the single most important issue you face as an
investor. The fact of the matter is that any investment entails a certain degree
of risk — overcoming that risk is what separates successful investors from
the rest. Find out how you too can successfully minimize risk and maximize
your returns with the help of commodities.

Commodities For Dummies 

Part II: Getting Started
Get the lowdown on the best investment methods you have at your disposal
to invest in commodities. I analyze the pros and cons of investing through the
futures markets, the equity markets, ETFs, and mutual funds. In addition, I
examine the role of the market regulators so you can know your rights as an
investor as well as specific trading techniques and analyses, such as techni-
cal and fundamental analysis. Read this part to find out how to start trading
commodities. 
Part III: The Power House: How to 
Make Money in Energy
Energy is the largest sub-asset class in the commodities universe. Crude oil,
for example, is the most widely traded commodity in the world today. Natural
gas, coal, and nuclear power are also major commodities. In addition, I
uncover investment opportunities in the alternative energy space (wind and
solar power) and examine the companies responsible for providing energy to
the world. 
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: 
Investing in Metals
Metals are grouped using two criteria: whether they contain iron and, more
importantly, their ability to resist corrosion. Metals that contain iron are
called ferrous metals and these include metals such as zinc. Non-ferrous
metals, such as gold, silver, and platinum, do not contain iron. On the corro-
sion side, the metals that don’t corrode easily are usually the precious
metals: gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. Base metals, like copper, nickel,
and zinc are major industrial metals. As you can tell, you’ll find out every-
thing you ever wanted to know about metals in this part. 
Part V: Going Down to the Farm: 
Trading Agricultural Products
There is nothing more fundamental to human life than food. In this part, find
out how you can nourish and grow your portfolio by investing in this most
basic commodity. Some of the most commonly traded agricultural products
5
Introduction

include coffee, sugar, and orange juice. I help you decipher the seasonal
nature of the business, analyze import/export activities, and consider poten-
tial obstacles so that you can design and execute a rock-solid investment
approach. Some of the commodities I discuss in this part include orange
juice, cocoa, feeder cattle, soybeans, and wheat. 
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The legendary For Dummies Part of Tens chapters provide you with tips on
how to become a better investor and trader. Follow the ten time-tested rules
that successful commodities investors have used to make substantial profits
in this area. You also get acquainted with ten of the best resources to help
you become a successful commodities investor. 
Part VII: The Appendix
The appendix includes a detailed glossary covering all the major technical
terminology covered in these pages. Investing in commodities can get fairly
technical, so understanding the concepts behind the words is critical for
your success as an investor. 
Icons Used in This Book
One of the pleasures of writing a For Dummies book is that you get to use all
sorts of fun, interactive tools to highlight or illustrate a point. Here are some
icons that I use throughout the book:
I use this icon to highlight information that you want to keep in mind or that
is referenced in other parts of the book.
When you see this icon, make sure you read the accompanying text carefully
because it includes information, analysis, or insight that will help you suc-
cessfully implement an investment strategy.
I explain information that is of a technical nature with this icon. The com-
modities markets are complex, and the vocabulary and concepts are quite
tricky. You can skip these paragraphs if you’re just wanting a quick overview
of the commodities world, but make sure to read them before seriously
investing. They allow you to get a better grasp of the concepts discussed.

Commodities For Dummies 

Investing can be an extremely rewarding enterprise, but it can also be a haz-
ardous endeavor if you’re not careful. I use this icon to warn you of potential
pitfalls. Make sure you remain alert for these icons because they contain
information that will help you avoid losing money. 
Sometimes, a potential investment requires a little extra research. Make sure
that when you see this icon, you get ready to analyze the investment with a
fine-toothed comb. This icon lets you know that extensive due diligence is in
order. 
Where to Go from Here
I’ve organized this book in a way that provides you with the most accurate
and relevant information related to investing in general and commodity
investing in particular. The book is modular in nature, meaning that while it
reads like a book from start to finish, you can read one chapter or even a sec-
tion at a time without needing to read the whole book to understand the
topic that’s discussed. 
If you’re a true beginner, however, I recommend that you read Parts I and II
carefully before you start skipping around in the chapters on particular com-
modities.

Part I
Commodities: Just
the Facts

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in this part give you everything you
wanted to know about commodities. I introduce the
commodities markets and go through some of the individ-
ual commodities and how they interact with each other. I
also look at how commodities as an asset class compares
to other assets such as stocks and bonds. 

Chapter 1
Investors, Start Your Engines! An
Overview of Commodities
In This Chapter
 Figuring out why you should invest in commodities
 Defining the commodities markets 
 Determining the best ways to trade commodities
 Identifying the major commodities 
T
he commodities markets are broad and deep, presenting both challenges
and opportunities. Investors are often overwhelmed simply by the
number of commodities that are out there: You have over 30 tradable com-
modities to choose from. (I cover almost all of them — 32 to be exact — more
than any other introductory book on the topic.) How do you decide whether
to trade crude oil or gold, sugar or palladium, natural gas or frozen concen-
trated orange juice, soybeans or aluminum? What about corn, feeder cattle,
and silver — should you trade these commodities as well? And if you do,
what is the best way to invest in them? Should you go through the futures
markets, through the equity markets, or by buying the physical stuff (such as
silver coins or gold bullion)? And do all commodities move in tandem or do
they perform independently of each other?
With so many variables to keep track of and options to choose from, just get-
ting started in commodities can be daunting. Have no fear — this book pro-
vides you with the actionable information, knowledge, insight, and analysis to
help you grab the commodities market by the horns. A lot of myths and fan-
tasies about commodities are out there, and I set out to shatter some of these
myths and, in the process, clear the way to help you identify the real money-
making opportunities. 
For example, a lot of folks equate (incorrectly) commodities exclusively with
the futures markets. There is absolutely no doubt that the two are inextrica-
bly linked — the futures markets offer a way for commercial users to hedge

against commodity price risks and a means for investors and traders to profit
from this price risk. However, the futures market is only one planet in the
commodities universe. 
The equity markets are also deeply involved in commodities. Companies
such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) focus exclusively on the production of
crude oil, natural gas, and other energy products; Anglo-American PLC
(NASDAQ: AAUK) focuses on mining precious metals and minerals across the
globe; and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) offers investors the opportunity to get
access to the coffee markets. Ignoring these companies that process com-
modities is not only narrow-minded, it’s also a bit foolish because they pro-
vide exposure to the very same commodities traded on the futures market. 
In addition to the futures and equity markets, a number of investment vehi-
cles exist that allow you to access the commodities markets, such as Master
Limited Partnerships (MLPs), Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and commod-
ity mutual funds (all covered in Chapter 6). So while I do focus on the futures
markets, I also examine investment opportunities in the equity markets and
beyond. 
The commodities universe is large, and investment opportunities abound. In
this book, I help you explore this universe inside and out, from the open
outcry trading pits on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange to the
labor-intensive cocoa fields of the Ivory Coast; from the vast palladium
mining operations in northeastern Russia to the corn-growing farms of Iowa;
from the Ultra Large Crude Carriers that transport crude oil across vast
oceans to the nickel mines of Papua New Guinea; from the sugar plantations
of Brazil to the steel mills of China. 
By exploring this fascinating universe, not only do you get insight into the
world’s most crucial commodities — and get a glimpse of how the global cap-
ital markets operate — but you find out how to capitalize on this information
to generate profits. 
First Things First
Just what, exactly, are commodities? Put simply, commodities are the raw
materials humans use to create a livable world. Humans have been exploiting
the Earth’s natural resources since the beginning of time. They use agricul-
tural products to feed themselves, metals to build weapons and tools, and
energy to sustain themselves. These — energy, metals, and agricultural prod-
ucts — are the three classes of commodities, and they are the essential build-
ing blocks of the global economy. 
12
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

For the purposes of this book, I present 32 commodities that fit a very spe-
cific definition, which I define in the following bulleted list. For example, the
commodities I present must be raw materials. I don’t discuss currencies —
even though they trade in the futures markets — because they’re not a raw
material; they can’t be physically used to build anything. In addition, the
commodities must present real money-making opportunities to investors.
13
Chapter 1: Investors, Start Your Engines! An Overview of Commodities
Commodities throughout history
The history of commodities tells the story of civ-
ilization itself. Ever since man first appeared on
Earth, his existence has been defined by a per-
petual and brutal quest for the control over the
world’s natural resources. Civilizations rise and
fall, nations prosper and perish, and societies
survive and subside based on their ability to
harness energy, develop metals, and cultivate
agricultural products — in short, on their
capacity to control commodities. It’s interesting
to note that prehistoric times are still defined
today by the subsequent stages of man’s mas-
tery of the metals production process: the stone
age, the bronze age, and the iron age. Nations
that have been able to achieve mastery over
natural resources have survived, while those
that failed have faced extinction. This sobering
reality has led to some of the most epic clashes
among civilizations.
History reveals that the most devastating bat-
tles have been fought over crude oil, gold, ura-
nium, and other precious natural resources (all
covered in this book). When Francisco Pizarro’s
first expedition to South America in 1524 led him
to the discovery of vast amounts of gold
deposits, his conquistadors proceeded to wipe
out the whole Inca civilization that stood
between them and the gold. As a matter of fact,
it is probably unlikely that Christopher Columbus
would have come across to the North American
continent in the first place were it not for an
unquenchable desire to find the shortest and
most secure route to transport spices and other
commodities from India to Europe. 
A few centuries later, this continuous quest for
commodities also resulted in the deadly South
African Boer Wars at the end of the 19th cen-
tury, which pitted the British Empire’s armed
forces against local fighters in a bloody battle
over South Africa’s precious metals and miner-
als. The 20th century, which heralded a new his-
torical phase — the hydrocarbon age, shortly
followed by the nuclear age — marks a turning
point in humans’ ability to utilize and exploit the
Earth’s raw materials and the extent to which
they would go to preserve this control. The
Persian Gulf War of 1991, which at its essence
was an effort to stabilize global oil markets after
the Iraqi invasion of oil-rich Kuwait in the oil-
rich Middle East, is another manifestation of this
historical reality. To this day, access to the
world’s vast deposits of oil, gold, copper, and
other resources is taken into account by the
various international players in the geopolitical
world. Commodities have thus determined the
fate and wealth of nations throughout history
and will continue to do so in the future.

All the commodities I cover in the book have to meet the following criteria: 
 Tradability: The commodity has to be tradable, meaning there needs to
be a viable investment vehicle to help you trade it. For example, I
include a commodity if it has a futures contract assigned to it on one of
the major exchanges, or if a company processes it, or if there’s an ETF
that tracks it. 
Uranium, which is an important energy commodity, isn’t tracked by a
futures contract, but several companies specialize in mining and pro-
cessing this mineral. By investing in these companies, you get exposure
to uranium. 
 Deliverability: All the commodities have to be physically deliverable. I
include crude oil because it can be delivered in barrels, and I include
wheat because it can be delivered by the bushel. However, I don’t
include currencies, interest rates, and other financial futures contracts
because they’re not physical commodities. 
 Liquidity: I don’t include any commodities that trade in illiquid markets.
Every commodity in the book has an active market with buyers and sell-
ers constantly transacting with each other. Liquidity is critical because it
gives you the option of getting in and out of an investment without
having to face the difficulty of trying to find a buyer or seller for your
securities. 
Going for a Spin: Choosing the 
Right Investment Vehicle
The two most critical questions you should ask yourself before getting
started in commodities are the following: What commodity should I invest in?
How do I invest in it? I will answer the second question first and then exam-
ine which commodities to choose. 
The futures markets
In the futures markets, individuals, institutions, and sometimes governments
transact with each other for price hedging and speculating purposes. An air-
line company, for instance, may want to use futures to enter into an agree-
ment with a fuel company to buy a fixed amount of jet fuel for a fixed price
for a fixed period of time. This transaction in the futures markets allows the
airline to hedge against the volatility associated with the price of jet fuel.
Although commercial users are the main players in the futures arena, the
futures markets are also used by traders and investors who profit from price
volatility through various trading techniques.
14
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

One such trading technique is arbitrage, which takes advantage of price dis-
crepancies between different futures markets. For example, you purchase and
sell the crude oil futures contract simultaneously in different trading venues for
the purpose of capturing price discrepancies between these venues. This is an
arbitrage trade. I take a look at some arbitrage opportunities in Chapter 9. 
The futures markets are administered by the various commodity exchanges,
such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX). I discuss the major exchanges, the role they play in the
markets, and the products they offer in Chapter 8. 
Investing through the futures markets requires a good understanding of
futures contracts, options on futures, forwards, spreads, and other derivative
products. I examine these products in depth in Chapter 9. 
The most direct way of investing in the futures markets is by opening an
account with a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). The FCM is very much
like your traditional stock brokerage house (such as Schwab, Fidelity, or
Merrill Lynch), except that it’s allowed to offer products that trade on the
futures markets. Here are some other ways to get involved in futures:
15
Chapter 1: Investors, Start Your Engines! An Overview of Commodities
Follow the money
While commodities have allowed nations to sur-
vive and thrive, they have also provided individ-
uals with tremendous wealth accumulation
possibilities. Some of the world’s most enduring
fortunes have been built around commodities.
Mayer Rothschild, patriarch of the European
Rothschild banking family, made a fortune
during the Napoleonic Wars by storing and dis-
tributing gold bullion to fund the British side of
the war effort. 
Andrew Carnegie, the self-made industrialist
and founder of the eponymous steel company
that eventually became U.S. Steel, consolidated
the American steel industry and, in the process,
became the second-richest man of his time,
behind only John D. Rockefeller, Sr. And what
better illustration of the power of commodities
as wealth-building vehicles than John Rockefeller
himself, whose impact on the global oil industry
through the creation of the Standard Oil
Company is still felt today. (See Daniel Yergin’s
The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and
Power.) Abdel-Aziz Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia’s first
monarch, consolidated and created an entire
nation through the control of crude oil and natural
gas riches. 
To this day, individuals involved in commodities
have been able to generate tremendous wealth.
Legendary oil man T. Boone Pickens, for
instance, made $1.4 Billion in 2005 betting on the
price of oil and natural gas; and Lakshmi Mittal,
the Indian-born steel magnate, became the
world’s fourth-richest person in 2004 as a result
of his business activities in the steel industry. It
is clear that those individuals who have the
foresight of investing in commodities have prof-
ited very handsomely from this enterprise.
While you may not be able to build as much
wealth as Rockefeller or Al-Saud, I’m confident
that you can benefit by opening up to investing
in commodities. 

 Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA): The CTA is an individual or com-
pany licensed to trade futures contracts on your behalf. 
 Commodity Pool Operator (CPO): The CPO is similar to a CTA except
that the CPO can manage the funds of multiple clients under one
account. This provides additional leverage when trading futures. 
 Commodity Indexes: A commodity index is a benchmark, similar to the
Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500, which tracks a basket of
the most liquid commodities. You can track the performance of a com-
modity index, which allows you in effect to “buy the market”. A number
of commodity indexes are available, such as the Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index or the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index, which I cover in
Chapter 7. 
These are only a few ways to access the futures markets. Make sure to read
Chapters 5 and 6 for additional methods. 
The futures markets are regulated by a number of organizations, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC). These organizations monitor the markets to
prevent market fraud and manipulation and to protect investors from such
activity. Check out Chapter 8 for an in-depth analysis of the role these regula-
tors play and how to use them to protect yourself from market fraud. 
Trading futures is not for everyone. By their very nature, futures markets,
contracts, and products are extremely complex and require a great deal of
mastery even by the most seasoned investors. If you don’t feel you have a
good handle on all the concepts involved in trading futures, then don’t
simply jump into futures or you could lose a lot more than your principal
(because of the use of leverage and other characteristics unique to the
futures markets). If you’re not comfortable trading futures, don’t sweat it. You
can invest in commodities in multiple other ways. 
If you are ready to start investing in the futures markets, you need to have a
solid grasp of technical analysis, which I discuss in depth in Chapter 10. 
The equity markets
Although the futures markets offer the most direct investment gateway to 
the commodities markets, the equity markets also offer access to these raw
materials. You can invest in companies that specialize in the production,
transformation, and distribution of these natural resources. If you’re a stock
investor familiar with the equity markets, then this may be a good route for
you to access the commodities markets. The only drawback of the equity
markets is that you have to take into account external factors, such as 
16
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

management competence, tax situation, debt levels, and profit margins,
which have nothing to do with the underlying commodity. That said, invest-
ing in companies that process commodities still allows you to profit from the
commodities boom. 
Publicly traded companies
The size, structure, and scope of the companies involved in the business are
varied, and I cover most of these companies throughout the book. I offer a
description of the company, including a snapshot of its financial situation,
future growth prospects, and areas of operation. I then make a recommenda-
tion based on the market fundamentals of the company. 
Here are the types of companies you’ll encounter in the book: 
 Integrated Energy Companies: These companies, such as Exxon Mobil
(NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), are involved in all aspects of the
energy industry, from the extraction of crude oil to the distribution of
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). They give you broad exposure to the
energy complex (see Chapter 11). 
 Diversified Mining Companies: A number of companies focus exclusively
on mining metals and minerals. Some of these companies, such as Anglo-
American PLC (NASDAQ: AAUK) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), have oper-
ations across the spectrum of the metals complex, mining metals that
range from gold to zinc. I look at these companies in Chapter 18. 
 Electric Utilities: Utilities are an integral part of modern life because
they provide one of life’s most essential necessities: electricity. They’re
also a good investment because they have historically offered large divi-
dends to shareholders. Read Chapter 13 to figure out whether these
companies are right for you. 
This list is only a small sampling of the commodity companies I cover in
these pages. I also analyze highly specialized companies, such as coal mining
companies (Chapter 13), oil refiners (Chapter 14), platinum mining compa-
nies (Chapter 15), and purveyors of gourmet coffee products (Chapter 19). 
Master Limited Partnerships
Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) invest in energy infrastructure such as oil
pipelines and natural gas storage facilities. I’m a big fan of MLPs because
they’re a publicly traded partnership. This means they offer the benefit of trad-
ing like a corporation on a public exchange, while offering the tax advantages
of a private partnership. MLPs are required to transfer all cash flow back to
shareholders, which makes them an attractive investment. I dissect the struc-
ture of MLPs in Chapter 6 and introduce you to some of the biggest names in
the business so you can take advantage of this unique investment. 
17
Chapter 1: Investors, Start Your Engines! An Overview of Commodities

Managed funds
Sometimes it’s just easier to have someone else manage your investments for
you. Luckily, you can count on professional money managers that specialize
in commodity trading to handle your investments. 
Here are a few options: 
 Mutual funds: If you’ve previously invested in mutual funds and are
comfortable with them, look into adding a mutual fund that gives you
exposure to the commodities markets. A number of funds are available
that invest solely in commodities. I examine these commodity mutual
funds in Chapter 6. 
 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are an increasingly popular invest-
ment because they are managed funds that offer the convenience of
trading like stocks. A plethora of ETFs that track everything from crude
oil and gold to diversified commodity indexes, have appeared in recent
years. Find out how to benefit from these vehicles in Chapter 6. 
If you have a pet or a child, sometimes you hire a pet sitter or baby sitter to
look out after your loved ones. Before you hire this individual, you interview
them, check their references, and examine their previous experience. Once
you’re satisfied with their competency, you entrust them with the responsi-
bility of looking out after your cat, daughter, or both. Same thing applies
when you’re shopping for a money manager, or money sitter. If you already
have a money manager you trust and are happy with, then stick with him. If
you’re looking for a new investment professional to look out after your invest-
ments, you need to investigate her as thoroughly as possible. In Chapter 6, I
examine the selection criteria you should use when shopping for a money
manager. 
Physical attractiveness
The most direct way of investing in certain commodities is by actually buying
them outright. Precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum are a great
example of this. As the price of gold and silver has skyrocketed recently, you
may have seen ads on TV or in newspapers from companies offering to buy
your gold or silver jewelry. As gold and silver prices increase in the futures
markets, they also cause prices in the spot markets to rise (and vice versa).
You can cash in on this trend by buying coins, bullion, or even jewelry. I pre-
sent this unique investment strategy in Chapter 15.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

This investment strategy is only suitable for a limited number of commodi-
ties, mostly precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum. Unless you own a
farm, keeping live cattle or feeder cattle to profit from price increases doesn’t
make much sense. And I won’t even mention commodities like crude oil or
uranium!
Checking Out What’s on the Menu
I cover 32 commodities in the book. Here is a listing of all the commodities
you can expect to encounter while going through these pages.
While the book is modular in nature, I list the commodities in this list in order
of their appearance in the text. 
Energy
Energy has always been indispensable for human survival and also makes for
a great investment. Energy, whether fossil fuels or renewable energy sources,
has attracted a lot of attention from investors as they seek to profit from the
world’s seemingly unquenchable thirst for energy. I present in this book all
the major forms of energy, from crude oil and coal to electricity and solar
power, and show you how to profit in this arena. 
 Crude oil: Crude oil is the undisputed heavyweight champion in the
commodities world. There are more barrels of crude oil traded every
single day (85 million and growing) than any other commodity.
Accounting for 40 percent of total global energy consumption, it pro-
vides some terrific investment opportunities. 
 Natural gas: Natural gas, the gaseous fossil fuel, is often overshadowed
by crude oil. It is nevertheless a major commodity in its own right,
which is used for everything from cooking food to heating houses during
the winter. I also take a look at the prospects of Liquefied Natural Gas
(LNG). 
 Coal: Coal accounts for over 20 percent of total world energy consump-
tion. In the United States, the largest energy market, 50 percent of elec-
tricity is generated through coal. Because of abundant supply, coal is
making a resurgence. 
 Uranium/Nuclear power: Because of improved environmental standards
within the industry, nuclear power use is on the rise. I show you how to
develop an investment strategy to capitalize on this trend.
19
Chapter 1: Investors, Start Your Engines! An Overview of Commodities

 Electricity: Electricity is a necessity of modern life, and the companies
responsible for generating this special commodity have some unique char-
acteristics. I examine how to start trading this electrifying commodity. 
 Solar power: Due to a number of reasons that range from environmental
to geopolitical, demand for renewable energy sources such as solar
power is increasing. 
 Wind power: Wind power is getting a lot of attention from investors as a
viable alternative source of energy. 
 Ethanol: Ethanol, which is produced primarily from corn or sugar, is an
increasingly popular fuel additive that offers investment potential. 
There are other commodities in the energy complex, such as heating oil,
propane and gasoline. Although I do provide insight into some of these other
members of the energy family, I focus a lot more on the resources I men-
tioned in the previous list.
Metals
Metallurgy has been essential to human development since the beginning of
time. Societies that have mastered the production of metals have been able
to thrive and survive. Similarly, investors that have incorporated metals into
their portfolios have been able to generate significant returns. I cover all the
major metals, from gold and platinum to nickel and zinc. 
 Gold: Gold is perhaps the most coveted resource on the planet. For cen-
turies, people have been attracted to its quasi-indestructibility and have
used it as a store of value. Gold is a good asset for hedging against infla-
tion and also for asset preservation during times of global turmoil. 
 Silver: Silver, like gold, is another precious metal that has monetary
applications. The British currency, the pound sterling, is still named
after this metal. Silver also has applications in industry (such as electri-
cal wiring) that places it in a unique position of being coveted for both
its precious metal status and its industrial uses. 
 Platinum: Platinum, the rich man’s gold, is one of the most valuable
metals in the world, used for everything from jewelry to the manufactur-
ing of catalytic converters. 
 Steel: Steel, which is created by alloying iron and other materials, is the
most widely used metal in the world. Used to build everything from cars
to buildings, it’s a metal endowed with unique characteristics and offers
good investment potential. 
20
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

 Aluminum: Perhaps no other metal has the versatility of aluminum; it’s
lightweight, yet surprisingly robust. These unique characteristics mean
that it’s a metal worth adding to you portfolio, especially since it’s the
second most used metal (right behind steel). 
 Copper: Copper, the third most widely used metal, is the metal of choice
for industrial uses. Because it’s a great conductor of heat and electricity,
its applications in industry are wide and deep, which makes this base
metal a very attractive investment. 
 Palladium: Palladium is part of the platinum group of metals and almost
half of the palladium that’s mined goes towards building automobile cat-
alytic converters. As the number of cars with these emission-reducing
devices increases, the demand for palladium will increase as well, which
makes this an attractive investment. 
 Nickel: Nickel is a ferrous metal that is in high demand because of its
resistance to corrosion and oxidation. Steel is usually alloyed with nickel
to create stainless steel, which assures that nickel will have an impor-
tant role to play for years to come. 
 Zinc: The fourth most widely used metal in the world, zinc is sought
after for its resistance to corrosion. It is used in the process of galvaniza-
tion, where zinc coating is applied to other metals, such as steel, to 
prevent rust. 
Agricultural products
Food is the most essential element of human life, and the production of food
presents solid money-making opportunities. In Commodities For Dummies,
you find out how to invest in the agricultural sector in everything from coffee
and orange juice to cattle and soybeans. 
 Coffee: Coffee is the second most widely produced commodity in the
world, in terms of physical volume, behind only crude oil. Folks just
seem to love a good cup of coffee, and this provides good investment
opportunities. 
 Cocoa: Cocoa production, which is dominated by a handful of countries,
is a major agricultural commodity, primarily because it is used to create
chocolate. 
 Sugar #11: Sugar is a popular food sweetener and it can be a sweet
investment as well. Sugar #11 represents a futures contract for global
sugar. 
21
Chapter 1: Investors, Start Your Engines! An Overview of Commodities

 Sugar #14: Sugar #14 is specific to the United States and it is a widely
traded commodity.
 Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice — Type A: FCOJ-A, for short, is the
benchmark for North American orange juice prices, as it’s grown in the
hemisphere’s two largest regions: Florida and Brazil. 
 Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice — Type B: FCOJ-B, like FCOJ-A, is a
widely traded contract that represents global orange juice prices. This
contract gives you exposure to orange juice activity on a world scale. 
 Corn: Corn’s use for culinary purposes is perhaps unrivaled by any
other grain, which makes this a potentially lucrative investment. Check
out how to trade it in Chapter 20.
 Wheat: According to archaeological evidence, wheat is one of the first
agricultural products grown by man. It is an essential staple of human
life and makes for a great investment. 
 Soybeans: Soybeans have many applications, including as feedstock and
for cooking purposes. The soybean market is a large market and pre-
sents some good investment opportunities. 
 Soybean oil: Soybean oil, also known as vegetable oil, is derived from
the actual soybeans. It’s used for cooking purposes and has become
popular in recent years due to the health-conscious dietary movement. 
 Soybean meal: Soybean meal is another derivative of soybeans that’s
used as feedstock for poultry and cattle. It may not sound sexy, but it
can be a good investment. 
 Live cattle: For those involved in agriculture, using the live cattle futures
contract to hedge against price volatility is a good idea. 
 Feeder cattle: While the live cattle contract tracks adult cows, the
feeder cattle contract is used to hedge against the risk associated with
growing calves. This area is not widely followed in the markets, but it’s
important to figure out how this market works. 
 Lean hogs: They may not be the sexiest commodity out there, but lean
hogs are an essential commodity, which makes them a good trading
target. 
 Frozen pork bellies: Frozen pork bellies are essentially nothing more
than good old bacon. This is a cyclical industry subject to wild price
swings, which provides unique arbitrage trading opportunities.

Benefiting from Commodities Creatively
While I was researching this book, I came across a number of colorful charac-
ters, both in-person and in historical accounts. One such character was
Samuel Brannan, who lived during the 1848 California Gold Rush. The story of
Sam Brannan is not well known but it is astonishing nevertheless and pro-
vides insight into how to approach the markets.
Sam was the third person to find out that gold had been discovered in California.
The first two people with this knowledge — John Sutter and James Marshall —
wanted, for obvious reasons, to keep this discovery secret. Sam Brannan, who
eventually profited so much from the gold rush that he became California’s first
millionaire, got rich without digging a single hole or prospecting for a single
nugget of gold. How did he do this? By selling shovels! 
When Sam, who owned a convenience store in Sutter’s Fort near the gold
deposits, heard that gold had been discovered, he quietly went around north-
ern California and bought all the shovels, picks, and pans he could get his
hands on. After he cornered this market, he literally went around town
screaming at the top of his lungs, “We found gold! We found gold!” Once word
spread that gold had been discovered, a swarm of people came to northern
California, all wanting to dig for gold, and Sam was the only man in town to
sell them the shovels. 
Sam Brannan’s story shows that you can profit from the current commodities
boom — which is similar to the California Gold Rush in more ways than one —
by being creative. You don’t have to invest in just crude oil or gold futures
contracts to benefit. You can trade ETFs, invest in companies that process
commodities such as uranium, buy precious metals ownership certificates,
or invest in Master Limited Partnerships. The commodities markets are global
in nature, and so are the investment opportunities. My aim in this book is to
help you uncover these global opportunities and to provide you with the
investment ideas and tools to help you unlock and unleash the power of the
commodities markets.

ommodities have traditionally been considered the black sheep in the
family of asset classes — no one wanted anything to do with them. This
traditional lack of interest (which no longer applies, by the way) has gener-
ated a lot of misinformation about commodities. As a matter of fact, probably
no other asset class has suffered through so much misunderstanding and
misconception. 
A lot of investors are, quite frankly, scared of venturing into the world of com-
modities. For one thing, it seems that every time the word “commodities” is
uttered, someone pops up with a horrible story about losing their entire life
savings trading soybeans, cocoa, or some other exotic commodity. 
Even though this negative perception is rapidly changing, commodities are
still often misunderstood as an investment. I actually know some investors
who invest in commodities (and who have made money off them) but who
don’t understand the fundamental reasons why commodities are such a good
long-term investment. (Yikes!) 

In this chapter, I show you why commodities are an attractive investment and
why many investors are becoming more interested in this asset class. I also
give you the goods on a number of global trends that are responsible for the
recent run-up in commodity prices. Those who are able to spot these trends
are going to do extremely well. And those who don’t, well, I wouldn’t want to
be in their shoes! 
You Can’t Argue with Success
In recent years, commodities as an asset class have received a lot of attention
from the investor community. Many investors are turning to commodities
because they are disappointed with the returns that other investments have
offered and, more importantly, because commodities have performed extremely
well recently. Take a look at Figure 2-1, which shows the recent performance of
the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index, an index that tracks a basket of commodities.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

As you can see from Figure 2-1, the performance of commodities as an asset
class has been phenomenal in recent years. And it’s not just commodities as
an asset class that have done well; individual commodities such as crude oil
and gold have also done well recently. For example, the price of crude oil 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) as shown in Figure 2-2 has
increased from $20 per barrel in 2001 to over $70 in 2006, an increase of 350
percent!
The price of gold, another key commodity, has also increased dramatically in
recent years. While I was writing this book, gold actually hit a 26-year high
when it reached $730 a troy ounce in May 2006. Check out gold’s recent 
performance in Figure 2-3, as measured in the futures market. 
Many investors, intrigued by the eye-popping performance of commodities,
want in on the action. However, a majority of investors are pouring into 
commodities without knowing why commodities are performing well — and
this is a recipe for disaster.

Chapter 2: Earn, Baby, Earn! Why You Should Invest in Commodities

Never invest in something you don’t understand. If you hear someone on TV
or the radio mention an investment, make sure you perform your due dili-
gence to get the ins and outs of the potential investment. (I talk about due
diligence in Chapter 3.) Not understanding an investment before you invest in
it is one of the easiest ways to lose money. 
In this chapter, I go through the reasons why commodities have been doing
so well so that you have an investment framework to follow in your own port-
folio. I also argue that the recent run-up in commodities is only the tip of the
iceberg — most of the gains still to come!
The 21st Century Is the Century 
of Commodities
Since the fall of 2001, commodities have been running faster than the bulls of
Pamplona. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index (a benchmark for commodities)
nearly doubled between 2001 and 2006. During this period oil, gold, copper,
and silver all hit all-time highs (although not adjusted for inflation). Other
commodities also reached levels never seen before in trading sessions.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

Many investors wondered, what is going on? How come commodities are
doing so well when other investments, such as stocks and bonds, aren’t per-
forming? I believe that what you and I are witnessing is a long-term cyclical
bull market in commodities. Because of a number of fundamental factors
(which I go through in the following sections), commodities are poised for a
rally that will last well into the 21st century — and possibly beyond that. It’s
a bold statement, I know. But the facts are there to support me.
Although I’m bullish on commodities for the long term, I have to warn you that
there are going to be times when commodities don’t perform well at all. This
is simply the nature of the commodity cycle. Furthermore in the history of
Wall Street, no asset has ever gone up in a straight line. There are always minor
(and, occasionally, major) pullbacks before the asset makes new highs — if in
fact it does make new highs.
A case in point is that during the first few months of 2006, commodities out-
performed every asset class, with some commodities breaking record levels.
Gold hit a 25-year high and so did copper. Then during the week of May 15,
commodities saw a big drop. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index fell over 5 per-
cent that week, with gold and copper dropping 10 and 7 percent, respectively.
Many commentators went on the offensive and started bashing commodities.
“We are now seeing the beginning of the end of the rally in commodities,”
said one analyst. “Is this the end of commodities?” ran a newspaper headline.
An endless number of commentators hit the airwaves claiming that this is a
speculative bubble about to burst. A respected economist even compared
what was happening to commodities to the dot com bubble: “There is no fun-
damental reason why commodity prices are going up.” Nothing could be fur-
ther from the facts. A couple of weeks after this minor pullback, some of
these commodities that were being compared to highly leveraged tech stocks
had regained most, if not all, of their lost ground. 
There’s a story behind the rise in commodities — and it’s a pretty compelling
one. 
Ka-boom! Capitalizing on the 
global population explosion
The 21st century is going to experience the largest population growth in the his-
tory of humankind. The United Nations estimates that the world will add a little
fewer than 1 billion people during each of the first five decades of the 21st cen-
tury. This means that the global population will grow to about 9 billion people
by 2050 (as of 2006, there are approximately 6.5 billion people on the planet). 
29
Chapter 2: Earn, Baby, Earn! Why You Should Invest in Commodities

Also, consider the following statistic: According to the UN, the average
number of years it takes to add 1 billion people has shrunk from an average
of 130 years in the 19th century to approximately 13 years in the 21st cen-
tury! This means the rate at which the human population is increasing has
reached exponential levels. Check out Figure 2-4 for the expected population
growth in the 21st century. 
So how is this relevant to commodities? Put simply, significant population
growth translates into greater global demand for commodities. Humans are
the most voracious consumers of raw materials on the planet — and the only
ones who pay for them. As the number of humans in the world increases, so
will the demand for natural resources. After all, people need food to eat,
houses to live in, and heat to stay warm during the winter — all this requires
raw materials. This large population growth is a key driver for the increasing
demand for commodities, which will continue to put upward pressures on
commodity prices. 
Brick by brick: Profiting from urbanization
Perhaps even more significant than population growth is the fact that it is
accompanied by the largest urbanization movement the world has ever seen.
In the early 20th century, according to the UN, less than 15 percent of the
world’s population lived in cities; by 2005 that number jumped to 50 percent —
and shows no sign of decreasing. As a matter of fact, 60 percent of the world’s
population is expected to live in urban areas by the year 2030.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

The number of large metropolitan areas with 5 million or more people (mega
cities) is skyrocketing and will continue to for much of the century. In Figure 2-5,
I list the number of cities expected to have 5 million inhabitants by 2015. When
you compare that with the growth in the number of cities with 5 million people
from 1950 to 2000, you quickly realize how staggering this growth really is. 
Urbanization is highly significant for commodities because people who live in
urban centers consume a lot more natural resources than those who live in
rural areas. In addition, more natural resources are required to expand the size
of cities as more people move to them (rural to urban migration) and are having
more kids (indigenous urban population growth). More natural resources are
required for the roads, cars, and personal appliances that are staples of city life. 
Industrial metals such as copper, steel, and aluminum are going to be in high
demand to construct apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, cars, and so
on. Investing in industrial metals is therefore one possible way to play the
urbanization card. Make sure to read Chapter 16 for more information on
these metals. 
As you can see from the map in Figure 2-5, the largest urbanization is taking
place in the developing world, particularly in Asia. As more Asians move from
the countryside to large urban areas, expect to see huge demand from that
part of the world for raw materials to fuel this growth.

Chapter 2: Earn, Baby, Earn! Why You Should Invest in Commodities

One way to profit from Asian urbanization is to invest in indigenous Asian
companies and countries that process natural resources. I present this
investment strategy in Chapter 5. 
Full steam ahead! Benefiting 
from industrialization
The first industrial revolution, which took place in the 19th century, was a
major transformational event primarily confined to Western Europe and
North America. Major industrialization did not spread to other corners of the
globe until parts of the 20th century, and even then only sporadically. 
A new wave of industrialization is taking place in the 21st century and it may
be the most important one in history. This wave is transforming a large
number of developing countries into more industrialized countries, and this
transformation is fueled by raw materials. 
The BRIC countries
Although a number of developing countries are on the fast track to industrializa-
tion, four countries in particular need to be singled out as the frontrunners in
this movement — Brazil, Russia, India, and China (known as the BRIC countries). 
The BRIC countries, which are now on a path towards full industrialization,
are scouring the globe to secure supplies of key natural resources such as oil,
natural gas, copper, and aluminum — the raw materials necessary for a coun-
try to industrialize. (See the sidebar “It’s déjà vu all over again: The great
game 21st century style.”)
As demand from the BRIC countries for natural resources increases, expect
to see increasing upward price pressures on commodities. 
China
Although all four of the BRIC countries are rapidly transforming themselves,
no other country is doing so as rapidly and dramatically as China. Actually, it
is only very fitting that the saying “May you live in interesting times” is said
to be an old Chinese proverb. The 21st century is undoubtedly going to be an
interesting century, and China is going to play an increasingly important role
in global economic affairs. 
China’s GDP has increased by 9 percent each year from 2000 to 2006. To sus-
tain this growth, China has been consuming all sorts of commodities. Some of
the highs that commodities such as oil, natural gas, cement, copper, and alu-
minum have experienced between 2003 and 2006 are a direct result of
increased demand from China. 
32
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

For example, in 2004 China gobbled up half the cement, one-third of the steel,
one-quarter of the copper, and one-fifth of the aluminum produced in the
world. In 2003, China overtook Japan to become the second largest consumer
of crude oil — right behind the United States. (For more information on global
oil consumption, make sure you read Chapter 11.) In Figure 2-6 you can see the
expected Chinese consumption of crude oil for the first quarter of the century. 
China is going to have a tremendous impact on the global economy in the
21st century and is expected to be the largest consumer of commodities in
the world. For more information on China’s emergence as a global economic
power and the transformation of the economic playing field that this entails, I

Chapter 2: Earn, Baby, Earn! Why You Should Invest in Commodities

It’s All about Me! Why Commodities 
Are Unique
As an asset class, commodities have unique characteristics that separate
them from other asset classes and make them attractive, whether as indepen-
dent investments or as part of a broader based investment strategy. I go
through these unique characteristics in the following sections. 
Inelasticity
In economics, elasticity seeks to determine the effects of price on supply and
demand. The calculation can get pretty technical but, essentially, elasticity
quantifies how much supply and demand will change for every incremental
change in price. 
Goods that are elastic tend to have a high correlation between price and
demand, which is usually inversely proportional: When prices of a good
increase, demand tends to decrease. This makes sense because you’re not
going to pay for a good that you don’t need if it becomes too expensive.
Capturing and determining that spread is what elasticity is all about. 
Inelastic goods, however, are goods that are so essential to consumers that
changes in price tend to have a limited effect on supply and demand. Most
commodities fall in the inelastic goods category because they are essential to
human existence. There is no way around this. 
For instance if the price of ice cream were to increase by 25 percent, chances
are you’re going to stop buying ice cream. Why? Because it’s not a necessity,
but more of a luxury. However, when the price of unleaded gasoline at the
pump increases by 25 percent (as it has actually done during 2003–2006),
you’re definitely not happy about the price increase, but you still go out there
and fill up your tank. The reason? Gas is a necessity — you need to fill up
your car in order to go to work, school, run errands, and so on. 
The demand for gasoline isn’t absolutely inelastic, however — you won’t
keep paying for it regardless of the price. A point will come when you decide
that it’s simply not worth it to keep paying the amount you’re paying at the
pump; and so you begin looking for alternatives. (Please read Chapter 13 for
more information on alternative energy sources.) But the truth remains that
you’re willing to pay more for gasoline than for other products you don’t
need (such as ice cream); that’s the key to understanding price inelasticity. 
34
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

Most commodities are fairly inelastic because they are the raw materials that
allow us to live the lives we strive for; they allow us to maintain a decent
(and, in some cases, extravagant!) standard of living. Without these precious
raw materials, you wouldn’t be able to heat your home in the winter; actually,
without cement, copper, and other basic materials, you wouldn’t even have a
house to begin with! And then of course, there’s the most essential commod-
ity of all: food. Without food we would not exist.
Because of the absolute necessity of commodities, you can be sure that as
long as there are humans around, there is going to be a demand for these raw
materials.
35
Chapter 2: Earn, Baby, Earn! Why You Should Invest in Commodities
It’s déjà vu all over again: The great game 
21st century style
During parts of the 19th and 20th centuries, the
global powers of the time were embroiled in a
strategic geopolitical contest over control of the
world’s precious natural resources, commonly
referred to as “the great game.” The 21st cen-
tury is experiencing a new great game, where
the stakes are higher and the competition
fiercer. The world’s industrialized and rapidly
industrializing countries are prowling the invest-
ment landscape in search of secure energy and
raw material sources. 
China, in particular, is becoming one of the most
aggressive players on the world stage when it
comes to securing energy sources. As natural
resources such as oil become more scarce,
expect more countries and companies to act
more aggressively to secure whatever supplies
are left. Because demand for raw materials is
fairly inelastic (please see the “Inelasticity”
section) and supply is limited, there is double
upward pressure from both the demand and
supply sides of the equation. (Yet another
reason to be bullish on commodities.) 
For now, the pie is large enough that most of the
global players are able to participate and get
something out of this contest. To profit as an
investor, keep your eye out for new companies
that are making deals overseas to secure raw
materials. The companies that are able to do so
efficiently and aggressively will generally tend
to produce higher revenues and cash flows —
key ingredients to the success of any company.
You should keep a particular close eye on com-
panies from emerging China, India, South
Korea, and Russia as well as the traditional
players from the United States, Great Britain,
Australia, Europe, and Japan, which have the
technological and capital resources to close in
on some big deals. (For more on how to identify
and evaluate these kinds of companies, flip on
over to Chapter 14.) 

Is it safe in here? Commodities 
as a safe haven
During times of turmoil, commodities tend to act as safe havens for investors.
Certain commodities, such as gold and silver, are viewed by investors as reli-
able stores of value. And so investors flock to these assets when times aren’t
good. When currencies slide, when nations go to war, when global pandemics
break out, you can rely on gold, silver, and other commodities to provide you
with financial safety. 
For example, after the horrible acts of September 11, 2001, the price of gold
jumped as investors sought safety in the metal. You can see a clear spike in
the price of gold in Figure 2-7 right after September 11. 
It’s a good idea to have part of your portfolio in gold and other precious
metals so that you can protect your assets during times of turmoil. Please
turn to Chapter 15 for more on investing in precious metals. 
Hedge-hogging galore! Commodities 
as a hedge against inflation
One of the biggest things you need to watch out for as an investor is the rav-
aging effects of inflation. Inflation can devastate your investments, particu-
larly paper assets such as stocks. (I discuss inflation and other risks in

Chapter 3.) The central bankers of the world — smart people all — spend
their entire careers trying to tame inflation, but despite their efforts, inflation
can easily get out of hand. This is why you need to protect yourself against
this economic enemy. 
Ironically, one of the only asset classes that actually benefits from inflation is,
you guessed it, commodities. Perhaps the biggest irony of all is that increases
in the prices of basic goods (commodities such as oil and gas) actually con-
tribute to the increase of inflation. 
As you can see in Figure 2-8, for example, there’s a positive correlation
between gold and the inflation rate. During times of high inflation, investors
load up on gold because it is considered a good store of value. 
One way to not only protect yourself from inflation, but also to actually profit
from it, is to invest in gold. I discuss the inflation hedging opportunities that
gold provides in Chapter 15.

Chapter 2: Earn, Baby, Earn! Why You Should Invest in Commodities

Could you hurry up, please! Bringing 
new sources online takes time
The business of commodities is a time and capital intensive business. Unlike
investments in high tech companies or other “new economy” investments
(such as e-commerce), bringing commodity projects online takes a lot of
time. 
For example, it can take up to a decade to bring new sources of oil online.
First a company must identify potentially promising areas to explore for oil.
Once an area is located, the company then has to actually start drilling and
prospecting for the oil. If it’s lucky, this process of discovering significantly
recoverable sources of oil will only take three to five years. The company
must then develop infrastructure and bring in machinery to extract the 
oil, which must then be transported to a refining facility to be transformed
into consumable energy products such as gasoline or jet fuel. After it 
goes through the lengthy refining stage it must finally be transported to 
consumers! 
So what does this all mean to you as an investor? When you’re investing in
commodities, you have to think long term! If you’re used to investing in tech
stocks or if you’re an entrepreneur involved in e-commerce, you need to radi-
cally change the way you think about investing when you approach com-
modities. If you’re able to recognize the long-term nature of commodities,
you’re on your way to becoming a successful commodities investor. 
Sell in May and go away? Definitely nay!
You may have heard the saying “sell in May and go away.” This is a Wall Street
adage referring to stocks. The thinking goes that because the stock market
doesn’t perform well during the summer months, you should sell your stocks
and get back into the game in the fall. 
This adage does not apply to commodities because commodities move in dif-
ferent cycles than stocks. Some commodities perform really well during the
summer months. For example, because summer is the heavy driving season,
there is an increase in demand for gasoline products. Thus, all things equal,
unleaded gasoline tends to increase in price during the summer. 
I discuss the cyclical nature of commodities in the following section. For a
more in-depth comparison between the performance of commodities and
other assets, please go to Chapter 4.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

Time to Get Down to Business:
Commodities and the Business Cycle
Commodities are cyclical in nature. Returns on commodity investments are
not generated in a vacuum — they are influenced by a number of economic
forces. In other words, the performance of commodities, like that of other
major asset classes, is tied to general economic conditions. Because
economies move in cycles, constantly alternating between expansions and
recessions, commodities react according to the current economic phase. 
39
Chapter 2: Earn, Baby, Earn! Why You Should Invest in Commodities
Constructing the BTC pipeline
A good example of the capital and time inten-
sive aspect of commodity projects is the con-
struction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline
that links a large Azerbaijan offshore oil field
located in the Caspian Sea (the Azeri-Chirag-
Guneshi oil field) to the Turkish port city of
Ceyhan in the Mediterranean Sea. 
Talks about building a pipeline to deliver
Azerbaijan’s 32 Billion Barrels of oil to consumer
markets started in 1996. Many Western coun-
tries and energy companies supported the pro-
ject because the pipeline would tap into a vast
new source of oil (thereby lowering depen-
dence on the volatile Persian Gulf region) and
would pass through Azerbaijan, recently inde-
pendent Georgia, and democratic Turkey
(thereby bypassing the Russians and the
Iranians). 
The project faced immediate opposition
because of strategic geopolitical maneuvering;
in other words, the Russians were not happy
that a pipeline would be built in what they con-
sidered their “backyard.” Environmentalists
also quickly expressed their discontent, fearing
the pipeline would disturb precious environ-
mental and ecological zones. 
Talks among the various interested parties
stretched from 1996 until 1999, when a mutually
agreed upon solution was reached, and the pro-
ject received the green light. Planning for the
construction of the pipeline then began, but
actual construction didn’t begin until late 2002.
The pipeline construction finished in 2006, and
oil started flowing from the Caspian Sea to the
Mediterranean Sea on May 28, 2006. 
So all in all, it took about ten years to create,
design, and execute this project, which has cost
$4 Billion and employed thousands of workers.
The BTC pipeline is a good example of how long
it can take to bring new sources of energy and
other precious commodities to consumer mar-
kets. And I’m not even counting the decades it
took of prospecting and exploring the Caspian
Sea to discover the oil in the first place! 
The point is that the world in 2006 is in serious
need of oil and other raw materials to fuel global
economic growth. However, the projects that
are now being developed will take a number of
years before they are able to produce. Make
sure you consider these factors before you
invest in commodities. 

The performance of commodities as an asset class is going to be different
during economic expansions than during recessions. 
As a general rule, commodities tend to do well during periods of late expan-
sions and early recessions. The reason is that as the economy slows, key
interest rates are decreased in order to stimulate economic activity — this
tends to help the performance of commodities. Stocks and bonds, on the
other hand, do not perform as well during recessions. This means that as an
investor seeking returns across all phases of the business cycle, opening up
to commodities will allow you to generate returns during good and bad eco-
nomic times. 
Make sure to read Chapter 3 for a comprehensive comparison between the
performance of commodities and other asset classes. Also please turn to
Chapter 5 for an overview of the benefits of diversification. 
The study of cycles, whether for commodities, stocks or other assets, is not
an exact science. I don’t recommend you use cycles as the foundation of a
trading or investment strategy. Rather, try to use the study of cycles to get a
sense of what historical patterns have indicated. This should help you get a
better sense of where an asset class is heading. 
While the historical pattern of commodities tends to show better perfor-
mance during late expansions and early recessions, this in no way guarantees
that commodities will keep following this pattern. Actually, during the latest
commodity bull market, commodities have acted independently of the busi-
ness cycle. This could be attributed to the fact that this commodity bull
market, for the reasons outlined in the section “The 21st Century Is the
Century of Commodities,” is a different beast than previous cycles.

Only for the Brave?
In This Chapter

C
ommodities have a reputation for being a risky asset. Many investors are
simply scared of investing in this asset class. This fear is largely unfounded
because, statistically speaking, there is no greater risk in investing in commodi-
ties than there is in investing in stocks. 
For whatever reason, investors have shunned this asset class in favor of what
they think are more “prudent” investments such as stocks. This is quite baffling
because the performance of commodities in recent years has been superior to
that of stocks. For example, between 2002 and 2005, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average returned a respectable 7 percent. However, the Dow Jones-AIG
Commodity Index, which tracks a basket of commodities, was up over 21 per-
cent! In fact in 2002 alone, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had negative
returns (–7 percent), the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index had returns of 26
percent.
I once attended a lecture with a world-renowned market psychologist who
made this simple argument: Investors are afraid of what they don’t know.
Many investors will prefer to stick with an investment they know even if that
investment doesn’t perform well for them. For example, during 2000 and
2001, the investing public lost a total of $5 Trillion in stocks (remember the
bursting of the dot.com bubble?). And yet you never hear the kinds of warn-
ings about stocks that you hear about commodities. Is this a double standard?
You can judge for yourself. 

42
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 
I believe that many investors are afraid of commodities because they don’t
know too much about them. My aim in this chapter is to shed some light on
the issues surrounding commodities so that you can invest with confidence.
However, I’m not denying that commodities present some risk — all invest-
ments do. So I give you some tools in the following sections to minimize and
manage those risks.
Biting Off More Than You Can Chew: 
The Pitfalls of Using Leverage
In finance, leverage refers to the act of magnifying returns through the use of
borrowed capital. Leverage is a powerful tool that gives you the opportunity
to control large market positions with relatively little upfront capital.
However, leverage is the ultimate double-edged sword because both your
profits and losses are magnified to outrageous proportions. 
If you invest in stocks, you know that you are able to trade on margin. You
have to qualify for a margin account but, once you do, you are able to use
leverage (margin) to get into stock positions. You can also trade commodities
on margin. However, the biggest difference between using margin with stocks
and with commodities is that margin requirement for commodities is much
lower than margins for stocks, which means the potential for losses (and
profits) is much greater in commodities. 
If you qualify for trading stocks on margin, you have to have at least 50 per-
cent of the capital in your account before you can enter into a stock position
on margin. 
The minimum margin requirements for commodity futures vary but are, on
average, lower than that for stocks. For example, the margin requirement for
soybeans in the Chicago Board of Trade is 4 percent. This means that with only
$400 in your account, you can buy $10,000 worth of soybeans futures con-
tracts! If the trade goes your way, you’re a happy camper. But if you’re on the
losing side of a trade on margin, you can lose much more than your principal. 
Another big difference between stock and commodity futures accounts is
that the balance on futures accounts is calculated at the end of the trading
session. This means that if you get a margin call, you need to take care of it
immediately. 
When you’re trading on margin, essentially on borrowed capital, you may get
a margin call from your broker requiring you to deposit additional capital in
your account to cover the borrowed amount. 

Because of the use of margin and the extraordinary amounts of leverage you
have at your disposal in the futures markets, you should be extremely careful
when trading commodity futures contracts. In order to be a responsible
investor, I recommend using margin only if you have the necessary capital
reserves to cover any subsequent margin calls you may receive if the market
moves adversely. For more on trading futures and margin requirements, run
on over to Chapter 9. 
Watch Your Step: Understanding the
Real Risks behind Commodities
Investing is all about managing the risk involved in generating returns. In this
section, I lay out some common risks you face when investing in commodities
and some small steps you can take to minimize these risks. 
Geopolitical risk
One of the inherent risks of commodities is that the world’s natural resources
are located in various continents and the jurisdiction over these commodi-
ties lies with sovereign governments, international companies, and many
other entities. For example, to access the large deposits of oil located in the
Persian Gulf region, oil companies have to deal with the sovereign countries
of the Middle East that have jurisdiction over this oil. 
Negotiations for natural resource extractions can get pretty tense pretty
quickly, with disagreements rising over licensing agreements, tax structures,
environmental concerns, employment of indigenous workers, access to tech-
nology, and many other complex issues. 
International disagreements over the control of natural resources are quite
commonplace. Sometimes a host country will simply kick out foreign compa-
nies involved in the production and distribution of the country’s natural
resources. In 2006, Bolivia, which contains South America’s second largest
deposits of natural gas, nationalized its natural gas industry and kicked out
the foreign companies involved. In a day, a number of companies such as
Brazil’s Petrobras and Spain’s Repsol were left without a mandate in a coun-
try where they had spent billions of dollars in developing the natural gas
industry. Investors in Petrobras and Repsol paid the price. 
43
Chapter 3: Is Investing in Commodities Only for the Brave?

So how do you protect yourself from this geopolitical uncertainty?
Unfortunately, there is no magic wand you can wave to eliminate this type of
risk. However, one way to minimize it is to invest in companies with experi-
ence and economies of scale. For example, if you’re interested in investing in
an international oil company, go with one with an established international
track record. A company like ExxonMobil, for instance, has the scale,
breadth, and experience in international markets to manage the geopolitical
risk they face. A smaller company without this sort of experience is going to
be more at risk than a bigger one. In commodities, size does matter. 
Speculative risk
The commodities markets, just like the bond or stock markets, are populated
by traders whose primary interest is in making short-term profits by specu-
lating whether the price of a security will go up or go down. 
Because speculators, unlike commercial users who are using the markets for
hedging purposes, are simply interested in making profits, they will tend to
move the markets in different ways. Although speculators provide much-
needed liquidity to the markets (particularly in commodity futures markets),
they can also tend to increase market volatility, especially when they begin
exhibiting what one Alan Greenspan termed “irrational exuberance.” Because
speculators can get out of control, as they did during the dot.com bubble,
always be aware of the amount of speculative activity going on in the mar-
kets. The amount of speculative money involved in commodity markets is in
constant fluctuation, but as a general rule, most commodity futures markets
contain about 75 percent commercial users and 25 percent speculators. 
Although I’m bullish on commodities because of the fundamental supply and
demand story (which I present in Chapter 2), too much speculative money
coming into the commodities markets can have detrimental effects. I antici-
pate that there will be times when speculators drive the prices of commodi-
ties in excess of the fundamentals. If you see too much speculative activity,
it’s probably a good idea to simply get out of the markets. 
If you trade commodities, constantly check the pulse of the markets, finding
out as much as possible about who the market participants are so that you
can distinguish between the commercial users and the speculators. One
source I recommend you check out is the Commitment of Traders report which
is put out by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This report
is available online at www.cftc.gov/cftc/cftccotreports.htm and gives
you a detailed look at the market participants. For more information on the
CFTC and other regulatory bodies, check out Chapter 8. 
44
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

Corporate governance risk
As if there weren’t enough things to worry about, you should always watch
out for plain and simple fraud. Although the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) and other regulatory bodies (see Chapter 8) do a decent
job of protecting investors from market fraud, there is always the possibility
that you will become a victim of fraud. For example, your broker may hide
debts or losses in offshore accounts, as was the case with Refco (see sidebar). 
One way to prevent being taken advantage of is to be extremely vigilant about
where you’re putting your money. Make sure that you thoroughly research a
firm before you hand over your money. I go through the due diligence process
you should follow when selecting managers in Chapter 6. Unfortunately, there
are times when no amount of research or due diligence is able to protect you
from fraud — it’s just a fact of the investment game. 
Managing Risk
You cannot completely eliminate risk, but you can sure take steps to help you
reduce it. In this section, I go through time-proven and market-tested ways to
minimize risk. 
Due diligence: Just do it
One way to minimize risk is to research all aspects of the investment you’re
about to undertake — before you undertake it. Too often, investors won’t
start doing research until after they invest in commodities contracts or 
companies. 
45
Chapter 3: Is Investing in Commodities Only for the Brave?
The unraveling of Refco
Refco was one of the largest commodity bro-
kers in the world. In moves not unlike the ones
followed by Enron executives, the company’s
management hid about $400 Million in debts
from the public in offshore accounts right
before launching an Initial Public Offering (IPO)
in order to make itself attractive to public
investors. When these losses were uncovered,
things got completely out of hand and the com-
pany was forced into bankruptcy in 2005. A
large number of individual and institutional
investors were affected by this unraveling.

A large number of investors buy on hype; they hear a certain commodity
mentioned in the press, and they buy just because everyone else is buying.
Buying on impulse is one of the most detrimental habits you can develop as
an investor. Before you put your money in anything, you should find out as
much as possible about this potential investment. 
Because you have a number of ways you can invest in commodities (which I
discuss in Chapter 5), the type of research you perform depends on what
approach you take. The following sections go over the due diligence you
should perform for each investment methodology.
Commodity companies
One way to get exposure to commodities is to invest in companies that
process commodities. Although this is an indirect way to access raw materi-
als, it is a good approach for investors who are comfortable in the equity
environment. 
Here are a few questions you should ask before you buy the company’s stock: 
 What are the company’s assets and liabilities?
 How effective is the management with the firm’s capital?
 Where will the firm generate future growth from?
 Where does the company actually generate its revenue from?
 Has the company run into any regulatory problems in the past?
 What is the company’s structure? (Some commodity companies are cor-
porations, while others act as limited partnerships — more on these in
Chapter 6.)
 How does the company compare with competitors?
 Does the company operate in regions of the world that are politically
unstable?
 What’s the company’s performance across business cycles?
Of course, these are only a few questions you should ask before making an
equity investment. I go through a series of other facts and figures you should
gather about commodity companies in Chapter 14 (for energy companies)
and Chapter 18 (for mining companies). 
You can get the answers to these questions by looking through the com-
pany’s annual report (Form 10K) and/or quarterly reports (Form 8K). 
46
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

Managed funds
If you’re not a hands-on investor or simply don’t have the time to actively
manage your portfolio, you may want to choose a manager to do the invest-
ing for you. You can choose from a number of different managers, including:
 Commodity Trading Advisor: Manager of individual futures accounts
 Commodity Pool Operator: Manager of group futures accounts
 Commodity Mutual Fund: Manager of mutual funds that invest in 
commodities
Before you invest with a manager, you need to find out as much as you can
about him. Here are a few questions you should ask:
 What is the manager’s track record?
 What is her investing style? Is it conservative or aggressive and are you
comfortable with it?
 Does he have any disciplinary actions against him?
 What do clients have to say about her? (It’s okay to ask a manager to
speak to one of her existing clients.)
 Is he registered with the appropriate regulatory bodies? (Please turn to
Chapter 8 for information on the regulators.)
 What fees does she charge? (Ask whether there are fees that are not dis-
closed: Always watch out for hidden fees!)
 How much assets does he have under management?
 What are her after-tax returns? (Make sure you specify after-tax returns
because many managers only post returns before taxes are considered.)
 Are there minimum time commitments?
 Are there penalties if you choose to withdraw your money early?
 Are there minimum investment requirements?
I go through other qualifying questions you should ask yourself before choosing
a manager to invest money for you in Chapter 6. 
Futures market
The futures markets play an important role in the world of commodities.
They provide liquidity and allow hedgers and speculators to establish bench-
mark prices for the world’s commodities. 
47
Chapter 3: Is Investing in Commodities Only for the Brave?

If you are interested in investing through commodity futures, you need to ask
a lot of questions before you get started. Here are some of these questions:
 On what exchange is the futures contract traded?
 Is there an accompanying option contract for the commodity?
 Is the market for the contract liquid or illiquid? (You want it to be liquid,
just in case you were wondering.)
 Who are the main market participants?
 What is the expiration date for the contract you’re interested in?
 What is the open interest for the commodity?
 Are there any margin requirements? If so, what are they?
To find out more about trading futures contracts, as well as options, make
sure you read Chapter 9. 
Commodity fundamentals
Whether you decide to invest through futures contracts, commodity compa-
nies, or managed funds, you need to gather as much information as possible
about the underlying commodity itself. This is perhaps the most important
piece of the commodities puzzle because the performance of any investment
vehicle you choose depends on what the actual fundamental supply and
demand story of the commodity is.
Here are a few questions you should ask yourself before you start investing in
a commodity, whether it’s coffee or copper.
 Which country/countries hold the largest reserves of the commodity?
 Is that country politically stable or is it vulnerable to turmoil?
 How much of the commodity is actually produced on a regular basis?
(Ideally you want to get data for daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual
basis.)
 Which industries/countries are the largest consumers of the commodity?
 What are the primary uses of the commodity?
 Are there any alternatives to the commodity? If so, what are they and 
do they pose a significant risk to the production value of the target 
commodity?
 Are there any seasonal factors that affect the commodity?
 What is the correlation between the commodity and comparable 
commodities in the same category? 
 What are the historical production and consumption cycles for the 
commodity? 
48
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

These are only a few questions you should ask before you invest in any com-
modity. Ideally you want to be able to gather this information before you
start trading.
Diversify, diversify, diversify
One of the best ways to manage risk is through diversification. This applies on
a number of levels: both diversification among asset classes, such as bonds,
stocks, and commodities and also diversification within an asset class, such as
diversifying your commodity holdings among energy and metals. 
In order for diversification to have the desired effects on your portfolio (to
minimize risk), you want to have asset classes that perform differently. One
of the benefits of using commodities to minimize your overall portfolio risk 
is that commodities tend to behave differently than stocks and bonds. For
example, as you can see in Figure 3-1, the performance of commodities and
equities is remarkably different. This means that when stocks are not doing
well, you will at least have your portfolio exposed to an asset class that is
performing. 
To find out more about how the performance of commodities compares to
that of other assets and how this is beneficial to you, check out Chapter 4.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 
Managed funds: Another one (or two) 
bites the dust
While I was writing Commodities For Dummies,
the prices of certain commodities such as crude
oil, natural gas, and gold were in an upward
trend line that seemed endless. Of course, every
rally eventually comes to an end, either to take
a breather before rallying again or to falter and
break down completely. Such was the case
with natural gas prices during the summer and
early fall of 2006. Natural gas prices, which are
notoriously volatile because natural gas is hard
to store (see Chapter 12), broke down after a
six-month rally. Several hedge funds were
forced to close down because of their exposure
to natural gas futures. 
Hedge funds, like a number of other financial
institutions, poured billions and billions of dol-
lars into commodities such as natural gas and
copper to profit from, and naturally contribute
to, the bull market in commodities. Hedge funds
generally have a high tolerance for risk and so
aren’t afraid to enter into highly leveraged posi-
tions (through the use of high margin). Two
funds that were exposed to heavy losses were
caught against the tide trading natural gas
futures contracts in the middle of 2006. 
The first fund to suffer massive losses was
MotherRock Energy Fund, a half billion dollar
hedge fund that specializes in energy futures.
MotherRock placed huge bets that the price of
natural gas was going to drop; they were cor-
rect, of course, except that they got their timing
wrong — natural gas prices rallied a few more
weeks before they dropped. MotherRock’s
unfortunate timing meant that the fund lost $100
Million in June 2006 and another $100 Million in
July 2006. Having lost half its total capital in two
months, the fund was forced to shut down. 
The second fund that fell victim to wild natural
gas price swings was a much-larger, multi-
strategy hedge fund based in Greenwich,
Connecticut, 
called 
Amaranth 
Advisors.
Amaranth, a fund with approximately $10 Billion
in assets, invests in various markets, not simply
commodities. Its multi-strategy focus allows it
to enter any market it believes is promising. The
company entered the natural gas market,
hoping that its previous successes would allow
it to profit in this market as well. Amaranth bet
that the prices of natural gas futures would
increase; unfortunately for Amaranth (and their
investors), natural gas prices decreased and it
was caught on the wrong side of the natural gas
tide. As a result, Amaranth lost a whopping $3
Billion! 
A number of lessons can be gleamed from these
hedge fund debacles. First, natural gas futures
are extremely volatile. Second, use leverage at
your own risk. Third, over-concentration
(putting all your eggs in one basket) can be dev-
astating. While these sorts of losses are few
and far between, they serve to remind the
investor that investing can be very rewarding
but can also be dangerous if not done properly.
At the end of the day, if you’re going to invest
using margin in volatile commodities, you need
to be ready for both spectacular wins, but also
devastating losses.

ommodities are generating some heated arguments among some of the
most sophisticated investors and experts. Some commodity bulls are
proclaiming a new era for commodities, while the bears are warning of an
impending commodity implosion. You may have heard of the commodities
super cycle theory on the one hand; and the story about the neighbor who
lost his entire life savings trading commodities on the other. 
With so many arguments and counter-arguments, claims and counter-claims,
how do you decide who is right and who is wrong? More importantly, how do
you decide whether to start investing in commodities or not? If you do, are
you subjecting yourself to potentially disastrous losses? But if you don’t
invest, will you lose out on some very lucrative gains? So many questions, so
little insight. My aim in this chapter is to deconstruct the arguments of both
the commodity bulls and bears in order to allow you to make up your own
mind about this crucial issue.
The constant tension between the bulls and bears, not simply in the com-
modities markets but in other markets as well, is actually good for the mar-
kets. If you didn’t have both sides, there would be no market: Buyers
wouldn’t find sellers and sellers wouldn’t find buyers. Even though the bulls
and the bears are in a constant struggle, they both need each other. This is
what makes investing in, and studying, the markets so much fun.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 
Seeing Both the Forest and the Trees
One of the biggest discrepancies between the arguments of the bulls and the
bears results from the natural divergence among the performance of the indi-
vidual commodities themselves. In Chapter 1, I explain that every single com-
modity has two fundamental qualities that determine its performance: the
laws of supply and demand specific to its production and consumption, and
its reaction based on the movements of the commodities asset class of which
it is a member. In other words, you have to look at commodities — whether
it’s natural gas, nickel, or cocoa — as individual entities as well as part of a
larger asset class. This financial dichotomy, which is sometimes captured by
the alpha and beta coefficients in a portfolio, is worth remembering as you
start investing in this market.
In the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which describes the relationship
between risk and return in a portfolio, the beta coefficient is a measure of risk
or volatility of a security or portfolio relative to a broader market. In other
words, beta measures the performance of the part relative to the whole. On
the other hand, the alpha coefficient quantifies the performance of a security
relative to its ability to generate returns independently of the broader
Reasonable doubt
During the California Gold Rush, a number of
charlatans emerged trying to sell products to
folks intent on finding gold. One fella was sell-
ing a bottled ointment that guaranteed the user
instant wealth through large discoveries of gold.
He promised that whoever poured this ointment
on their body, climbed to the top of a mountain,
and rolled down the mountain would become
rich instantly. He claimed that the ointment was
so powerful it would attract all the surrounding
gold as the individual rolled down the mountain!
As ridiculous as this sounds, this guy sold hun-
dreds of these bottles to gullible customers.
While this is an extreme example, the moral of
the story is that there are a lot of people out
there who try to sell products that are simply
bogus. Avoid these people like the plague.
Whoever promises you guaranteed returns in
the markets, whether in commodities or else-
where, either doesn’t know what they’re talking
about or they’re outright crooks. Either way, you
don’t want to have anything to do with such
people.
Investing in general, and in commodities in par-
ticular, requires tremendous amounts of focus,
discipline, analysis, research, and — some-
times — just plain old luck (although it’s unlikely
any one on Wall Street will ever admit they got
lucky). The bottom line is that a little skepticism
is not only a useful trait, it’s a necessary trait.
I’ve spent thousands of hours analyzing specific
investments and scrutinizing potential invest-
ments top to bottom, inside out, and I could
never guarantee returns to anyone — it’s simply
not possible. The best you can do is perform
your due diligence before any trade or before
committing any capital to an investment. Having
all the knowledge and information at your dis-
posal is critical, and the aim of this book is to
help you do just that.

market. I talk about portfolio construction, efficient portfolio theory, and gen-
eral portfolio allocation methods in Chapter 5 to help you design a portfolio
that synchronizes commodities with your other holdings. 
In this section, I want to show you that the performance of individual com-
modities varies dramatically both in relation to other individual commodities
as well as relative to a broader market benchmark. For example, take a look
at the performance of crude oil, as measured by the West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), in
Figure 4-1. 
No one who looks at this chart can argue that crude oil, as measured by the
WTI futures contract, hasn’t been in a bull market since at least the beginning
of 2002. But what does this mean for the broader market? What about other
commodities? Have they performed just as well as crude, which is touted by
commodity bulls as a sign of a broader bull market in commodities? 
Check out Figure 4-2. It shows the performance of the gold futures contract
on the COMEX division of the NYMEX.
As you can see, gold has performed almost as well as — if not better than —
crude oil during the same time period. So this means that there’s definitely a
bull market in commodities, right? Well, not exactly. Figures 4-1 and 4-2 show
the performance of crude oil and gold, and only crude oil and gold. It’s true
that crude oil and gold are perhaps the two most important commodities in
the asset class, but are they representative of the whole asset class?

Chapter 4: Get Ready to Rumble! Commodity Bulls vs. Bears

Crude oil is a closely followed commodity because of its importance to the
global economy, and gold because of its precious metal status. (I cover crude
oil in Chapter 11, and gold in Chapter 15.) 
In Figure 4-3, you can see the performance of coffee — another major com-
modity — as measured by the coffee futures contract on the New York Board
of Trade (NYBOT), during same time period, 1997 to 2006. 
What’s going on here? Not only is coffee not in a rally, it seems to be trading
sideways (within a narrow price band). If crude oil and gold are experiencing
a rally, then shouldn’t there be a bull market in coffee as well? After all, coffee
is one of the most important commodities in the world, second only to crude
oil in terms of global production figures. Perhaps it’s a statistical anomaly. 
I’m sure that other commodities have experienced a rally similar to crude oil
and gold. Maybe another major commodity, say live cattle, has experienced a
rally. Take a look at Figure 4-4 for the recent performance of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME) live cattle futures contract.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

Whoa! No rally in the live cattle futures contract either. As a matter of fact, it
doesn’t look like there’s any correlation between live cattle and coffee either.
The performance is so varied that these four representative commodities
seem to have no relation to each other. Even their risk profiles seem very dif-
ferent — live cattle is a lot more volatile than the other three. 
And this is the point that I want to make: The performance of each individual
commodity varies dramatically from the performance of other commodities.
If commodities moved in lock step, then the live cattle and coffee markets
would be experiencing the same rally as crude oil and gold. But they don’t
because the markets are a lot more nuanced than that. Always keep this
diverging performance among individual commodities in mind, particularly
when folks start talking about commodities as an asset class. 
However, there are benchmarks that attempt to capture the performance of
commodities as an asset class. These benchmarks, known as commodity
indexes, are similar to the Dow Jones Industrial Average or other market
benchmarks that track the performance of a group of securities. Like the
commodities markets themselves, these benchmarks are varied in terms of
both the commodities they track as well as their construction methodolo-
gies. Some indexes are overweight specific sub-asset classes (such as
energy), while others follow an equal weight strategy.

Chapter 4: Get Ready to Rumble! Commodity Bulls vs. Bears

These indexes, which I discuss extensively in Chapter 7, do their best to provide
a “big picture” of what the commodities markets are doing. However, because
of the index component selection, construction and rolling methodologies,
rebalancing features, and other external variables, these indexes fail to provide
a complete picture of what the markets are doing. Take the Reuters/Jefferies
Commodity Research Bureau Index, widely viewed as the gold standard of
the commodity benchmarks. One quarter of this index tracks the WTI crude
oil contract (see Figure 4-1), while other commodities such as coffee account
for a much less significant percentage — in the case of coffee only 5 percent.
Placing an emphasis on crude oil is reflected in the performance of the
benchmark, as you can see in Figure 4-5.
Placing such a great emphasis on crude oil means that the benchmark is
more sensitive to price movements in crude than in any other commodity —
which is reflected in its performance as you can clearly see by comparing
Figures 4-1 and 4-5. 
Now, the emphasis on crude oil is justified to a certain extent because crude
oil is in fact an important commodity, perhaps the most important commod-
ity both in terms of production and dollar value. However, despite the impor-
tance of crude, the benchmarks don’t provide a complete picture of what the
commodities markets as a whole are doing. Part of the reason is that bench-
marks track only a few commodities, while they completely fail to include a
number of important commodities.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

For example, none of the benchmarks include steel, which is the most widely
used metal in the world. Knowing what steel is doing is an important consid-
eration and not including such an important commodity — because there
isn’t a futures contract that tracks steel — takes away from the big picture of
what the commodities markets are actually doing.
The bottom line here is that you need to take all the talk about commodities
being in a bull or bear market or about commodities being a risky asset class
with a big grain of salt. Some commodities, such as crude oil and gold, have
clearly been in a bull market, while others such as coffee and live cattle
haven’t performed as well. And some commodities, such as live cattle or
frozen pork bellies, are notoriously more volatile than crude oil and other
commodities.
At the end of the day, you need to be able to see both the forest and the
trees. That’s why my aim throughout the book is to provide you with the crit-
ical information regarding every individual commodity, but also to make sure
to help you tie it with the performance of the broader asset class. Figuring
out what individual commodities are doing is as crucial as knowing what the
broader market is doing.

Ride the Wave? Kondratieff 
and the Super Cycle Theory
One theory that keeps popping up during debates about commodities
between the bulls and the bears is the super cycle theory. This theory, which
has been made famous by legendary commodities investor Jim Rogers, stipu-
lates that commodities are in a long-term cyclical bull market that began in
the late 1990s and will last for 15 years or so. I agree with Rogers — up to a
point. I agree with the premise that the fundamentals are there to support
and generate a run-up in commodity prices, namely a tight supply coupled
with soaring demand. There is no doubt that the fundamentals explain the
recent rally in commodities, and I talk about these fundamental reasons —
such as population growth, industrialization, urbanization, and project dura-
tion — extensively in Chapter 2.
My mid- to long-term outlook for commodities is certainly bullish, but I cannot
say with certitude how long this bull market will last. The theory about super
cycles is nothing new. Nikolai Kondratieff, a Russian economist working in the
1920s, claimed to have identified patterns of economic boom and bust cycles
that stretched across a 50-year period. Kondratieff, the grandfather of the
super cycle theories, based this conclusion on historical data he gathered on
advanced capitalist societies. Not surprisingly, his theory did not hold up
during the next ten years, let alone for the next 50 years.
When confronted with this information, Kondratieff’s followers claimed that
human life expectancy had increased and therefore the Kondratieff cycle no
longer applied. At the end of the day, the whole literature on these super
cycles — be they for advanced capitalist societies or commodities — is
inconclusive.
At the end of the day, I recommend you analyze every asset you invest in —
whether a stock, a particular commodity or a commodity index — based on
the fundamental reasons specific to that asset. Super cycle theories should
help shed some light on a particular asset but don’t rely solely on these
broad market theories to guide your investment strategy.
Keeping It Simple: Looking at the 
Laws of Supply and Demand
The most basic, and fundamental, premise in the study of economics is that
price is a function of the interaction between supply and demand. If supply
doesn’t change and demand increases, prices will increase. When demand
remains constant and supply increases, prices go down. It doesn’t get any
58
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

simpler than that. This simple but powerful concept can be used to explain
the current commodities boom, as well as the previous commodities down-
turns — and the future movements of commodity cycles.
As I outlined in the previous section “Kondratieff and the Super Cycle Theory,”
theories about long-term cycles are more of an economic curiosity than his-
torical fact. At the end of the day, what moves prices are the laws of supply
and demand. The current boom in commodities can be explained through this
lens. For years — perhaps even decades — the commodities industry was
plagued by capital underinvestment in infrastructure. New mines weren’t
being exploited and new oilfields weren’t being discovered. In the late 20th
and early 21st century, demand for the world’s raw materials began to
increase at a rapid clip, driven primarily by the needs of the newly emerging
leading developing countries, particularly India and China (see Chapter 2).
While demand from the industrialized world — mostly North America,
Europe, Japan, and Australasia — remained constant, and demand from the
developing world skyrocketed, prices for the world’s commodities increased.
One of the characteristics of the commodities world is that bringing new
capacity on line takes a long time, often five years and sometimes even
decades (Chapter 2). Extracting raw materials from the earth, transforming
them into usable goods and then transporting them to consumers is a labor-
intensive, technologically driven and time-consuming process. The world was
therefore caught by surprise when economic growth around the world
spurred an intense and lasting demand for natural resources, which ranged
from crude oil and copper to coal and steel.
Faced with surging demand (especially from the leading developing coun-
tries) and lagging supply (because of infrastructure underinvestment for
decades), prices for commodities went through the roof. And this is the situa-
tion the world is facing now: increased demand with limited supply. Will this
current supply and demand balance remain static forever? It’s unlikely.
Already, oil companies are building pipelines to transport oil from hard-to-
reach locations to consumers, and mining companies are digging new mines
to provide consumers with primary base metals. 
As this supply-side crunch subsides, and as demand decreases — and it will
eventually — prices for commodities will again decline. When you enter the
current commodities market, you should be well aware of the fact that prices
are going to come down at some point. 
It’s sometimes easy to lose track of the fundamental nature of the commodi-
ties markets because of all the hype and all the hot money coming in and out
of the markets for speculative purposes. But once you clear out all this noise,
what remains is clear: The commodities markets, like all other markets, are
driven by the fundamental laws of supply and demand. If you remember this
basic premise, you will be able to come out ahead in the markets.

The Color of Money: Taking Control 
of Your Financial Life
You invest because you’ve come to the realization that it’s better to have
your money working for you than to have it sit in a bank account earning so
little interest that you end up losing money when you factor in inflation.
Enough of that — you want your money to work for you. Most people end up
working for their money all their lives, and they get stuck in a vicious cycle
where they become servants to money. 
If you’re caught in this vicious cycle, you want your relationship with money
to go through a 180-degree reversal: Instead of working hard for your money,
you should have your money work hard for you! This is how investing allows
you to build and, more importantly, to maintain your wealth. (In the following
sections I show you how to use commodities to achieve this goal.)
There are a plethora of books that deal with building and maintaining wealth.
With such a wide selection, how do you know which ones to choose?
Fortunately, I’ve taken a look at most of them and have come up with a good
list of recommendations. 
Here are a few books on the topic that I highly recommend you read if you’re
new at investing:
 Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki
 Personal Finance For Dummies by Eric Tyson
 Start Late, Finish Rich by David Bach
 The Millionaire Mind by Thomas Stanley
 One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch
Building wealth is not easy, but with a little discipline and self-control, it can
actually be a very fun and rewarding process. 
Often, the accumulation phase isn’t the biggest challenge to building wealth;
being able to preserve wealth is often more difficult. Here are a couple things
you should be aware of that can negatively impact your bottom line:
 Inflation: Inflation, an increase in prices or in the money supply that can
result in a quick deterioration of value, is one of the most detrimental
forces you face as an investor. Inflation keeps some of the brightest
minds up at night; among them is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve,
whose main priority is making sure that the economy doesn’t grow so

fast that it creates bad inflation. When inflation gets out of control, the
currency literally isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on. This state, known
as hyperinflation, occurred in Weimar Germany in the 1920s. At its worst,
people placed paper money in their stoves to heat themselves during
the winter because the money burned longer than wood. Conveniently,
one way to protect yourself from inflation is by investing in commodities
such as gold and silver. (Make sure to read Chapter 15 for more on using
precious metals as a hedge against inflation.) 
 Business Cycles: In the world of investing, nothing ever goes up in a
straight line. There is always minor turbulence along the way, and most
investments usually experience some drops before they make new highs —
that is, if they ever make new highs! The economy moves in the same way,
alternating between expansions and recessions. Certain assets that per-
form well during expansions (such as stocks) don’t do so well during reces-
sions. Alternatively, assets such as commodities do fairly well during late
expansionary and early recessionary phases of the business cycle. As an
investor interested in preserving and growing your capital base, you need
to be able to identify and invest in assets that are going to perform and
generate returns regardless of the current business cycle. Make sure you
check out Chapter 2, where I discuss the performance of commodities
across the business cycle.
These and other risks, such as those posed by fraud, the markets, and
geopolitics, can be minimized with some due diligence and a few wise deci-
sions. I look at risk as it relates to both commodities and investing in general
in Chapter 3. 
Looking Ahead: Creating a 
Financial Road Map
Building wealth through investing takes a lot of time, effort, and discipline —
unlike winning the lottery or getting a large inheritance. It takes a conscious
and systematic effort to achieve your financial goals. Of course, the first part
is identifying and establishing your financial goals. These could be as diverse
as amassing enough money to retire by age 50 and travel the world, to gather
enough money to pay for college, or to make enough money to pass on to
your children or grandchildren. Before you start investing in commodities (or
any other asset), sit down and figure out clear financial goals. Every individ-
ual has different needs and interests. In the following sections, I outline some
key points to help you establish your financial goals. 
63
Chapter 5: Feel the Love: Welcoming Commodities into Your Portfolio

Once you identify your goals, you can then begin figuring out how to use
commodities to achieve these goals. I show you how in the section “Opening
Up Your Portfolio to Commodities.”
Figuring out your net worth
You need to know where you are before you can determine where you want
to go. From a personal finance perspective, you need to know how much you
are worth in order to determine how much capital to allocate to investing,
living expenses, retirement, and so on. 
Your net worth is calculated by subtracting your total liabilities from your
total assets. (Assets put money in your pocket, while liabilities remove money
from your pocket.) 
Fill in the blanks in Table 5-1 to determine the total value of your assets.

Once you have determined both your total assets and total liabilities, simply
use the following formula to determine your total net worth:
Total Net Worth = Total Assets – Total Liabilities
Determining your net worth on a regular basis is important because it allows
you to keep track of the balance between your assets and liabilities. Knowing
your net worth will allow you in turn to determine which investment strategy
you should pursue. 
65
Chapter 5: Feel the Love: Welcoming Commodities into Your Portfolio

Based on this simple mathematical formula, the key to increasing your net
worth is to increase your assets while reducing your liabilities. Investing
helps you increase your assets. Cutting down on living expenses may help
you reduce your liabilities. 
Identifying your tax bracket
Taxes have a direct impact on how much of your assets you get to keep at the
end of the day. It is important to understand the implications that taxes can
have on your portfolio. 
How much you pay in taxes is based on where you are in the tax bracket. I list
in Table 5-3 the individual income tax brackets to help you determine how
much you’ll end up paying in taxes based on your income.

The tax rate schedule in Table 5-3 is known as Schedule X and applies to you
if you are filing your tax return as a single. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
has a number of different schedules depending on how you are filing your
returns.
 Schedule Y-1: Married and filing jointly OR Qualifying widow(er)
 Schedule Y-2: Married filing separately
 Schedule Z: Head of household
66
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

Tax rates change depending on which schedule you file under. Visit the IRS
Web site at www.irs.gov or talk to your accountant to find out the tax rates
under the different schedules. Because tax rates may change on an annual
basis, make sure you inquire about these tax issues regularly. 
Where you live can also have a big impact on how taxes affect your invest-
ments. Did you know that there are a number of states within the continental
United States that don’t have income taxes? Here are the states that have
absolutely no income tax, which means you get to keep more of what you earn! 
 Alaska
 Florida
 Nevada
 New Hampshire
 South Dakota
 Tennessee
 Texas
 Washington
 Wyoming
By living in one of these states, you will pay federal income taxes but no state
income taxes, so I understand if you start thinking about relocating to one of
these states!
Out of the nine states that don’t have personal income taxes, Florida does
place a tax on intangible personal property. This means that items such as
stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are subject to taxes. Also note that New
Hampshire and Tennessee both tax income earned on interest and dividends. 
Investing in commodities, as in any other asset class, has tax implications.
While I’m not an accountant and the aim of this book is not to offer you tax
advice, I do recommend you talk to your accountant before you invest in
commodities. Knowing the tax implications before you invest will save you a
lot of heartache down the road. Make sure to talk to your accountant, who
can provide you with appropriate tax advice.

Are you hungry? Determining 
your risk appetite
Risk is perhaps the single greatest enemy you face as an investor. How won-
derful would life be if you could have guaranteed returns without risk? Since
that’s not possible, and has never been possible, you have to learn how to
manage, tame, and minimize risk. While I devote a whole chapter to managing
risk related to commodities (see Chapter 3), I do want to briefly discuss gen-
eral portfolio risk in this section.
Your risk tolerance depends on a number of factors that are unique to you as
an individual. The first step in determining your risk tolerance is deciding
how much risk you are willing to take on. Although there is no equation or
formula to determine risk (it would be nice if there were one), you can use a
general rule to identify the percentage of your assets you should dedicate to
aggressive investments with an elevated risk/reward ratio.
As a general rule, the younger you are, the higher your percentage of assets
should be devoted to higher-risk investments. This makes sense because if
you lose a lot you still have a lot of time ahead of you to recoup your losses.
When you’re older, however, you don’t have as much time to get back your
investments.
Table 5-4 gives you a simple guideline to help you determine the percentage
of assets that should go into investments with higher returns (and risks).

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

This rule is not set in stone, but you can use it to approximate how much of
your assets should be placed in investments that have a high risk/reward
ratio. If you’re investments are working just fine with the percentages you’re
working with, don’t change them! As the saying goes, if it’s not broken, don’t
try to fix it. 
This table provides you with a general guideline of the percentage of assets
you should earmark for growth investments, such as stocks, commodities, and
real estate. This is not a percentage of how much of your portfolio you should
invest in commodities. I discuss that percentage in the following section.
Making Room in Your Portfolio 
for Commodities
One of the most common questions I get from investors is, “How much of my
portfolio should I have in commodities?” My answer is usually very simple: It
depends. You have to take into account a number of different factors to deter-
mine how much capital to dedicate to commodities.
Personally, my portfolio may include at any one point anywhere between 35
to 50 percent commodities. However, there are times when it’s much lower
than that. And there have been times where almost 90 percent of my portfolio
was in commodities!
If you’re new to commodities, I would recommend starting out with a rela-
tively modest amount, anywhere between 3 and 5 percent to see how com-
fortable you feel with this new member of your financial family. Test out how
commodities contribute to your overall portfolio’s performance. If satisfied, I
recommend you gradually increase it.
Many investors who like the way commodities anchor their portfolios have
about 15 percent exposure to commodities. I find that’s a pretty good place
to be if you’re still getting used to commodities. Although my guess is that
once you see the benefits and realize how much value commodities can pro-
vide, that number will steadily increase.
In Figure 5-1, I create a hypothetical portfolio that includes commodities
along with other asset classes.

Chapter 5: Feel the Love: Welcoming Commodities into Your Portfolio

Having a diversified portfolio is important because it helps reduce the overall
volatility of your market exposures. Having unrelated assets increases your
chances of maintaining good returns when a certain asset under-performs. 
Fully Exposed: The Top Ways to 
Get Exposure to Commodities
You have several methods at your disposal, both direct and indirect, for get-
ting exposure to commodities. In this section, I go through the different ways
you can invest in commodities.
Looking towards the future 
with commodity futures
The futures markets are the most direct way to get exposure to commodities.
Futures contracts allow you to purchase an underlying commodity for an
agreed upon price in the future. I talk about futures contracts in depth in
Chapter 9. In this section, I list some ways you can play the futures markets.

Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

Commodity index
Commodity indexes track a basket of commodity futures contracts. The
methodology that each index uses is different and the performance of the
index is different from its peers. Commodity indexes are known as passive,
long-only investments because they are not actively managed and they can
only buy the underlying commodity; they can’t short it. (For more on going
long and going short, please turn to Chapter 9.) 
Here are the five major commodity indexes you can choose from:
 Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI)
 Reuters/Jefferies Commodity Research Bureau Index (R/J-CRBI)
 Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index (DJ-AIGCI)
 Rogers International Commodity Index (RICI)
 Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index (DBLCI)
I analyze the components, performance, and construction methodology of
each one of these indexes in Chapter 7. 
71
Chapter 5: Feel the Love: Welcoming Commodities into Your Portfolio
Modern Portfolio Theory and the 
benefits of diversification
The idea that diversification is a good strategy
in portfolio allocation is the cornerstone of the
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). MPT is the
brainchild of Nobel Prize winning economist
Harry Markowitz. In a paper he wrote in 1952 for
his doctoral thesis, Markowitz argued that
investors should look at a portfolio’s overall
risk/reward ratio. While this sounds like
common sense today, it was a groundbreaking
idea at the time.
Up until Markowitz’s paper, most investors con-
structed their portfolios based on a risk/reward
ratio analysis of individual securities. Investors
chose a security based on its individual risk 
profile and ignored how that risk profile would
fit within a broader portfolio. Markowitz argued
(successfully) that investors could construct
more profitable portfolios if they looked at the
overall risk/reward ratio of their portfolios.
Therefore, when you are considering an indi-
vidual security, you should not only assess its
individual risk profile, but also take into account
how that risk profile fits within your general
investment strategy. Markowitz’s idea that hold-
ing a group of different securities reduces a
portfolio’s overall volatility is one of the most
important ideas in portfolio allocation.

Futures Commission Merchant
Don’t be intimidated by the name — a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) is
very much like your regular stock broker. However, instead of selling stocks,
an FCM is licensed to sell futures contracts, options, and other derivatives to
the public. 
If you are comfortable trading futures and options contracts, then opening an
account with an FCM will give you the most direct access to the commodity
futures markets. Make sure you read Chapter 6 to find out the pros and cons
of investing through an FCM. 
If you’re going to trade futures contracts directly, you should have a solid
grasp of technical analysis, which I discuss in Chapter 10. 
Commodity Trading Advisor
A Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) is an individual who manages accounts
for clients who trade futures contracts. The CTA may provide advice on how
to place your trades, but may also manage your account on your behalf.
Make sure you research the CTA’s track record and investment philosophy to
make sure it squares with yours. 
The CTA may manage accounts for more than one client. However, they are
not allowed to “pool” accounts and share all profits and losses among clients
equally. (This is one of the main differences between a CTA and a CPO, dis-
cussed next.) 
Make sure to read Chapter 6 to identify key elements to look for when shop-
ping for a CTA.
Commodity Pool Operator
The Commodity Pool Operator (CPO) acts a lot like a CTA except that, instead
of managing separate accounts, the CPO has the authority to “pool” all client
funds in one account and trade them as if she were trading one account. 
There are two advantages of investing through a CPO over a CTA:
 Because a CPO can pool funds together, she has access to more funds to
invest. This provides both leverage and diversification opportunities
that smaller accounts don’t offer. You can buy a lot more assets with
$100,000 than with $10,000. 
 Most CPOs are structured as partnerships, which means the only money
you can lose is your principal. In the world of futures, this is pretty good
because, due to margin and the use of leverage, you can end up owing a
lot more than the principal should a trade go sour. Make sure to read
Chapter 9 for more on margin and leverage. 
72
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

I go through the pros and cons of investing through a CPO in Chapter 6. 
Funding your account with 
commodity funds
If you think that delving into commodity derivatives is not for you, then you
can access the commodity markets through funds. If you’ve invested before,
you may be familiar with these two investment vehicles. 
Commodity mutual funds
Commodity mutual funds are exactly like your average, run of the mill mutual
funds except that they focus specifically on investing in commodities. You
have a number of such funds to choose from, although the two biggest ones
are the PIMCO and the Oppenheimer funds. 
A recent SEC ruling changed the way that mutual funds account for qualifying
income, and this has put some pressure on funds, particularly PIMCO, to
come up with different accounting methods. Make sure you find out how
such rulings affect your investments. 
I examine commodity mutual funds in Chapter 6. 
Exchange Traded Funds
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have become really popular with investors
because they provide the benefits of investing in a fund with the ease of trad-
ing a stock. This hybrid instrument is becoming one of the best ways for
investors to access the commodities markets. 
The world of commodity ETFs is fairly new and is constantly changing. Just
during the writing of this book, three new ETFs were launched. Because this
is such a dynamic field, I have a section called ETF Watch in my Web site
www.commodities-investor.com that I encourage you to check out to
keep up to date on everything that’s happening in the world of ETFs. 
You currently have at your disposal ETFs that track baskets of commodities
through commodity indexes, as well as ETFs that track single commodities
such as oil, gold, and silver. I list some popular commodity ETFs in Table 5-5.

You’re in good company: Investing 
in commodity companies
Another route you can take to get exposure to commodities is to buy stocks
of commodity companies. These companies are generally involved in the pro-
duction, transformation, and/or distribution of various commodities.
This is perhaps the most indirect way of accessing the commodity markets
because in buying a company’s stock, you’re getting exposure not only to the
performance of the underlying commodity the company is involved in, but
also other factors such as the company’s management skills, creditworthi-
ness, and ability to generate cash flow and minimize expenses.
Publicly traded companies
Publicly traded companies can give you exposure to specific sectors of com-
modities, such as metals, energy, or agricultural products. Within these three
categories, you can choose companies that deal with specific methods or
commodities, such as refiners of crude oil into finished products or gold
mining companies.
74
Part I: Commodities: Just the Facts 

If you’re considering an equity stake in a commodity company, you should
determine how the company’s stock performs relative to the price of the
underlying commodity that company is involved in.
Although there is no hard rule, I’ve found that there is a relatively strong cor-
relation between the performance of commodity futures contracts and the
performance of companies that use these commodities as inputs.
So investing in the stock of commodity companies actually gives you pretty
good exposure to the underlying commodities themselves. However, you
want to be extra careful and to perform a thorough due diligence before you
invest your money in these companies. I show you some key things you
should look for before you invest in such companies in Chapters 14 and 18.
Master Limited Partnerships
Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are a hybrid instrument that offers you
the convenience of trading a partnership like a stock. You really get the best
of both worlds: the liquidity that comes from being a publicly traded entity
with the tax protection of being a partnership.
One of the biggest advantages of MLPs is that, as a unit holder, you are only
taxed at the individual level. This is different than if you invested in a corpo-
ration, where cash back to shareholders (in the form of dividends) is taxed
both at the corporate level as well as the individual level. MLPs do not pay
any corporate tax! This is a huge benefit for your bottom line. 
In order for an MLP to qualify for these tax breaks, it must generate 90 per-
cent of its income from qualifying sources that relate to commodities, partic-
ularly in the oil and gas industry.
Some of the popular assets that MLPs invest in include oil and gas storage
facilities and transportation infrastructure such as pipelines. I go through
MLPs in detail in Chapter 6.

f you’re looking for ways to get involved in commodities, you have the
option of hiring a trained professional to do the investing for you. As the
number of investors putting their money in this asset class grows, more and
more investment vehicles are being developed to satisfy this demand.
Currently, a number of money managers offer their services to help you
invest in this market. 
Of course, whenever you hand over your hard-earned money to a manager,
you want to make sure you feel confident about her ability to invest your
money wisely. You should consider several criteria before handing over your
money to a manager. In this chapter, I look at some of the vehicles you have
at your disposal to invest in the commodities markets, and I offer you hands-
on information to help you select the most suitable money manager for you.
Mutually Beneficial: Investing in
Commodity Mutual Funds
A common way for individuals to invest in commodities is through a mutual
fund. It just may be the simplest way for you to get involved in the commodi-
ties markets because you’re relying on a trained professional to do the invest-
ing on your behalf. 

80
Part II: Getting Started 
A mutual fund is a fund managed by an investment professional for the benefit
of the fund investors. Mutual funds, by definition, can only follow a specific
set of trading techniques. Mutual funds don’t engage in sophisticated trading
techniques such as arbitrage trades, special situations, long-short strategies,
or distressed asset investing. These strategies are conducted primarily by
hedge funds, which are similar to mutual funds except they can engage in
these sophisticated investment strategies. Most mutual funds follow long-only
strategies, which is an investment policy based on the buy-and-hold principle.
There are many different types of mutual funds that have nothing to do with
commodities. You can invest in stock funds, bond funds, currency funds, and
even country-specific funds. But a number of mutual funds specialize in
investing in only commodities or commodity-related products.
Plain vanilla funds are your run-of-the-mill funds. If you’ve ever invested in a
mutual fund, you should have no problems investing in these straightforward
funds. How do you get started? You write your check and purchase shares of
the mutual funds either through your broker or directly from the fund
providers, and voila! Of course, I recommend you ask a number of questions
before writing your check. I look at these qualifying questions in the following
section.
Plain vanilla funds are actively administered by a fund manager whose
responsibility is to allocate capital across various sub-asset classes in order
to maximize the fund’s returns. Generally speaking, these mutual funds invest
in commodity-linked derivative instruments such as futures contracts and
options on futures traded on the major commodity exchanges in New York,
Chicago, and elsewhere. (Make sure to read Chapter 8 for more information
on commodity exchanges.) Others may also invest in companies that process
these raw materials, such as energy companies (Chapter 14) and mining com-
panies (Chapter 18). 
Riddle me this, riddle me that: 
Asking the right questions
Before you invest in a mutual fund, you should gather as much information as
possible about the fund itself as well as about the mechanics of investing in
the fund. You can get answers to these questions directly from the fund man-
ager or the fund’s prospectus. 
Call the mutual fund company directly and ask for a prospectus. A prospectus
contains a wealth of information regarding how the fund is managed, what
strategies the fund managers use, as well as details on fees and expenses. It’s
a great way to start gathering information on a prospective fund. And best of
all, mutual funds will send you their prospectus for free!

Here are some useful questions to help you zero in on the key points of
mutual fund investing: 
 What is the fund’s investment objective? Different funds have radically
different investment objectives. While one may focus on capital gains,
another may specialize in income investing. Knowing the fund’s objective
is one of the first pieces of information to look out for. 
 What securities does the fund invest in? This may seem like a straight-
forward answer (such as commodities), but a number of funds claim
their main investment products are commodities when in reality only a
small percentage of the fund is commodities-related. I look at some of
these funds in the section “Taking a look at what’s out there.”
 Who manages the fund? You want to know as much as possible about
the individuals who are going to be managing your hard-earned money.
Most money managers in the United States have to be registered with
the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). You can get infor-
mation on the manager’s personal background by checking the NASD
Web site at www.nasdbrokercheck.com. Here are some key points to
look for: 
• Experience: How long has he been a manager?
• Track record: What kind of returns has the manager achieved for
his clients in the past?
• Disciplinary actions: Has this manager been disciplined for a past
action? If so, find out more. 
• Registrations and certifications: Does this manager have all the
required registrations with the appropriate financial authorities to
trade and invest on behalf of clients? 
 What kind of strategy does the fund use? A fund’s strategy relies on a
number of factors, including the investing style of the portfolio man-
agers, the fund’s objective, and the securities it chooses to invest in.
Some funds follow low-risk, steady income strategies, while others have
a more aggressive strategy that uses a lot of leverage. Identifying the
fund’s strategy right away is critical. 
 What is the profile of the typical investor in this fund? The fund will
cater to the profile of its investors, which can be anywhere from highly
conservative to extremely aggressive. You need to know what kind of
individual is likely to invest in this fund and determine whether your risk
tolerance squares with that of the other investors. 
 What are the main risks of investing in this fund? Whenever you invest,
you take on a certain degree of risk: interest rate risk, credit risk, risk of
loss of principal, liquidity risk, hedging risk, and geopolitical risk. For a
detailed look at a number of different risks, take a look at Chapter 4. 
81
Chapter 6: Show Me the Money! Choosing the Right Manager

 What is the fund’s track record? Although past performance does not
guarantee future results, it’s always important to examine the fund’s
track record to get a sense of the kinds of returns the managers have
achieved for their investors in the past. Most funds will post their per-
formance over a number of different years — take a look particularly at
the key periods of the past three, five, and ten years. 
 What is the fund’s after-tax performance? Be sure to pay close atten-
tion to after-tax returns when looking at historical performance because
these are a more accurate measure of the fund’s performance — and
how much money you get to keep after you pay Uncle Sam. Many funds
will advertise in big, bold charts their performance before taxes, but
these can be misleading because a significant portion of these returns
end up in the government’s coffers after taxes are taken out
 What are the fund’s fees and expenses? Fees and expenses are always
going to cut into how much money you can get out of the fund. Look for
funds that have lower expenses and fees. This information is available in
the prospectus. 
 What is the minimum capital an investor must commit? A number of
mutual funds require a minimum amount of money you have to invest in
order to participate, ranging anywhere from $500 to $10,000 or more.
The minimum requirement may also vary according to the type of
investor. Someone investing for an IRA may have to put up less money
up front than someone investing through a brokerage account. Finally,
many funds also require minimum incremental amounts after the initial
investment amount. So you could invest $1000 upfront but then be
required to increase your investment by at least $100 each subsequent
time you want to invest in the fund. 
 Are there different classes of shares? Most mutual funds offer more
than one class of shares to investors. The different classes are based on
a number of factors, including sales charges, deferred sales charges,
redemption fees, and investor availability. Make sure to examine each
class of shares closely to determine which one is best for you. 
 What are the tax implications of investing in this fund? Talk to your
accountant in order to determine the tax consequences of any invest-
ment you make. 
Like almost everything else in finance, investing in mutual funds requires
mastery of specific terminology. Here are some of these technical terms to
help you talk the talk: 
 Expense ratio: The expense ratio is the percentage of the fund’s total
assets earmarked for general operational expenses. This is the amount
used to run the fund and generally lowers total fund returns. 
82
Part II: Getting Started 

 Sales Load: Some mutual funds sell their shares through brokerage
houses and other financial intermediaries. A sales load is the commis-
sion the mutual fund pays to brokers that sell their shares to the general
public. The sales load is paid by the investor. Some funds don’t have
sales load, in which case they’re called no-load funds. 
 Sales charge: A sales charge, sometimes referred to as a deferred sales
charge, is a fee paid by the mutual fund investor when she sells her
mutual fund shares. This is also known as a back-end charge because you
pay a fee after you want to sell your shares.
 Net Asset Value (NAV): A fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV) is its total assets
minus total liabilities. Mutual funds calculate NAV on a per share basis at
the end of each trading day by dividing the difference between total
assets and liabilities by the number of shares outstanding. A mutual
fund’s NAV is similar to a publicly traded company’s stock price on a per
share basis. 
Taking a look at what’s out there
You can choose from two main commodity mutual funds: the PIMCO
Commodity Real Return Strategy Fund and the Oppenheimer Real Asset Fund. 
With over $12 Billion in assets under management, the PIMCO Commodity
Commodity Real Return Strategy Fund (PCRAX) is the largest commodity-oriented
fund in the market. Although the fund is actively managed, it seeks to broadly
mirror the performance of the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index (see Chapter 7
for the goods on this index). As such, the fund invests directly in commodity-
linked instruments such as futures contracts, forward contracts, and options on
futures. (For more on these instruments, flip on over to Chapter 9.)
Because these contracts are naturally leveraged, the fund also invests in
bonds and other fixed-income securities to act as a collateral to the commod-
ity instruments. This fund offers three classes of shares — A, B, and C — and
I encourage you to examine each class carefully in order to choose the best
one for you. For example, if you invest in Class A shares, there is a minimum
investment amount of $5000, a front load of 5.5 percent, and an expense ratio
of 1.24 percent. However, when you invest in Class B shares, there is no front
load, although there is a deferred sales charge of 5 percent and an expense
ratio of 1.99 percent.
With a little under $2 Billion in assets, the Oppenheimer Real Asset Fund
(QRAAX) is considerably smaller than the PIMCO fund. It tracks the perfor-
mance of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, an index that tracks a broad
basket of 24 commodities. (I encourage you to read Chapter 7 for more on
commodity indexes.)
83
Chapter 6: Show Me the Money! Choosing the Right Manager

With $1000 as its minimum investment requirement, Oppenheimer requires a
little less capital upfront than PIMCO’s fund. It offers five classes of shares (A,
B, C, N, and Y), Class A being the most popular among average individual
investors. Class A shares have no deferred sales charge, although they have a
front load of 5.75 percent and an expense ratio of 1.32 percent. So even
though you need less initial capital to invest in the Oppenheimer fund, it is
slightly more expensive than the PIMCO fund because of the front load
charges and its expense ratio. 
Although Oppenheimer and PIMCO offer the two most popular commodity
funds, a number of other firms are starting to offer similar products to satisfy
the growing demand from investors for funds that have wide exposure to the
commodities markets. Two newcomers to the market are the Merrill Lynch
Real Investment (MDCDX) and the Credit Suisse Commodity Return Strategy
Fund (CRSCX). As more investors seek exposure to commodities, expect
more funds of this nature to crop up in the future. This is good news because
you have more funds to choose from!
To find out more about commodity mutual funds, a very useful tool is the
Morningstar Web site (www.morningstar.com). This is an all-around excel-
lent resource for investors and includes lots of information related to com-
modity mutual funds, such as the latest news, updates, load charges, expense
ratios, and other key data. It also uses a helpful five star ratings system to
rate mutual funds.
Examining Exchange Traded Funds
Driven by a growing demand for commodities by the investor community,
many financial institutions are now offering the commodities Exchange
Traded Fund, or ETF. This new breed of fund allows you to buy into a fund
that offers the diversification inherent in a mutual fund, with the added bene-
fit of being able to trade that fund like a regular stock, giving you the power-
ful combination of diversification and liquidity.
Unlike a regular mutual fund, where the Net Asset Value is generally calcu-
lated at the end of the trading day, the ETF allows you to trade throughout
the day. Furthermore, you can go both long and short the ETF, something you
can’t do with regular mutual funds. (For more on going long and short, turn a
few pages to Chapter 9.)
The first commodity ETF in the United States was launched by Deutsche Bank
in February 2006. The Deutsche Bank Commodity Index Tracking Fund (AMEX:
DBC) is listed on the American Stock and Options Exchange (AMEX) and
tracks the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index (DBLCI). The DBLCI in turn
84
Part II: Getting Started 

tracks a basket of six liquid commodities: light sweet crude oil (35%), heating
oil (20%), gold (10%), aluminum (12.5%), corn (11.25%), and wheat (11.25%).
The DBC ETF is structured as a Commodity Pool Operator (CPO), and the
fund invests directly in commodity futures contracts. (Check out the section,
“Jumping into a commodity pool.”) In order to capture additional yields, the
energy contracts are rolled monthly, while the rest of the contracts are rolled
on an annual basis. (Chapter 9 gives you more on rolling futures contracts.)
The fund also invests in fixed income products, including the 3-month
Treasury bill. This provides an additional yield for you as an investor. With an
expense ratio of 1.5 percent, it is a reasonably priced investment. 
One of the downsides of investing in ETFs is that they can be fairly volatile
because they track derivative instruments that trade in the futures markets.
A downside of the DBC specifically is that it tracks a basket of only six com-
modities. However, more commodity ETFs are in the pipeline that will offer
even greater diversification benefits. While writing this book, a number of
ETFs that track individual commodities have launched. 
Here is a list of some of these recent commodity ETFs:
 United States Oil Fund (AMEX: USO): The Unites States Oil Fund (USO) is
an ETF that seeks to mirror the performance of the West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract on the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Although the ETF doesn’t reflect the
movement of the WTI contract tick by tick, it does a good job of broadly
mirroring its performance. It’s a good way to get exposure to crude oil
without going through the futures markets.
 streetTRACKS Gold Shares (AMEX: GLD): This ETF seeks to mirror the
performance of the price of gold on a daily basis. The fund actually
holds physical gold in vaults located in secure locations to provide
investors with the ability to get exposure to physical gold without actu-
ally hold gold bullion. 
 iShares Silver Trust (AMEX: SLV): This is the first ever ETF to track the
performance of the price of physical silver. Like the gold ETF, the silver
ETF holds actual physical silver in vaults. This is a safe way to invest in
the silver markets without going through the futures or physical markets.
Mastering MLPs
If you’re interested in investing in companies that are involved in the produc-
tion, transformation, and distribution of commodities, one of the best ways
to do so is by investing in a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). MLPs are a
great investment because of their tax advantage and high cash payouts. 
85
Chapter 6: Show Me the Money! Choosing the Right Manager

The ABCs of MLPs
MLPs are public entities that trade on public exchanges. Just like a company
issues stock on an exchange, an MLP issues shares that trade on an
exchange. You can get involved in an MLP by simply purchasing its shares on
an exchange. This is why an MLP is also called a Publicly Traded Partnership
(PTP). 
The shares that an MLP issues are called units, and investors who own these
units are known as unit holders.
Although a majority of MLPs trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a
few MLPs also trade on the Nasdaq National Market (NASDAQ) as well as on
the American Stock and Options Exchange (AMEX). Make sure to browse
through the section “The nuts and bolts of MLP investing” where I list a few
MLPs and the exchange they trade on. 
When you invest in an MLP, you are essentially investing in a public partner-
ship. This partnership is run by a General Partner for his benefit and, more
importantly, fort that of the Limited Partners (which you become when you
buy MLP units). See the following sections “General Partner” and “Limited
Partner.” 
The taxman only rings once
One of the reasons I like MLPs so much is that, unlike regular corporations,
they’re only taxed once. Many publicly traded companies are subject to
double taxation: They’re taxed at the corporate level as well as at the share-
holder (individual) level. Not so with MLPs. 
Because of congressional legislation, any MLP that derives 90 percent or more
of its income from activities related to the production, distribution, and
transformation of commodities qualifies for this tax-exempt status.
The income that an MLP uses to qualify for tax advantages is known as quali-
fying income. If an MLP is able to prove its qualifying income, it can “pass
through” its income tax-free to its shareholders, who are then responsible for
paying whatever taxes are appropriate for them. This is why MLPs are some-
times referred to as “pass through entities.” 
Curious to see how this tax advantage plays out in the real world? Suppose
you are in a 35 percent tax bracket. You invest $1 in an MLP and $1 in a 
corporation. The corporation would need to generate $2.20 of income to 
distribute $1 of after-tax profits to you. The MLP, thanks to its favorable tax
treatment, would only have to generate $1.54 of income to give you back $1 
of after-tax profits! 
86
Part II: Getting Started 

This tax status gives MLPs a competitive advantage over other publicly-
traded entities when they compete for assets. An MLP simply does not have
to generate as much cash flow as a corporation in order to distribute similar
levels of after-tax income to shareholders — and this has two possible impli-
cations. First the MLP can, if it wants, afford to overpay for an asset and still
generate healthy cash flows for its investors. Alternatively, it can purchase an
asset at a similar price from a competing corporation but generate more cash
flow to investors because of its favorable tax treatment. 
MLPs are required to distribute all available cash back to unit holders on a
quarterly basis. When you own an MLP, you receive a K1 tax form, which is
similar to the 1099 Tax Form you would receive from a corporation.
Be sure to inform your accountant of your MLP investments in advance
because most K1 Forms aren’t mailed out to shareholders until February.
This only gives you a few weeks to account for the MLP income in your taxes.
General partner
The General Partner’s (GP) main responsibility is running the MLP. The GP
isn’t always an individual. In fact, a majority of GPs are actually other corpo-
rate entities set up for the specific purpose of running the MLP. These entities
are sometimes set up in the form of corporations or Limited Liability
Companies (LLCs) and are often owned by an even larger corporation. 
Besides managing the MLP, the GP generally has a financial stake in the MLP
itself (usually 2 percent) and is eligible to receive Incentive Distribution Rights
(IDRs) based on performance. IDRs are a percentage of the total payout the GP
gets to keep after hitting specific targets. Because the raison d’être of the MLP
is to distribute cash back to its unit holders, most MLPs include incentives for
the GP if and when it distributes certain levels of cash back to the LPs.

MLP structure: The method behind the madness
Kinder Morgan is one of the largest energy
transportation and distribution companies in the
United States. The Kinder Morgan family of
companies includes three separate entities,
including its successful MLP, Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP). Kinder
Morgan’s MLP is managed by a General Partner
called Kinder Morgan Management, LLC (NYSE:
KMR), which was established to manage the
MLP. The Kinder Morgan GP is in turn owned by
an even larger entity: Kinder Morgan, Inc.
(NYSE: KMI). So the Kinder Morgan MLP (KMP)
is run by the Kinder Morgan General Partner
(KMR), which is owned by Kinder Morgan, Inc.
(KMI). If you’re scratching you’re head trying to
figure out this structure, don’t worry! Because
of regulatory, legal, and corporate reasons, the
structures of many MLPs can get pretty convo-
luted. Another reason for reading this book
before you get started!

The distribution rights that an MLP grants the General Partners are disclosed
in the MLP’s Partnership Agreement with the GP. Before investing in an MLP,
make sure you comb through the Partnership Agreement carefully to under-
stand the incentive rights granted to the GP. This is important because IDRs
have a direct impact on how much money you get to keep at the end of the
day. The most important piece of information you should look for in the
Partnership Agreement is the MLP’s IDR structure. 
In order to understand the MLP structure, you need to fully appreciate the
degree of autonomy that the GP has in running the MLP. Here are a few things
to keep in mind:
 Limited Partners have limited voting rights. 
 LPs have no say in day-to-day operations, which are carried out by the
General Partner.
 The GP often has no fiduciary duty to the LPs.
 An MLP is not required to hold annual meetings for unit holders.
Essentially, when you invest in an MLP, you are turning over the keys of the
kingdom over to the GP. The GP exercises a high degree of control over how
the MLP is run, how much cash is distributed back to the unit holders, and
the general governance matters relating to the MLP. So it’s a good idea to
thoroughly investigate the General Partner’s track record and historical per-
formance. At the end of the day, there is little you can do if you disagree with
what the GP is doing except sell your units. In this way an MLP is very differ-
ent than a corporation, where as a shareholder you can attend annual meet-
ings, issue proxy statements, and generally exercise a larger degree of
control. That said, most GPs do a good job of running MLPs because it’s in
their best financial interest to do so.
Limited partner
Although the General Partner is responsible for managing the MLP, the
Limited Partners bring in the capital that the MLP manages. In order to
become a Limited Partner in an MLP, all you have to do is purchase units of
that MLP on an exchange. (For more on how to do this, read the section
“Getting started.”) Once you purchase the MLP units, you are officially a
Limited Partner in that MLP.
As a Limited Partner, you have virtually no say in how the partnership is
managed, but you will get to participate in the MLP’s cash flow distribution,
which is probably the most important reason you want to own MLP units in
the first place. 
88
Part II: Getting Started 

When you purchase MLP units, you can make money from two sources: quar-
terly cash flow distributions and appreciation of the unit price. Because units
are publicly traded, they may appreciate in value as the Partnership expands
and grows over time. In addition, because the MLP is obligated to distribute
all available cash back to its unit holders on a quarterly basis, your units gen-
erate you quarterly income as well. 
As a matter of fact, the MLP yields (the amount of cash distributed back to
shareholders) are among the highest of any asset class, with an average yield
of 6 percent. Some MLPs actually have yields as high as 10 percent! MLP
yields are similar to stock dividends, except they are slightly more advanta-
geous thanks to the favorable tax treatment they enjoy. (More on that in the
following section.) 
The biggest drawback of being an LP is that you don’t get to make any deci-
sions about where the Partnership is heading. You essentially transfer power
over to the GP who makes all operational decisions. However, because cer-
tain incentives built into the MLP agreement, it is in the GP’s own self-interest
to make sure that the MLP generates as much cash flow as possible. 
Cash flow is king
The reason MLPs exist in the first place is to distribute all available cash back
to the MLP unit holders, which has to be done on a quarterly basis. The
amount of cash distributed to each investor is determined by a number of
factors:
 How many units the investors hold
 The Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs) created for the GP
 The difference between distributable and discretionary cash flow 
The GP is responsible for distributing cash back to the LPs proportionally to
their holdings. In other words, an investor who owns 1000 units will get twice
as much cash as an investor who owns 500 units in the same MLP. (But
remember, this doesn’t mean that the investor with the greater number of
units gets to keep all of that cash — she still has to pay taxes on this income
based on her tax profile.) 
In order to promote the GP’s efforts to increase cash flow for shareholders,
many MLPs include incentives for the GP. Generally speaking, the more cash
flow the GP generates back to shareholders, the more cash she gets to keep.
89
Chapter 6: Show Me the Money! Choosing the Right Manager

Although IDRs are different for each MLP, they are always based on a tier
system. A typical IDR incentive structure for GPs increases the distribution
rate to unit holders, as shown in the following table:
Distribution Tier
Dollar Distribution
LP Payout
GP Participation
Tier 1
$0.50
98%
2%
Tier 2
$1.00
85%
15%
Tier 3
$1.50
75%
25%
Tier 4
$2.00
50%
50%
Using this tier distribution system, if the GP generates $1.00 of cash flow per
unit (Tier 2), the LP would get $0.85 and the GP $0.15 of that dollar. However,
if the GP is able to generate $2.00 of cash flow per unit (Tier 4), he would get
to keep 50 percent of that amount, or $1.00; the LP would get a smaller per-
centage amount (50 percent down from 85 percent) but would get a higher
cash payout ($1.00) than other tiers. The GP is thus encouraged to generate
as much cash flow back because he gets a higher cut of the profits. This is
the incentive behind this elegant and sophisticated tiered distribution
system. 
The distribution of cash flow is known as splits because the LPs split their
share of cash flow with the GP. Tier 4, where the GP participates on equal
footing with the LPs, is known as a high split.
It is therefore in the best interest of the GP to maximize the cash flow to the
investor. This is important because the GP has a lot of discretion over how
much of the available cash is actually redistributed to shareholders and how
much will be used for operations related to the MLP — the difference
between distributable cash flow and discretionary cash flow. 
Distributable cash flow
As its name implies, distributable cash flow describes the amount of cash that
is available to redistribute to shareholders. Generally speaking, most MLPs
calculate distributable cash flow using the following formula:
MLP Distributable Cash Flow = 
Income + (Depreciation and Amortization) – Capital Expenditures
This is the cash available to all members of the MLP, including both the GP
and the LP. To calculate how much cash is distributed back to the LPs only,
use the following formula:
LP Distributable Cash Flow =
Income + (Depreciation and Amortization) – Capital Expenditures – GP
Distribution
90
Part II: Getting Started 

This takes into account the cash flow participation of the GP and is a more
accurate indicator of how much cash will flow back to the regular investors —
the LPs. 
Discretionary cash flow
The GP has a lot of discretion over how much cash flow is distributed to share-
holders. Although he could theoretically distribute all available cash flow back
to shareholders, it’s unlikely he would do so because the GP has to have cash
to operate the MLP. He may need to have some cash handy to finance growth
projects, acquisitions, or other investments. This cash is known as discre-
tionary cash flow and — like the name implies — the GP can use it at his discre-
tion. While distributable cash flow is a measure of how much cash could
theoretically be distributed back, actual cash flow is calculated by factoring in
discretionary cash flow. This simple equation gives you a more accurate way to
calculate how much money you’ll end up with in the end:
Actual Cash Flow = Distributable Cash Flow – Discretionary Cash Flow
This is the difference between how much can be paid and how much is actually
paid.
The nuts and bolts of MLP investing
So how do you actually go about investing in an MLP? It’s quite simple, really.
Because MLPs are publicly traded, you can purchase any of them on the
exchange on which it’s traded by calling your broker to purchase MLP units
or by buying them through an online trading account, if you have one. Either
way, buying MLP units is as simple as buying stocks.
In Table 6-1, I list some MLPs along with the exchange they’re traded on.

Chapter 6: Show Me the Money! Choosing the Right Manager

Although a majority of MLPs in the United States trade on the NYSE, a few
trade on the NASDAQ as well as the AMEX.
For a complete list of MLPs, check out the Web site www.ptpcoalition.org.
Although this is a lobbying group for the industry, the site includes a com-
plete listing of all available MLPs. I also recommend checking whether your
brokerage firm has published any research on MLPs you’re interested in. 
About 50 MLPs are publicly traded in the United States; out of these, 40 are
involved in the energy industry, with a focus on storage terminals,
pipelines/transportation, refining, and distribution. Remember, MLPs invest
in these assets because 90 percent of their income must be from infrastruc-
ture related to the production and distribution of commodities for them to be
exempt from double taxation. In addition, many MLPs invest in pipelines and
other energy infrastructure because these offer steady cash flow streams,
which can then be distributed back to shareholders. 
Before you invest in an MLP, ask your broker the following questions:
 What’s the historical payout?
 How much is cash flow?
 What is the GP’s IDR?
 What are the operational activities? 
 How much assets are under management?
Heads Up! Risk and MLPs
Investing in MLPs comes with a number of risks. Here’s a quick list of some of
those risks — so that you don’t come upon any surprises when you get your
K1 tax form in February: 
 Management risk: Because as a Limited Partner you have no say in the
way the business is run, you’re essentially handing over control to the
General Partner to manage the MLP as he or she sees fit. If you are not
satisfied with the GP’s performance, there’s really not much you can do
about it except to withdraw your money from the MLP.
 Environmental risk: Many MLPs operate sophisticated infrastructures
such as pipelines and drilling rigs, which are often vulnerable to natural
disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Any of these could have a
negative impact on your bottom line. 
92
Part II: Getting Started 

 Terrorism risk: MLPs’ assets often include sensitive infrastructures that
may be vulnerable to a terrorist attack. 
 Liquidity risk: Because the MLP market is still fairly small compared to
other assets such as stocks and bonds, you may face liquidity issues
should you wish to dispose of your units. Until liquidity increases in the
MLP market, you risk not finding a buyer for your units. 
These are a few of the risks associated with MLPs, which is still a growing
market. However, because of the beneficial structure and scope of operations
of these entities, I believe they have a place in any diversified portfolio. 
Relying on a Commodity Trading Advisor
If you’re interested in investing in commodities through the futures markets
or on a commodity exchange, getting the help of a trained professional to
guide you down this path is always a good idea. One option is to hire the services
of a Commodity Trading Advisor, or CTA. The CTA is like a traditional stock-
broker who specializes in the futures markets, and she can help you open a
futures account, trade futures contracts, and develop an investment strategy
based on your personal financial profile. 
CTAs have to pass a rigorous financial, trading, and portfolio management
exam called the Series 3. Administered by the National Association of
Securities Dealers (NASD), this exam tests the candidate’s knowledge of the
commodities markets inside and out. By virtue of passing this exam and
working at a commodities firm, most CTAs have a good fundamental under-
standing of the futures markets. CTAs are also licensed by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and registered with the National Futures
Association (NFA). 
Here are a few resources I’ve used and have found helpful in finding the right
CTAs: 
 www.autumngold.com
 www.barclaygrp.com
 www.iasg.com
Each CTA has his own investment approach and trading philosophy. Before
you select a CTA, find out about their investment style to see whether it
squares with your investment goals. You also have to decide how much of a
role you want the CTA to play in your investment life. Do you want someone
to actively manage your funds or simply want someone who will provide you
with advice? 
93
Chapter 6: Show Me the Money! Choosing the Right Manager

In order to answer these questions, you must first decide how involved you
want to be in running your portfolio. If you’re a hands-on kind of investor
with free time to invest, you could consider investing on your own but keep-
ing a CTA close by to answer any questions you may have. 
If, on the other hand, you don’t have a lot of time or in-depth knowledge of
commodities and would prefer the CTA to manage your funds for you, then
ask yourself a few questions to determine which CTA is right for you. 
Here are some points you may want to consider when looking for a CTA:
 Track Record: Web sites like Autumngold.com and IASG.com rank
CTAs by their historical track record. I recommend you take a look at the
longest historical track record, which is the annualized return since the
CTA began trading. However, it can also be useful to look at one, three,
or six months returns as well as one, three, and five year annualized
returns. 
 Disciplinary Actions: The National Futures Association (NFA) main-
tains a comprehensive database of all registered CTAs, including a
record of any disciplinary action the CTA may have faced. Make sure
that the CTA you’re going to be doing business with has a clean record.
The NFA database that tracks CTAs is called Background Affiliation 
Status Information Center (BASIC), and you can access it through the NFA
Web site at www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet. An additional resource
is the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), which also
maintains a comprehensive database of CTAs and other securities 
professionals. You can order a report on a CTA from the NASD by going
to www.nasdbrokercheck.com. 
 Management Fee: A majority of CTAs, like most money managers,
charge you a flat management fee. The industry average is 2 percent
although some CTAs, depending on their track record — may charge you
higher management fees. These fees generally go towards operational
expenses: paying employees, taking care of rent, mailing and printing
marketing material, running a trading platform, maintaining a 1-800
number, and so on. 
 Performance Fee: Although a large portion of the management fee goes
towards running the CTA’s business, the performance fee provides an
incentive for the CTA to generate the highest returns possible. This is
the CTA’s bread and butter. Again, performance fees differ from CTA to
CTA, although I’ve found that 20 percent seems to be a benchmark for
most CTAs. Some CTAs with good track records may have higher perfor-
mance fees in place, in which case you want to compare historical and
actual returns among different CTAs to find the one with the highest dis-
tribution back to investors. However, if the CTA doesn’t reach certain
levels, then she does not get any performance fee. In other words, the
CTA will only be rewarded for good performance. If she doesn’t hit her
numbers, then she won’t get to participate in the profits. 
94
Part II: Getting Started 

 Miscellaneous Fees: Watch out for these fees because they can add up
really quickly — just like the miscellaneous fees you get on your cell
phone bill. Ever opened up your phone bill and found that miscella-
neous fees have increased your bill by 10 or 15 percent or higher? Your
CTA may charge you for such items such as handling express mail deliv-
eries, check and wiring fees, night desk charges (a fee you pay if the CTA
trades your account after trading hours), and maintenance fees. For
example, if you don’t maintain a minimum amount in your account —
such as $500 — you will be charged a fee! 
 Margin Requirements: If you decide to open a margin account (as
opposed to a cash account), you are able to borrow money from your
CTA to purchase securities. Buying on margin provides you with a lot of
leverage (both on the upside but also on the downside), so knowing the
details of the margin requirement is absolutely critical. (For more on
using margin, take a look at Chapter 3.) 
 Minimum Investment Requirement: Many CTAs require that you invest
a minimum amount of money with them. This can be as low as $1000 and
as high as $200,000. I recommend that if you’re going to invest with a
CTA, you invest no more than 5 to 10 percent of your investing capital
with them. This will help you diversify your holding to include managed
futures, but this won’t come back to haunt you should the CTA perform
badly. (For more on how to construct a balanced, diversified portfolio,
flip to Chapter 5.) 
Jumping into a Commodity Pool
Another way you can get access to the commodities futures markets is by
joining a commodity pool. As its name suggests, it is a pool of funds that
trades in the commodities futures markets. The commodity pool is managed
and operated by a designated Commodity Pool Operator (CPO) who is
licensed with the NFA and registered with the CFTC. All investors share in the
profits (and losses) of the commodity pool based on how much capital
they’ve contributed to the pool. 
Investing in a commodity pool has two main advantages over opening an indi-
vidual trading account with a CTA. First, because you’re joining a pool with a
number of different investors, your purchasing power increases significantly.
You get a lot more leverage and diversification if you’re trading a $1 Million
account as opposed to a $10,000 account. 
The second benefit, which may not seem obvious at first, is that commodity
pools tend to be structured as limited partnerships. This means that, as an
investor with a stake in the pool, the most you can lose is the principal you
invested in the first place. Losing your entire principal may seem like a bad
deal, but for the futures markets this is pretty good! 
95
Chapter 6: Show Me the Money! Choosing the Right Manager

Let me explain. With an individual account, you are able purchase securities
on margin. That means you can borrow funds in order to buy futures con-
tracts. What happens if the position you entered into with the borrowed
funds does the opposite of what you expected it to? Now not only have you
lost your principal, but you also have to pay back your broker, who lent you
the money to open the position. This means that you lose your principal and
you still owe money, which is known as a margin call.
Now because commodity pools are registered as limited partnerships, even if
the fund uses leverage to buy securities and the fund gets a margin call, you
are not responsible for that margin call. Hence, the (only) capital you risk is
your principal! Of course, you want to perform due diligence on the CPO to
make sure that the likelihood that the pool will go bust is as small as possible! 
A good place to start looking for commodity pools is the Web site www.

ndexes are useful tools in the world of investing. If the act of investing
were similar to driving a car, the index would be the equivalent of the
speedometer — it tells you how fast the car (or the market) is going. Indexes
exist for all sorts of assets: You have indexes that track the top 30 blue-chip
companies in the United States (Dow Jones Industrial Average) and the 500
largest companies (S&P 500), just to name a couple. 
If you want to measure the performance of commodities, you also have at
your disposal indexes whose function is to track baskets of commodities.
These commodity indexes can be useful for two reasons. First, you can use
them as market indicators, which allows you to gauge where the commodity
markets are trading as a whole. Second, because most indexes are tradable
instruments (through Exchange Traded Funds and other investment vehi-
cles), you can profit by investing directly in the index. 
In this chapter, I give you the goods on commodity indexes and show you
how to profit by using these powerful tools. 

98
Part II: Getting Started 
Checking Out Commodity Indexes
A commodity index tracks the price of a futures contract of an underlying
physical commodity on a designated exchange. When you invest through one
of the commodity indexes I present in this chapter, you are actually investing
in the futures markets. (For more on futures contracts please read Chapter 9.) 
Indexes are known as passive, long-only investments because no one is
actively trading the index, and the index only tracks the long performance of
a commodity. It doesn’t track commodities that are short (a sophisticated
strategy meant to profit when prices go down). For more on long and short
positions, refer to Chapter 9. 
Is it “indexes” or “indices”? I use the plural form “indexes” because that’s the
more traditional way to refer to an index in the plural. You may also run into
“indices” as a plural form for index. Dow Jones, which has its own commodity
index, spells the plural form of index as “indexes.” On the other hand,
Standard & Poor’s, which also has a commodity index, spells the plural form
as “indices.” At the end of the day, “indexes” and “indices” refer to the same
thing! 
What’s the use of an index?
Using commodity indexes is a good way to determine where the commodity
markets are heading. Just like stock indexes allow you to identify broad
market movements (which allows you to implement and update your invest-
ment strategy accordingly), commodity indexes provide you with a way to
measure the broad movements of the commodities markets. 
In essence, a commodity index gives you a snapshot of the current state of
the commodities market. This means you can use an index in one of three
ways:
 Benchmark: You can use a commodity index to compare the perfor-
mance of commodities as an asset class with the performance of other
asset classes, such as stocks and bonds. 
 Indicator: You can use the commodity index as an indicator of economic
activity, possible inflationary pressures, and as a measure of the state of
global economic production. 
 Investment vehicle: Because a commodity index tracks the performance
of specific futures contracts, you can replicate the performance of the
index by trading the contracts it tracks. You can invest both directly
(buying the contracts) and indirectly (mutual funds) in a commodity
index, which I discuss in depth in the following section. 

So how do I make money using an index?
You have a number of methods at your disposal to invest through a commod-
ity index. There are five widely followed commodity indexes to choose from
(which I cover in the section “Cataloguing the Indexes”), and each one can be
tracked and traded in different ways. 
Here are a few ways you can invest through a commodity index:
 Owning the futures contracts: One of the most direct ways of tracking
the performance of an index is to own the contracts the index tracks. In
order to do this, you must have a futures account. (Please refer to
Chapter 6 to find out how to open a futures account.) 
 Investing with a third party manager: A number of money managers
use commodity indexes as the basis of their investment strategy. Some
of these vehicles include mutual funds, commodity pools, and commod-
ity trading advisors. (For more on selecting the right manager, make sure
you read Chapter 6.)
 Owning futures contracts of the index: A few commodity indexes have
futures contracts that track their performance. When you buy the futures
contract of the index, it’s similar to buying all the commodity futures con-
tracts the index trades!
 Exchange Traded Funds: ETFs, as they’re known on Wall Street, are a
fairly new breed of investments that track the performance of a fund
through the convenience of trading a stock. This is a popular alternative
for folks who don’t want to trade futures. (Make sure to explore the ben-
efits and drawbacks of ETFs in Chapter 6.) 
I’ve listed only a few ways you can get exposure to commodity indexes. As
commodities become more popular with the investing community, expect to
see more ways to get access to indexes. To keep track of all the new develop-
ments in index investing, make sure to keep checking my Web site at

From Head to Toes: Anatomy 
of a Commodity Index
As an investor interested in making money through index investing, you have
five commodity indexes at your disposal. Although the composition and
structure of every index is different, their aim is the same — to track a basket
of commodities. Before you get into the specific commodity indexes, here are
some things you should look out for when you’re shopping for an index:
99
Chapter 7: Track and Trade: Investing through Commodity Indexes

 Components: Each index follows a specific methodology to determine
which commodities are part of the index. Some indexes such as the GSCI
(see the following section) include commodities based on their global
production value; others such as the DBLCI include commodities based
on their liquidity and representational value of a component class: For
example, picking gold to represent metals and oil as a representative of
the energy market. 
 Weightings: Some indexes follow a production-weighted methodology,
where weights are assigned to each commodity based on its propor-
tional production in the world. Other indexes choose component weight-
ings based on the liquidity of the commodity’s futures contract. In
addition, some weightings are fixed over a predetermined period of time,
while others fluctuate to reflect changes in actual production values. 
 Rolling methodology: Because the index’s purpose is to track the per-
formance of commodities and not take actual delivery of the commodity,
the futures contracts that the index tracks must be rolled over from the
current month contract to the front month contract (the upcoming trading
month). Because this rolling process provides a roll yield (a yield that
results from the price differential between the current and front
months), you should examine each index’s policy on rolling. You can
find this information in the index brochure. 
 Rebalancing features: Every index reviews its components and their
weightings on a regular basis in order to maintain an index that reflects
actual values in the global commodities markets. While some indexes
rebalance annually, others rebalance more frequently. Before you invest
in an index, find out when it is rebalanced and what methodology it uses
to rebalance.
Although each index is constructed differently, all indexes have to follow cer-
tain criteria to determine whether a commodity will be included in the index: 
 Tradability: The commodities have to be traded on a designated
exchange and have a futures contract assigned to them. Steel, for exam-
ple, while a crucial commodity, is not represented by an index because
there are no futures contracts for steel. 
 Deliverability: The contracts that go into the index must be for an
underlying commodity that has the potential to be delivered. This elimi-
nates the inclusion of futures contracts that represent financial instru-
ments such as economic indicators, interest rates, and other
“financials.” 
 Liquidity: The market for the underlying commodity has to be liquid
enough to allow investors to move in and out of their positions without
facing liquidity crunches, such as not being able to find a buyer or seller.

Cataloguing the Indexes
In the following sections, I go through each of the five major commodity
indexes you can invest in. Each one is unique, so you’ll be sure to find one
that best suits your needs. 
Goldman Sachs Commodity Index
The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) is one of the most closely
watched indexes in the market. Launched in 1992 by the investment bank of
the same name, it tracks the performance of 24 commodity futures contracts.
The GSCI is the most heavily tracked index. As of 2006, investors poured $50
Billion to track the GSCI. 
The GSCI is a production-weighted index because it assigns different weights
to different commodities proportional to their current global production
quantity, a method known as global production weighting. As such, crude oil is
assigned more weight than cocoa in the index because this reflects actual
world production figures — there’s a lot more crude oil produced in the
world than cocoa. 
In order to calculate the contract production weight of each commodity (the
percentage a commodity assigned to the index), the GSCI takes the average of
that commodity’s global production over the previous five years. The main
advantage of using a five-year average as opposed to a one-year average is
that the former takes into account any statistical aberrations related to the
production of the specific commodity. For example, if a natural disaster
affected the production of a particular commodity during one year, the five-
year average would reflect that change but still maintain a heavy weighting
on that commodity because that event was an aberration. 
In Figure 7-1, I list the main component classes that the GSCI tracks.
Notice that the bulk of the GSCI is tied to energy contracts because global
commodity production is dominated by energy products. 
The GSCI is currently overweight energy, but this does not mean that this
won’t change in the future. If energy production decreases on a global scale,
the index will reflect this change. The index reviews its weightings on an
annual basis, reassigning weights to the index in January, so this weighting is
likely to change year after year. 
101
Chapter 7: Track and Trade: Investing through Commodity Indexes

Table 7-1 lists the actual commodity futures contracts that make up the GSCI
along with their correspondent weighting in the index. I also list the exchange
on which they trade in case you want to purchase these contracts.

Because futures contracts have an expiration date, they must be rolled on a
regular basis. Contracts such as the crude oil futures are rolled on a monthly
basis because they expire every month. However, some contracts only have
contract expiration dates during certain months of the year. (I discuss
monthly contract tradability in Chapter 9.) These contracts, such as the con-
tracts for cotton or gold, are rolled according to the available monthly con-
tract trade. 
The GSCI has a futures contract that tracks the index’s performance. You can
buy this contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). If you have a
futures trading account (you can find out how to open one in Chapter 6), you
can simply buy this contract to get direct access to the GSCI. The ticker
symbol for the GSCI on the CME is GI. 
103
Chapter 7: Track and Trade: Investing through Commodity Indexes

Another way to access the GSCI is to invest in a managed fund that tracks its
performance. One such fund is the Oppenheimer Real Asset Fund (which I
discuss in Chapter 6). The Oppenheimer fund mirrors the performance of the
GSCI. However, as a general rule, managed funds don’t identically replicate
the performance of an index because you have to take into consideration
external factors such as loads, management fees, and other expenses related
to the management of the fund. 
Reuters/Jefferies Commodity 
Research Bureau Index
Created in 1957 as the Commodity Research Bureau’s official commodity
tracking index, this index is the oldest commodity index in the world. The
original index received its most recent makeover in 2005 when it was
renamed the Reuters/Jefferies Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB) —
quite a mouthful, isn’t it! 
The CRB index is widely followed by institutional investors and economists;
out of all the indexes, it is perhaps the most widely used as an economic
benchmark, although the GSCI and the DJ/AIGCI (introduced in the next sec-
tion) are also widely used as references. 
The CRB index has performed well since 2002. Table 7-2 lists the total annual
returns of the CRB index.

you can see in Figure 7-2.

Part II: Getting Started 

The CRB Index currently tracks a basket of 19 commodities, which are
selected based on their liquidity and production value. This index is quite
unique because it is the only index that uses a tiered methodology of distribut-
ing weights to commodities. This hybrid approach gives a production value
weight to energy products while assigning fixed weights to other commodi-
ties. The components and their weightings are reviewed on an annual basis. I
list the index tiers along with the commodities the index tracks in Table 7-3.

Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index
With approximately $25 Billion tracking it (2006 figures), the Dow Jones-AIG
Commodity Index (DJ-AIGCI) is one of the most widely followed indexes in the
market. The DJ-AIGCI places a premium on liquidity but also chooses com-
modities based on their production value. 
The DJ-AIGCI is one of the few indexes that places a floor and ceiling on indi-
vidual commodities and component classes. For example, no component
class (such as energy or metals) is allowed to account for more than 33 per-
cent of the index weighting. Another rule is that no single commodity may
make up less than 2 percent of the index’s total weighting. The DJ-AIGCI fol-
lows these rules in order to ensure that all commodities are well represented
while at the same time making sure that no commodity or component class
dominates the index. 
I list in Figure 7-3 the component classes of the DJ-AIGCI.
106

The component weightings are rebalanced on an annual basis. Currently the
index tracks a group of 19 publicly traded commodities, which I list in Table 7-4.

One way to access the commodities listed in the DJ-AIGCI is by investing in a
mutual fund that tracks it. You’re in luck because one of the largest commod-
ity mutual funds, the PIMCO Commodity Real Return Fund, uses the DJ-AIGCI
as its benchmark. Therefore you get a very high correlation between the per-
formance of the index with that of the fund. Make sure to take a look at
Chapter 6 where I present the PIMCO fund. 
Another way to access the DJ-AIGCI is through the Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT). The CBOT offers a futures contract that tracks the performance of
the DJ-AIGCI. This is very similar to the GSCI contract on the CME. The ticker
symbol for the DJ-AIGCI on the CBOT is AI. 
Rogers International Commodities Index
With a grand total of 35 listed commodities, the Rogers International
Commodities Index (RICI) tracks the most commodities among the different
indexes. The RICI is the brainchild of famed commodities investor Jim
Rogers, who launched the index in order to achieve the widest exposure to
commodities. 
The RICI, like the other commodity indexes, includes traditional commodities
such as crude oil, natural gas, and silver. However, it also includes some of
the most exotic commodities you can think of, such as silk and adzuki beans!
If you’re looking for the broadest exposure to commodities, the RICI is proba-
bly your best bet. 
108
Part II: Getting Started 

The RICI was launched in 1998 and has performed extremely well. Between
1998 and 2006 its total return was 265.58 percent.
The RICI is a production-weighted index, assigning weightings to component
classes based on their actual global production value and rebalancing the index
every December. I list the main component classes of the RICI in Figure 7-4.
I list the RICI components and their index weighting in Table 7-5.

If you want to invest in the RICI, you can do so through the RICI TRAKRS
offered by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). TRAKRS (pronounced
trackers) are similar to futures contracts offered by the CME. To trade the
RICI TRAKRS on the CME, use the ticker symbol RCI. 
Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index
Launched in 2003 by Deutsche Bank, the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity
Index (DBLCI) is the new kid on the index block and has the most distinct
approach to tracking commodity futures contracts among all the commodity
indexes. The DBLCI tracks just six commodity contracts: two in energy, two
in metals, and two in agricultural products. Figure 7-5 shows the weighting of
each of these component classes. 
The weighting of the DBLCI is done at the end of the year and it seeks to
reflect global production values. Hence, like the other production-weighted
indexes (such as the GSCI), it’s also overweight energy because this reflects
the current production values in the world. 
Table 7-6 lists the commodities that make up the component classes of the
DBLCI.

With so few underlying commodities, you may be asking yourself whether the
DBLCI offers a broad and diverse enough exposure to the commodities mar-
kets. One of the advantages of the DBLCI is that it chooses only the most
liquid and representative commodities in their respective component classes. 
For example, the WTI Crude Oil contract is indicative of where the energy
complex is moving. So instead of including unleaded gas, propane, natural
gas, and other energy contracts, the DBLCI relies on WTI as a benchmark to
achieve representation in the energy market as a whole. This is a unique
approach in the world of commodity indexes that has its merits because the
index is able to track the commodities markets by only monitoring the per-
formance of a small number of commodities. This “less is more” approach is
also helpful for individual investors who prefer to track indexes by buying
the index contracts: Instead of buying 19 contracts, you only have to buy six
contracts to mirror the index’s performance. 
The energy contracts of the DBLCI are rolled on a monthly basis, while the
metal and agricultural contracts are rolled on an annual basis. 
The DBLCI is the first commodity index to have its performance tracked by
an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). You can buy the ETF that will provide you
with exposure to the DBLCI on the American Stock and Options Exchange
(AMEX). This fund, whose ticker symbol is DBC, is also managed by Deutsche
Bank. I discuss this ETF in depth in Chapter 6. 
112
Part II: Getting Started 

Which Index Should You Use?
With so many indexes to choose from, how do you decide which one to
follow? Generally speaking, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) is
the most tracked index in the market — the one that has the most funds fol-
lowing, or tracking, its performance. As of 2006, over $55 Billion in assets
track its performance, and this number is growing monthly. It is pretty popu-
lar with institutional and, increasingly, individual investors. It is perhaps the
easiest one to follow because you can track it by investing through the
Oppenheimer Real Asset Fund as well as through the GSCI futures contracts
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). 
Although the GSCI is the most widely tracked index, the most closely watched
index (there is a difference) is the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index. The CRB
Index is used as a global benchmark for what the commodities markets are
doing. As such it is the equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the
commodity world. When investors want to gauge where the commodity mar-
kets are heading, they usually turn to the CRB Index. In addition, when ana-
lysts or journalists discuss the performance of the commodities markets,
they usually make reference to the CRB Index. 
For investors who don’t trade futures or don’t feel comfortable investing in
an index through a mutual fund, you can always choose to invest in an index
through ETFs, which offer the convenience of trading complex financial
instruments with the ease of trading stocks. Currently, the DBLCI is the only
index tracked by an ETF, the DBC. Buying the DBC is as simple as logging into
your brokerage account or calling your broker and placing an order for the
number of DBC units you want to purchase. An ETF is in the works to track
the GSCI, and I expect to see more ETFs that track these commodity indexes
as more investors seek to get access to this area of the market.

Understanding How Commodities
Exchanges Work
In This Chapter
 Realizing the importance of commodity exchanges
 Investigating exchanges around the world
 Placing orders at the exchange
 Investing in exchanges
T
he first commodity exchanges appeared in the United States during the
1800s, and their role was to match buyers and sellers interested in
acquiring and selling commodities. The first traded commodities included
wheat, butter, milk, cheese, and other agricultural products. Commodity
exchanges soon evolved from simple places of commerce to highly regulated
marketplaces where prices were established for all sorts of commodities. 
The first image that usually comes to mind when you think of a commodity
exchange is a group of brokers standing in a large circle, wearing bright-colored
jackets, and shouting at each other while making funny gestures. If you’ve ever
visited or seen television footage of a commodity exchange, you’ve probably
wondered what all the fuss was about. Why are these guys yelling? What are
they saying? Can anyone actually hear anything down there anyway? 
Behind all this apparent chaos is a very rational, efficient, and orderly
process that is responsible for setting global benchmark prices for the
world’s most important commodities. The prices established in the
exchanges have a direct impact on our lives, from the price we pay to fill our
gas tanks to how much we pay to heat our homes. 
In this chapter, I give you a tour of a typical commodity exchange, explain to
you the role that exchanges play in global capital markets, and introduce you
to some of the players who are part of this fascinating world. I also examine
some of the products traded on the exchanges and show you how you can
get involved in the buying and selling of exchange-traded commodities. 

Why Do We Have Commodities
Exchanges, Anyway?
Whether you are an individual seeking to hedge commodity prices for the
future or an investor interested in capturing price discrepancies and fluctua-
tions in the global commodity markets, the commodity exchange will help
you achieve your goals. 
Commodity exchanges provide investors and traders with the opportunity to
invest in commodities by trading futures contracts, options on futures, and
other derivative products. (See Chapter 9 for more on these products.) By
their very nature, these products are extremely sophisticated financial instru-
ments used by only the savviest investors and the most experienced traders. 
Although independent traders, like you and me, can and do trade the futures
markets, the majority of players in the futures markets are large commercial
entities who use the futures markets for price hedging purposes. For exam-
ple, Hershey Foods Corporation is an active participant in cocoa futures
because it wants to hedge against the price risk of cocoa, a primary input for
making its chocolates. If you decide to trade cocoa futures contracts (cov-
ered in Chapter 19), you should remember that you’re up against some large
and experienced market players. 
At the end of the day, the commodity futures exchanges are your gateway to
the futures markets; in fact, they are the commodity futures markets.
However, because of the fierce competition in these markets and because of
the complexity of exchange traded products, you should only trade directly
in the commodity futures markets if you have an iron clad grasp of the tech-
nical aspects of the markets and have a rock solid understanding of the
market fundamentals. If you don’t have either, I would recommend staying
out of these markets because you could be subjecting yourself to disastrous
losses. That said, you can hire a trained professional with experience trading
commodity futures to do the trading for you, which I cover in the following
sections and also in depth in Chapter 6. 
Commodity futures exchanges serve a very important role in establishing
global benchmark prices for crucial commodities such as crude oil, gold,
copper, orange juice, and coffee. The exchanges are crucial for both producers
and consumers of commodities. Producers, who use commodities as inputs
to create finished goods, want to shelter themselves from the daily fluctuations
of global commodity prices. Producers may use the commodity exchange 
to lock in prices for these raw materials for fixed periods of time using
futures contracts (more on these in Chapter 9). This process is known as
hedging. Similarly, traders may use the commodity exchange to profit from
these fluctuations. This is sometimes known as speculation. 
116
Part II: Getting Started 

Whether you are an individual seeking to hedge commodity prices for the
future or an investor interested in capturing price discrepancies and fluctua-
tions in the global commodity markets, the commodity exchange will help
you achieve your goals. There are a number of commodity exchanges operat-
ing worldwide, which specialize in all sorts of commodities. In the following
sections, I identify the major commodity exchanges and list the commodities
traded in them. 
Identifying the Major Commodity
Exchanges
A number of commodity exchanges operate worldwide and specialize in all
sorts of commodities. Although you have some overlap among some of the
commodities the exchanges offer — for example gold contracts are traded on
both the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT) — most exchanges offer unique contracts. As such, every
exchange specializes in certain commodities. For instance, the NYMEX
focuses on providing investors with products to trade energy and metals; it
has contracts for crude oil, propane, and heating oil as well as gold, silver,
and palladium. 
The New York Board of Trade (NYBOT), on the other hand, focuses primarily on
tropical or “soft” commodities such as coffee, cocoa, sugar, and frozen concen-
trated orange juice (covered in Chapter 19). The Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME) offers a wide range of products but specializes in livestock, offering con-
tracts for live cattle, feeder cattle, lean hogs, and frozen pork bellies. 
Most commodities in the United States are only traded on one exchange. The
feeder cattle contract is only traded on the CME, and frozen concentrated
orange juice is only traded on the NYBOT. However, certain commodities are
traded on more than one exchange. For example, the WTI crude oil contract
is traded on both the NYMEX and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). In this
case, you want to trade the most liquid market. You can find out where the
most liquid market for a commodity is by consulting the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC), which keeps information on all the exchanges
and their products. I discuss the CFTC and other market regulatory organiza-
tions in this section as well. 
The main commodity exchanges in the United States are located in New York
and Chicago, with a few other exchanges in other parts of the country. In
Table 8-1, I list the major commodity exchanges in the United States along
with the commodities traded in each one.

* The Intercontinental Exchange is one of the only exchanges without a physical trading floor —

exchanges.
Note: This is only a small sampling of the commodities that these exchanges offer. The CME, for
example, offers over 100 futures products that track everything from milk and feeder cattle to non-
farm payrolls and currencies. I recommend visiting the exchange websites for a comprehensive
listing of their product offerings.

Part II: Getting Started 
Fighting back fraud
The first contracts began trading on U.S. com-
modity exchanges in the middle of the 19th cen-
tury. In the early part of the 20th century, the U.S.
government decided that these exchanges
should be regulated in order to prevent market
fraud and abuse. So in 1936, Congress passed
the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), providing
federal oversight and regulation of all commod-
ity exchanges operating in the United States. In
2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures
Modernization Act (CFMA) to overhaul the CEA
and adapt it to the modern financial marketplace.

The technical name for a commodity exchange is Designated Contract Market
(DCM). DCM is a designation handed by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) to exchanges that offer commodity products to the
public. (More on the CFTC in the following section.) 
If an exchange does not have the designation DCM, stay away from it! 
Commodity exchanges are responsible for setting global benchmark prices for
some of the world’s most important commodities. As a result, the amount of
liquidity they generate is enormous. For example, more than $1.5 Trillion worth
of contracts are traded in the commodity exchanges mentioned previously —
each day! 
Although the bulk of commodity trading is done in the United States — the
largest consumer market of commodities — there are commodity exchanges
located in other countries. If you’re in the United States, you may want to
consider investing in overseas exchanges for liquidity purposes. For example,
aluminum futures contracts are offered on both the American NYMEX as well
as the British London Metal Exchange (LME). However, the aluminum contract
in the LME is more liquid, so you could get a better price by buying aluminum
contracts in London as opposed to New York. In Table 8-2, I list some of these
international commodity exchanges. 
119
Chapter 8: Understanding How Commodities Exchanges Work
It’s a crude world: Reading between the lines
Have you ever picked up the newspaper and
read that crude oil prices reached a new high?
Have you ever asked yourself how these prices
are determined? Well, they’re determined on an
exchange. The global benchmark for crude oil
prices is a type of crude traded on the NYMEX,
and it’s called West Texas Intermediate (WTI).
WTI comes from where its name suggests —
West Texas. WTI is a light, sweet crude oil, and
it’s a benchmark because light, sweet crude is
preferred by refiners to heavy, sour crude since
they can get a lot more products out of it. (I take
an in-depth look at the different types of crude
oil in Chapter 12.) 
Because the WTI is traded on the NYMEX as
a futures contract, the price you read in the
newspaper usually refers to the front month
delivery of the contract. (For more on futures
delivery dates please turn to Chapter 9.) So
when you read that oil is now at $62 a barrel, this
refers to WTI crude oil traded on the NYMEX for
next month’s delivery! This is very different than
the current spot market price — the price you
would pay if you were to purchase a barrel of oil
right away, or on the spot. Additionally, the North
Sea Brent — another light, sweet crude —
which trades in London on the International
Petroleum Exchange (which is now part of the
Intercontinental Exchange), is used as a sec-
ondary global benchmark.

Commodity exchanges are under strict oversight in order to protect all
market participants and to ensure transparency in the exchanges. Here are
the main regulatory organizations that have oversight of commodity
exchanges in the United States.
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): The CFTC is a federal
regulatory agency created by Congress in 1974. Its main purpose is to
regulate the commodity markets and to protect all market participants
from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices. Any exchange that con-
ducts business with the public must be registered with the CFTC. You
can visit their Web site at www.cftc.gov. 
 National Futures Association (NFA): The NFA is the industry’s self-
regulatory body. It conducts audits, launches investigations to root
out corrupt practices in the industry, and enforces the rules relating to
the trading of commodities on the various exchanges. It also regulates
every single firm or individual who conducts business with the you as
an investor — including floor traders and brokers, futures commission
merchants, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators,
and introducing brokers. 
You can check out the work of the NFA, as well as research individual com-
modities professionals, at the NFA Web site: www.nfa.futures.org.
Ready, Set, Invest: Opening an 
Account and Placing Orders
When you decide you’re ready to start trading exchange-traded products,
you have to choose the most suitable way for you to do so. Unless you’re a
member of an exchange or have a seat on the exchange floor, you have to
open a trading account with a commodity broker who’s licensed to conduct
business on behalf of clients at the exchange. 
120
Part II: Getting Started 

The technical term for a commodity broker is a Futures Commission Merchant
(FCM). The FCM is licensed to solicit and execute commodity orders and
accept payments for this service. 
Before choosing a commodity broker who will handle your account, you have
to perform a thorough and comprehensive analysis of their trading platform.
You want to get as much information as possible about the firm and its activi-
ties. A few things you should consider are firm history, firm clients, licensing
information, trading platform, regulatory data, and employee information.
Chapter 6 gives you a detailed analysis of the criteria you want to use to
select a broker, so check it out. 
Choosing the right account
After you select a commodity brokerage firm you’re comfortable with, it’s
time to open an account and start trading! You can choose from a number
of different brokerage accounts. Most firms will offer you at least two
types of accounts, depending on the level of control you want to exercise
over the account. 
If you feel confident about your trading abilities, then a self-directed account
where you call the shots is the most suitable account for you. On the other
hand, if you don’t feel comfortable calling the shots, then having a profes-
sional make the trading decisions for you through a managed account is your
best bet. In this section, I go through the pros and cons of self-directed and
managed accounts so you can determine which one is best for you.
Self-directed account 
If you feel comfortable with exchange-traded products and are ready to take
direct control of your account, then consider opening a self-directed account,
also known as a non-discretionary individual account. This means that you take
matters into your own hands and make all the trading decisions. If you have a
good understanding of market fundamentals and want to get direct access to
commodity exchange products, then a self-directed account is for you.
Before you open a self-directed account, talk to a few commodity brokers
because each firm offers different account features. This is similar to buying a
car. You want to test drive as many cars as possible to get the biggest bang for
your buck. Same thing when you’re opening a commodities trading account. 
Specifically, ask about any minimum capital requirements the firm has. Some
commodity brokers require that you invest a minimum amount of $10,000 or
more. You also want to become familiar with account maintenance fees and
with the commission scale the firm uses. Knowing this information upfront will
save you a lot of heartache down the road. After you gather all the relevant
information and open your account, you’re finally ready to start trading and
placing orders! 
121
Chapter 8: Understanding How Commodities Exchanges Work

Managed account 
In a managed account, you’re essentially transferring the responsibility of
making all buying and selling decisions over to a trained professional. 
Open a managed account if: 
 You don’t follow the markets on a regular (i.e. daily) basis but are inter-
ested in getting exposure to commodities. 
 You follow the markets regularly but are unsure about which trading
strategy will maximize your returns. 
 You don’t have the time to manage a personal account.
 You feel comfortable knowing that someone else is making trading deci-
sions for you. 
If these statements apply to you, then you’re ready to open a managed
account. So how do you get started? First, you should determine your invest-
ment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. (For help determining your
investment strategy, flip on over to Chapter 6.) Then you need to find out
about any minimum capital requirements, commissions, or management fees
you may face. (I cover these in depth in Chapter 6 also.) After you have this
information, you can proceed to choose a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA)
to manage the account. 
If you have mutual funds, the CTA is similar to a fund manager. The FCM,
on the other hand, is more like a stock brokerage house. The FCM provides
you with a trading platform, while the CTA actually manages your accounts
for you. 
A CTA is a securities professional who is licensed by the National Association
of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the National Futures Association (NFA) to
offer advice on commodities and to accept compensation for investment and
management services. Before you select a CTA, I recommend you perform a
rigorous background check on him. Because a CTA is required to register
with the NFA to transact with the public, you can find out a lot about a CTA
by simply visiting the NFA Web site (www.nfa.futures.org). (And check
out Chapter 6 for more info on selecting CTAs and other money managers.) 
Here are a few things to find out about your CTA:
 How many years of market experience does he have?
 What is his long-term performance record?
 What is his trading strategy and does it square with your investment
goals?
 Does he have any complaints filed against him? (This information is pub-
licly available through the NFA.)
122
Part II: Getting Started 

 Many CTAs manage more than one account. Try and find out how many
accounts he is currently managing. If the number seems too high then
maybe your account won’t be a high priority for him.
 Does he have a criminal record? If so, then find out the details of any
arrests or convictions he has. This information is also available through
the NFA.
After you perform due diligence on your CTA and feel comfortable with him,
you’re ready to turn over trading privileges to him. How do you do that? You
actually have to sign a power of attorney document. After that document is
signed, your CTA will have full trading discretion and complete control over
the buying and selling of commodities in your account. That means he makes
all the decisions, and you have to live with the good (and sometimes bad)
decisions he makes. If you trade stocks, this account is similar to having a
discretionary individual stock account where your stockbroker makes trad-
ing decisions for you. The main benefit of the managed account is that you
get a trained professional managing your investments. The drawback is you
can’t blame anyone but yourself if you incur any losses. 
A CTA is allowed by law to manage more than one account and have more
than one client. However, a CTA must keep all managed accounts separate.
That means there is no commingling of funds allowed and no transferring of
profits or losses between accounts. A managed account is very different from
a commodity pool, where your funds are “pooled” with those of other
investors. In a commodity pool, the manager, who is known as a Commodity
Pool Operator (CPO), pools all the funds, and all profits or losses are shared
by all investors. Make sure that when you choose a managed account you get
a CTA who will manage your account based on your personal risk profile. (I
cover CPOs and examine the differences between the CPO and the CTA more
closely in Chapter 6.) 
Placing orders
Your trading account is your link to the commodity exchange. The broker’s
trading platform gives you access to the exchange’s main products such as
futures contracts, options on futures, and other derivative products. Because
the products traded on commodity exchanges are fairly sophisticated finan-
cial instruments, you need to specify a number of parameters in order to pur-
chase the product you want. 
Contract parameters
The lifeblood of the exchange is the contract. As an investor, you can choose
from a number of different contracts — from plain vanilla futures contracts to
exotic swaps and spreads. (I discuss these products in depth in Chapter 9.)
Whether you’re buying a forward contract or engaging in a swap, there are
specific entry order procedures you need to follow. 
123
Chapter 8: Understanding How Commodities Exchanges Work

Here is a list of the parameters you need to indicate to place an order at the
exchange:
 Action: Indicate whether you are buying or selling. 
 Quantity: Specify the number of contracts you’re interested in either
buying or selling.
 Time: By definition, commodity futures contracts represent an underly-
ing commodity traded at a specific price for delivery at a specific point
in the future. Futures contracts have delivery months, and you must
specify the delivery month. Additionally, you should also specify the
year because many contracts represent delivery points for periods of up
to five years (or more). 
 Commodity: This is the underlying commodity that the contract repre-
sents. It could be crude oil, gold, or soybeans. Sometimes, it’s also helpful
to indicate on which exchange you want to place your order. (This is fairly
significant because more and more of the same commodities are being
offered on different exchanges. For example, the benchmark WTI crude
oil — which used to be traded only on the NYMEX — is now available
both on the NYMEX floor as well as on the ICE electronic exchange.) 
 Price: This could be the most important piece of the contract: the price
at which you’re willing to buy or sell the contract. Unless you’re placing
a market order (which is executed at current market prices), you should
indicate the price you want your order to be filled. 
 Type of Order: There are a lot of different types of orders, from plain
vanilla market orders to more exotic ones such as Fill or Kill (FOK). See
Table 8-3 for a list of the different types of orders. This is an important
piece of the order since this is where you indicate how you want to buy
or sell the contract. 
 Day or Open Order: Market orders relate to price, while day or open
orders relate to how long you want your order to remain open. In a day
order, your order expires if it isn’t filled by the end of the trading day.
An open order, however, will remain open unless you cancel the order,
the order is filled, or the contract expires. 
Defining different types of orders
One of the most important pieces of information you need to indicate is the
order type. This indicates how you want your order to be placed and exe-
cuted. Table 8-3 lists the major types of orders along with a brief description
of each one. 
124
Part II: Getting Started 

Table 8-3
Defining Different Types of Orders
Order Type
What It Means
Fill or Kill (FOK)
Use this order if you want your order to be filled right
away at a specific price. If a matching offer is not found
within three attempts, your order will be cancelled, or
“killed.”
Limit (LMT) 
A limit order is placed when you want your order to be
filled only at a specified price or better. If you’re on the
buy-side of a transaction, you want your limit buy order
placed at or below the market price. Conversely, if
you’re on the sell-side, you want your limit sell order at
or above market price. 
Market (MKT)
A market order is perhaps the simplest type of order.
When you choose a market order, you’re saying you
want your order filled at the current market price. 
Market if Touched (MIT)
A market if touched order sounds intimidating, but it’s not.
When you place an MIT, you specify the price at which
you want to buy or sell a commodity. When that price is
reached (or “touched”), your order is automatically filled
at the current market price. A buy MIT order is placed
below the market, while a sell MIT order is placed above
the market. In other words, you buy low and sell high. 
Market on Close (MOC)
When you place a market on close order, you’re not
selecting a specific price but a specific time to execute
your order. Your order will be executed at whatever
price that particular commodity happens to close at the
end of the trading session. 
Stop (STP)
A stop order is a lot like a market if touched order
because your order is placed when trading occurs at or
through a specified price. However, unlike an MIT order,
a buy stop order is placed above the market, and a sell
stop order is placed below market levels. 
Stop Close Only (SCO) 
If you choose a stop close only order, your stop order
will be executed only at the closing of trading and only if
the closing trading range is at or through your desig-
nated stop price. 
Stop Limit (STL) 
A stop limit order combines both a stop order and a limit
order. Once the stop price is reached, the order will
become a limit order and the transaction will be exe-
cuted only if the specified price at which you want the
order to go through has been reached. 
125
Chapter 8: Understanding How Commodities Exchanges Work

In order to put theory into practice, here are a couple sample orders:
 Buy ten June 2006 COMEX Gold at $550 Limit Day Order. This means
you’re buying ten contracts for gold on the COMEX (the metals complex
of the NYMEX) with delivery date of June 2006. You are willing to pay
$550 per troy ounce per contract, or better. (A troy ounce is the mea-
surement unit for gold at the COMEX.) Because this is a day order, if
your order isn’t filled by the end of the trading day, it will expire. 
 Sell 100 September 2007 NYMEX Crude at Market Open Order.
Through this order, you’re selling 100 contracts of crude oil on the
NYMEX with delivery date of September 2007. You are willing to sell
them at the current market price. Because this is an open order, your
order will remain open for multiple trading sessions until it is filled. 
Say that “Mary” is an investor who has recently opened a self-directed account
with Infinity Brokers, a commodity brokerage firm. She keeps track of the
markets and is comfortable placing orders that will take advantage of current
market fundamentals. Mary picks up her newspaper one morning and reads
that there is political turmoil in Nigeria, one of the world’s top oil exporters.
Rebels have seized a major pipeline, and Nigeria’s oil exports will be cut by
15 percent. This will have a significant impact on global oil prices, which are
already sensitive to any supply disruptions. 
Anticipating higher oil prices due to this latest development, Mary picks up
the phone and calls her broker (sometimes known as an account executive),
and instructs him to buy a contract for 1000 Barrels of oil at current market
prices on the NYMEX for next month delivery. The account executive takes
down her order and informs her that he’ll notify her as soon as her order is
executed.
What happens between the time the orders are placed and then executed? In
the following section, I give you a behind-the-scenes look at what actually
goes on at the exchange that enables your orders to go through. I introduce
you to some of the players who are responsible for seeing through the orders
from start to finish. 
Tracking your order from start to finish
When you pick up the phone or log into your online account and place an
order, it’s sometimes easy to forget that your order isn’t placed in a vacuum.
You place the order and wait for the confirmation number. Seems simple,
right? Not quite. A number of people are involved in making sure your order
is executed as smoothly and efficiently as possible, and your order goes
126
Part II: Getting Started 

through an extensive supply chain before it’s executed. In this section, I shed
some light on how your orders are executed and introduce you to some of
the people who make this possible.
The clerk
The first point of contact at the exchange with the outside world is the clerk.
The clerk isn’t an employee of the exchange but is employed by the various
commodity brokers who are licensed to conduct business at the exchange. The
clerk works the phones and is responsible for taking down client orders. Once
the clerk receives an order by phone (and now increasingly through e-mail as
well), he fills out an order ticket, which he then passes on to the floor broker. 
The floor broker
The floor broker (FB) is the one in the large ring shouting and making funny
gestures. The FB is responsible for actually executing the order. The FB is in
the front lines of every transaction that goes through the exchange during
the open outcry sessions. Once the FB receives the order ticket from the
clerk, it’s his responsibility to find a matching offer and to fill the order. The
FB shouts and makes gestures (which are actually derived from American
Sign Language) to interact with other brokers and traders in the ring. Once
he finds a broker or trader who is willing to fill his order, he writes down on
the order ticket the time the agreement was entered into. 
The floor trader
The floor trader (FT) is different than a floor broker because the FB is licensed
to buy and sell commodities on behalf of clients. The trader may only trade
on behalf of his personal account. The FT, sometimes known as a “local,” pro-
vides much-needed liquidity to the exchange. An FT may be the person who
will sell or buy a contract from the FB. 
When both buyer and seller at the exchange agree on price and other con-
tractual terms, both must write down that the transaction went through on
their tickets. However, only the seller is responsible for notifying the
exchange that the transaction went through. How does he do that? He fills
out an order ticket with the price, quality, and quantity of the contract along
with the time the transaction took place. He must then physically throw the
ticket order to the card clocker. 
The card clocker
The card clocker sits in the middle of the ring, where he’s literally at the
center of the action. The responsibility of the clocker is to time stamp every
ticket order and record the time of each transaction that takes place on the
127
Chapter 8: Understanding How Commodities Exchanges Work

exchange floor. He is an employee of the exchange and processes about 1000
tickets every minute! Because brokers and traders are throwing order tickets
at them, they must wear eye goggles to protect themselves. 
The floor runner
The floor runner is also employed by the exchange, and her responsibility is
to gather all time-stamped ticket orders from the card clocker and hand them
to the data-entry folks at the exchange. She is called a floor runner because
she has to literally run between the card clocker and data-entry to deliver
the ticket orders. Data-entry is responsible for recording the exact time
and nature of the contract for the exchange’s internal compliance records.
The price reporter
The price reporter is a major link between what goes on inside the trading
rings and the outside world. The price reporter is responsible for noting the
price and time of every transaction that takes place inside the ring. The price
reporter notes this information down on a hand-held computer which is
directly linked to the exchange’s floor board. The price the reporter notes
flashes directly and instantaneously on the board, where it is then dissemi-
nated to the outside public via various news and wire services. 
The price you read in a crawling news ticker is the price that’s recorded by
the price reporter during trading hours, and it represents the settlement
price of the latest transaction for a given contract. However, unless you
subscribe to a wire service that provides you with “real-time access” to
the prices on the exchange, the price you read is usually delayed by 15 to
20 minutes. This is because news providers such as Bloomberg, Dow Jones,
and Reuters pay a premium to get access to exchange prices in real-time. 
If you want real-time exchange quotes, you have to subscribe to one of these
business news services. This is why if you ever visit an exchange, cameras,
cellphones, and other recording devices are strictly prohibited. The news
providers and the exchanges don’t want you to get access to the latest infor-
mation, fearing that you might disseminate it to the outside world for free! 
The ring supervisor
Every exchange has a floor with more than one ring in it. A ring, sometimes
known as a pit, is where specific commodity contracts are bought and sold
during the open outcry sessions. For example, the floor of the NYMEX has a
natural gas ring, a crude oil ring, and a heating oil ring. The brokers and traders
in each ring may buy and sell only the specific commodity that is traded in that
ring. Every ring has a supervisor who is responsible for overseeing trading
activity and maintaining orderly conduct in the ring. (I know it’s a little hard
128
Part II: Getting Started 

to imagine order in a trading pit but that’s their job!) The ring supervisor is
similar to the umpire in a tennis game — she oversees the game to make sure
that all the rules are followed and intervenes whenever they are not. 
Keeping up at the exchange
Working at the commodity exchange is not for the faint-hearted! Many people
are attracted by the energy (pun intended) and fast pace of the exchanges,
but you should remember that this is a high-pressure environment where
the competition is ruthless. Brokers are paid by how many transactions they
successfully complete, so the pressure to close as many deals as possible is
intense. If you ever consider a career working on the exchange floor, you
should always keep this in mind. 
These are only some of the people involved in making the exchanges run as
smoothly and efficiently as possible. As an investor with a brokerage
account, all you see after you place your order is a confirmation number, and
most investors fail to recognize the complexity behind placing orders at the
commodity exchanges. Understanding the mechanism behind the order
placement procedure will go a long way to making you a better investor. The
more information you have on the mechanics of the exchange, the better off
you are placing your trades with confidence. 
It’s also important to note that the open outcry system (where brokers stand in
a trading pit filling and executing orders manually) has faced increased com-
petition from electronic trading platforms, where orders are matched electron-
ically. As a matter of fact, out of the major exchanges in the United States, only
the NYMEX, COMEX, and NYBOT still rely heavily on the open outcry system
to conduct business. Most exchanges now use a combination of electronic and
open outcry, and many believe that the open outcry system is in jeopardy of
being retired altogether. For example, in 2005 the open outcry at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange only accounted for 30 percent of the exchange’s total
volume — 70 percent of orders were placed electronically. 
Owning a Piece of an Exchange
Savvy investors always keep their pulse on the markets and seek to develop
investment strategies that take advantage of the market fundamentals. One of
the biggest trends in the global investment game in the beginning of the 21st
century is the increasing popularity of commodities in investor portfolios.
Driven by high commodity prices, many investors are looking for ways to
profit in this sector — after all, that’s why you’re reading this book! (For an
in-depth analysis of this trend, please turn to Chapter 5.) 
129
Chapter 8: Understanding How Commodities Exchanges Work

Commodity exchanges are becoming popular vehicles through which investors
access the commodity markets. Because of their unique position, commodity
exchanges stand to gain tremendously from this interest from the investing
public. Interested in cashing in on this trend without trading a single contract
on a single commodity exchange?
Sometimes, with all the commotion associated with the trading floors on
commodity exchanges, it’s easy to forget that an exchange is a business like
any other business. Exchanges have employees, board members, revenues,
earnings, expenses, and so on. These are not charitable organizations; a
commodity exchange is a for-profit enterprise. While a car manufacturer
sells cars to customers, commodity exchanges sell commodity contracts to
customers. That’s their bread and butter — their business is to sell financial
instruments to the investing public. As any company, they charge a fee for
this service. 
For most of their existence, exchanges have been privately held companies
whose business side remained under close wraps. However, because of the
increasing popularity of commodities and the rise of the electronic trading
platform, a large number of commodity exchanges are now going public. That
is, they’re becoming public companies with shareholders and outside
investors. Most of the commodity exchanges are now traded on stock
exchanges just like Microsoft, Ford, or Wal-Mart! 
In 2003, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the nation’s largest commodity
exchange in terms of volume) went public. Its shares are now traded on the
New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CME. CME went public at a
price of $43 a share. By March 2006, the stock price of CME reached an aston-
ishing $435 a share! That’s more than a 1000 percent increase in a period of
three years. (See Figure 8-1.) Encouraged by these results, a number of other
commodity exchanges went public soon after, and more are following suit.
You can cash in on this trend by becoming a shareholder in one of these
exchanges, since commodity exchanges are increasingly becoming hot
investments in their own right.

Before you go and purchase equity (stock) in one of the commodity
exchanges, make sure you perform a thorough analysis of the stock and the
company fundamentals. A stock will never go up in a straight arrow — it
always retreats before making new highs. Sometimes, it doesn’t make new
highs at all. 
I recommend you follow a stock on paper — that is, follow its movements
without actually owning the stock — for a period of at least two weeks. That
way you can get a feel for how the stock moves with the rest of the market.
This will allow you to pinpoint the right entry and exit points. 
Table 8-4 lists some of the commodity exchanges that recently have gone
public.

actually having to buy commodity exchange–traded products!

Back to the Future: Getting a Grip
on Futures and Options
In This Chapter

 Deciphering options contracts
S
ome investors think that “futures and options” and “commodities” are
basically the same thing, but this is not the case. Commodities are a class
of assets that includes energy, metals, agricultural products, and similar items.
Futures and options are investment vehicles through which you can invest in
commodities. Think of it this way: If commodities were a place, futures and
options would be the vehicle you use to get there. In addition to commodities,
futures and options also allow you to invest in a variety of other asset classes
such as stocks, indexes, currencies, bonds, and even interest rates.
In Wall Street lingo, futures and options are known as derivatives because
they derive their value from an underlying financial instrument such as a
stock, bond, or commodity. However, futures and options are different finan-
cial instruments with singular structures and uses — but I’m getting ahead
of myself.
Futures and options conjure up a lot apprehension and puzzlement among
investors. A majority of investors have never used them and those who have
often come back with stories about losing their life savings trading them.
While their negative aspects are slightly exaggerated, trading futures and
options is not for everyone. 
Futures and options, by their very nature, are complex financial instruments.
It’s not like investing in a mutual fund, where you mail your check and wait
for quarterly statements and dividends. If you invest in futures and options
contracts, you need to monitor your positions on a daily basis, often even on
an hourly basis. You have to keep track of the expiration date, the premium

paid, the strike price, margin requirements, and a number of other shifting
variables. (I discuss these in the section “Contract specs: Keeping track of all
the moving pieces.”)
That said, understanding futures and options can be very beneficial to you as
an investor because they are powerful tools. They provide you with leverage
and risk management opportunities that your average financial instruments
don’t offer. If you can harness the power of these instruments, you can dra-
matically increase your leverage — and performance — in the markets. 
My aim in this chapter is not to make you an expert in trading these sophisti-
cated financial instruments, but to introduce you to these vehicles so that
you have a working knowledge of what they are. If you then choose to use
them in your trading strategy, you will at least have a good understanding of
how to best utilize them. Or if you decide to hire a professional money man-
ager to invest in the futures markets for you, you’ll know the lingo and key
concepts so you can ask them the right questions. I include a comprehensive
list of money managers who specialize in helping investors invest in the
futures markets on my Web site www.commodities-investor.com. I also
discuss how to go about choosing a money manager in Chapter 6.
The futures markets are only one way for you to get involved in commodities
and, because they can be fairly volatile, it’s important you have a solid under-
standing before you jump in. 
Although a number of books deal specifically with futures and options, I rec-
ommend checking out John Hull’s Options, Futures and Other Derivatives
(Prentice Hall) for its thoroughness. Another book I recommend is
Derivatives Demystified by Andrew Chisholm (Wiley).
The Future Looks Bright: How to 
Trade Futures Contracts
The futures market is divided into two segments: one that’s regulated and
another one that’s unregulated. Trading in the regulated portion of the
futures market is done through designated commodity futures exchanges
such as the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME), which I cover in Chapter 8. Trading in the unregulated por-
tion of the futures market is done by individual parties outside the purview of
the exchanges. This is known as the Over-The-Counter market. 
The futures market is the opposite of the cash market, often known as the
spot market, because transactions take place right away, or on the spot.
134
Part II: Getting Started 

A futures contract is a highly standardized financial instrument whereby two
parties enter into an agreement to exchange an underlying security (such as
soybeans, palladium, or ethanol) at a mutually agreed-upon price at a specific
time in the future — which is why it’s called a futures contract. 
Futures contracts, by definition, trade on designated commodity futures
exchanges, such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Chicago Board
of Trade (CBOT). The exchanges provide liquidity and transparency to all
market participants. However, the structure of the futures market is such
that only about 20 percent of market activity takes place in the exchange
arena. The overwhelming majority of transactions in the futures markets
take place in the Over-The-Counter market (OTC). The OTC market is not
regulated or monitored by the exchanges, and it usually involves two market
participants that establish the terms of their agreements through forward
contracts. Forwards are similar to futures contracts except that they trade
in the OTC market, and thus allow the parties to come up with flexible
and individualized terms for their agreements. Generally speaking, the
OTC market is not suitable for trading by individual investors who seek
speculative opportunities because it consists primarily of large commercial
users (such as oil companies and airlines) who use it solely for hedging
purposes. 
In this chapter, I focus on derivatives that trade on the commodity
exchanges. I don’t focus on the OTC market because it does not lend itself to
trading by individual investors. So when I refer to the “futures market” in this
chapter, I’m talking about the trading activity in the designated commodity
futures exchanges. 
Despite the fact that futures contracts are designed to accommodate delivery
of physical commodities, such delivery rarely takes place because the primary
purpose of the futures markets is to minimize risk and maximize profits. The
futures market, unlike the cash or spot market, is not intended to serve as the
primary exchange of physical commodities. Rather, it is a market where buyers
and sellers transact with each other for hedging and speculative purposes.
Out of the billions of contracts traded on commodity futures exchanges each
year, only about 2 percent of these contracts result in the actual physical
delivery of a commodity. 
In the land of futures contracts, both the buyer and the seller have the right
and the obligation of fulfilling the contract’s terms. This is different than in
the realm of options, where the buyer has the right but not the obligation to
exercise the option, but where the seller has the obligation but not the right
to fulfill her contractual obligations. This can get a little confusing, I know!
That’s why I dig deeper into these issues in the section “Keeping Your
Options Open”.

Chapter 9: Back to the Future: Getting a Grip on Futures and Options

The competition: Who trades futures?
Essentially two types of folks trade futures contracts. The first are commercial
producers and consumers of commodities who use the futures markets to sta-
bilize either their costs (in the case of consumers) or revenues (in the case of
producers). The second group is made up of individual traders, investment
banks, and other financial institutions who are interested in using the futures
markets as a way of generating trading profits. Both groups take advantage of
the futures markets’ liquidity and leverage (which I discuss in the following
sections) to implement their trading strategies. 
If you ever get involved in the futures markets, it’s important to know who
you’re up against. I examine the role of these hedgers and speculators in the
following sections so you’re ready to deal with the competition. 
Scene one, take one: Getting over the hedge
Hedgers are the actual producers and consumers of commodities. Both produc-
ers and consumers enter the futures markets with the aim of reducing price
volatility of the commodities that they buy or sell. Hedging provides these
commercial enterprises the opportunity to reduce the risk associated with
daily price fluctuations by establishing fixed prices of primary commodities
for months, sometimes even years, in advance. 
Hedgers can be on either side of a transaction in the futures market, either on
the buy-side or the sell-side. Here are a few examples of entities that use the
futures markets for hedging purposes: 
 Farmers who want to establish steady prices for their products use
futures contracts to sell their products to consumers at a fixed price for
a fixed period of time, thus guaranteeing a fixed stream of revenues.
 Electric utility companies that supply power to residential customers
can buy electricity on the futures markets to keep their costs fixed and
protect their bottom line. 
 Transportation companies whose business depends on the price of fuel
get involved in the futures markets to maintain fixed costs of fuel over
specific periods of time. 
To get a better idea of hedging in action, take a look at a hedging strategy
employed by the airline industry.
One of the biggest worries that keeps airline executives up at night is the
unpredictable price of jet fuel, which can vary wildly from day to day on the
spot market. Airlines don’t like this kind of uncertainty because they want to
keep their costs low and predictable (they already have enough to worry
136
Part II: Getting Started 

about with rising pension and health care costs, fears of terrorism, and other
external factors). So how do they do that? By hedging the price of jet fuel
through the futures market. 
Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) is one of the most active hedgers in the indus-
try. At any one point, Southwest may have up to 80 percent of a given year’s
jet fuel consumption fixed at a specific price. Southwest will enter into
agreements with producers through the futures markets, primarily through
Over-The-Counter agreements, to purchase fuel at a fixed price for a specific
period of time in the future.
The benefit for Southwest (and its passengers) is that they have fixed their
costs and eliminated the volatility associated with the price fluctuation of the
jet fuel they’re consuming. This has a direct impact on their bottom line. The
advantage for the producer is that they now have a customer who is willing
to purchase their product for a fixed time at a fixed price, thus providing
them with a steady stream of cash flow. 
However, unless prices in the cash market remain steady, one of the two par-
ties who enters into this sort of agreement may have been better off without
the hedge. If prices for jet fuel increase, then the producer has to bear that cost
because they still have to deliver jet fuel to the airline at the agreed-upon price,
which is now below the market price. Similarly, if prices of jet fuel go down, the
airline would have been better off purchasing jet fuel on the cash market. But
because these are unknown variables, hedgers still see a benefit in entering
into these agreements to eliminate this unpredictability. 
The truth about speculators
For some reason, the term speculator carries some negative connotation, as if
speculating was a sinful or immoral act. The fact of the matter is that specula-
tors play an important and necessary role in the global financial system. In
fact, whenever you buy a stock or a bond, you are speculating. When you
think prices are going up, you buy. When they’re going down, you sell. The
process of figuring out where prices are heading and how to profit from this
is the essence of speculation. So we’re all speculators! 
In the futures markets, speculators provide much needed liquidity that
allows the many market players the opportunity to match their buy and sell
orders. Speculators, often simply known as traders, buy and sell futures con-
tracts, options, and other exchange-traded products through an electronic
platform or a broker to profit from price fluctuations. A trader who thinks
that the price of crude oil is going up will buy a crude oil futures contract to
try to profit from his hunch. This adds liquidity to the markets, which is valu-
able because liquidity is a prerequisite for the smooth and efficient function-
ing of the futures markets. 
137
Chapter 9: Back to the Future: Getting a Grip on Futures and Options

When markets are liquid, you know that you will be able to find a buyer or a
seller for your contracts. You also know that you are assured a reasonable
price because liquidity provides you with a large pool of market participants
who are going to compete for your contracts. Finally, liquidity means that
when a number of participants are transacting in the marketplace, prices are
not going to be subject to extremely wild and unpredictable price fluctuations.
This doesn’t mean that liquidity eliminates volatility, but it certainly helps
reduce it. 
At the end of the day, having a large number of market participants is posi-
tive, and speculators play an important role due to the liquidity they provide
to the futures markets. 
Contract specs: Keeping track
of all the moving pieces
Trading futures contracts takes a lot of discipline, patience, and coordination —
one of the biggest deterrents to participating in the futures markets is the
number of moving pieces you have to constantly monitor. In this section, I go
through the many pieces you have to keep track of should you decide to trade
futures. 
Because futures contracts can only be traded on designated and regulated
exchanges, these contracts are highly standardized. Standardization simply
means that these contracts are based on a uniform set of rules. For example, the
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil contract is standardized
because it represents a specific grade of crude (West Texas Intermediate) 
and a specific size (1000 Barrels). Therefore you can expect all NYMEX crude
contracts to represent 1000 Barrels of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. In
other words, the contract you purchase won’t be for 1000 Barrels of Nigerian
Bonny Light, another grade of crude oil. 
The regulatory bodies that are responsible for overseeing and monitoring
trading activities on commodity futures exchanges are the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association
(NFA). I discuss these at length in Chapter 8. 
The buyer of a futures contract is known as the holder; when you buy a
futures contract you are essentially “going long” the commodity. The seller
of a futures contract is referred to as the underwriter or writer. If you sell a
futures contract, you are holding a short position. Remember that “going
long” simply means you’re on the buy-side of a transaction; conversely, going
short means you’re on the sell-side. In other words, when you “go long,”
you expect prices to rise, and when you “go short” you anticipate prices
to decrease. 
138
Part II: Getting Started 

Underlying asset
The underlying asset is the financial instrument that is represented by the
futures contract. The underlying asset can be anything from crude oil and
platinum to soybeans and propane. Because futures contracts are traded on
designated exchanges, every exchange offers different types of assets you
can trade. For a list of these assets, make sure to read Chapter 8. 
Futures contracts can be used to trade all sorts of assets, and not just tradi-
tional commodities like oil and gold. Futures can be used to trade interest
rates, indexes, currencies, equities, and a host of other assets. There are
even futures contracts that allow you to trade weather!
Although most of the world’s major commodities are traded on exchanges
through futures contracts, one of the only major commodities that does not
have a futures contract assigned to it is steel. A few of the major exchanges,
such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the London Metal
Exchange (LME), have considered offering steel futures, but a steel futures
contract is still not available to investors. 
Before you place your order, make sure you’re very clear about the under-
lying commodity you want to trade. Make sure to specify on which exchange
you want your order executed. This is important because you have contracts
for the same commodities that trade on different exchanges. For example,
aluminum futures contracts are traded on both the COMEX division of the
NYMEX as well as on the London Metal Exchange (LME). When you’re plac-
ing an order for an aluminum contract, it’s important you specify where
you want to buy the contract: either on the COMEX or on the LME. 
Underlying quantity
The contract size, also known as the trading unit, is how much of the under-
lying asset the contract represents. In order to meet certain standards, all
futures contracts have a predetermined and fixed size. For example, one
futures contract for ethanol traded on the Chicago Board of Trade is the
equivalent of one rail car of ethanol, which is approximately 29,000 Gallons. 
The light sweet crude oil contract on the NYMEX represents 1000 US Barrels,
which is the equivalent of 42,000 Gallons. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
a futures contract for frozen pork bellies represents 40,000 Pounds of pork. 
Make sure you know exactly the amount of underlying commodity the con-
tract represents before you purchase a futures contract. 
Because more individual investors want to trade futures contracts, many
exchanges are now offering contracts with smaller sizes, which means that
the contracts cost less. The NYMEX, for instance, now offers the miNY™Light
Sweet Crude Oil contract, which represents 500 Barrels of oil and is half the
price of its traditional crude oil contract.
139
Chapter 9: Back to the Future: Getting a Grip on Futures and Options

Product grade
Imagine you placed an order for a Ford Mustang and instead got a Ford
Taurus. You’d be pretty upset, right? I know I would! In order to avoid
unpleasant surprises should delivery of a physical commodity actually
take place, exchanges require that all contracts represent a standard
product grade. For instance, gasoline futures traded on the NYMEX are
based on contract specifications for New York Harbor Unleaded Gasoline.
This is a uniform grade of gasoline widely used across the East Coast,
which is transported to New York Harbor from refineries in the East Coast
and the Gulf of Mexico. Thus, if delivery of a NYMEX gasoline futures con-
tracts takes place, you can expect to receive NY Harbor Unleaded Gas. 
If your sole purpose is to speculate and you’re not intending on having gaso-
line or soybeans delivered, then knowing the product grade is not as impor-
tant as if you were taking physical delivery of the commodity. However, it’s
always good to know what kind of product you’re actually trading. 
Price quote 
While most futures contracts are priced in US Dollars, some contracts are
priced in other currencies, such as the Pound Sterling or the Japanese Yen.
The price quote really depends on which exchange you’re buying or selling the
futures contract from. Keep in mind that if you’re trading futures in a foreign
currency, you’re potentially exposing yourself to currency exchange risks. 
Price limits
Price limits help you determine the value of the contract. Every contract has
a minimum and maximum price increment, also known as tick size. Contracts
move in ticks, which is the amount by which the futures contract increases
or decreases with every transaction. Most stocks, for example, move in
cents. In futures, most contracts move in larger dollar amounts, reflecting
the size of the contract. In other words one tick represents different values
for different contracts. 
For example, the minimum tick size of the ethanol futures contract on the
Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) is $29 per contract. This means every con-
tract will move in increments of $29. On the other hand, the maximum tick
size for ethanol on the CBOT is $4350, meaning that if the tick size is greater
than $4350, trading will be halted. Exchanges step in when contracts are
experiencing extreme volatility in order to calm the markets. 
Minimum and maximum tick sizes are established by the exchanges and are
based on the settlement price during the previous day’s trading session. 
Determining the value of the tick allows you to quantify the price swings of
the contract on any given trading session. 
140
Part II: Getting Started 

Trading months
Although you can trade futures contracts practically around the clock, cer-
tain commodities are only available for delivery during certain months. 
For instance, frozen pork bellies on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
are listed for the months of February, March, May, July, and August. This
means that you can trade a July contract at any given point, but you cannot
trade a June contract — a contract that’s deliverable in June — because that
contract does not exist. On the other hand, crude oil on the NYMEX is avail-
able for all 12 months of the year. 
Check the contract listing before you trade so you know for which delivery
months you can trade the contracts. 
The front month is simply the upcoming delivery month. For example, June is
the front month during the May trading session. 
In the world of futures, trading and delivery months have specific abbrevia-
tions attributed to each month. I list these abbreviations in Table 9-1:
Table 9-1

Traders use these abbreviations to quickly identify the months they’re inter-
ested in trading. If you’re placing an order with a futures broker (which I dis-
cuss in Chapter 6), knowing these abbreviations is helpful. 
Delivery location
In case of actual delivery, exchanges designate areas where the physical
exchange of commodities actually takes place. For instance, delivery of the
NYMEX’s WTI crude oil contract takes place in Cushing, Oklahoma, which is a
major transportation hub for crude oil in the United States. 
141
Chapter 9: Back to the Future: Getting a Grip on Futures and Options

Last trading day
All futures contracts must expire at some point. The last trading day is the
absolute latest time you have to trade that particular contract. Trading days
change from exchange to exchange and from contract to contract. Make sure
to check out the contract specifications at the different exchanges for infor-
mation on the last trading day. 
Trading hours
Before the days of electronic trading, contracts were traded through the open
outcry system during specific time periods. Now, with the advent of elec-
tronic trading you have more time to trade the contracts. 
Knowing at what times to place your trades has a direct impact on your
bottom line because the number of market participants varies throughout
the day. Ideally, you’d like to execute your orders when there are the most
buyers and sellers because this increases your chances of getting the best
price for your contracts. 
Check the exchange Web sites (which I list in Chapter 8) for information on
trading hours. 
For a Few Dollars Less: Trading 
Futures on Margin
One of the unique characteristics of futures contracts is the ability to trade
with margin. If you’ve ever traded stocks, you know that margin is the
amount of borrowed money you use to pay for stock. Margin in the futures
markets is slightly different than stock market margin. 
In the futures markets, margin refers to the minimum amount of capital that
must be available in your account for you to trade futures contracts. Think of
margin as collateral that allows you to participate in the futures markets. The
amount of capital that has to be in your account before you place a trade is
known as initial margin. Because profits and losses on your open positions
are calculated every day in the futures markets, you also have to maintain an
adequate amount of capital on a daily basis. This is known as maintenance
margin. 
 Initial margin: The minimum amount of capital you need in your account
to trade futures contracts. 
 Maintenance margin: The subsequent amount of capital you must con-
tribute to your account in order to maintain the minimum margin
requirements. 
142
Part II: Getting Started 

Margin requirements are established for every type of contract by the
exchange on which those contracts are traded. However, the futures broker
you use to place your order may have different margin requirements. Make
sure you find out what those requirements are before you start trading. 
In the stock market, capital gains and losses are calculated after you close
out your position. In the futures market, capital gains and losses are calcu-
lated at the end of the trading day and credited to or debited from your
account. If you experience a loss in your positions on any given day, you will
receive a margin call, which means that you have to replenish your account
to meet the minimum margin requirements if you want to keep trading. 
Trading on margin provides you with a lot of leverage because you only need
to put up relatively small amounts of capital as collateral in order to invest in
significant dollar amounts of a commodity. For example, if you want to trade
the soybean futures contracts on the CBOT, the initial margin requirement
is $1100. With this small amount you can control a CBOT soybeans futures
contract that has a value of approximately $28,400 (5000 Bushels at $5.68
per bushel)! This translates to a minimum margin requirement of less than
4 percent! 
Margin is a double-edged sword because both profits and losses are amplified
to large degrees. If you’re on the right side of a trade, you’re going to make a
lot of money. However, you’re also in a position to lose a lot (much more than
your initial investment) should things not go your way. Knowing how to use
margin properly is absolutely critical. I discuss in depth how to use leverage
responsibly in Chapter 3.  
Taking a Pulse: Figuring Out Where
the Futures Market Is Heading
You need to be familiar with a couple of technical terms related to movements
in the futures markets if you want to successfully trade futures contracts.
Before I name them, I have to advise you that you may want to take a couple
of aspirins before trying to pronounce them. Even by Wall Street standards,
these terms are kind of out there. The first one is contango and the second is
backwardation. (I warned you!)
Contango: It takes two to tango
Futures markets, by definition, are predicated on the future price of a com-
modity. Analyzing where the future price of a commodity is heading is
what futures trading is all about. Because futures contracts are available
143
Chapter 9: Back to the Future: Getting a Grip on Futures and Options

for different months throughout the year, the price of the contracts changes
from month to month. When the front month trades higher than the current
month, this market condition is known as contango. The market is also in con-
tango when the price of the front month is higher than the spot market, and
also when late delivery months are higher than near delivery months. I include
an example of the NYMEX Crude Oil contract in contango in Table 9-2. 
Table 9-2
NYMEX Crude Oil in Contango
Month
Settlement Price
June 06
$74.05
July 06
$75.30
August 06
$75.85
September 06
$76.30
October 06
$76.58
November 06
$76.65
As the contract extends into the future, the price of the contract increases.
Contango is thus a bullish indicator, showing that the market sentiment is that
the price of the futures contract is going to increase steadily into the future. 
Backwardation: One step forward,
two steps back
Backwardation is the opposite of contango. When a market is experiencing
backwardation, the contracts for future months are decreasing in value relative
to the current and most recent months. This means that the spot price is
greater than the front month, which is greater than future delivery months.
Table 9-3 shows the NYMEX Copper contract in backwardation.

July 06
$3.08
August 06

Part II: Getting Started 

A market in backwardation is a bearish sign because the expectation among
traders is that prices over the long term are going to decrease. 
Keeping Your Options Open:
Trading with Options
Before I start this section on options, I want to stress the fact that there is a
big difference between futures and options. Often times, folks tend to think of
futures and options as being one and the same — that’s understandable since
whenever you hear “futures,” “options” is never too far behind! However, as I
explain in the following sections, futures and options are different financial
instruments with singular structures and uses. Realizing this difference right
off the bat will help you understand these financial instruments better.
145
Chapter 9: Back to the Future: Getting a Grip on Futures and Options
The Metallgesellschaft debacle
Trading futures contracts is certainly not for the
faint hearted. Even the pros can run into lots of
trouble in the futures markets. A case in point is
what happened in the 1990s to a company
called Metallgesellschaft. Metallgesellschaft
(I’ll call it MG for short so you won’t have to go
through the trouble of pronouncing it!) was a
German company partly owned by a conglom-
erate led by Deutsche Bank, which specialized
in metals trading. In 1993, MG lost a staggering
$2.2 Billion trading futures contracts. 
In the early 1990s, MG set up an energy division
to trade futures contracts in the United States.
Its motive was to profit by betting on the price
fluctuations of crude oil. MG’s strategy was
based on taking advantage of the price differ-
ential between crude oil on the spot markets
and futures markets. Specifically, MG sold long-
term futures contracts to various parties and
hedged its long-term risk by buying short-term
contracts and rolling them on a monthly basis.
This strategy works beautifully — but only when
the long-term prices are lower than the short-
term prices. In other words, this is a good strat-
egy when the markets are in backwardation. 
However, in 1993, long-term crude oil prices
started increasing, and MG was caught short
with these contracts. When the markets moved
to contango (prices for future months were
higher than the current month), MG found itself
unable to hedge the long-term contracts and
was forced to meet the obligations on those long-
term contracts. Because it held such large open
positions, MG eventually lost a mind-numbing
$2.2 Billion! The parent company pulled the plug,
and MG was forced into liquidation.
The moral of this story is that futures trading can
be volatile and risky, even for seasoned profes-
sionals. Fortunately for investors like you and
me who are interested in commodities, the
futures market is only one way through which
to invest in this asset class. If you are interested
in accessing the futures markets, I recommend
you use the help of a Commodity Trading
Advisor (CTA) or a Commodity Pool Operator
(CPO). If you want to explore other ways to
invest in commodities (such as through mutual
funds or exchange traded funds), I recommend
reading Chapter 6. 

While futures give the holder (buyer) and underwriter (seller) both the right
and the obligation to fulfill the contract’s obligations, options give the holder
the right (or option) — but not the obligation — to exercise the contract. The
underwriter of the option, on the other hand, is required to fulfill the con-
tract’s obligations if the holder chooses to exercise the contract. 
When you’re buying an option, you’re essentially paying for the right to buy
or sell an underlying security at a specific point in time at an agreed-upon
price. The price you pay for the right to exercise that option is known as the
premium. 
The technically correct way of thinking about options is “options on futures
contracts;” in other words, the options contracts give you the option to buy
futures contracts for commodities such as wheat and zinc. This is different
than stock options, which give you the option to purchase stocks. In this sec-
tion, I examine options on futures contracts because that’s the focus of this
chapter. If you want an overview of stock options, I recommend Stock Options
For Dummies (Wiley).
Cutting to the chase: Options in action!
Understanding options can be challenging because they’re in fact derivatives
used to trade other derivatives (futures contracts). So here’s an example that
applies the concept of options to a real world situation.
You walk into a car dealership and you see the car of your dreams: It’s shiny,
it looks beautiful, and you know you’ll look great in it! Unfortunately it costs
$100,000, and you can’t spend that amount of money on a car right now.
However, you’re due for a large bonus at work — or you just made a killing
trading commodities, have your pick! — and you’ll be able to pay for it in two
weeks. So you approach the car dealer and ask him to hold the car for you for
two weeks, at which point you can make full payment on it. 
The dealer agrees but insists that he will have to charge you $5000 for the
option to buy the car in two weeks for the set price of $100,000. You agree to
the terms and give him a non-refundable deposit of $5000 (known as the pre-
mium in options speak), which gives you the right, but not the obligation, to
come back in two weeks and purchase the car of your dreams. The dealer, on
the other hand, is obligated to sell you the car should you choose to exercise
your option to do so. In this situation, you are the holder of the option, while
the dealer is its underwriter. 
Consider two different scenarios that unfold during the two-week period.
The first one is that a few days after you purchase the option to buy the
vehicle, the car manufacturer announces that it will stop making vehicles
146
Part II: Getting Started 

of this kind — the car is now a limited series edition and becomes a collec-
tor’s car. Congratulations! The value of the car has now doubled overnight!
Because you and the dealer entered into an options agreement, the dealer
is obligated to sell you the car at $100,000 even though the car now costs
$200,000 — should you choose to exercise your rights as the option holder.
You come back to see the dealer, and you buy the car at the agreed upon
price of $100,000. You can now either drive your new car or you can turn
and sell it at current market price for a cool $95,000 profit ($200,000 –
$100,000 – $5000 = $95,000)!
The second scenario isn’t as rosy as the first. A few days after you sign the
options agreement, the car manufacturer announces that there is a defect
with the car’s CD player. The car works fine so the manufacturer doesn’t need
to recall it, but the built-in CD player is defective and not usable. Because of
this development, the value of the car drops to $80,000 (drivers like listening
to their CDs after all). As the holder of the option you are not obligated to
purchase the car. Remember, you have the right — but not the obligation —
to follow through on the contractual agreements of the contract. If you
choose not to purchase the car, you will have incurred the $5000 loss of the
premium you paid for the option. 
That, in a nutshell, is what trading options is all about. You can now take this
concept and apply it to profit in the capital markets in general, and the com-
modities market in particular. If you expect, for example, the price of the June
copper futures contract on the COMEX/NYMEX to increase, you can buy an
option on the COMEX/NYMEX that gives you the right to purchase the June
copper futures contract for a specific price. You pay a premium for this
option and, if you don’t exercise your option before the expiration date, the
only thing you lose is the premium. 
Trader talk
When talking about options, there are certain terms you have to know:
 Premium: The price you actually pay for the option. If you don’t exer-
cise your option, then the only money you lose is the premium you paid
for the contract in the first place. 
 Expiration date: The date at which the option expires. After the expira-
tion date, the contract is no longer valid. 
 Strike price: The predetermined price at which the underlying asset is
purchased or sold. 
 At-the-money: When the strike price is equal to the market price, the
option is known as being at-the-money.
147
Chapter 9: Back to the Future: Getting a Grip on Futures and Options

 In-the-money: In a call option, when the asset’s market price is above
the strike price, it is in-the-money. In the land of puts, an option is in-the-
money when the market price is below the strike price. 
 Out-of-the-money: When the market price is below the strike price in a
call option, that option is a money-loser: It’s out-of-the-money. When
the market price is greater than the strike price in a put option, it’s 
out-of-the-money. 
 Open interest: The total number of options or futures contracts that are
still open on any given trading session. This is an important measure of
market interest. 
Options have character
Every option has different characteristics, depending on how you want to
exercise the option and what action you want to conduct once it is exercised.
Put simply, you can use options that allow you to either buy or sell an under-
lying security. You can further specify at which point you want to exercise the
options agreement. This section lays out these characteristics for you.
Call options: Calling all investors
If you expect rising prices, you can buy a call option that gives you the right —
but not the obligation — to purchase a specific amount of a security at a spe-
cific price at specific point in the future. 
When you buy a call option, you’re being bullish and are expecting prices to
increase — call options are similar to having a long position. When you sell a
call option, you expect prices to fall. If the prices fall and never reach the
strike price, then you get to keep the premium. If prices increase and the
holder exercises her option, you’re obligated to sell her the underlying asset
at the agreed-upon price.
Putting everything on the line: Using put options
A put option is the exact opposite of a call option because it gives you the right,
but not the obligation, to sell a security at some point in the future for a prede-
termined price. When you think the price of a security is going down, you want
to use a put option to try and take advantage of this price movement. 
Buying a put option is one way of shorting a security. If prices do decrease,
you can then purchase the security at the agreed-upon (lower) price and
then turn back and sell it on the open market and pocket the difference. If, on
the other hand, prices increase, then you can choose to let the option expire.
In this case you will only lose the premium you paid for the option. 
148
Part II: Getting Started 

When you sell a put option, you believe that prices are going to increase. If
you’re correct and prices increase, then the holder won’t exercise the option,
which means you get to collect the premium. So when you sell a put option,
you’re actually being bullish. 
Here are the possible combinations of buying and selling put and call
options, accompanied by their corresponding market sentiment:
 Buying a call: Bullish
 Selling a call: Bearish
 Buying a put: Bearish
 Selling a put: Bullish
Buy American: Looking at American options
When you buy an American option, you have the right to exercise that option
at any time during the life of the option — from the start of the option until
the expiration date. Most options traded in the United States are American
options. You get a lot more flexibility out of them because you have the free-
dom to exercise them at any point.
The European alternative
The European option allows you to exercise the option only at expiration.
This is a fairly rigid kind of option. The only possible advantage of a
European option over an American option is that you may be able to pay
a smaller premium for this option. However, because of its rigidity, I highly
recommend you use American options in your trading strategies.

I
gotta start out this chapter by saying that technical analysis — like
investing in general — is not an exact science. I’ve been on Wall Street
long enough to know that there is a raging debate about the role of technical
analysis in the financial markets. Although a number of investors and traders
claim to have made fortunes using technical analysis, another large group of
investors believes it’s nothing more than voodoo. So just what is technical
analysis?
Put simply, technical analysis is used to examine a security’s past price pat-
terns in order to forecast its future price movements. Technical analysis is
based on the study of the interaction between supply and demand and its
effect on a security’s price. It assumes that there is a constant battle between
buyer and sellers (between bulls and bears), and it seeks to profit from this
battle by predicting the winner. This analysis is thus based partly on market
psychology and partly on market forces. 
So when should you actually use technical analysis? Technical analysis can
be applied at various stages of the investing cycle. Some of the most frequent
users of technical analysis are active day traders who want to profit by
making short-term bets on the direction of a security. So, if you’re an active
trader, then technical analysis can be a very useful tool for you. If you’re
investing for the long term, technical analysis can still provide useful insight
that other types of analyses don’t provide. 

In order to examine the interaction between buyers and sellers — and
between supply and demand — technical analysis relies on a number of tech-
nical indicators. In this chapter, I examine the most widely used indicators so
that you have a solid set of tools in your technical analysis toolkit. If you
want more information on other technical indicators, I recommend you check
out Technical Analysis For Dummies (Wiley).
As a general rule, don’t rely on just one indicator to make buying or selling
decisions. Rather, use each of the indicators I discuss in the chapter in con-
junction with other key metrics to drive a rational and balanced investment
approach. Relying on one metric is not very wise — you want to take into con-
sideration as many factors as possible to make an informed trading decision.
Looking at Charts: A Picture Is Worth
More Than a Thousand Words
The foundation of technical analysis is a chart that shows a security’s price
movements over a certain period of time; the primary charts are the line
chart, the bar chart, and the candlestick chart. 
All graph charts include an X and Y axis. Price is always plotted on the Y axis
and time — which could be days, weeks, months, years, or even minutes — is
plotted on the X axis. 
You can choose different timeframes for the chart — one day, one week, one
month, three months, six months, one year, three years, five years, and so
on —depending on a number of factors, such as your investment time frame,
holding period, and risk tolerance (which I cover in Chapter 3).
I recommend you look at a chart from the point the security you’re analyzing
started trading. This will give you a complete and comprehensive view of the
performance of that security, helping you develop both a long-term as well
as a short-term strategy. If you’re using a chart viewing service (such as the
ones I present below), you would get this information by clicking on Historical
Performance. 
Here are a few Web sites that offer good chart viewing services:
 Finance.yahoo.com: This is an all-around excellent financial Web site
that includes charts for everything from equities to commodity
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
 Futures.tradingcharts.com: This Web site includes advanced graph
functions for the world’s major commodities, from soybeans to platinum.

 Barchart.com: This site has a comprehensive list of all commodities
and futures contracts that trade on the major exchanges. A subscription
is required to access advanced chart services, although their non-
member section is quite useful as well. 
Line it up: Checking out line charts
A line chart is the most commonly used type of chart. It plots the closing price
of a security by taking one price point and connecting it with other price points
over a specific time period. The line chart is formed once all these price points
are connected to each other. See Figure 10-1 for an example of a line chart. 
The advantage of using a line chart is that you get a quick overview of the
commodity’s previous closing prices over a specific period of time. However,
the line chart leaves out crucial pieces of information — such as the opening
price or the day’s highs and lows — which can be useful to you as you’re con-
ducting your technical analysis. 
Going for bar charts
I like using bar charts because they contain a lot of practical information to
help you make better informed trading decisions. In a bar chart, every trad-
ing session is represented by a vertical line — sometimes known as a tick.
The tick contains four critical pieces of information about a security’s price
during a particular trading session: the opening price, the day’s high, the
day’s low, and the closing price. Because it includes all this information, the
bar chart provides a more complete picture of a security’s price movements
than the line chart. In Figure 10-2, I show you how these pieces of information
are depicted on a bar chart tick.

Chapter 10: Technically Speaking: Using Technical Analysis

Take a look again at Figure 10-2. How do you know which horizontal tick rep-
resents the closing price and which one the opening price? The convention
used in bar charts is that all closing prices are noted by a horizontal tick on
the right side of the vertical line, and all opening prices are represented by
the horizontal tick on the left. Figure 10-3 gives you an actual example of a
bar chart.
Not all bar charts include these four pieces of information. Some charts include
the day’s high, the day’s low, and the closing price, but not the opening price.
In these types of graphs, the closing price is depicted as a horizontal tick that
crosses both the right and left sides of the vertical line.

Lighting up the chart with candlesticks 
Like bar charts, candlestick charts include information on the four crucial pieces
of a security’s performance during a trading session: opening price, daily high,
daily low, and closing price. Figure 10-4 demonstrates a candlestick tick. 
In addition, candlesticks use a color-coordinated system to identify whether
the trading session for a commodity ended higher or lower. Essentially, when
a commodity closes lower than its opening price, called a downtick, it will be
a dark color. Conversely, when the commodity closes higher than when it
opened, called an uptick, it will be a light color (see Figure 10-5). 
Most charts include traditional black and white colors, although some use
more exotic colors such as red (downtick) and green (uptick). 
This system allows you to quickly determine the commodity’s performance
during a particular trading session. Out of all the charts, candlesticks provide
you with the most detailed information about a security, which is why I prefer
using them over bar charts and line charts. That said, if you’re looking for a
quick overview of performance, I recommend using the line chart. If you’re
looking for something that combines the detail of the candlestick chart and
the big picture approach of the line chart, then the bar chart is your best bet.
Take a look at Figure 10-6 for an actual example of a candlestick chart.

Chapter 10: Technically Speaking: Using Technical Analysis

Identifying Patterns: The Trend
Is Your Friend
The basic premise of technical analysis is the constant interaction between
buyers and sellers of a particular financial instrument, which is really just the
interplay between the forces of supply and demand. Put simply, everything
else constant, when there is increased demand for a security, the price of that
security goes up. Conversely, when there is more supply of a security than
demand, prices will go down. This information then helps you determine the
future price direction of a commodity.
Support and resistance are two important technical indicators that seek to
gauge the relationship between buyers and sellers. In this section, I show you
how to identify support and resistance lines and what to do with them. 
Identifying support and resistance
When demand for a commodity is strong enough, prices begin to remain at or
above a particular level, which is known as support. Support is nothing more
than a line that supports preexisting price levels. Technically, support is where
demand is strong enough — or at least stronger than supply — that it prevents
any further price declines. Figure 10-7 is an example of a support line in action.

On the other end of the spectrum is resistance. Resistance is the exact oppo-
site (or mirror) of support in that it is the level where supply (number of sell-
ers) is so strong that it prevents any further price increases. Figure 10-8 is an
example of resistance, where prices are not able to go past a certain point. 
So how do you actually establish support and resistance? It’s quite simple:
Use the commodity’s previous highs to establish resistance and use its previ-
ous lows to establish its support line. For resistance, take the average of the

previous highs, as seen on the chart, and draw a straight line through that
average. For support, you take the average of the previous lows on the chart
and draw a straight line through that. 
Again, support and resistance lines are not set in stone and are likely to fluc-
tuate as prices increase or decrease. These lines are meant to give you a ball-
park estimate of a commodity’s trading range.

Part II: Getting Started 
What is the difference between technical 
and fundamental analysis?
If you want to witness a good argument, put a
fundamental analyst and a technical analyst in
the same room — but I recommend you take a
couple of steps back because the argument may
get a little heated! Just as there’s a constant
battle between bulls and bears in the financial
markets, it seems that fundamental analysts and
technicians are constantly at odds with each
other. Perhaps it’s because each side approaches
investing in radically different ways. 
Fundamental analysis is a method of investing
that places a premium on the fundamentals of a
financial instrument. For example if a funda-
mental analyst is analyzing a company’s stock,
she will take a look at the company’s balance
sheet, income statement, and statement of cash
flows. She will analyze the underlying health of
a company, focusing on data on assets and lia-
bilities and on income and expenses. As such,
fundamental analysis focuses on the “basics”
of a company or security. (I examine some of
these key fundamental metrics for energy com-
panies in Chapter 14 and for mining companies
in Chapter 18.) 
Technical analysis, on the other hand, does not
concern itself too much with the underlying
security’s health. Technical analysis studies the
interaction between sellers and buyers of a
security and attempts to predict future price
patterns based on a study of this interaction.
Technicians rely on graphs, charts, and other
trading information to forecast the price of a
security. They tend to only concern themselves
with what’s going on in the actual marketplace. 
So which is the better approach? As a general
rule, investors who have a long investment hori-
zon use fundamental analysis to identify a com-
pany or commodity that’s in good health. They
choose the healthiest company and park their
money there, not worrying about day-to-day fluc-
tuations. The assumption is that a security with
good fundamentals will tend to outperform a
security whose fundamentals are shaky over the
long term (Warren Buffett’s investment strategy
is based on this philosophy). Most short-term
investors (traders) seek to profit in the market-
place by placing short-term bets on a security’s
price movements. These traders rely on techni-
cal analysis because it gives them a good idea of
where a security is heading in the short term. 
In a nutshell, if you’re investing for the long
term, then fundamental analysis may provide
you with better results. If, on the other hand,
your investing timeframe is short, then techni-
cal analysis may give you better results. That
being said, I recommend you use a combination
of both fundamental and technical analysis
when you’re investing because each one pro-
vides information that the other one does not.

Trend lines: Ride the trend till the end
Support and resistance lines are used to identify and establish price trend
lines. One of the major assumptions of technical analysis is that prices tend
to move in established patterns; in other words they follow a trend. Trend
lines are in fact based on Isaac Newton’s First Law of Motion, which states
that an object in uniform motion tends to remain in uniform motion, unless it
is acted upon by outside forces. This is what technical analysis is all about:
identifying the trend and then riding that trend till the end, either when it
stops or reverses. 
You want to be familiar with the two types of trend lines that exist in the
world of technical analysis: uptrends and downtrends. 
Uptrends
An uptrend line has a positive slope and is nothing more than an upward slop-
ing support line. Support is established because there are more buyers than
sellers and this drives up the price of the commodity. Figure 10-9 shows an
example of an uptrend line in action.

Chapter 10: Technically Speaking: Using Technical Analysis

Downtrends
A downtrend line has a negative slope and is the equivalent of a downwardly
sloped resistance line. When a commodity is trending downward, there are
more sellers than buyers, and this is what puts downward pressure on the
price. Figure 10-10 shows a good example of a downtrend line in action. 
Once you identify a trend, I would not recommend trading against that trend
because a confirmed trend tends to continue along the same path. In other
words, if a commodity is trending upward, you probably want to be on the
buy-side because there are more buyers than sellers (that’s what is actually
causing the upward trend). The only time you should trade against a pre-
existing trend is if that trend breaks down or establishes a new trend in the
opposite direction (known as a trend reversal). 
Pump Up the Volume!
After price, the trading volume of a security is perhaps the most important
indicator in technical analysis. If you ever consider buying or selling a
commodity — or any other security for that matter — looking at volume is
critical.
What does volume indicate, anyway? Volume is the best measure of interest by
the investing community in a commodity or other security. When investors are
interested in an asset — whether on the buy side or the sell side — you are
going to see large spikes in volume, which is an indication of large amounts of

trading activity. When investors aren’t interested in a commodity, volume will
be fairly dry. 
An increase in trading volume accompanying a price spike is a sign of
accumulation — that investors are busy accumulating, or acquiring, the
commodity. This is a very good, bullish sign if you’re long the commodity or
considering going long the commodity. (Turn to Chapter 9 for more on going
long.) This means that the trend has been identified and, more importantly, it
has been confirmed. In Figure 10-11, I give you an example of a price increase
accompanied by a spike in volume.
Besides being a measure of supply and demand, volume can confirm whether
a commodity is experiencing a reliable run-up in price or whether it is going
through a false breakout. A price increase that’s not accompanied by a spike
in volume is not such a good sign because the price is increasing without
heavy accumulation. This signals that the price run-up could falter — that this
may be a false breakout. Volume, therefore, provides confirmation of the trend. 
If the price of the commodity is going down on heavy volume (when volume
is high), get out! This means that the commodity is experiencing heavy distri-
bution, or selling. Of course, if you’re short the commodity, then by all means
hold on to your position. (For more on going long and short, make sure you
check out Chapter 9.)

Chapter 10: Technically Speaking: Using Technical Analysis

Moving Averages: Anything But Average
The Moving Average (MA) is a widely used technical indicator that charts the
average of a security’s price over a specific period of time. You can use two
types of Moving Averages: the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the
Enhanced Moving Average (EMA). 
Keeping it simple with the SMA
The SMA, like its name implies, takes a straightforward, equally weighted
approach to the concept of moving averages. The SMA takes the average of a
security’s price over a specific period of time and places an equal weighting
on all the averages. In other words, the price of the commodity during each
of the trading sessions has the same statistical significance. 
For example, if you take a 50-day SMA of a security, the performance of that
security on Day 3 has the same weight as its performance on Day 44. 
Calculating the moving average is not very difficult. Simply add the closing
prices of the commodity over X number of days and then divide the total by
X. For instance, to calculate the 200-day SMA, add the closing prices of the
commodity over the past 200 trading sessions and divide it by 200. 
While you can create an SMA for any period of time, the most widely used
SMAs are the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA. 
The SMA is a fluid metric that is in constant flux because it takes into
account the commodity’s closing price over a fixed number of trading
sessions. Figure 10-12 shows an SMA overlay to illustrate this point. 
Taking it up a notch with the EMA
One of the biggest drawbacks of the SMA is that it places the same weight on
a commodity’s most recent prices as it does on older prices. This creates a
lag in the SMA’s sensitivity to recent price changes, making it a less accurate
portratyal of current trends. As a result, many investors use an improved (or
at least a more accurate) version of the SMA: the Enhanced Moving Average
or EMA (sometimes also known as the Exponential Moving Average). 
The EMA is an extension of the SMA and emphasizes a commodity’s more
recent prices over older ones. This emphasis allows for a better price reaction
sensitivity, which means that the EMA reacts more quickly and accurately to
recent price movements. This, in turn, is a more accurate predictor of where
the commodity’s price is heading. Notice in Figure 10-13 that the EMA for
162
Part II: Getting Started 

Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is much more sensitive to price movements
than the SMA in Figure 10-13, particularly towards the most recent trading
sessions. 
Both the SMA and EMA are good indicators of established price trends. But
which is better? I recommend using the SMA if your investment time horizon
is long term because the SMA is a more accurate projection of long-term
price patterns and doesn’t fluctuate as much with recent price moves. On the
other hand, if you’re investing for the short term, then you want to be able to
react as quickly as possible to recent and sudden price fluctuations, in which
case the EMA is a better indicator.

Chapter 10: Technically Speaking: Using Technical Analysis

Both the SMA and EMA are good indicators when the commodity is following
a confirmed trend — either an upward trend or a downward trend. But don’t
rely too heavily on the moving averages when the security is not following a
confirmed trend line because MAs are lagging indicators whose strength is in
identifying confirmed patterns, not in predicting sudden price reversals or
breakdowns. 
It’s All Relative: Using the RSI
The Relative Strength Index, also known as the RSI, is a useful tool you can use
to measure the price momentum or velocity of a commodity. The RSI measures
the rate of change of a commodity’s price by comparing the average price
change of a commodity’s price increases with the average price change of
that commodity’s price decreases. 
The technical designation of the RSI is momentum oscillator because it tries to
gauge the momentum, or how fast a commodity is changing, over a certain
period. The RSI quantifies the magnitude between a commodity’s upward and
downward price movements by using the following formula: 
RSI = 100 – 100/(1 + RS)
Where 
RS = Average gain of the days the commodity closes upward divided by
Average gain of the days the commodity closes downward
The number of days taken into consideration is up to you, although most RSI
indicators take into account a period of 14 trading sessions. 
The RSI is measured by a number between 0 and 100. The higher the RSI, the
more the commodity is said to be overbought. In other words, it is overval-
ued, and a decrease in price may be around the corner. Although there isn’t a
specific number that indicates with absolute certainty whether a commodity
is overvalued, 70 is generally used as the cutoff. 
Similarly, an RSI figure of 30 or below indicates that a commodity is oversold,
or undervalued. A low RSI number is a bullish indicator and may signal price
increases in the near future. Take a close look at how the RSI moves — or
oscillates — with the price of the security in Figure 10-14. 
As a general rule, a high RSI is a sell signal while a low RSI is a buy signal.

Breaking into Bollinger Bands
Bollinger Bands, developed by the analyst John Bollinger, is a technical indi-
cator that uses a system of fluctuating bands that encompass the security to
determine its volatility.
The Bollinger Bands system uses three bands. The primary, or middle, band —
the basis of the Bollinger Bands system — is a straightforward Simple Moving
Average (SMA) The second, upper band is plotted as the SMA plus two stan-
dard deviation units. The third, lower band is the SMA minus two standard
deviation units. 
In statistics, standard deviation is often used as a measure of volatility.
Standard deviation is calculated using a mathematical formula that essen-
tially measures how spread out certain points are from a given arithmetic
mean. This is sometimes known as statistical dispersion and is applied in tech-
nical analysis to determine volatility. 
Because Bollinger Bands move in tandem with the SMA, they continually
shadow the price of the security on a relative basis. When prices become
more volatile, the Bollinger Bands tend to expand. Similarly, when prices
become more stable, the Bollinger Bands adjust themselves by contracting. 
When prices approach the upper band, this indicates that the commodity is
overbought. The commodity is overvalued and will likely face downward price
pressures in future trading sessions. In other words, prices approaching the
upper band is a bearish sign.

Chapter 10: Technically Speaking: Using Technical Analysis

On the other hand, when the price flirts with the lower band, this indicates
that the commodity is oversold and undervalued. When the price approaches
the lower band, this is generally viewed as a bullish signal. Take a look at
Figure 10-15 to see how Bollinger Bands move in tandem with a security. 
Bollinger Bands are best used in conjunction with other technical metrics.
When I’m using technical analysis, the first things I look at are the support
and resistance lines and the moving averages, and I use this information to
identify trend lines and the likely direction of the commodity. If I need addi-
tional confirmation of a trend, I will then use secondary technical indicators
such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger Bands. In other words,
use Bollinger Bands after you’ve looked at the other primary technical met-
rics for confirmation purposes.

C
rude oil is undoubtedly the king of commodities, in terms of both its pro-
duction value and its importance to the global economy. Crude oil is the
most traded nonfinancial commodity in the world today, and it supplies 40
percent of the world’s total energy needs — more than any other single com-
modity. In fact, more barrels of crude oil are traded on a daily basis (85
Million Barrels, 2006 figures) than any other commodity. Crude oil’s impor-
tance also stems from the fact that it is the base product for a number of
indispensable goods. Gasoline, jet fuel, plastics, and a number of other neces-
sary products are derived from it. 
The importance of crude oil to the global economy was illustrated during the
Arab Oil Embargo of 1973. During that year, the Arab members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) placed an embargo on
crude oil shipments to Western countries. Within a matter of weeks, the price
of crude oil skyrocketed by 400 percent, and a number of industrialized
nations were thrown into recessions, experiencing high inflation and high
unemployment for a number of years thereafter. The oil price shocks of the
1970s and their debilitating effects on the global economy underscored crude
oil’s indispensability.
Oil is truly the lifeblood of the global economy. Without it, the modern world
would come to a screeching halt. Drivers wouldn’t be able to drive their cars,
ships would have no fuel to transport goods around the world, and airplanes
would be grounded indefinitely. 

Because of its preeminent role in the global economy, crude oil makes for a
great investment. In this chapter, I show you how to make money investing in
what is arguably the world’s greatest natural resource. However, the oil
industry is a multidimensional, complex business with many players with
often conflicting interests. So proceeding with a bit of caution and making
sure to understand the market fundamentals is essential for success. 
In the following sections, I give you an overview of the global oil industry and
the many links in the oil supply chain. I analyze consumption and production
figures, introduce you to the major players (both countries and companies),
and show you the best ways to execute a sound investment strategy. 
Crude Realities
Having a good understanding of the global consumption and production pat-
terns is important if you’re considering investing in the oil industry. Knowing
how much oil is produced in the world, by which countries, and to which
consumers it is shipped allows you to develop an investment strategy that
benefits from the oil market fundamentals. 
I’m sometimes amazed at some of the misconceptions regarding the oil indus-
try. For example, I was once speaking with students about energy indepen-
dence and I was shocked when a majority of them claimed that the United
States got over 50 percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia in
particular; in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. 
The United States is the third largest producer of crude oil in the world. Take
a look at Table 11-2, and you’ll quickly see that the United States produces
over 7 Million Barrels a day (this includes oil products), behind only Saudi
Arabia and Russia. In fact, the United States didn’t become a net importer of
oil until 1993; up until that point the United States produced over 50 percent
of the oil it consumed domestically. 
Currently (2006 figures) the United States imports about 65 percent of its oil.
If energy (oil) independence is measured by the percentage of oil a country
imports, then the United States is more energy independent than both
Germany (which imports 80 percent of its oil) and Japan (which imports
more than 90 percent). 
The biggest oil exporter to the United States isn’t a Middle Eastern country
but our friendly northern neighbor. That’s right: Canada is the largest
exporter of crude oil to the United States in the world! Persian Gulf oil makes
up about 20 percent of imported oil.

Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

My point here is that there’s a lot of misinformation out there about this
topic, and you need to be armed with the correct figures to be a successful
investor. In the following sections, I show you which metrics are closely mon-
itored by all the market participants (traders, major oil companies, and pro-
ducing/consuming countries) — such as global reserve estimates, daily
production rates, daily consumption rates, daily export figures, and daily
import figures. I present you with the most up-to-date information regarding
oil production and consumption patterns. Because these patterns are likely
to change in the future because of supply and demand, I also show you where
you can go to get the latest information on the oil markets. This will make
you a better investor. 
No need for a reservation: Examining
global reserve estimates
As an investor, knowing which countries have large crude oil deposits is an
important part of your investment strategy. As demand for crude oil
increases, countries that have large deposits of this natural resource stand to
benefit tremendously. One way to benefit from this trend is to invest in
indigenous countries and companies with large reserves of crude oil (I go
through this strategy in detail in the last section of this chapter). 
The Oil & Gas Journal estimates that global proven crude oil reserves are
1,292 Billion Barrels (1.29 Trillion Barrels). In Table 11-1, I list the countries
with the largest proven crude oil reserves. These figures may change as new
oilfields are discovered and as new technologies allow for the extraction of
additional oil from existing fields. 
171
Chapter 11: It's a Crude, Crude World! Investing in Crude Oil
Mad Max is mad about oil
Remember the 1980s movie Mad Max, which
launched Mel Gibson’s career? The movie,
which was released only a few years after the
Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, is actually a depiction
of a world without oil. If you recall, the movie
portrays a society that is plunged into civil dis-
order, chaos, and unrest as a result of a fuel
shortage. The citizens resort to violence and
mayhem in order to steal any fuel they can get
their hands on. 
This high-octane drama demonstrates the
extent to which societies were affected by the
oil shocks of the 1970s and underscores the
importance of oil as an essential element of
modern life.

Although Canada is not on this list, it has proven reserves of 4.7 Billion
Barrels of conventional crude oil — crude that is easily recoverable and
accounted for. In addition to conventional crude, Canada is rich in unconven-
tional crude oil located in oil sands. Oil from oil sands is much more difficult
to extract and, as a result, is generally not included toward the calculation of
official and conventional reserve estimates. However, if Canada’s oil sands
were included, Canada would be catapulted to the number-two spot with a
grand total of 178 Billion Barrels. 
Another point to keep in mind is that having large deposits of crude doesn’t
mean that a country has exploited and developed all of its oilfields. For exam-
ple, although Iraq has the third largest oil deposits in the world, it’s not even
in the top ten list of producing countries because of poor and underdevel-
oped infrastructure. There is a big difference between proven reserves and
actual production. (See Table 11-2 in the following section.) 
The calculation of proven, recoverable deposits of crude oil is not an exact
science. For example, the Oil & Gas Journal figures are different from those of
the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which in turn are different from
those from the International Energy Agency (IEA). I recommend following a
“big picture” approach to global reserve estimates and consulting all the
major sources for these statistics. To keep up on updated figures and statis-
tics on the oil industry, check out the following organizations:

Staying busy and productive: Looking at
production figures
Identifying the countries with large reserves is important, but it’s only a starting
point as you start investing in the oil markets. In order to determine which
countries are exploiting these reserves adequately, I recommend looking at
another important metric: actual production. Having large reserves is meaning-
less if a country isn’t tapping those reserves to produce oil. In Table 11-2, I list
the top ten producers of crude oil.

A number of factors influence how much crude a country is able to pump out of
the ground on a daily basis, such as geopolitical stability and the application of
technologically advanced crude recovery techniques. Also, remember that daily
production may vary across the year because of disruptions resulting from
geopolitical events such as embargos, sanctions, and sabotage that put a stop to
daily production or from other external factors like weather. Think of Hurricane
Katrina and its devastating effect on U.S. oil supply in the summer of 2005. 
173
Chapter 11: It's a Crude, Crude World! Investing in Crude Oil

You need to keep a close eye on global daily supply because any disruption
in the production supply chain can have a strong impact on the current price
of crude oil. Because there is a tight supply-and-demand equation, any dis-
ruption in supply can send prices for crude skyrocketing. 
Traders in the commodity exchanges follow the daily crude oil production
numbers closely. Benchmark crude oil contracts such as the West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)
and the North Sea Brent traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in
London are affected by supply numbers. As a result, any geopolitical event or
natural disaster that may reduce production is closely watched by the
market. (Check out Chapter 9 for more on the crude oil futures contracts.) 
If you’re an active oil trader with a futures account, then following these daily
production numbers — which are available through the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) Web site at www.eia.doe.gov — is crucial. The futures
markets are particularly sensitive to these numbers, and any event that takes
crude off the market can have a sudden impact on crude futures contracts. If,
on the other hand, you’re a long-term investor in the markets, monitoring this
number is also important because production figures can have an effect on
the general stock market performance as well. For example, if rebels seize a
pipeline in Nigeria and 300,000 Barrels of Nigerian crude are taken off the
market, this will result in higher crude prices, which will have an impact on
U.S. stocks (they generally fall). Thus your stock portfolio holdings may be at
risk because of daily crude oil production disruptions. Therefore monitoring
this statistic regularly is important for both short-term traders as well as
long-term investors. 
It can be demanding: Checking 
out demand figures
The United States tops the list of oil consumers and has been the single
largest consumer of crude oil for the last 25 years. While a lot of folks pay
attention to the demand increase from China and India, most of the demand
for crude oil (and the resulting price pressures) still comes from the United
States. While supply is a closely watched metric by traders around the world,
demand figures are equally important because they indicate a steady and
sustained increase in crude demand for the mid- to long term. This is likely to
maintain increased pressure on crude prices. I list the top ten consumers of
crude oil in the world in Table 11-3.

As of 2006, global consumption stood at approximately 85 Million Barrels per
day. The United States and China are currently the biggest consumers of
crude oil in the world, and this trend will continue throughout the 21st cen-
tury, with global consumption expected to increase to 120 Million Barrels a
day by 2025.

Always design an investment strategy that will profit from long-term trends.
This steady increase in global demand for crude oil is a good reason to be
bullish on oil prices. 
Going in and out: Eyeing 
imports and exports
Another pair of numbers you need to keep close tabs on is export and import
figures. Exports are different from production because a country can produce
a lot of oil and consume most, if not all, of it — just like the United States. On
the other end of the spectrum, a country can produce plenty of oil and
export most of it. Identifying the top exporting countries is helpful because
this allows you to zero in on the countries that are actually generating rev-
enues from the sale of crude oil to other countries. Countries that are net
exporters of crude stand to benefit tremendously from the oil boom and you
can get in on the action by investing domestically in these countries, a strat-
egy I outline in the final section of this chapter. In Table 11-4, I list the top oil-
exporting countries in 2006.

Although exports receive a lot of attention from traders, imports, which rep-
resent the other side of equation, are equally important. Countries that are
main importers of crude oil are primarily advanced, industrialized societies
like Germany and the United States. This means that these countries are rich
enough that they can absorb crude oil price increases, but as a general rule,
the importers face a lot of pressure during any price increases. This pressure
is sometimes translated into lower stock market performances in the import-
ing countries, which means you should be careful if you’re exposed to the
domestic stock markets of these oil importers. I list the top crude oil import-
ing countries of 2006 in Table 11-5. 
177
Chapter 11: It's a Crude, Crude World! Investing in Crude Oil
What is OPEC and how does 
it affect the oil markets?
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) is made up of countries that
are involved in the production and export of
crude oil products around the world. Currently
OPEC has 11 member countries: Algeria,
Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), and Venezuela. Because OPEC’s mem-
bers collectively hold about 65 percent of total
crude oil reserves and produce 40 percent of
the world’s oil, they have considerable influence
on the markets. 
OPEC’s members meet regularly at its head-
quarters in Vienna, Austria, in order to establish
the course of action for its members. Because
its members are key players in the global oil
markets, any decision taken by OPEC can sig-
nificantly affect the price of oil on a global scale.
One mechanism through which OPEC achieves
this influence is through the use of a quota
system, where individual members must follow
pre-established production quotas. 
OPEC quotas are an important statistic to regu-
larly keep your eye on because they dictate the
level of oil production for some of the world’s
most important oil producers. But even more
important than the self-imposed quotas is the
actual oil production from each member coun-
try because that may differ from the quotas:
Some countries, enticed by the high price of
crude, are sometimes tempted to increase their
production because this means more petrodol-
lars in their coffers. This is ironic because the
production quota is partly responsible for the
increased prices, meaning prices decrease as
production increases. You can keep track of
regular developments from OPEC that may
affect oil markets through the OPEC Web site at
www.opec.org. Although OPEC’s influence
on the markets has diminished since the 1973
Arab Oil Embargo, it still wields considerable
influence over the oil markets.

Going Up the Crude Chain
Crude oil by itself isn’t very useful; it derives its value from its derivative
products. Only after it is processed and refined into consumable products
such as gasoline, propane, and jet fuel does it become so valuable. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain the contents of crude oil and go through some of
the products that can be extracted from crude. 
Crude oil was formed across millions of years from the remains of dead ani-
mals and other organisms whose bodies decayed in the Earth. Because of a
number of geological factors such as sedimentation, these remains were
eventually transformed into crude oil deposits. Therefore, crude oil is liter-
ally a fossil fuel — a fuel derived from fossils. As a matter of fact, the word
petroleum comes from the Latin words petra, which means rock, and oleum,
which means oil. So the word petroleum literally means oil from the rocks! 
Take a look at some of the products an average barrel of crude oil yields in
Figure 11-2.
178
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

A barrel holds 42 Gallons of crude oil or crude oil equivalents. (That’s about
159 Liters.) Barrel is abbreviated as bbl; barrels as bbls.
You want that light and sweet 
or heavy and sour?
Not all crudes are created equal. If you invest in crude oil, you need to realize
right off the bat that crude oil comes in different qualities with different char-
acteristics. You’d be surprised at how different that “black stuff” can be from
region to region. Generally speaking crude oil is classified into two broad cat-
egories: light and sweet, and heavy and sour. There are other classifications,
but these are the two major ones. 
The two criteria most widely used to determine the quality of crude oil are
density and sulfur content. Density usually refers to how much a crude oil will
yield in terms of products, such as heating oil and jet fuel. For instance, a
crude oil with lower density, known as a light crude, tends to yield higher
levels of products. On the other hand, a crude oil with high density, com-
monly referred to as a heavy crude, will have lower product yields.

Chapter 11: It's a Crude, Crude World! Investing in Crude Oil

The density of a crude oil, also known as the gravity, is measured by a scale
devised by the American Petroleum Institute (API). The higher the API
number, expressed in degrees, the lower the density of the crude oil.
Therefore, a crude oil with density of 43 degrees API will yield more desirable
crude oil products than a crude oil with 35 degrees API. Heavy crude (which
is found in Venezuela and Canada) has an API degree of 20 or below. 
Sulfur content is another key determinant of crude oil quality. Sulfur is a corro-
sive material that decreases the purity of a crude oil. Therefore a crude oil
with high sulfur content, which is known as sour, is much less desirable than
a crude oil with low sulfur content, known as sweet crude. 
How is this important to you as an investor? First, if you want to invest in the
oil industry, you need to know what kind of oil you’re going to get for your
money. If you’re going to invest in an oil company, you need to be able to
determine which type of crude it is processing. You can find this information
in the company’s annual or quarterly reports. A company involved in the pro-
duction of light, sweet crude will generate more revenue from this premium
crude than one involved in the processing of heavy, sour crude. This doesn’t
mean you shouldn’t invest in companies with exposure to heavy, sour crude;
you just have to factor the type into your investment strategy. 
In Table 11-6, I list some important crude oils and their characteristics.

As you can see, you can choose from a wide variety of crude oil products as
investments. If you’re interested in investing in a specific country, you need
to find out what kind of crude oil it produces. Ideally you want a crude oil
with low sulfur content and a high API number as a density benchmark.

Chapter 11: It's a Crude, Crude World! Investing in Crude Oil
What’s the deal with peak oil? 
Is the world really running out of oil? The con-
cept of peak oil has generated much attention
in recent years. A plethora of books have been
written about whether the world is running out
of oil, and proponents (and opponents) of this
theory have hit the airwaves en masse. This is a
serious topic, but unfortunately folks tend to get
carried away and start spinning tales of global
gloom and doom. It’s important to remain level
headed when talking about this issue. Basically,
you have two schools of thought on the matter.
The first school argues that the world has
already reached peak production and that
demand is going to quickly suck out what’s
remaining of crude in the world. The other side
argues that the world still has abundant crude
oil supplies and that, through technological
developments and other means, crude oil that
wasn’t previously extractable will be brought to
market. Both arguments have some merit. First,
crude oil is a finite resource and, by definition, is
available only in limited quantities. However,
people have been saying that the world is going
to run out of oil since the first commercially
viable oil well was discovered in Titusville,
Pennsylvania, back in 1859. One hundred and
fifty years later and the world still hasn’t run out
of oil. Does this mean that the world will never
run out of oil? Of course not. But it does indicate
that these calls have been made before and are
likely to continue well into the future. 
Many experts agree that completely running out
of oil in the near future is an unlikely event. I
prefer to put it this way: The world is not about
to run out of oil — the world is about to run out
of cheap, high-quality, and readily available oil.
The light, sweet crude oil that refiners prefer
because of its high products yield (discussed in
the section “You want that light and sweet or
heavy and sour?” and in Chapter 13) is running
low. However, the world still has plenty of crude
that’s of a heavier quality. Just look at Canada’s
oil sands. This heavy crude is not preferred
because of its low quality, but there is plenty of
it to go around for a long time. In addition, tech-
nological advances (such as horizontal drilling)
are enabling previously unextractable oil to now
be extracted. Therefore the oil fields are yield-
ing more crude than ever before, both percent-
agewise and on an absolute basis. 
What you should be concerned about at the end
of the day as an investor are the fundamentals
of the market. Whether the world is running out
of oil is a hot debate that receives a lot of atten-
tion; but panic is not an investment strategy. If
the world is truly running out of oil, you just need
to look at the market fundamentals and develop
an investment strategy that’s going to take
advantage of these fundamentals. 
If history is a guide, humans can be extremely
resourceful when it comes to sustaining them-
selves. If crude does run out, there will be other
alternative sources of energy (which I look at in
Chapter 13). Because energy is necessary to
human life, you can be sure that alternatives will
be developed. There is already a move towards
investing in alternative energy sources, such as
wind and solar energy, as well as other more
abundant fossil fuels such as coal. This trend
should continue in the coming years. As an
investor, you need to go where the value is. 

Make Big Bucks with Big Oil
The price of crude oil has skyrocketed during these first years of the 21st
century; if these years are any indication for what’s in store for oil, then you
definitely want to develop a winning game plan to take advantage of this
trend. Figure 11-3 shows the increasing price of crude oil from 1997 to 2006. 
I talk about how to invest directly in West Texas Intermediate crude oil and
other oil futures contracts in Chapter 9. 
A lot of people are making a lot of money from the high price of crude and
gasoline. Why shouldn’t you be one of them? In this section, I show you how
to actually profit from the high prices at the pump!
Oil companies: Lubricated and 
firing on all cylinders
Oil companies get a lot of bad rap. Whatever you may think of them, they
make for a great investment. Oil companies are responsible for bringing pre-
cious energy products to consumers, and for this service they are compen-
sated — handsomely. Oil companies are for-profit companies that are run for
the benefit of their shareholders. Instead of complaining about oil companies,
why not become a shareholder of one (or more)!

In this section, I talk about the integrated oil companies, sometimes known as
“big oil,” “the majors,” or “integrated oil companies.” These are the oil com-
panies that are involved in all the phases of the oil production process —
from exploring for oil, to refining it, to transporting it to consumers.
ExxonMobil, Chevron Texaco, and BP are all “big oil” companies. 
Big oil companies aren’t the only players in the oil business. A number of other
companies are involved in specific aspects of the transformational process of
crude oil. For example, you have companies like Valero that are primarily
involved in refining and others such as General Maritime that own fleets of
tankers that transport crude oil and products. I discuss how to invest in these
companies — the refiners, transporters, and explorers — in Chapter 14. 
Flying solo: Looking at individual oil companies
The major oil companies have been posting record profits. In 2005, ExxonMobil
announced the largest annual corporate profit in history as it earned a staggering
$36.1 Billion on revenues of $371 Billion! To put it in perspective, Saudi Arabia’s
2005 GDP was $338 Billion. Exxon’s 2005 profits were 20 percent higher than its
2004 profits, which were over 10 percent higher than the previous year’s! 
Another big oil company, ConocoPhillips, raked in $13.53 Billion in profits for
2005, up 66 percent from the previous year. Chevron Corp., meanwhile,
posted $14.1 Billion in earnings for 2005. These mouthwatering announce-
ments are a direct result of the increased global demand for crude oil and its
products. As global demand continues and supplies remain limited, I expect
big oil companies to keep generating record revenues and profits. This is an
investment you cannot afford to miss. In Table 11-7, I list some of the compa-
nies that you could include in your portfolio.

Chapter 11: It's a Crude, Crude World! Investing in Crude Oil

This is only a brief snapshot of some of the major integrated oil companies
you can choose from to add to your portfolio. For a more comprehensive list,
check out Yahoo! Finance’s section on integrated oil companies at
http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/120.html.
Market capitalization, sometimes abbreviated as market cap, is a measure of
the size of a corporation. Market cap is calculated by multiplying the number
of shares outstanding by the price per share. 
Most of these traditional oil companies have now moved into other areas in
the energy sphere. These companies not only process crude oil into different
products, but they also have vast petrochemicals businesses as well as grow-
ing projects involving natural gas and, increasingly, alternative energy
sources. (To reflect this shift, for example, BP has changed its name from
British Petroleum to Beyond Petroleum.) The bottom line is that investing in
these oil companies gives you exposure to other sorts of products in the
energy industry as well. 
Although market capitalization, revenues, and earnings are important metrics
to look at before investing in these companies, you also need to perform a
thorough due diligence that takes into consideration other important factors
that determine a company’s health. I introduce some of these key metrics to
help you decide the most suitable energy companies for your portfolio in
Chapter 14. 
Oil company ETFs: Strength in numbers
If you can’t decide which oil company you want to invest in, you have several
other options at your disposal, which allow you to buy the market, so to
speak. One option is to buy Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the
performance of a group of integrated oil companies (I discuss ETFs in
Chapter 6). Here are a few oil company ETFs to consider:
 iShares S&P Global Energy Sector (AMEX: IXC): This ETF mirrors the
performance of the Standard & Poor’s Global Energy Sector index.
Buying this ETF gives you exposure to companies such as ExxonMobil,
Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Royal Dutch Shell. The ETF, launched at
the end of 2001, has 35 percent aggregate returns for a 3-year period. 
 Energy Select Sector SPDR (AMEX: XLE): The XLE ETF is the largest
energy ETF in the market. It is part of the S&P’s family of Standard & Poor’s
Depository Receipts (SPDR), commonly referred to as spiders, and tracks
the performance of a basket of oil company stocks. Some of the stocks it
tracks include the majors ExxonMobil and Chevron; however, it also
tracks oil services companies such as Halliburton and Schlumberger
(which I discuss in Chapter 14). You get a nice mix of integrated oil com-
panies as well as other independent firms by investing in the XLE. 
184
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

 iShares Goldman Sachs Natural Resources Sector (AMEX: IGE): The
IGE ETF mirrors the performance of the Goldman Sachs Natural
Resources Sector index, which tracks the performance of companies like
ConocoPhillips, Chevron, and BP as well as refiners such as Valero and
Suncor. (I talk about refiners in Chapter 14.) Although a majority of this
ETF is invested in integrated oil companies, it also provides you with a
way to play a broad spectrum of energy companies. 
Get your passport ready:
Investing overseas
Another great way to capitalize on oil profits is to invest in an emerging
market fund that invests in countries that sit on large deposits of crude oil
and that have the infrastructure in place to export crude oil. 
Even though a country may have large deposits of crude oil, it isn’t necessar-
ily able to produce and export crude oil for a profit. Iraq is a good example.
Even though it sits on the third largest reserves of crude oil in the world (see
Table 11-1), Iraq isn’t even one of the top ten exporters of crude because the
infrastructure and security environment isn’t secure enough. 
185
Chapter 11: It's a Crude, Crude World! Investing in Crude Oil
John D. Rockefeller: Father of the 
modern oil industry
A majority of today’s most important oil compa-
nies are offspring of the Standard Oil Company,
which was started by John Rockefeller in the
late 19th century. Perhaps no other company
has had such an impact on an industry as much
as Standard Oil on the oil industry. Standard Oil
was one of the first truly global companies that
was involved in all aspects of the oil supply
chain, from extraction and production to trans-
portation, distribution, and marketing. The com-
pany got so big that the Department of Justice
ordered its breakup. The resulting companies
are still today’s dominant energy companies.
Standard Oil of New Jersey became Exxon and
Standard Oil of New York became Mobil — the
two companies eventually merged and are now
ExxonMobil; Standard of California became
Chevron; and Standard of Ohio is now known as
Marathon Oil. Even though the company was
forced to break up, the influence of Rockefeller’s
Standard Oil company is still felt in the industry
today. 

Countries that export crude oil have seen their current account surpluses
reach record highs. (Current account measures a country’s balance of pay-
ments as they relate to trade.) These windfall profits are having a tremen-
dous effect on the economies of such countries. The stock markets of some
of these countries, particularly the Persian Gulf countries (known as the Gulf
Cooperation Council — or GCC), have had stellar performances lately. Table
11-8 shows the performance of the Persian Gulf countries’ stock markets
awash in petrodollars.

The current account surplus is an important measure of how much a country
is benefiting from the current oil boom. Saudi Arabia’s current account sur-
plus, for example, reached a record-setting $150 Billion in 2005, thanks largely
to its oil exports. OPEC countries (see the sidebar “What is OPEC and how
does it affect the oil markets?”) are expected to generate a whopping $500
Billion current account surplus in 2006 because of the high price of oil. 
For the uninitiated, investing directly in emerging markets can be a risky
proposition and requires a lot of research. Some countries have different reg-
ulatory rules than the United States, and you need to know what these are
before you get involved in a foreign venture. 
One way to play emerging markets while avoiding the direct risks that this
may entail is by investing in emerging markets funds that are located in the
United States. These funds hire professionals who are familiar with the busi-
ness environment in target countries and are able to navigate these foreign
investment seas. These funds allow you to take advantage of booms in for-
eign countries, while remaining within the safe regulatory and investing envi-
ronment of the United States.

Dubai: An oasis in the desert 
Dubai, in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates, is
but one of many striking examples of the trans-
formative power of crude oil on a local econ-
omy. What was once a small desert town has
transformed itself into a global financial power-
house and a major trading hub. Fueled by the
boom in crude oil exports, both in the UAE and
from other Persian Gulf countries, Dubai has
thriving financial services, construction, media,
and manufacturing sectors. 
Dubai’s GDP has grown at an annual rate of 12
percent a year since the late 1990s as the price
of crude oil has skyrocketed. As the price of
crude continues to go up, driven by increased
demand and tight supply, expect to see coun-
tries that export this black gold thrive. One way
to benefit from this is by investing in the indige-
nous economies of oil-exporting countries.

f crude oil is the king of commodities, natural gas is sometimes said to be the
queen. While crude oil accounts for about 40 percent of total energy con-
sumed in the United States (the biggest energy market in the world), approxi-
mately 25 percent of energy consumption comes from natural gas. Natural gas is
therefore an important source of energy both in the United States and around
the world and can offer tremendous money-making opportunities. 
Like crude oil (see Chapter 11) and coal (see Chapter 13), natural gas is a
nonrenewable fossil fuel found in large deposits under the Earth. As a matter
of fact, natural gas is sometimes found not too far away from crude oil
deposits. While crude oil is the liquid fossil fuel and coal the solid one, nat-
ural gas is the gaseous fossil fuel. 
Many people are sometimes confused by the term natural gas because they
think (incorrectly) that it refers to the gas (gasoline) they use to fill their
tanks. Although natural gas is sometimes used as a transportation fuel, the
gasoline you buy at the gas station and natural gas have nothing to do with
each other. The gasoline your car consumes is a product of crude oil, while
natural gas is an entirely different member of the fossil fuel family used pri-
marily for heating, cooling, and cooking purposes. 
Because of its importance as a source of energy, natural gas makes for a good
investment. It’s an important commodity with many applications. In this
chapter, I present you with all the information you need to develop an invest-
ment strategy in the natural gas segment of energy. 

Because it’s important you get all the facts upfront about this commodity, I
first provide you with all the hands-on information about natural gas’ applica-
bility — how is it used and how you can profit from these uses. Then I give
you a snapshot of the global natural gas market — this provides you with a
road map so you know who’s producing it and who’s consuming it.
Identifying these patterns is a necessary part of developing a sound invest-
ment strategy. Finally, I show you how to actually start investing in and trad-
ing Nat Gas, as traders sometimes call it. Natural gas may not get the same
kind of attention as crude oil, but it still makes for a great investment! 
What’s the Use? Looking at 
Natural Gas Applications
Natural gas, because it is one of the cleanest-burning fossil fuels, has become
increasingly popular as an energy source. In the United States alone, natural
gas accounts for nearly a quarter of total energy consumption, as seen in
Figure 12-1. 
As you can see from Figure 12-1, natural gas is second only to petroleum
when it comes to generating energy in the United States. 
So who uses all this natural gas? The primary consumers of this commodity
are the industrial sector, commercial interests, residential elements, trans-
portation, and electricity generation. I list the consumption ratio of these sec-
tors in Figure 12-2.

Chapter 12: Welcome to Gas Vegas, Baby! Trading Natural Gas
How do you measure natural gas?
Measuring natural gas can be confusing because
there are multiple measurement methods. 
These measurements basically boil down to this:
How much physical natural gas there is and how
much energy does the natural gas generate.
While crude oil is measured in barrels (each
barrel containing 42 Gallons of oil), natural gas
is measured in cubic feet. Recall from chemistry
class that a cubic foot is a measure of volume
for a square prism with six sides each consist-
ing of 1 foot in length. (The technical name for
this shape is a regular hexahedron.) Or, you can
simply think of it as the shape of a sugar cube!
Because natural gas is in a gaseous state, it’s
easier to measure it in cubic feet. (Sometimes,
natural gas is converted into liquid form, known
as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), which I cover in
the section “Liquefied Natural Gas: Getting
Liquid without Getting Wet.” LNG is also mea-
sured in cubic feet. 
The abbreviation for cubic feet is cf (both letters
are lower case). Therefore 10 cubic feet is
abbreviated as 10 cf. In order to have practical
applications, cubic feet must be able to mea-
sure large amounts of volume. Here are the
abbreviations for measuring larger volume
amounts of cubic feet:
 100 cubic feet: 1 Ccf
 1000 cubic feet: 1 Mcf
 1 million cubic feet: 1 Mmcf
 1 billion cubic feet: 1 Bcf
 1 trillion cubic feet: 1 Tcf
Note that cf is always in lower case, while the
first letter of the abbreviation is always capital-
ized. Many futures contracts based on natural
gas are measured in cubic feet. 
Natural gas may also be measured by the
amount of energy it generates. This energy con-
tent is captured by a unit of measurement
known as the British Thermal Unit or Btu. One
Btu measures the amount of heat necessary to
increase the temperature of one pound of water
by one degree Fahrenheit. To put it in perspec-
tive, 1 cf is the equivalent of 1027 Btus. Btus,
sometimes called therms, is the number that
may appear in your gas bill to express the
amount of natural gas your household con-
sumed during a particular period of time. 
For investment purposes, however, natural gas
is generally quantified using cubic feet. 

Calling all captains of industry: 
Industrial uses of natural gas
The industrial sector is the largest consumer of natural gas, accounting for
almost 40 percent of total consumption. While industrial uses of natural gas
have always played a major role in the sector, their significance has increased
over the last several years and will continue to do so. As you can see in
Figure 12-3, the industrial sector has always accounted for a large part of nat-
ural gas use and because this trend is going to continue, this is a good area to
consider investing in. (Actually, demand for natural gas products as a whole
is going to increase throughout the first quarter of the 21st century, for rea-
sons I discuss in the next section. See Figure 12-8.) 
This increased demand should put upward price pressures on natural gas;
one way to profit from this is by being long natural gas futures (for more on
going long on futures, flip to the section “Natural selection: Trading Nat Gas
futures”). 
As an investor, looking at long-term trends helps you develop an investment
strategy that takes advantage of the market fundamentals. 
So what specific parts of the industrial sector use natural gas? Natural gas is
a truly versatile form of energy because it has many applications in industry.
Here are a few industrial applications of natural gas products:

 Waste incineration
 Fueling industrial boilers
 Feedstock for fertilizers
The chemical composition of natural gas consists primarily of methane, a
hydrocarbon molecule. It also includes other hydrocarbons such as butane,
ethane, and propane — all gases that have important industrial uses. 
When the industrial sector is firing on all cylinders, so to speak, demand for
natural gas will tend to increase. Keep an eye out for increased activity from
the industrial sector because this is a bullish sign for natural gas. One indica-
tor you can use to gauge the economic output from the industrial sector is
the Producer Price Index (PPI). The PPI measures the average change in prices
received by producers for their products, expressed as a percent change. The
PPI, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), is a good measure of
the health in the industrial sector. You can get the latest PPI reports at
www.bls.gov/ppi.
If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the
kitchen! Natural gas in your home
Residential usage accounts for almost a quarter of total natural gas consump-
tion (see Figure 12-2). A large portion of homes in the United States, as well as
other countries, use natural gas for both their cooking and heating needs —
the two largest applications of natural gas in the home. 
About 70 percent of households in the United States have natural gas ovens
in the kitchen. The use of natural gas for cooking purposes has steadily
increased as technological developments have allowed for an efficient and
safe use of natural gas. How does this affect you as an investor? As long as
folks need to cook, you can bet that natural gas will be there to fill this impor-
tant need. This essential usage assures that demand from the residential
sector for natural gas will remain strong — a bullish sign for Nat Gas. 
Over 50 percent of homes in the United States use natural gas for heating pur-
poses. One way to benefit from this particular application is by identifying
peak periods of natural gas consumption. Specifically, demand for natural gas
for heating increases in the northern hemisphere during the winter seasons.
Therefore one way to profit in the natural gas markets is by calibrating your
strategy to this cyclical, weather-related trend. In other words, all things con-
stant, natural gas prices should go up during the winters as folks seek to stay
warm. 
193
Chapter 12: Welcome to Gas Vegas, Baby! Trading Natural Gas

Although my aim in this book is to help you make money by investing in com-
modities such as natural gas, I’m going to take the liberty of showing you how
to save money by using natural gas in your home. Natural gas is one of the
cheapest energy forms as measured by dollars per unit of energy generated.
Look at Figure 12-4, and you’ll quickly realize that you get more energy from
natural gas per dollar (as measured in British Thermal Units — the standard
energy measurement unit), than from almost any other source. 
Check to see how you supply heat to your home because using natural gas
may save you some money during the winters — which you can then use to
bulk up on your commodities investments! 
Going commercial: Natural gas’s 
commercial uses
About 40 percent of the energy consumed by commercial users, such as hos-
pitals and schools, comes from natural gas, accounting for about 15 percent
of total natural gas consumption. I list in Figure 12-5 the uses of natural gas
by the commercial sector. 
Because commercial users include establishments such as schools, hospitals,
restaurants, movie theaters, malls, and office buildings, demand for natural
gas from these key drivers of the economy will rise during times of increasing
economic activity. This means that, all things equal, you should be bullish on
natural gas during times of economic growth. (For more on how to gauge eco-
nomic activity, please turn to Chapter 3.)

One place to look for important economic clues that affect demand for nat-
ural gas is the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a division of the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE). The EIA provides a wealth of information
regarding consumption trends of key energy products, such as natural gas,
from various economic sectors. For information on the commercial usage of
natural gas please visit www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/aeoref_tab.html.
Truly electrifying! Generating electricity
with natural gas
Natural gas is quickly becoming a popular alternative to generate electricity,
with just under 25 percent of natural gas usage going towards generating
electricity. Actually, natural gas is used to produce approximately 10 percent
of electricity generation in the United States. As you can see from Figure 12-6,
that figure is going to increase dramatically in the coming years. 
The long term trend is that more natural gas is going to be required to gener-
ate electricity. This increased demand from a critical sector will keep upward
pressures on natural gas prices over the long term. Keep this in mind as you
consider investing in this commodity.

Chapter 12: Welcome to Gas Vegas, Baby! Trading Natural Gas

Getting from here to there: Natural gas
and transportation
It’s not a widely known fact, but natural gas is used in a number of vehicles
(approximately 3 million worldwide) as a source of fuel. These vehicles,
known simply as Natural Gas Vehicles (NGV), run on a grade of natural gas
called Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). While this usage accounts for only
about 5 percent of total natural gas consumption, demand for NGV could
increase as a viable (cheaper) alternative to gasoline (a crude oil derivative).
Keep a close eye on technological developments of natural gas in the trans-
portation sector. If natural gas were to grab a slice of the transportation
market, which now accounts for almost two-thirds of crude oil consumption,
prices for natural gas could increase dramatically. One place you could check
out for the latest on NGV is the International Association of Natural Gas
Vehicles. Their Web site is: www.iangv.org. 
Liquefied Natural Gas: Getting Liquid
without Getting Wet
Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG, is a recent development in the field. LNG is
exactly what it says it is: natural gas in a liquid form. The reason for this
development is quite simple: As demand for natural gas increases, you need

to be able to transport this precious commodity across vast distances (for
example, across continents and through oceans). That is difficult to do when
it is in a gaseous state. Enter LNG: which is nothing but natural gas in a liquid
state to make it easy to transport. 
Transforming natural gas from its gaseous state into a liquid state is a very
complex process. The Nat Gas must first be cooled to a temperature of
–260°F in order to transform it to its liquid state. An additional advantage of
LNG is that it takes up considerably less space — about 600 times less —
which means you can transport a lot more of it farther and more economi-
cally. Once the Nat Gas is in a liquid state, it is usually transported in spe-
cially designed tankers to consumer markets. (I present some of the
companies who transport energy products around the world in Chapter 14.)
Before it’s actually delivered to consumers, it goes through a regasification
process. 
In the United States, the majority of natural gas is transported through
pipelines in a gaseous state. The natural gas pipeline system in the United
States is one of the most extensive in the world — 300 million miles of
pipeline — and it connects major Nat Gas producing regions (such as the Gulf
of Mexico) to large Nat Gas consumers (such as the East Coast). While this
remains the dominant method of transporting Nat Gas, LNG is quickly estab-
lishing itself as a viable source of Nat Gas, particularly as domestic produc-
tion declines and imports increase. Some of the major operators of these
pipelines that transport both Nat Gas and LNG are entities known as Master
Limited Partnerships (MLPs). The good news is that you can profit from
moving Nat Gas across the United States by investing in MLPs, which I cover
in Chapter 6. 
In 2005, the United States received only about 1 percent of its total natural
gas (0.17 Tcf) through LNG. However, that number is expected to increase at
a solid rate of 15.8 percent annually over the next 20 years, to reach 4.8 Tcf
by 2025. 
Investing in Natural Gas
The future for natural gas looks bright. The total natural gas consumption on
a global scale in 2005 was approximately 100 Trillion cubic feet (100 Tcf). By
2025, that figure is estimated to increase by over 50 percent — at a rate of 2.3
percent annually — to a total of 156 Tcf, as you can see in Figure 12-7.

Chapter 12: Welcome to Gas Vegas, Baby! Trading Natural Gas

Knowing that demand for natural gas will remain steady until 2025 is an
important piece of information for you as an investor. What’s perhaps even
more important is to figure out which countries and companies will be meet-
ing this demand. Figuring out who’s going to be supplying this natural gas will
help you to devise an investment strategy to profit from this increased nat-
ural gas demand. Table 12-1 lists the countries with the largest reserves of
natural gas in the world.

Global natural gas reserves are estimated at 6040 Tcf, which is the equivalent
of approximately 6 Quadrillion cubic feet. (Quadrillion — not Zillion! — is the
next figure above Trillion.) You can get exposure to this huge natural gas
market in a couple ways: by trading futures contracts or by investing in com-
panies that are involved in the production and development of natural gas
fields in some of the countries listed in Table 12-1. I discuss the pros and cons
of each investment method in the following sections. 
Natural selection: Trading Nat Gas futures
The most direct method of investing in natural gas is by trading futures con-
tracts on one of the designated commodities exchanges (see Chapter 8). The
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the preeminent exchange for
energy products, provides you with the option of buying and selling natural
gas futures and options. 
In order to trade futures, you need to have a futures account with a desig-
nated broker, known as the Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). After you
open a futures account, you can start trading these derivative products. For
more on futures and options, turn to Chapter 9. To find out how to open a
futures account, make sure to read Chapter 6.
The Nat Gas futures contract is the second most popular energy contract on
the NYMEX, right behind crude oil. It is traded under the ticker symbol NG,
and it trades in increments of 10,000 Mmbtu. You can trade it during all the
calendar months, to periods up to 72 months after the current month. (I
cover tradability in Chapter 9.) 
The NYMEX offers a mini version of this contract for individual hedgers and
speculators. Check out the Nat Gas section of the NYMEX Web site for more
on this contract: www.nymex.com/ng_pre_agree.aspx.
Trading Nat Gas futures contracts and options is not for the faint hearted.
Even by commodities standards, Nat Gas is a notoriously volatile commodity
subject to wild price fluctuations. If you’re not an aggressive investor willing
to withstand the financial equivalent of a wild roller coaster ride, then Nat
Gas futures may not be for you. To give you a picture of the prices, Figure
12-8 shows you a historical overview of the price action of the NYMEX Nat
Gas contract.

Chapter 12: Welcome to Gas Vegas, Baby! Trading Natural Gas

Nat Gas companies: The natural choice
Investing in companies that process natural gas is a balance positive invest-
ment choice because it offers you exposure to this market through the exper-
tise and experience of industry professionals, without the volatility of the
futures market. Some natural gas companies are involved in the production
of natural gas fields, while others are responsible for delivering natural gas
directly to consumers. 
I list companies that are fully integrated natural gas companies, which means
they are involved in all the production, development, transportation, and dis-
tribution phases of natural gas. Investing in these companies provides you
with a solid foothold in this industry. Here is your hit list:
 Alliant Energy (NYSE: LNT): Provides consumers with natural gas and
electricity derived from natural gas throughout the United States. A good
choice if you want exposure to the North American Nat Gas market. 
 Allegheny Energy (NYSE: AYE): This S&P 500 company provides Nat
Gas-based electricity to consumers in the eastern United States, primar-
ily in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland. If you want regional expo-
sure to Nat Gas production, then AYE is a good option. 
 Nicor Inc. (NYSE: GAS): Nicor’s operations are primarily centered in the
Illinois area, where it provides Nat Gas to over 2 million consumers. This
is another good regional investment. 
For a complete listing of companies involved in natural gas production and
distribution, look at the American Gas Association Web site: www.aga.org.

 Considering wind power
T
he world’s demand for energy is in an upward trend and is likely to
remain elevated for decades to come. Currently almost 90 percent of
the world’s total energy needs are met by fossil fuels: crude oil (39 percent),
natural gas (24 percent), and coal (24 percent). For a number of reasons —
environmental, political, geopolitical — there is a strong push to move away
from fossil fuels as the main sources of energy and toward alternative energy
sources such as nuclear, wind, and solar. As a result, these alternative sources
may provide you with some solid money-making opportunities. 
In this chapter, I go through the global energy scene and identify some of the
major trends affecting it. I also introduce you to alternative energy sources and
show you how to profit from this segment of the energy market. Specifically, I
provide you with investment opportunities in the following areas: coal, nuclear
power, and electricity, as well as solar and wind power. 
Out with the Old and in with the New?
As the global population increases and as emerging countries industrialize
(see Chapter 2), the demand for energy products will rise throughout the first

quarter of the 21st century. The Energy Information Administration (EIA)
anticipates that global demand for energy products will increase by over 70
percent between 2003 and 2030. You can take a look at this expected increase
in Figure 13-1. 
In 2003, fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) accounted for 87 percent of
total energy consumption. Crude oil alone was responsible for almost 40 
percent of global energy use. However, as the price of these traditional
energy sources increases (driven by both strong demand and limited
supply), the calls for new sources of energy are increasing as well. For 
example, in 2005 many members of Congress pushed for an alternative
energy initiative to promote the use of solar, wind, and other renewable
energy sources. 
Despite numerous calls, however, the energy landscape is unlikely to change
any time soon, which means that fossil fuels will remain the dominant source
of global energy for years to come. This is not to say that the alternative 
energies won’t generate a lot of attention — they will. But how much actual
progress will be made is still up in the air. Keep this in mind as you’re looking
at investing in these alternatives. 
For example, take a look at Figure 13-2. You can see that the energy picture
until 2030 will remain fairly static on a percentage basis. That is to say that
fossil fuels are going to remain the dominant fuel for the global economy,
while alternatives will keep playing an important but less significant role. 
Despite the dominance of fossil fuels, particularly crude oil, the alternative
space is a dynamic area and a fertile ground for investment opportunities.
I present you below with all the money-making opportunities in this
sector.

King Coal: Not as Scary as You Think
Before the beginning of the 20th century, coal was truly the king of commodi-
ties. Coal was the dominant source for energy during the tumultuous indus-
trial revolution. People still often associate the industrial revolution with
images of coal mines. The beginning of the end of coal as the dominant
energy source can be traced to a fateful day in 1912 when the First Lord of
the Admiralty in the British Navy ordered the conversion of all coal ships to
oil. That move resulted in the rise of oil as the dominant global energy source
at the expense of coal. That First Lord of the Admiralty was none other than
Winston Churchill. 
Although Churchill’s decision to switch the British Navy from coal to oil effec-
tively dethroned coal as the fossil fuel of choice, coal still enjoys an elevated
position in global energy markets. For example, in 2004 (the latest year for
which data is currently available) in the United States (the world’s most
important energy market), coal accounted for 26 percent of total fossil fuel
consumption, 22.39 Quadrillion Btu (British thermal unit) out of a total 85.65
Quadrillion Btu of fossil fuel consumption. Therefore coal is still an important
source of energy and can provide some good money-making opportunities. In
this section, I show you how to make money in coal. 
Coal hard facts
Coal is used primarily for electricity generation (steam coal) and steel manu-
facturing (metallurgical coal). Besides its practical uses in these two impor-
tant areas, coal is an increasingly popular fossil fuel because of its large
reserves. Specifically, companies in the United States have long touted the

benefits of moving towards a more coal-based economy because the United
States has the largest coal reserves in the world. I list in Table 13-1 the coun-
tries with the largest coal reserves. 
Coal is measured in short tons. One short ton is the equivalent of 2000 lbs. In
terms of energy, one short ton of anthracite, the coal of highest quality (see
section “Paint it black”), contains approximately 25 Million Btu of energy.

If you’re going to invest in companies that process coal, I recommend select-
ing a company with a heavy exposure in one of the countries listed in Table
13-1. Specifically, because the United States, Russia, and China collectively
hold more than 55 percent of the world’s total coal reserves, investing in a
coal company with large operations in any of these countries will provide you
with exposure to this important segment of the market. I introduce some of
these coal companies in the section “It’s a coal investment.” 
Just because a country has large deposits of a natural resource, however,
doesn’t mean that it exploits them to full capacity. As such, there is a signifi-
cant gap between countries with large coal reserves and those that produce
the most coal on an annual basis. To give you a better idea of this market
characteristic, I list in Table 13-2 the top coal producing countries.

Demand for coal is expected to increase during the first quarter of the 21st
century. In Figure 13-3, you can see that demand for coal is going to increase
dramatically from now until 2025. Most of this growth will come from the
emerging market economies, particularly the economies of China and India
which will account for approximately 75 percent of the demand increase for
coal. (China is currently the largest consumer of coal in the world, ahead of
the United States, India, and Japan.)

The coal markets have already started reacting to this increased demand for
the product. From 2002 to 2005, as you can see in Figure 13-4, the price of coal
in the spot market rose from approximately $25 per Short Ton in January
2002 to reach a high of more than $60 per Short Ton by January 2005. 
Paint it black
You should know that, like other fossil fuels, coal comes in different qualities.
Specifically, coal comes in four categories and is classified by its carbon,
sulfur, and ash contents, as well as by the level of energy it releases. 
Here are the four major categories of coal:
 Lignite: Lignite contains the least amount of carbon and the most sulfur
and ash of all coal types and is therefore considered to be of the least
value. Sometimes called brown coal, its primary use is in electricity 
generation. 
 Sub-bituminous: This type of coal contains a little more carbon than 
lignite and is therefore considered to be of a higher quality. It also has
lower levels of sulfur and ash than lignite. It is used mostly to heat water
in electricity-generating steam turbines. 
 Bituminous: Because bituminous coal burns well and creates a lot of
energy, it is of high value. It’s the most common type of coal found in the
United States and is used both in electricity generation, as well as in the
steel industry to create high quality steel.

Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

 Anthracite: Anthracite is by far the most valuable type of coal because it
contains the highest levels of carbon and the least amount of sulfur and
ash; it also provides the most energy on a per unit basis. Because of its
high value, anthracite is used for residential and commercial space 
heating. 
Before you invest in companies involved in the coal business, find out which
type of coal they produce. This information will help you develop a better
understanding of the company’s business and profit margins. You can find
this type of information in a company’s annual and quarterly reports. 
It’s a coal investment
You can get access to the coal markets by either trading coal futures directly
or by investing in coal companies. 
The big sandy: Coal futures contract
Like other members of the fossil fuel family, coal has an underlying futures
contract that trades on a commodity exchange, in this case the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). This coal contract provides commercial users
(such as coal producers, electric companies, and steel manufacturers) with
the opportunity to hedge against market risk and offers speculators a chance
to profit from this market risk. (For more on the NYMEX and other commodity
exchanges, please turn to Chapter 8.) 
The coal futures contract on the NYMEX tracks the price of the Central
Appalachian type of coal. Central Appalachian coal, known as CAPP, is a
high quality coal with low sulfur and ash contents. The CAPP futures con-
tract, sometimes affectionately called “the big sandy” by traders because it
is produced in the area between West Virginia and Kentucky where the Ohio
River flows, is the premium benchmark for coal prices in the United States. 
It trades under the ticker symbol QL and is tradable during all the calendar
months of the current year, in addition to all calendar months in the subse-
quent three years. Additional information on this futures contract is available
on the NYMEX Web site at www.nymex.com/coa_fut_descri.aspx. 
While the coal futures contract does offer you exposure to coal, I should
warn you that the market for this contract is fairly illiquid, meaning that the
trading volume is low. Most of the traders involved in this market represent
large commercial interests that transact with each other. While there are a
few speculators trading the coal futures markets, they don’t represent a sig-
nificant portion of the market. This means that you may not be able to get
involved directly in this market without large capital reserves to compete
with the commercial interests. 
207
Chapter 13: Fuel for Thought: Looking at Alternative Energy Sources

I encourage you to read Chapter 9 for more on futures contract specifications. 
Coal company
One of the best ways to invest in coal is by investing in a company that mines
it. The following three companies are the best in my opinion:
 Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU): Peabody Energy is the largest coal 
company with approximately 10 Billion Short Tons of coal reserves.
The coal it produces is responsible for generating approximately 10 
percent of the electricity in the United States. With 2005 revenues
approaching $5 Billion, it is the largest coal company out there today.
It is the ExxonMobil of coal companies. I like Peabody Energy because
of its size and because it has mining operations in the United States but
also in Australia and Venezuela, two important coal markets. 
 Consol Energy (NYSE: CNX): With headquarters in Pittsburgh, Consol
Energy has significant operations in the coal mines of Pennsylvania and
neighboring coal-rich states of West Virginia and Kentucky. As of 2005,
it controlled 4.5 Billion Short Tons of coal reserves, with operations in
over 17 mines across the United States. CNX is well positioned to take
advantage of the booming domestic coal market. 
 Arch Coal (NYSE: ACI): Arch coal is smaller in size than its main com-
petitors Peabody and Consol, but I like it because the coal it produces
is of very high quality. It operates over 20 mines on the continental
United States and controls over 3 Billion Short Tons of reserves. It has
operations in the largest coal producing regions in the United States,
including in the Appalachian, the Powder River Basin (between the
Montana/Wyoming border), and the Western Bituminous region
(between the Colorado/Utah border). 
If you want to invest in coal companies with a more international exposure
to markets in Russia, China, and other coal-rich countries, I recommend you
consult the World Coal Institute. Their Web site is www.worldcoal.org. 
Investing in Nuclear Power: Going
Nuclear without Going Ballistic
When most people think of nuclear power, they tend to think of nuclear
weapons and mushroom clouds. However, nuclear power also has an impor-
tant civilian role. Civilian and commercial nuclear power is an integral part of
the global energy supply chain and is a valuable energy source for residential,
commercial, and industrial consumers worldwide. In fact, nuclear power gen-
erates over 20 percent of the electricity in the United States. In countries like
France, nuclear power generates over 75 percent of electricity! 
208
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

Nuclear power currently accounts for about 5 percent of total global energy
consumption (see Figure 13-2), and it is expected to remain at these stable
levels until 2030. But if the price of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) dra-
matically enough to start affecting demand (creating what is called demand
destruction), nuclear may play an important role in picking up the slack. 
One way you can profit from increased interest in nuclear power is by invest-
ing in uranium, the most widely used fuel in nuclear power plants. You may
be surprised to find out that there has been a bull market in uranium from
2000 to 2006, and this shows no sign of slowing. However, you’re not likely to
hear about this opportunity from your local financial media because uranium
is a pretty obscure investment area. But sometimes as an investor, you need
to be able to think creatively and look at opportunities that other investors
haven’t considered. Investing in uranium to benefit from the increased demand
in nuclear power is not a well-known or well-advertised investment play, but
it is lucrative nevertheless. Take a look in Figure 13-5 at the spot price of ura-
nium from 1994 to 2005.

Splitting atoms
The primary use of civilian nuclear power is in
generating electricity. Electricity is generated
by heating water to very high temperatures to
create steam that powers the turbines in a
steam turbine. In a nuclear power plant, the
water is heated through a process known as
nuclear fission, where atoms are split apart to
release large amounts of energy. (This is the
opposite of nuclear fusion where atoms are
fused together.)

Because uranium isn’t a widely tradable commodity, the best way to profit
from this trend is to invest in companies that specialize in the mining, pro-
cessing, and distribution of uranium for civilian nuclear purposes. Here are a
few companies I like in this sector:
 Cameco Corporation (NYSE: CCJ): Cameco is the marquee name in the
uranium mining space. The company operates four uranium mines in
the United States and Canada. The company mines uranium and is also
involved in refining and converting the uranium into fuel that’s sold to
nuclear power plants to generate electricity. 
 UEX Corporation (Toronto: UEX): UEX is a Canadian-based mining com-
pany that specializes in the exploration and mining of uranium in the
Athabasca basin. The Athabasca basin in Canada is an important region
in global uranium mining that accounts for about 30 percent of total world
production. The company is currently still in exploration phases, but it
could become a real money-maker if it comes across large deposits of
uranium. The company trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
 Strathmore Corporation (Toronto: STM): While UEX is involved in the
exploration of uranium ore, Strathmore — another Canadian company —
specializes in the mining of uranium. The company, which trades on the
Toronto Stock Exchange, operates in the Athabasca region in Canada as
well as in the United States. 
For more information on nuclear power, the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) has an excellent Web site with all sorts of practical information on this
industry at www.eia.doe.gov/fuelnuclear.html.
The Ux Consulting Company is a great resource for everything regarding 
uranium and nuclear power. Their Web site is located at www.uxc.com. 
You’ve Been Zapped! Trading Electricity
Benjamin Franklin may not have imagined what his kite experiment would
mean for the world, but his experimentation paved the way for develop-
ments in electricity, which is now a necessity of modern life. It is also a trad-
able commodity. In this section, I show you how to make money investing in
electricity.

Have you ever wondered how that electricity that allows you to watch TV,
use your air conditioner, or power your computer comes from? Before I show

you how to profit from this electrifying resource, I want to take a quick moment
to show you how it is generated. 
Getting electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers is
a lengthy process. The electricity is first created in a generator at a power
plant and is then sent through transmission lines at very high voltages to a
substation near the consumers. The substation is equipped with a generator
that transforms the high voltage electricity into low voltage form, which is
then sent to consumers via distribution lines. So how can you profit from it?
It’s quite simple. 
Most of the electricity in the United States is generated through steam turbines.
The water used to generate steam is heated to very high temperatures using tra-
ditional energy sources such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear power, as well as
other renewable sources (such as wind and solar). Look at Figure 13-6 for a
breakdown of how electricity was generated in the United States in 2004. 
Electricity is measured in watts where one kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts and
a megawatt equals 1 million watts. In the power industry, watts are expressed
in terms of hours of operation where 1 kilowatt hour (1 kWh) is 1000 watts
working for a period of 1 hour. Your electricity bill is measured in kWh and 1
kWh is the equivalent of 3412 Btu. To put it in perspective, the United States
consumed a grand total of 3669 Billion kWh of electricity in 2003.

invest directly in the power industry. I discuss these investment procedures
in the following sections. 
Charged and ready to go
The most direct way of investing in electricity is . . . by buying it! The New
York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) offers a futures contract that tracks the
price of electricity as administered by PJM Interconnection. PJM is a Regional
Transmission Organization (RTO) that oversees the largest electric grid system
in the world and services over 50 million customers in the United States. It is
responsible for the generation of over 700 Million megawatt hours of electric-
ity across 55,000 miles of transmission lines. Because of its dominance in the
U.S. electricity market, the PJM electricity futures contract on the NYMEX
provides you with a widely recognizable and tradable electricity benchmark.
For more information on the NYMEX and other commodity exchanges, please
flip to Chapter 8. 
The PJM contract offers you the option of trading both on-peak and off-peak
electricity hours. On-peak times are defined as Monday through Friday between
7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., the times where the most electricity is consumed
in the United States. Off-peak hours go from midnight to 7:00 a.m. local time,
Monday through Friday, and include Saturdays and Sundays as well. On-peak
hours are usually more liquid because that’s when most of the electricity is
consumed.
The PJM contract is traded in units of 40 mWh (megawatt-hours) under the
ticker symbol JM. For more information on this specific contract, check out
the NYMEX Web site at www.nymex.com/jm_desc.aspx. To find out more
about futures contracts in general, please turn to Chapter 9.
Although most of the market participants in the electricity futures market are
local and regional power providers and suppliers, the futures contract lends
itself to being traded by individual speculators as well. In recent years, as
interest in commodities as an asset class has increased, the number of 
speculative participants in the electricity market has grown as well.
Power to the people
You probably get a letter from them every month, but you may have never
given too much thought about the investment opportunities they present. I’m
talking of course about electric utilities. Utilities are the companies responsi-
ble for providing electricity to millions of folks in America and around the
world.
I like utilities for a number of reasons, but particularly for their very high div-
idend payout. The industry has on average a 5 percent dividend yield, one of
the highest of any industry. However, remember when you’re investing for
dividend income that dividends are subject to market fluctuations. I list in
Table 13-3 some utilities you could consider, along with their dividend yield.

Dividends are a taxable source of income. Because of recent tax relief legisla-
tion, taxes on income generated through dividends are capped at 15 percent.
However, Congress is considering an overhaul of the dividend tax in 2008 that
may result in an increase in the dividends tax rate. Make sure to keep a close
eye on these dividend tax issues because they will have a direct impact on
your utility investments. 
Always Brand Spanking New!
Renewable Energy Sources
As the price of traditional sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, and coal
continues upward and the calls from environmentalists about the hazards of
burning these fossil fuels grows louder, more attention will be paid to renew-
able sources of energy, such as solar and wind power.
Currently, renewable sources of energy make up about 8 percent of total energy
use in the world (see Figure 13-2 for the breakdown). This figure pales com-
pared to the 87 percent share of fossil fuels, but it has the potential to grow
as nonrenewable energy sources are depleted. The field of renewable energy
is getting a lot of attention and there is certainly potential to make some
money in this field. I look at a couple of promising sectors in this field in the
following sections.
If you’re interested in keeping up-to-date on the latest developments in the
renewable energy space, I recommend you check out the Department of
Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) initiative. The Web
site is www.eere.energy.gov.

Chapter 13: Fuel for Thought: Looking at Alternative Energy Sources

Sunny delight: Solar energy
Solar power is the process by which energy from the sun is harnessed and
channeled into a usable energy form, generally heat or electricity. Solar
power can be transformed using two different processes:
 Solar Thermal Energy: This method transforms the sun’s energy into
heat, which may be used for a number of different purposes, such as
interior space heating or water heating. If you’ve ever seen flat panel
solar collectors mounted on homes or buildings, they are used for solar
thermal energy purposes. 
 Solar Photovoltaic Energy: Don’t be intimidated by this high sounding
name — it simply describes the method whereby energy from the sun is
captured and transformed into electricity. A lot of companies are trying
to turn these two methods of transforming solar energy into a commer-
cially viable enterprise, but they face some challenges. One of the biggest
impediments to the commercial success of solar power is the sun itself!
Specifically, the sun isn’t a resource that you can control. For one thing,
you can’t manipulate the weather, and you’re therefore at the mercy of
rain, fog, clouds, the Earth’s rotation, and other natural external factors
that block the sun. For this reason, solar power accounted for a little
less than 0.06 percent of total energy consumed in the United States
during 2005. 
However, this doesn’t mean you can’t make any money investing in this
sector. Because of technological advancements, the future looks bright for
solar energy. Although a number of companies have entered the field of solar
power, two companies stand out as well positioned to take advantage of the
increased demand for solar energy:
 Evergreen Solar (Nasdaq: ESLR): Evergreen Solar has operations in
Germany and the United States and is engaged in the production and
distribution of photovoltaic cells. It has a patented system that allows
for direct transformation from solar to consumable electricity. It sells its
electricity directly to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. 
 Suntech Power Holdings (NYSE: STP): This company, with headquarters
in China, launched its IPO in the Unites States in 2005. The company is
also involved in producing photovoltaic cells and panels for electricity
generation. This is an attractive company because it has a foothold in
China, which could be a huge market for solar power. 
Fast and furious: Wind energy
Wind energy is another renewable resource that is getting increasing atten-
tion from investors. Energy is generated by huge wind machines (similar to
traditional wind mills), which are placed side by side in wind farms. 
214
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

The challenge to wind energy is that it is dependant on the wind, a very
unpredictable natural phenomenon. As a result, wind energy only accounted
for 0.4 percent of electricity generation in the United States in 2004. That
same year, total energy consumption from wind was 0.14 percent in the
United States. As a result, it is extremely difficult to invest in wind energy at
this stage. Currently there are very few publicly traded companies that deal
specifically in wind power. 
However, with rising energy prices, wind energy may get more focus. If you
are interested in investing in wind power and want to keep on top of any
emerging trend, check out the American Wind Energy Association. Their Web
site is www.awea.org. They keep a database of private companies involved
in wind energy that might go public one day.

Chapter 13: Fuel for Thought: Looking at Alternative Energy Sources
What’s up with ethanol?
Ethanol is an alcohol fuel that can be used as a
transportation fuel. It can be made from corn,
sugar, wheat, and other agricultural products.
Because of its origins, it is a renewable source
of energy. In Brazil, the world’s largest producer
of ethanol fuel, ethanol is the primary automotive
fuel. The United States has seen an increase in
the use of ethanol as a transportation fuel and
that trend is likely to increase. One company
involved in the production of ethanol that I rec-
ommend is Pacific Ethanol (NASDAQ: PEIX). If
you’re interested in getting exposure to ethanol,
then PEIX is a good way to go.

O
ne way to play the energy markets is to invest in the companies involved
in the production, transformation, and distribution of the world’s most
important energy commodities. In this chapter, I look at specialized energy
and oil companies that are critical links in the global crude oil supply chain.
This chain is long and convoluted, and these industries move in cycles, so
identifying who does what will allow you to develop a targeted investment
strategy. 
I show you in the following sections how to profit from the first step of the oil
industry (exploration and production), through the transformational process
(refining), and finally through the delivery system (transportation). Each of
the companies operating in these segments of the market offers unique money-
making investment opportunities. (See Chapter 11 for the goods on the large
integrated oil companies (often referred to as “the majors”) that allow you
to buy the market, so to speak, because they are involved in all facets of the
global energy industry.)
Bulls Eye! Profiting from Oil
Exploration and Production
The oil industry all starts in one place: at the oilfield. Actually, the birth of
the modern oil industry began with the discovery of the first commercially
viable oilfield by “Colonel” Edwin Drake in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859.
(The title Colonel is in quotations because Edwin Drake was not really a

colonel. He simply called himself that in order to get permits from the local
authorities to drill for oil!) 
Ever since that day, individuals, companies, and countries have relentlessly
pursued the discovery of oilfields and oil wells. This pursuit was perhaps
best portrayed by James Dean in the classic movie Giant, where Dean por-
trays a Texas wildcatter who strikes it rich after discovering a gusher, a well
that literally gushes oil. 
Among industry insiders, exploring for oil and gas is affectionately called
wildcatting. Most wildcatting expeditions end up without any oil discoveries.
When wildcatters drill a hole in the ground and no oil comes out, that is
known as having a dry hole, the unfortunate opposite of a gusher. 
The exploration and discovery of oil is a very lucrative segment in the oil
business. To this day, when someone strikes it rich, the metaphor “it’s like
she discovered oil” is still used. So how you can you strike it rich by discov-
ering oil? Fortunately you won’t have to roll up your sleeves and go prospect-
ing for oil in the Texas heartland. You can invest in companies that specialize
in the exploration and production of oilfields, known in the business as E&P. 
Oil wells are found in one of two places: either on land or on sea. In recent
years, offshore drilling has generated a lot of interest among investors, and a
flurry of activity has been taking place in this sector as oil on land becomes
more and more scarce. In this section, I introduce you to some of the compa-
nies involved in this exciting segment of the market.
Going offshore
Before I present the leading companies in the offshore drilling market, I need
to go over some terminology with you. The offshore drilling business is a
technology-heavy industry, and you have to be familiar with some of these
technical terms in order to make the most out of your investments. 
218
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 
Going upstream
The oil business is effectively divided into three
phases. The first phase is extracting the oil from
the ground (or the sea). This is known in the
industry as the upstream segment of the market.
Next, the oil needs to be refined into consum-
able products such as gasoline and jet fuel. The
companies involved in the refining process are
known as midstream companies. Finally, the
specific products must be delivered to con-
sumers, either via pipeline or by ships (some-
times by other means, but these are the two
dominant methods). This last phase is known as
the downstream portion of the market. 

Because offshore drilling activity may take place in unforgiving locations,
companies have to deploy specific vessels for specific drilling projects. These
vessels are among the most technologically advanced structures created by
man. Some vessels are designed to withstand harsh winds and high waves.
Others are more suited for shallow water exploratory projects and need to
have the ability to move from location to location quickly. 
Here are the names of some of these vessels you can expect to come across
as you start investing in offshore drilling companies. 
 Drilling barge: The drilling barge is one of the most nimble vessels in
the market. The drilling barge is a floating device usually towed by tug-
boat to target drilling locations. It’s primarily used in inland, in still, 
shallow waters such as rivers, lakes, and swamps. 
 Jack-up rig: The jack-up rig is a hybrid vessel that is part floating barge,
part drilling platform. The jack-up rig is towed to the desired location,
usually in open, shallow waters where its three “legs” are lowered and
“jacked” down to the seafloor. Once the legs are secured, the drilling
platform is elevated to the desired levels to enable safe drilling. 
 Submersible rig: The submersible rig is similar to the jack-up rig in that
it is primarily used for shallow water drilling activity and is secured to
the seabed. 
 Semi-submersible rig: Sometimes referred to as a semi, this structure
is a feat of modern technological development. It is similar to a sub-
mersible, except that it has the capacity to drill in deep waters under
harsh and unforgiving weather conditions. The drilling platform is ele-
vated and sits atop a floating structure that is semi-submerged in the
water (hence the name) and is secured by large anchors that can weigh
up to ten tons each. 
 Drill ship: The drill ship is essentially a ship with a drilling platform. It
is perhaps the most versatile drilling vessel because it can be easily 
dispatched to remote offshore locations, including drilling in very deep
waters. 
 Offshore oil platform: Once one of the previous vessels discovers a
commercially viable offshore oil field, a company may decide to build
a permanent platform to exploit this discovery. Enter the offshore oil
platform. These structures are a sight to behold and they are truly man-
made floating cities. They house personnel, include living quarters, and
are often even equipped with heliports. They are ideally suited to with-
stand harsh, deepwater conditions. 
You can get information on an offshore drilling company’s fleet in its annual
report. Companies will usually lease out these vessels to customers, which
may include independent oil and gas companies, national oil companies, and
the major integrated oil companies, for a premium. The company will also
include this type of financial information regarding its fleet in the annual
219
Chapter 14: Totally Energized: Investing in Energy Companies

report. (See more on annual reports and other important forms in the sidebar
“In the public eye: Looking at a company’s public disclosure forms.”)
Here are some of the leading companies in the offshore drilling business:
 Transocean Inc. (NYSE: RIG): Transocean, whose company motto
is “We’re never out of our depth,” is the Exxon Mobil of the offshore
drillers. It’s the largest company in terms of its market capitalization
as well as the size and scope of its operations. The company has over
90 offshore drilling units at its disposal and is an expert in operating
under harsh and extreme weather conditions. It has offshore operations
in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, the Mediterranean Sea,
the North Sea, Australia, and Southeast Asia. If you’re looking for the
most diversified company in the group, then this is it. 
 GlobalSantaFe Corp. (NYSE: GSF): GSF is a truly global offshore drilling
contractor. It operates a fleet of over 60 vessels in locations stretching
from Canada to the Middle East. It operates in three major segments:
the leasing of drilling equipment, services, and crews (contract drilling);
engineering and project services where it teams up with clients to provide
offshore engineering solutions; and turnkey services where it assumes full
control and responsibility of drilling projects from the design to the
implementation phase. 
220
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 
In the public eye: Looking at a 
company’s public disclosure forms
A publicly traded company in the United States
is required by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to file annual and quarterly
reports. The quarterly report, known as Form
10Q, contains information about the company’s
financial operations during each of the first
three fiscal quarters in a given year. (A company
doesn’t need to file a quarterly report at the end
of the fiscal year since that’s when the annual
report is released.) Form 10K, which is the
annual report, contains a much more compre-
hensive overview of a company’s financial oper-
ations. It is released at the end of the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year, and it includes infor-
mation on the company’s structure, sharehold-
ers, business activities, assets, and liabilities. 
An additional disclosure form you may want to
look at is Form 8K. A company is required to file
Form 8K with the SEC in the event that it under-
takes structural changes, such as a merger or
acquisition, bankruptcy, or election of new
board members. Form 8K may contain important
information regarding the company’s future
plans. So where can you check out a company’s
annual report or Form 8K? Perhaps the best
resource for this type of information is EDGAR
(www.edgar-online.com). They include
the most comprehensive SEC filings I’ve ever
come across. A subscription may be required. 

GSF offers an array of full offshore services to its clients, which include
independent and integrated oil companies as well as foreign governments
and oil companies. 
 Noble Corporation (NYSE: NE): Founded in 1921 in Texas, Noble is one
of the oldest drilling contractors in the world. While it has a fleet of over
60 vessels and operations stretching from Brazil to the North Sea, it has
an edge in implementing technologically oriented solutions to meet cus-
tomer demands. 
Noble Corporation actually has a subsidiary, Noble Technology Services
Division, which is a sort of technological think-tank dedicated to generate
technical solutions for customers. 
If you’d like to dig deeper into this sector, you can check out the following
Web site: www.rigzone.com, which includes up-to-date information on the
offshore industry as well as the oil industry as a whole. 
Staying on dry land
A large part of E&P activity takes place on dry land. Actually, the first com-
mercially viable oil wells were first discovered on land. While most industry
insiders agree that a majority of onshore oil wells have been discovered, you
can still benefit by investing in companies that are involved in the exploitation
and production of onshore oilfields. 
Here are a couple of companies you could consider to invest in this segment
of the drilling market:
 Nabors Industries (NYSE: NBR): Nabors is one of the largest land drilling
contractors in the world. It has a division that is able to perform heavy-
duty and horizontal drilling activities. 
 Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: PTEN): Patterson-UTI is an onshore
oilfield drilling contractor that has extensive operations in North America.
It operates in a number of segments, including the drilling of new wells,
as well as the servicing and maintenance of existing oil wells. It is part of
the S&P 400 MidCap stocks. 
Servicing the oilfields
Another area that I recommend taking a close look at is companies that focus
on oilfield maintenance and services. The oilfield services sector is dominated
by technology oriented and labor-intensive companies that seek to maximize
an oilfield’s output through the use of sophisticated technological techniques,
such as horizontal drilling and 3-D mapping and imaging. 
221
Chapter 14: Totally Energized: Investing in Energy Companies

The oilfield services companies are generally hired by the major integrated oil
companies or national oil companies for general oilfield and oil well mainte-
nance and extraction solutions. For example, Saudi Aramco, the largest oil com-
pany in the world in terms of proven reserves, may turn to an oilfield services
company for the maintenance of a particular oilfield. The services company
may get involved in the actual extraction of crude from the oil well; provide data
and statistics on current and past usage as well as on potential future output;
use technologically oriented techniques to extract hard-to-recover oil; and per-
form other specific and general oilfield management services.
The added value of the oilfield services companies is that they can improve
oil recovery rates on existing fields and recover previously untapped oil
pockets in old fields. As fewer and fewer oilfields are discovered, the world’s
major oil companies are looking for ways to maximize existing oilfields.
Therefore the role of the oilfield services companies will become increasingly
important in the future. 
Perhaps the most well-known oilfield services company is Halliburton (NYSE:
HAL). A lot of people are familiar with the name because it’s a high-profile
Defense Department contractor that was once headed by Vice President Dick
Cheney. Because of the nature of its political contracts, Halliburton is often a
lightning rod for criticism. I would recommend going beyond some of this
criticism and directly analyzing the company’s balance sheet, income state-
ment, and other metrics to get a more accurate sense of the company’s scope
of operations. Although some of its work is political in nature (government
contracts), this only represents a fraction of its operational activities. More
importantly, although Halliburton is the most notorious of the oilfield services
companies, it is certainly not representative of the other companies in the
field. Many of the other players in this space are focused exclusively on oil-
field maintenance and services and aren’t involved in work that’s of a political
nature. 
Here is your hit list of top companies if you’re looking to invest in the oilfield
services space:
 Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE: SLB): Schlumberger may not be a household
name, but it’s well known and well regarded in the oil industry. The com-
pany is one of the most technologically savvy services companies out
there and can provide solutions regarding all aspects of oilfield manage-
ment services, from exploration and extraction to maintenance and
abandonment. It provides evaluations to help customers identify the
short-term and long-term viability of an oilfield and specializes in maxi-
mizing oilfield output through technologically advanced solutions. 
 Halliburton Co. (NYSE: HAL): The Houston, Texas, based company
makes a lot of headlines (sometimes not very positive ones) because
of the political nature of its work with the U.S. government and military.
Besides its governmental contracts — which only make up a fraction of
222
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

its revenues — the company is a leader in oil and gas field maintenance.
It helps customers extract as much energy from existing wells as possi-
ble while maintaining low costs. This makes Halliburton a knowledge-
able company in the petroleum services sector. 
 Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI): Like most oilfield services companies,
Baker Hughes is headquartered in Houston, Texas. The company oper-
ates both in the United States as well as internationally, with operations
stretching from the Persian Gulf to West Africa. Baker Hughes provides
technologically oriented solutions to its customers to maximize oilfield
output efficiency. Baker Hughes is not the biggest company in the group,
but it’s certainly a nimble competitor. 
For more information on the oilfield services sector and all the companies
involved in it, I recommend checking out the Yahoo! Finance Web site at:
http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/124.html.
Oh My, You’re So Refined! 
Investing in Refineries
Crude oil by itself doesn’t have many useful applications — it needs to be
refined into consumable products such as gasoline and jet fuel. Refineries are
a critical link in the crude oil supply chain because once crude oil is discov-
ered, it needs to be transformed into products before being sent to consumers. 
Here is a list of some of the products that refineries derive from refining
crude oil. You may recognize some of them (tongue-in-cheek):
 Gasoline
 Heating oil (commercial and residential)
 Diesel fuel
 Jet fuel (military and commercial aviation)
 Kerosene
 Automotive lubricating oil
 Propane
 Petrochemicals
 Asphalt
Given the importance of these derivative products, you can imagine that you
can make a lot of money investing in refineries. But before I give you a few
223
Chapter 14: Totally Energized: Investing in Energy Companies

company options, I want to get a few technical terms you should be familiar
with out of the way. 
Here are three criteria you need to look at when considering investing in
companies that operate refineries:
 Refinery throughput: The capacity for refining crude oil over a given
period of time, usually expressed in barrels. 
 Refinery production: Actual production of crude oil products, such as
gasoline and heating oil. 
 Refinery utilization: The difference between production capacity, the
throughput, and what’s actually produced. 
You can find this information in a company’s annual or quarterly reports.
Table 14-1 presents an example of a refinery’s earnings.

The largest refinery in the United States is located in Baytown, Texas, and is
operated by Exxon Mobil. It has a refining capacity of 557,000 bbls/day.  Most
major integrated oil companies have large refining capacity. These include
some of the majors like Exxon Mobil and BP. One way to get exposure to the
refining space is by investing in these major companies. I discuss the majors,
their scope of activity, and how to invest in them in Chapter 11. 
Another, more direct, way to profit from refining activity is by investing in
independent refineries. The marquee name in this area is a company called
The Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO). Valero is the largest independent
refining company in North America. It has a throughput capacity of 3.3
Million bbls/day and operates the largest number of refineries in North
America. 
I like Valero because if you want to play the refinery card, it provides you
with one of the most direct ways to do so. The major integrated companies
are a good play, but they are so big that you don’t get the same kind of direct
exposure you do from Valero. In addition, Valero is a consistent performer in
a very cyclical industry. Check out the long-term performance of Valero’s
stock in Figure 14-1.
Although Valero is the goliath in the refinery space, a number of smaller com-
panies exist that could offer you a lot of value. 
Here are a couple of these companies:
 Sunoco Inc. (NYSE: SUN): Sunoco is the second largest refiner in terms
of total refinery throughput. It refines approximately 1 Million Barrels of
crude a day into refined products, which it distributes primarily in the
eastern United States. 
Sunoco, with headquarters in Philadelphia, operates refineries in
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Jersey and has a wide distribution network
across the East Coast.

 Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO): Tesoro, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas,
is one of the leading refiners in the mid-continental and western United
States. Its refineries transform crude oil into gasoline that is distributed
through a network of about 500 retail outlets in the western United States.
This is a good regional play.
It operates refineries in Utah, California, Washington, Alaska, and even
Hawaii.

How to Become an Oil Shipping Magnate
Commodities, such as oil and gas, would be useless if there was no way of
transporting them to consumers. In fact, transporting commodities to con-
sumers is probably as important as finding and processing them in the first
place. Fortunately, as an investor, this provides you with fertile ground to
make money in the transportation of commodities. 
Here’s a statistic to put things in perspective for you: Two out of every three
barrels of oil that are transported are moved around in ships. The remaining
one-third is transported via pipelines. (For more on how to invest in pipeline
infrastructure, you should consider Master Limited Partnerships, which I 
discuss in Chapter 6.) Therefore the shipping industry plays a crucial role in
the integrated oil business. 
Perhaps no one person embodies the shipping industry like Aristotle Onassis,
the Greek shipping magnate. Onassis built one of the largest fortunes in the
world by shipping oil and other commodities around the world. Although I
don’t promise to make you as rich as Onassis, I am confident that investing in
the seaborne transportation business can give your portfolio a big boost. 
In this section, I provide you with tools to help you invest in the oil shipping
business. I introduce you to the types of vessels that make up a modern oil
tanker fleet, present you to some of the major companies involved in the
business, and offer you advice on pinpointing the right entry and exit points.

Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

common questions I get asked about the oil shipping industry is the following:
What is the relationship between the price of crude oil and oil tanker profit
margins? Like many good questions, there is no straight answer. It depends on
a lot of factors. My short answer is this: The relationship between the price of
crude oil and tanker spot rates is not easily quantifiable. 
Tanker spot rates — the bread and butter of the shipping industry — are
determined by supply and demand. The supply side, in this case, consists of
how many ships are available to transport crude and products to the desired
destinations around the world. On the demand side is how much crude oil
and products need to be shipped from point A to point B. In the global ship-
ping business, these are the two factors that you need to watch closely. 
For example, recently there has been some supply-side pressure on tanker
spot rates. Because of a series of environmental incidents, the International
Maritime Organization (the global regulatory body of the shipping industry —
www.imo.org) ordered the phasing out of all single hull ships in 1997 in order
to help prevent further oil spills. 
Single hull ships have just one layer of protection. Double hull ships provide
more protection against oil leaks because they are composed of two layers,
one exterior and one interior. 
Because of this regulation, the number of ships in the open sea transporting
oil and products has decreased. This created a supply-side crunch that has
contributed to the increase in tanker spot rates during the 2002–2004 period,
the largest run-up in tanker spot rates in recent memory. (See Figure 14-2 at
the end of the chapter.) The program to phase out all single hull ships from
open waters is scheduled to end before 2010. 
Shipping companies are planning on replacing these single hull ships with
double hull ships, but like almost anything that has to do with the commodi-
ties business, the construction of these ships takes time. Therefore the supply
side pressure on tanker spot rates will remain until these newly designed
double hull ships are brought on board. 
On the demand side of the equation, demand for crude oil and products on a
worldwide basis remains robust. In 2006, the world consumed on average 85
Million Barrels of oil a day, and that number is growing. 
Another important demand factor, sometimes overlooked by many industry
onlookers, is oil import dependency. While crude oil demand is critical, if oil
could be produced and consumed without the need to transport it across
long distances on seaborne voyages, the oil shipping industry would be out
of business. The lifeblood of the global oil tanker business is the international
flow of oil across countries and continents, or the dependence on oil imports.
One key metric to help you gauge the level of activity in this area is global
import and export data, which is monitored by the Energy Information
227
Chapter 14: Totally Energized: Investing in Energy Companies

Administration’s energy statistics division. Their Web site is www.eia.doe.
gov/oil_gas/petroleum/info_glance/petroleum.html.
As long as the supply of ships remains tight and the demand for crude oil
seaborne transportation remains high, tanker spot rates will stay elevated.
Now, to the extent that crude oil prices affect the demand of crude oil world-
wide, crude oil prices will have an effect on tanker spot rates. Specifically, if
crude oil prices go so high that folks are no longer willing to buy crude, thus
causing demand destruction, the demand for shipping crude oil worldwide
will also decrease (this is the notion of elasticity, which I cover in Chapter 2),
causing tanker spot rates to go down as well. However, this rate drop is an
indirect effect of rising oil prices and that’s why the relationship between
crude oil prices and tanker spot rates is not easily quantifiable. There are
simply too many variables at play. 
At the end of the day, as long as there is a demand for crude to be transported
from producers to consumers, you can rest assured that oil shippers will remain
in business. 
Ships ahoy!
One factor you need to consider as you’re planning investments in the oil
shipping industry is the ships themselves. Before you invest in a tanker
stock, closely examine the fleet of vessels it operates. 
To help you with this examination, I list some of the types of vessels used in
the global crude oil shipping industry: 
 Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC): This type of vessel, known in the
industry as the ULCC, is the largest vessel in the market. It’s used for
long haul voyages. It offers economies of scale because it can carry
large amounts of oil across long distances. 
 Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC): The VLCC is the vessel of choice for
long distance seaborne voyages. It’s ideally suited for intercontinental
maritime transportation; its areas of operation include the Persian Gulf
to East Asia and West Africa to the United States, among other routes. 
 Suezmax: This vessel is named thus because its design and size allows it
to transit through the Suez Canal, in Egypt. The Suezmax is among the
vessels used to transport oil from the Persian Gulf to Europe, as well as
to other destinations. It is ideally suited for medium haul voyages. 
 Aframax: The Aframax, whose first four letters are an acronym for
Average Freight Rate Assessment, is considered the “workhorse” in the
tanker fleet. Because of its smaller size, it is ideally suited for short haul
voyages and has the ability to transport crude and products to most
ports around the world. 
228
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

 Panamax: Like the Suezmax, the Panamax gets its name from its ability
to transit through a canal, in this case the Panama Canal. This vessel is
sometimes used for short haul voyages between the ports in the
Caribbean, Europe, and the United States. 
Besides their catchy names, these vessels are also identified by how much
crude oil and products they can transport on sea. The unit of measurement
used to capture this capacity is known as the Dead Weight Ton, or DWT. DWT
measures the weight of the vessel including all cargo it is carrying. Most
ships are constructed in such a way that one DWT is the equivalent of 6.7
Barrels of oil. 
I list in Table 14-2 the DWT capacity of the vessels listed previously, along
with their equivalent in barrels of oil.

Masters of the sea: Petroleum
shipping companies
The companies responsible for transporting crude oil and petroleum products
are an essential link in the global energy supply chain. This group is a diverse
bunch, and each company provides a necessary and important service to this
crucial industry. Some companies concentrate their operations regionally,
such as in the Gulf of Mexico or the Persian Gulf. Others have extensive trans-
portation capabilities with operations in all four corners of the globe. Some
operate a small group of VLCC vessels, while others operate a large number
of smaller vessels. And still others specialize in shipping only crude oil, while
others focus primarily on petroleum products such as gasoline. 
With so many options to choose from, it can be confusing trying to identify
which company to invest in. In this section, I give you a list of all the major pub-
licly traded oil shipping companies, and I go through their operations and scope
of activities so you can decide which one is right for your investment needs. 
229
Chapter 14: Totally Energized: Investing in Energy Companies

 Teekay Shipping Corp. (NYSE: TK): Teekay Shipping is one of the world’s
largest seaborne transporters of crude oil and crude oil products. It
operates a fleet of over 130 vessels, including one VLCC (2 Million Barrel
capacity) that transports crude from the Persian Gulf and West Africa to
Europe, the United States, and Asia; about 15 Suezmax vessels (1 Million
Barrel capacity) that connect producers in North Africa (Algeria) and
West Africa to consumers in Europe and the United States; and over 40
Aframax vessels (0.6 Million Barrel capacity) that operate in the North
Sea, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Caribbean. 
In addition to conventional tankers, Teekay operates a fleet of offshore
tankers that are constructed to transport crude from offshore locations
to onshore facilities. If you’re interest in a truly global and diversified oil
shipping company, you can’t go wrong with Teekay Shipping. 
 Frontline Ltd. (NYSE: FRO): Founded in 1948, Frontline is one of the
oldest shipping companies in the world. It also operates one of the
world’s largest fleets of VLCC vessels with over 44 VLCCs. In addition
to its VLCCs, Frontline owns over 35 Suezmax vessels (1 Million Barrel
capacity), making it one of the largest tanker companies in the world in
terms of transportation capacity. Cumulatively, it has the capacity of 18
Million Dead Weight Tons. With operations in the Persian Gulf, Europe,
the United States, and Asia, Frontline runs a very tight ship indeed! 
In addition to its tanker fleet, Frontline offers shareholders one of the
highest dividend payouts I have ever seen: an eye-popping $6 per share!
At current market prices, that’s a yield of over 18 percent! (See Table
14-3 for more on dividend yields.) 
 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE: OSG): OSG, unlike many of its
competitors that are incorporated in offshore locations such as Bermuda
and the Bahamas, is headquartered in New York City. Although it has an
international presence, it is the only company with a large presence in
the American shipping market. Its U.S. vessels are mainly engaged in the
transportation of crude oil from Alaska to the continental United States,
and products from the Gulf of Mexico to the East Coast. 
Additionally, OSG has one of the highest profit margins in the industry: a
whopping 45 percent profit margin (2006 figures)! If you’re interested in
the domestic crude oil transportation market, then take the plunge with
OSG.
 General Maritime Corp. (NYSE: GMR): General Maritime focuses on the
small and mid-size segment of the tanker market. They operate a fleet of
Suezmax and Aframax vessels with operations primarily focused in the
Atlantic basin. General Maritime links producers and consumers from
Western Africa, the North Sea, the Caribbean, the United States, and
Europe. If you’re looking for exposure to the trans-Atlantic oil seaborne
trade, then GMR is a good bet. 
Also, the fact that they offer a $5 dividend per share makes this an
attractive tanker stock. 
230
Part III: The Power House: How to Make Money in Energy 

 OMI Corporation (NYSE: OMM): OMI Corporation specializes in the
transport of crude products on smaller vessels such as the Handysize
and Handymax vessels. It has a nice niche market in the transportation
of refined products from refineries to consumer markets. In addition, it
also operates over ten Suezmax vessels and two Panamax vessels. OMI
is a lean and mean competitor in this highly competitive industry. 
I’ve given you here a snapshot of global tanker activities. If you do decide to
invest in the global oil shipping business, I recommend you dig deeper into
a target company’s operations. Most of the information you need is found
in a company’s annual report (Form 10K) or quarterly report (Form 10Q).
Additional information can also be obtained through third parties, such as
analyst reports. 
One of the best-kept secrets in this industry is the high dividend payout these
companies issue. I’m a huge fan of dividends because they provide you with
certainty in an uncertain investment world. And oil tanker stocks offer some
of the highest dividend payouts out there. Table 14-3 gives you a group of
shipping company stocks that offer some remarkable dividend payouts.

Calculating dividend payouts can be tricky because a company isn’t obligated
to give back money to shareholders in the form of dividends. Some companies
will pay out high dividends one year but not the next, while for others paying
dividends may only be a one-time event. One way to determine future divi-
dend payouts is by examining the company’s dividend payout history. Any
good stock screener should have this information handy. I personally find
that the Yahoo! Finance Web site does the job: www.finance.yahoo.com. 
Swimming with sharks: 
Avoiding industry risk
As with most things that have to do with commodities, tanker spot rates and
fixed rates, which provide the bulk of a shipping company’s revenue stream,
are highly cyclical. It’s not out of the ordinary for shipping rates to fluctuate
231
Chapter 14: Totally Energized: Investing in Energy Companies

by 60 or 70 percent on a daily basis. Take a look at the tanker spot rate
volatility in Figure 14-2. 
So how do you protect yourself from these extreme price volatilities? One
way to hedge your positions is by investing in one of the large oil tanker
stocks that I mentioned in the previous section. These companies have been
in the business a long time and have substantial experience managing these
wild price swings. 
Another factor you need to consider is global economic growth. The oil ship-
ping industry is dependent on a strong global economy with a healthy appetite
for crude oil and crude oil products. If the global economy is thrown in a
recession, you can expect that the tanker stocks will take a hit. Everything
else equal, if the world demand for oil products slows down, I recommend
getting out of these tanker stocks. 
For the more adventurous investor, there’s always the option of shorting
the stock of companies you know aren’t going to do well. You can short a
company’s stock through various means, such as buying a put option or
even selling a call option. I discuss short selling in Chapter 9. 
To find out more about the oil shipping industry, I recommend you check
out Martin Stopford’s excellent book on the subject, Maritime Economics
(Routledge).

In this part . . .
P
eople have always been fascinated by precious
metals such as gold. In this part, I cover not only 
precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum, but
also important base and industrial metals like copper, 
aluminum, zinc, and steel. I provide you with an in-depth
look at these markets and introduce you to some of the
world’s best mining companies to help you profit in this
market.

M
etallurgy and civilization go hand in hand. Man’s ability to control
metals has enabled him to develop modern society and civilization.
As a matter of fact, human prehistory is classified using a three-age system
based on man’s ability to control metals: the stone age, the bronze age, and
the iron age. Societies that have mastered the use of metals in weaponry and
tool-making have been able to thrive and survive. Those without this ability
have faced extinction.
Similarly, investors who have been able to master the fundamentals of the
metals markets have been handsomely rewarded. In this chapter, I introduce
you to the fascinating world of precious metals, which include gold, silver,
and platinum. These metals can play a role in your portfolio because of their
precious metal status, their ability to act as a store of value, and their poten-
tial to provide a hedge against inflation. In this chapter, you discover all you
need to know to incorporate precious metals into your portfolio.
As a general rule, metals are classified into two broad categories: precious
metals and base metals. This classification is based on a metal’s resistance to
corrosion and oxidation: Precious metals have a high resistance to corrosion,
whereas base metals (which I cover in Chapter 16) have a lower tolerance.
Going for the Gold
Perhaps no other metal — or commodity — in the world has the cachet
and prestige of gold. For centuries, gold has been coveted and valued for its
unique metallurgical characteristics. It was such a desirable commodity that

it developed monetary applications, and a number of currencies were based
on the value of gold. In 1944, for example, 44 of the world’s richest countries
decided to peg their currencies to the yellow metal; this is known as the
Bretton Woods Agreement, and it included such major currencies as the US
Dollar. Although President Nixon removed the dollar from the gold stan-
dard in 1971, a large number of countries still use gold as a global currency 
benchmark. 
In addition, gold has a number of applications in industry and jewelry that
have resulted in increased demand for this precious metal. Check out the
price of gold between 1997 and 2006 in Figure 15-1. 
The gold standard
The increased demand for gold is due to a number of reasons. In order to
profit from this increased demand, you need to be familiar with the funda-
mentals of the gold market. I go through these market fundamentals in this
section. 
236
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 
The golden boy from the gold rush
The California gold rush was a defining moment
in the history of the United States. When word
spread that gold had been discovered in the
San Francisco area, a large number of young
men rushed out West with a burning desire to
strike it rich. A number of success stories
emerged from this era. However, one of the
greatest untold stories of the California Gold
Rush is the story of Samuel Brannan, who was
California’s first millionaire. Sam Brannan was
the third man to find out that gold had been dis-
covered in California. Not surprisingly, the first
two people who knew about the gold — John
Sutter and James Marshall — wanted to keep
the discovery a secret. Sam Brannan had other
plans. 
Instead of keeping quiet about the discovery,
Sam Brannan quickly got the word out that gold
had been discovered in California. What’s
remarkable is that Sam Brannan made a fortune
during the California Gold Rush without ever
digging a single hole or prospecting for a single
nugget of gold. How did he make his money? By
selling shovels to the large number of people who
were interested in digging for the gold! Before
telling the world about the California gold, Sam
Brannan quietly bought almost all the shovels in
Northern California. When the prospectors
flooded in, the price of shovels went through the
roof, and Sam was the only man in town to sell
them. He reaped untold fortunes selling shovels
during the gold rush. 
One of the lessons of Sam Brannan’s story is
that you don’t have to actually dig for gold to
profit from it. You need to keep your mind open
to creative investment ideas that will allow you
to profit creatively from the commodities boom.

First, you should know what gold is used for. You may not be surprised to
find out that jewelry accounts for a large portion of gold demand. However,
did you know that dentistry also represents a significant portion of the gold
market? Here are some of the uses of gold: 
 Jewelry: Since it was first discovered by man thousands of years ago,
gold has been used as an ornament and in jewelry. The ancient Egyptian
king Tutankhamen was so enamored with gold that he was buried in a
gold coffin. Today, jewelry is the most important consumer use of gold
in the world, accounting for over 70 percent of total consumption. 
 Electronics: Because of its ability to efficiently conduct electricity, gold is a
popular metal in electronics. It is used as a semiconductor in circuit boards
and integrated boards in everything from cellphones and TVs to missiles.
 Dentistry: Because gold resists corrosion, it has wide application in den-
tistry. It is alloyed with other metals such as silver, copper, and platinum
to create dental fixtures.
 Monetary: Many central banks hold reserves of gold. In addition, gold is
one of the only commodities that is held in its physical form for invest-
ment purposes by the investing public. (See section “Getting physical.”)
Another monetary use of gold aside from central bank reserves and
investor portfolios is the use of gold in coinage. In countries such as
Canada and South Africa, some gold coins are actually legal tender.

In gold we trust
Why is gold such an important metal? Here are some traits that will help you
get an understanding of where gold derives its value: 
 Quasi-indestructibility: Gold has high resistance levels and doesn’t
easily corrode. Corrosive agents such as oxygen and heat have almost
no effect on gold, which can retain its luster over long periods of time
(think thousands of years). The only chemical that is able to affect gold
is cyanide, which dissolves gold. 
 Rarity: Gold is one of the rarest natural resources on Earth. A lot of
people don’t realize this, but only about 150,000 tons of gold have ever
been produced since humans first began mining gold over 6,000 years
ago. To give you an idea of how little that is, if you were to take all the
gold in the world it would not even fill up four Olympic size swimming
pools! And because most gold is recycled and never destroyed, a major-
ity of gold is still in use today. As a matter of fact, about 15 percent of
gold is recycled every year. 
 Malleability: Pure gold (24 karat) is a very malleable metal and is prized
by craftsmen around the world who enjoy shaping it into jewelry and
other objects of beauty. One ounce of gold can be transformed into over
96 square feet of gold sheet! 
238
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

 Ductility: Gold is a very ductile metal. In metallurgy, ductility measures
how much a metal can be drawn out into a wire. For example, one ounce
of gold can be converted into over 50 miles of gold wire! This gold wire
can then be applied in electronics and used as an electric conductor.
The wizard of oz: How to measure gold
Gold, like most metals, is measured and weighed in troy ounces (oz). One troy
ounce is the equivalent of 31.10 grams. (Despite the common misperception,
the troy ounce does not take its name from the mythic ancient Greek city of
Troy. Rather it is named after the French town of Troyes, which was an impor-
tant center of trade and commerce with a thriving precious metals market
during the Middle Ages.) When you buy gold for investment purposes, such
as through an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) or gold certificates, troy ounces
is the measurement of choice. 
When you want to refer to large quantities of gold, such as the amount of
gold a bank holds in reserves or the amount of gold produced in a mine, then
the unit of measurement you use is metric tons. One metric ton is equal to
32,150 troy ounces. 
If you’ve bought gold jewelry, you may have come across the following mea-
surement: karats. Karats (sometimes spelled carats) measures the purity of
gold. The purest form of gold is 24 karat gold (24K). Everything below that
number denotes that the gold is alloyed, or mixed, with another metal. 
Table 15-2 shows you what the different numbers of karats translate to in
terms of gold’s purity.

If you buy physical gold either for adornment purposes (jewelry) or for
investment purposes (gold coins/bars), you want to get the purest form of
gold, 24K. If you can’t get 24K gold, then you should aim to get the purest
form of gold you can get your hands on. Remember that the purer the gold,
the higher its value. Pure gold (24K) is always a yellow color. However, you’ve
239
Chapter 15: Getting the Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Platinum

probably encountered white gold or even red gold — these other colors are
created by alloying gold with metals such as nickel or palladium for a white
color or with copper to create red gold. By definition, white and red gold
aren’t pure gold. 
While purity measures how precious gold is in a percentage basis, fineness
measures gold’s purity expressed as a whole number. Fortunately, fineness
and purity are so similar that gold with 91.67% purity has a fineness of 0.9167.
Good as gold
In this section, I introduce you to the different ways you can invest in gold:
physical gold, gold ETFs, gold mining companies, and gold futures contracts. 
Getting physical
Gold is unlike any other commodity because it is one of the few commodities
that can be physically stored to have its value preserved or increased over
periods of time. One investment method unique to gold is to actually buy it —
hard, physical gold. You can purchase gold bars, bullion, and coins and store
them in a safe location as an investment. Perhaps no other commodity offers
you this unique opportunity. (Storing physical coal or uranium for investment
purposes just doesn’t work, believe me!) In some countries, folks will actually
buy gold jewelry for the dual purpose of adornment and investment. Here are
some different forms of gold you can get your hands on: 
 Gold coins: One of the easiest ways to invest in physical gold is by
buying gold coins. I like gold coins because they give you a lot of bang
for your buck. Unlike large gold bars, gold coins allow you to purchase
the yellow metal in smaller quantities and units. This means two things:
First, you don’t have to put up as much money to buy a gold coin com-
pared to buying a gold bar; second, if you want to sell part of your gold
holdings, you can easily sell five gold coins and keep five — that’s not
possible when you only have one gold bar. Another reason I like gold
coins is that they can be easily and safely stored; they’re more discreet
than having large gold bullion. The third reason I like gold coins is that
they’re actually issued by a federal government and are instantly recog-
nized as such; in some countries (Canada and South Africa), they are
even considered legal tender. I list the most popular types of gold coins,
by country of issuance, here: 
• Gold Eagle: The gold eagle coin is issued by the United States gov-
ernment; it has the full backing of Congress and the U.S. Mint. It
comes in various sizes including 1 oz., 1⁄2 oz., 1⁄4 oz. and 1⁄10 oz. At 22
karats, it’s a high quality coin that can actually be used towards
funding an IRA account. 
240
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

• Gold Maple Leaf: The gold maple leaf, you guessed it, is backed by
the Canadian government. It is issued by the Royal Canadian Mint
and, at 24 karats, is the purest gold coin on the market. 
• Gold Krugerrand: The gold krugerrand is issued by the South
African government and is one of the oldest gold coins issued in
the world. It has a fineness of 0.916. 
 Gold bars: Gold bars have an undeniable allure. In pop culture, for
example, gold is usually depicted as large gold bars. Think of the movies
Goldfinger and Die Hard 3, for instance. Much more than great movie
props, gold bars are also a great investment. While gold coins are more
suited for smaller purchases, gold bars are ideal if you’re interested in
purchasing larger quantities of gold. Despite popular depictions, gold
bars come in all shapes and sizes. They can be as small as 1 gram or as
large as 400 troy ounces. Despite the size, most gold bars are high qual-
ity with a fineness of 0.999 and above (24 karats). For a comprehensive
listing of gold bars, I recommend The Industry Catalogue of Gold Bars
Worldwide, which you can find at www.grendon.com.au/goldbarscat.
htm. Perhaps the only drawback of gold bars is their size, which makes
them harder (and more expensive) to store. 
 Gold certificates: Gold certificates are a hybrid instrument that allows
you to own physical gold without actually taking possession of it. Gold
certificates, like the name implies, certify that you own a certain amount
of gold, which is usually stored in a safe location by the authority who
issues the gold certificates. Owning gold certificates is my favorite way
of owning physical gold because it is safe and easy to store. When you
own gold bars or coins, safety is always a concern — someone could lit-
erally steal your gold. Storage is another concern, particularly if you
have large quantities of the stuff, because it can end up costing you a lot
to store your gold (such as in a bank vault or personal safe). The gold
standard of gold certificates is the Perth Mint Certificate Program (PMCP). 
The PMCP is administered by the Perth Mint, Australia’s oldest and most
important mint. At one point, the Perth Mint had as much gold as Fort
Knox. The PMCP is the only certificate program that is guaranteed by a
government, in this case the Government of Western Australia. The PMCP
issues you a certificate and it stores your gold in a secure government
vault. You may retrieve or sell your gold at any point. For more on this
program check out the Perth Mint’s Web site at www.perthmint.com.au. 
Gold bullion is nothing more than large gold bars.
If you want to purchase gold coins, bars, or even certificates, you need to go
through a gold dealer. One gold dealer I recommend is Kitco (www.kitco.com).  
241
Chapter 15: Getting the Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Platinum

Before doing business with any gold dealer, though, make sure you find out
as much information about the business (and business history) as possible.
You can check out different gold dealers by going through the Better Business
Bureau at www.bbb.org. 
Gold ETFs
Exchange Traded Funds offering exposure to commodities are a popular
investment gateway for folks who don’t want to mess around with futures
contracts. Signaling gold’s importance, one of the first commodity ETFs is,
you guessed it, a gold ETF. Currently you have two gold ETFs to choose from:
 StreetTracks Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD): The StreetTracks gold ETF is
the largest gold ETF on the market today. Launched in late 2004, it holds
about 12 Million Ounces of physical gold in secured locations. (That’s
more than $7 Billion worth of gold in 2006 bullion prices). The price per
ETF unit is calculated based on the average of the bid/ask spread in the
gold spot market. This fund is a good way of getting exposure to physi-
cal gold without actually owning it. 
 iShares COMEX Gold Trust (AMEX: IAU): The iShares gold ETF holds
a little more than 1.3 Million Ounces of gold in its vaults. The per unit
price of the ETF seeks to reflect the current market price in the spot
market of the ETF gold. 
Make sure to find out about the fees and expenses associated with each of the
ETFs mentioned. Because these ETFs actually hold physical gold, they have to
pay a number of entities to make this possible, so make sure to inquire about
any storage fees. This is in addition to the general fund expenses such as reg-
istration and administration fees. Carefully consider all expenses and fees
because these will have a direct impact on your bottom line. 
Because both the StreetTracks and iShares ETFs track the price of gold on the
spot market, their performance is remarkably similar — at times, it’s actually
identical. Therefore, if you can’t decide between the two, I recommend
StreetTracks because it holds more physical gold and, more importantly, it
offers you more liquidity than the iShares ETF. 
Stocks in gold companies
Another way to get exposure to gold is by investing in gold mining compa-
nies. A number of companies specialize in mining, processing, and distribut-
ing this precious metal. Here are a few companies I recommend:
 Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM): Newmont, which is head-
quartered in Colorado, is one of the largest gold mining companies in
the world. It has operations in Australia, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, the
United States (Nevada and California), Canada, Peru, and Bolivia. It is
actually the largest gold producer in South America. Additionally, it has
exploration programs in Ghana that could turn out to be very promising
242
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

for the company. If you’re looking for a truly global and diversified gold
producer with real growth potential, then you can’t go wrong with
Newmont. 
 Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: ABX): Barrick is a Canadian company
with headquarters in Toronto. It is a premier player in the gold mining
industry and has operations in Canada, the United States, Argentina,
Peru, Chile, Tanzania, South Africa, Australia, and Papua New Guinea.
It also has a foothold in the potentially lucrative Central Asian market,
where it has joint operations in Turkey, Russia, and Mongolia. Another
reason I like Barrick is that it has one of the lowest production costs per
ounce of gold in the industry. 
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (NYSE: AU): AngloGold, which is listed in five dif-
ferent stock exchanges around the world, is a truly global gold company.
Based in South Africa, it operates over 20 mines and has significant
operations in Africa and South America, particularly in South Africa,
Namibia, Tanzania, Ghana, Mali, Brazil, Argentina, and Peru, which all
have major gold deposits. It has additional operations in Australia and
North America. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo-American, the
global mining giant (which I cover in Chapter 18). 
A number of other mining companies have gold mining operations that are
part of a general mining program that includes other metals, such as silver,
copper, and so on. I selected these companies because their sphere of opera-
tions revolve almost exclusively on gold mining. 
The performance of these companies is not directly proportional to the spot
or future price of gold. These companies don’t give you the direct exposure
to gold that gold certificates or bars do, for example. Also, by investing in
these stocks you’re exposing yourself to regulatory, managerial, and opera-
tional factors. 
Gold contracts
Gold futures contracts provide you with a direct way to invest in gold through
the futures markets. You can choose from two gold futures contracts that are
widely traded in the United States (see Chapter 9 for the goods on futures
contracts):
 COMEX Gold (COMEX: GC): The COMEX gold futures contract was the
first such contract to hit the market in the United States (back in the
1970s). It is traded on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX), and it’s the most liquid gold contract in the world.
It is used primarily by large commercial consumers and producers, such
as jewelry manufacturers and mining companies, for price hedging pur-
poses. However, you can also purchase the contract for investment pur-
poses. Each contract represents 100 Troy Ounces of gold. 
243
Chapter 15: Getting the Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Platinum

 CBOT Mini-Gold (CBOT: YG): Launched in 2004, the Chicago Board
of Trade (CBOT) gold contract is a relative newcomer to the North
American gold futures market. However, it’s a very popular contract
because you can trade it online through the CBOT’s electronic trading
platform. In addition, at a contract size of 33.2 Troy Ounces, the mini is
popular with investors and traders who prefer to trade this smaller size
contract than the larger 100-ounce contract offered by CBOT or COMEX.
Although the CBOT also offers the more traditional, full size 100-ounce gold
contract, the COMEX’s 100-ounce contract is the more liquid of the two.
However, this may change in the future. 
When investing in the futures markets, always trade in the most liquid markets.
Liquidity is an indication of the number of contracts that are traded on a regular
basis. The higher the liquidity, the more likely you are to find a buyer or seller to
close out or open a position. You can get information on the volume and open
interest of contracts traded in the futures markets through the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Web site at www.cftc.gov. 
Get the Tableware Ready: 
Investing in Silver
Creating and designing silverware and jewelry isn’t the only use for silver. As
a matter of fact, silverware is only a small portion of the silver market. A large
portion of this precious metal goes towards industrial uses, such as conduct-
ing electricity, creating bearings, and welding, soldering, and brazing (the
process by which metals are permanently joined together). Because of its
numerous practical applications and its status as a precious metal, investing
in silver can bolster your portfolio. In this section, I introduce you to the ins
and outs of the silver market, and then show you how to actually include
silver in your portfolio. 
Checking out the big picture 
on the silver screen
Silver has a number of uses that make it an attractive investment. Here are
the most important ones, which account for more than 95 percent of total
demand for silver:
 Industrial: The industrial sector is the single largest consumer of silver
products, accounting for almost 45 percent of total silver consumption
in 2005. Silver has a number of applications in the industrial sector,
244
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

including creating control switches for electrical appliances and con-
necting electronic circuit boards. Because it’s a good electrical conduc-
tor, silver will keep playing an important role in the industrial sector.
 Jewelry and silverware: A large number of people believe (incorrectly)
that the largest consumer of silver is the jewelry industry. Although
silver does play a large role in creating jewelry and silverware, demand
from this sector accounted for 27 percent of total silver consumption in
2005, the latest year for which data is currently available.
 Photography: Did you know that the photographic industry is also a
major consumer of silver, accounting for about 20 percent of total con-
sumption. In photography, silver is compounded with halogens to form
silver halide, which is used in photographic film. Almost 200 Million Troy
Ounces of silver was used by the photography industry in 2003. That
number is slowly decreasing, however, because digital cameras, which
don’t use silver halide, are becoming more popular than traditional cam-
eras. Keep this decrease in demand in mind as you consider investing in
silver. 
Monitor the commercial activity in each of these market segments, looking
for signs of strength or weakness in these areas because a demand increase
or decrease in one of these markets will have a direct impact on the price of
silver. 
Knowing where the silver comes from is always important to an investor, so I
list the top producers of silver in the world in Table 15-3.

If you’re interested in finding out more about silver and its investment possi-
bilities, the Silver Institute maintains a comprehensive database on the silver
market. The Silver Institute is a trade association for silver producers and
consumers. Its Web site is www.silverinstitute.org. 
A sliver of silver in your portfolio
Silver can play an important role in your portfolio. Because of its precious
metal status, you can use it as a hedge against inflation and to preserve part
of your portfolio’s value. In addition, because it has important industrial
applications, you can use it to provide you with capital appreciation opportu-
nities. Whether for capital preservation or appreciation purposes, I believe
there is room in any portfolio for some exposure to silver. In this section, I
introduce you to the different ways you can invest in silver. 
Buying physical silver
One of the unique characteristics of silver is that you can invest in it by actu-
ally buying the stuff, as you would buy gold coins and bars for investment
purposes. Most dealers that sell gold generally offer silver coins and bars as
well. Here are a few silver coins to consider as investments:
 Silver Maple Coins: These coins, which are a product of the Royal
Canadian Mint, are the standard for silver coins around the world. Each
coin represents 1 oz. of silver and has a purity of 99.99 percent, making
it the most pure silver coin on the market. 
 100 oz. Silver Bar: If you’re interested in something a little more sub-
stantial than 1 oz. silver coins, you could buy the 100 oz. silver bar.
Before buying it, check the bar to make sure it’s pure silver (you want 99
percent purity or above).
The term sterling silver refers to a specific silver alloy that contains 92.5 per-
cent silver and 7.5 percent copper (other base metals are occasionally used
as well). Pure silver is sometimes alloyed with another metal, such as copper,
in order to make it stronger and more durable. Just remember that if you’re
considering some silver jewelry as an investment, sterling silver won’t provide
you with as much value in the long term as buying pure silver.
Buying the silver ETF
One of the most convenient ways of investing in silver is by going through
an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Until recently, there were no ETFs to track
silver. However, Barclays Global Investors (a subsidiary of the investment
bank) launched an ETF through its iShares program in April 2006 to track the
price of silver. The iShares Silver Trust (AMEX: SLV) holds silver bullion in a
vault and seeks to mirror the spot price of that silver based on current market
246
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

prices. This new silver ETF is a testament to the increased demand by investors
to include silver in their portfolios.
Looking at silver mining companies
Another alternative investment route is to go through companies that mine
silver. Although some of the larger mining companies (which I cover in
Chapter 18) have silver mining operations, you can get a more direct expo-
sure to the silver markets by investing in companies that specialize in mining
this precious metal. These companies may not be household names, but they
are a potentially good investment nevertheless. Here are a couple of companies
that focus exclusively on mining silver:
 Pan American Silver Corporation (NASDAQ: PAAS): Pan American
Silver, based in Vancouver, has extensive operations in the Americas.
It operates six mines in some of the most prominent locations in the
world, including Peru, Mexico, and Bolivia. If you’re interested in a well-
managed company to provide you with exposure to Latin American
silver mines, you won’t go wrong with Pan American Silver. 
 Silver Wheaton Corp. (NYSE: SLW): Silver Wheaton is one of the only
mining companies that generates all of its revenues from silver mining
activity. While other mining companies may have smaller interests in
other metals, Silver Wheaton focuses exclusively on developing and
mining silver. It has operations in geographically diverse areas that
stretch from Mexico to Sweden. If you’re looking for a geographically
diverse company to provide you with direct access to silver mining
activities, then Silver Wheaton is your best bet. 
Silver futures contract
The silver futures contracts, like gold futures, provide you with the most
direct access to the silver market. I list the most liquid silver futures con-
tracts below: 
 COMEX Silver (COMEX: SI): The COMEX silver contract is the standard
futures contract for silver. It is traded on the COMEX division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and represents 5000 Troy Ounces of
silver per contract. 
 CBOT Mini-Silver (CBOT: YI): The Mini-Silver contract that trades on
the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) represents a stake in 1000 Troy
Ounces of silver with a purity of 99.9 percent. This contract is available
for electronic trading. 
To give you an idea of the performance of the NYMEX/COMEX silver futures
contract, I list its price in Figure 15-2.

Chapter 15: Getting the Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Platinum

Bling Bling: Investing in Platinum
Platinum, which is sometimes referred to as “the rich man’s gold,” is one of
the rarest and most precious metals in the world. Perhaps no other metal or
commodity carries the same cachet as platinum, and for good reason. It is by
far the rarest metal in the world: If you were to put all the platinum that has
ever been mined in an Olympic size swimming pool, that platinum would not
even cover your ankles! As a matter of fact, while precious and base metals
such as gold and copper have been exploited for thousands of years, man’s
interest in platinum only developed in the 17th century when the Conquistadors
discovered large amounts of the metal in South America. It was soon discov-
ered that platinum had superior characteristics to most metals: It is more
resistant to corrosion, doesn’t oxidize in the air, and has stable chemical
properties. Because of these characteristics, platinum is a highly desirable
metal and can play an important role in your portfolio. 
Platinum is also the name of the group of metals that includes platinum, 
palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. In this section, I talk
about the metal and not the group of metals, although I cover palladium in
Chapter 17.

Platinum facts and figures
Deposits of platinum ore are extremely scarce and, more importantly, are
geographically concentrated in a few regions around the globe, primarily
in South Africa, Russia, and North America. South Africa has the largest
deposits of platinum in the world and, by some accounts, may contain up
to 90 percent of the world’s total reserve estimates. Russia is also a large
player in the production of platinum, currently accounting for 20 percent
of total global production (2006 figures). North America also contains some
commercially viable platinum mines, located mostly in Montana.
Platinum’s rarity is reflected in its price per troy ounce. For example, the
price of platinum in June 2006 was $1,230.25 per troy ounce! By comparison,
silver during the same period cost $11.55 per troy ounce. 
So who uses platinum? Platinum has several uses. Here are the most impor-
tant ones:
 Catalytic converters: You may be surprised to find out not only that
platinum is used in catalytic converters in transportation vehicles, but
also that this accounts for over 45 percent of total platinum demand.
Platinum’s unique characteristics make it a suitable metal in the produc-
tion of these pollution-reducing devices. As environmental fuel standards
become more stringent, expect the demand from this sector to increase
in the future. 
 Jewelry: At one point jewelry accounted for over 50 percent of total
demand for platinum. Although that number has decreased, the jewelry
industry is still a major purchaser of platinum metals for use in highly
prized jewelry. 
 Industrial: Because it’s a great conductor of heat and electricity, platinum
has wide applications in industry. It is used in the creation of everything
from personal computer hard drives to fiber optic cables. Despite its rel-
ative value, platinum will continue to be used for industrial purposes. 
A change in demand from one of these industries will affect the price of plat-
inum. The International Platinum Association maintains an updated database
of the uses of platinum. Check out their Web site for more information on
platinum supply and demand at www.platinuminfo.net. 
Going platinum
Platinum’s unique characteristics as a highly sought-after precious metal with
industrial applications makes it an ideal investment. Fortunately, you can invest
249
Chapter 15: Getting the Glitters: Gold, Silver, and Platinum

in platinum in a number of ways. I list a couple of these methods in the follow-
ing sections. 
Platinum futures contract
The most direct way of investing in platinum is by going through the futures
markets. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) offers a platinum
futures contract. Because of increased demand from the industrial sector and
other fundamental supply and demand reasons, the price of the NYMEX plat-
inum futures contract has experienced significant upward shift in recent
years. Check out the price of platinum in Figure 15-3.
The NYMEX platinum futures contract represents 50 Troy Ounces of platinum
and is available for trading electronically. It trades under the ticker symbol PL. 
Platinum mining companies
Here are a couple of companies you can check out that will give you direct
exposure to platinum mining activities:
 Stillwater Mining Company (NYSE: SWC): Stillwater Mining is headquar-
tered in Billings, Montana, and owns the rights to the Stillwater mining
complex in Montana, which contains one of the largest commercially
viable platinum mines in North America. This is a good play on North
American platinum mining activities. 
 Anglo-American PLC (NASDAQ: AAUK): Anglo-American is a diversified
mining company that has activities in gold, silver, platinum, and other
precious metals. I recommend Anglo-American because it has significant
interests in South African platinum mines, the largest mines in the world.
If you’re looking for an indirect exposure to South Africa’s platinum
mining industry, then Anglo-American does the trick. 
Investing in companies that mine precious metals, or any other commodity
for that matter, does not provide you with direct exposure to the price fluctu-
ations of that commodity. You need to be familiar with the fluctuations and
patterns of the equity markets in order to be able to profit from this invest-
ment methodology. You also need to take into consideration any external fac-
tors that will impact the performance of the company, such as management
effectiveness, total debt levels, areas of operation, and other metrics that are
specific to companies. That said, investing in the equity markets still gives
you access to the commodities markets.

S
teel, aluminum, and copper may not be as glamorous as their precious
metals counterparts — gold, silver, and platinum, covered in Chapter 15 —
but they are perhaps even more precious to the global economy. Gold, silver,
and platinum do have industrial applications, but their primary value is derived
from their ability to act as stores of value, in addition to their use in jewelry.
Steel, aluminum, and copper are the most important industrial components
of the metals complex, used to build everything from railcars to bridges. You
may be surprised to find out that steel is the most widely used metal in the
world — over 1.1 Billion Tons of it was produced in 2005. Steel is closely fol-
lowed by aluminum, which itself is closely followed by copper in terms of
total global output. So steel, aluminum, and copper — in that order — rank
at the top of the metals complex based on total output. 
Without these metals, which are literally the building blocks of modern soci-
eties, life as you and I know it wouldn’t exist. Buildings couldn’t be built with-
out steel, cars wouldn’t be as lightweight and efficient without aluminum,
and you probably wouldn’t be able to get any electricity in your home with-
out copper, which is the electrical conductor of choice. Due in part to rapid
industrialization in China (which happens to be the largest steel producer),
India, and other leading developing countries, demand for these three build-
ing block metals is strong and will remain robust for the medium to long term.
The future looks bright for these metals, and in this chapter I help you develop
a game plan to invest in these powerhouse metals. 

Building a Portfolio That’s 
As Strong As Steel
The development of steel, alongside iron, has changed the course of human
history. In fact, the last stage of prehistoric times, the iron age, is named thus
because humans mastered the iron and steel making process. This development
allowed societies to build tools and weapons, which speeded advancements
in construction and technology. Steel was responsible for another revolution
in the 19th century — the Industrial Revolution. Today, in a high-tech world
dominated by software and technological gadgets, this age-old metal is still
as reliable as ever. In fact, steel is making a resurgence as advanced develop-
ing countries — China, India, and Brazil — barrel down a path towards rapid
industrialization not unlike the one the West experienced in the 19th century
(see Chapter 2). Steel, which is iron alloyed with other compounds (usually
carbon), is still the most widely produced metal in the world today.
Steel is measured in Metric Tons, sometimes abbreviated as MT. For global
production and consumption figures, Million Metric Tons (MMT) is used. 
Steely facts
Before I introduce the best ways to invest in steel, take a look at the dynamics
of the broader steel industry. Steel production is dominated by China, which
has generous subsidies in place for its steel manufacturers. China now pro-
duces three times more steel than Japan, the second largest producer. For
a long time, the United States was the number one producer of steel, but its
254

Andrew Carnegie: Man of steel
Perhaps no one individual has had as much
impact on the modern, global steel industry as
Andrew Carnegie, the self-made industrialist.
Carnegie single-handedly established the steel
industry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which
would dominate the steel industry for decades.
He established the Carnegie Steel Corporation,
which would eventually become U.S. Steel, in
the 1890s and played a decisive role in the
industrialization of the young nation. His steel
was used in everything from building bridges to
railroads. Another contribution to the steel
industry, which is perhaps less known, is
Carnegie’s pioneering business philosophy of
“counter-cyclical investing”. Many business
executives at the time invested their profits to
upgrade facilities when business was booming;
this was a costly endeavor. Carnegie, identify-
ing the cyclical nature of the industry, would
undertake capital expenditures when the indus-
try was in decline — this was less expensive.
By investing when the industry was in a down
cycle, his cost upgrades would be less expen-
sive than during up cycles. This greatly helped
increase his company’s profitability, and it is a
business practice still used today. 

dominance eroded in large part due to competition from Asia (especially
China and Japan) and partly due to internal reasons (such as high costs of
running a steel mill in the United States). The United States is still an impor-
tant player in the steel industry, and other countries worth mentioning
include Russia, Germany, and South Korea. I list in Table 16-1 the top steel
producers in the world.

Investing in steel companies
Although futures contracts are available for everything from crude oil to
coffee, there is no underlying futures contract for steel. However, a number
255
Chapter 16: Metals That Prove Their Mettle: Steel, Aluminum, and Copper

of exchanges have expressed interest in developing a steel futures contract,
so keep an eye out for such a development. 
But for now, the best way to get exposure to steel is by investing in companies
that produce steel, specifically globally integrated steel companies. The com-
panies I list in Table 16-2 are global leaders in the steel industry.

The companies in Table 16-2 are the world leaders in the industry. However,
not all are available for investment. Some of them are private, and others
trade on foreign exchanges that don’t issue American Depository Receipts
(ADRs). (Turn to Chapter 18 for more on ADRs, which essentially allow you to
invest in foreign companies through U.S. financial institutions.) The following
list, however, represents good investments that not only are the best-run com-
panies, but also display the greatest potential for future market dominance: 
 U.S. Steel (NYSE: X): U.S. Steel, which was formed as a result of the consoli-
dation of Andrew Carnegie’s steel holdings in the early 20th century, is one
of the oldest and largest steel companies in the world. U.S. Steel represents
by itself the whole history of the modern steel industry. At one point it was
the largest producer of steel in the world. While it has scaled down its
operations, it is still a significant player in the industry today, and is the
seventh largest steel producing company worldwide (see Table 16-2). U.S.
Steel is involved in all aspects of the steel-making process from iron ore
mining and processing to the marketing of finished products. 
256
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

 Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE): The American steel industry remains a robust
competitor on the global stage, despite the dominance of Asian (particu-
larly Chinese) companies. Nucor operates almost exclusively in the United
States and, if you’re interested in getting exposure to the American steel
market, you should consider an investment in it. Nucor is also one of the
only companies to operate mini-mills domestically, which many argue
are more cost-efficient than the traditional blast furnaces. 
 Arcelor-Mittal (Newly combined entity is not yet listed on an exchange,
pending merger approval): While I was writing this book, the two largest
steel companies in the world entered into a merger agreement after
months of contentious talks. The newly-formed company will have con-
trol over 10 percent of the world’s steel market (in terms of output) and
produce approximately 120 MMT of steel annually. The merger could
result in cost-cutting synergies across both companies. I recommend
considering an investment in this new steel behemoth in part due to its
size and the resulting economies of scale. I examine the prospects of this
new company in Chapter 18. 
Aluminum: Everything Is Illuminated
Aluminum is one of the most ubiquitous metals of modern society. It’s not
just all those aluminum soda cans that account for its widespread use — 
aluminum is also used in transportation (cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes),
construction, and electrical power lines, to name just a few end-uses. As a
matter of fact, aluminum is the second-most widely used metal in the world,
right after steel. Because of its indispensability, there is room to include this
metal in your portfolio. In this section, I show you how to do just that. 
Aluminum is generally measured in Metric Tons (MT). 
Just the aluminum facts
Aluminum is a lightweight metal that is resistant to corrosion. Because of
these characteristics, it is widely used to create a number of products, from
cars to jets. Here are a few items that are made out of aluminum. You may
recognize a few of them:
 Transportation: Aluminum is used to create the body, axles, and, in
some cases, engines of cars. In addition, large commercial aircrafts
are built using aluminum because of its light weight and sturdiness. 
 Packaging: Almost a quarter of aluminum is used to create aluminum
wrap and foil, along with beverage cans and rivets. 
257
Chapter 16: Metals That Prove Their Mettle: Steel, Aluminum, and Copper

 Construction: Aluminum has industrial uses as well that include usage
in the construction of buildings, oil pipelines, and even bridges. Building
constructors are attracted to it because it is lightweight, durable, and
sturdy.

Aluminum futures
You can invest in aluminum through the futures markets. Currently, two
major contracts for aluminum are available. The first one is through the
London Metal Exchange (LME), while the second one is traded in the COMEX
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). 
 LME Aluminum: The London Metal Exchange’s (LME) aluminum 
contract is the most liquid in the world. The LME aluminum 
258
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

contract represents a size of 25,000 tons and its price is quoted in US
Dollars. 
 COMEX Aluminum: The aluminum contract traded on the COMEX divi-
sion of the NYMEX trades in units of 44,000 pounds, with a 99.7 percent
purity. The contract is tradable during the current calendar month as
well as for the next 25 consecutive months. It trades under the symbol
AL and is also available for trade electronically. 
Because the NYMEX is located in the United States, it is regulated by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, because the
LME is located in the United Kingdom, it falls under the jurisdiction of the
Financial Services Authority (FSA), the British regulator. (For more on com-
modity exchanges and regulatory bodies, please turn to Chapter 8.) This
information is crucial because if you start investing in futures, and some-
thing goes wrong, you need to know who to turn to. These regulatory
bodies are well equipped to handle customer complaints and questions. 
To give you an idea of the performance of aluminum in recent years, Figure
16-1 shows you the chart of COMEX aluminum. As you can see, the underly-
ing demand from rapidly industrializing nations such as China and India has
resulted in upward price pressures on the metal.

Aluminum companies
Another way I recommend investing in aluminum is by investing in compa-
nies that produce and manufacture aluminum products. Here are a few com-
panies that make the cut:
 Alcoa (NYSE: AA): Alcoa is the world leader in aluminum production.
It is involved in all aspects of the aluminum industry and produces pri-
mary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, as well as alumina. The company
has operations in over 40 countries and services a large number of
industries, from aerospace to construction. If you’re looking to get the
broadest exposure to the aluminum market, then you can’t go wrong
with Alcoa. 
 Alcan (NYSE: AL): Alcan, which is headquartered in Canada, is a leading
global manufacturer of aluminum products. It has operations that cover
the spectrum of aluminum processing, from mining and refining to smelt-
ing and recycling. Like Alcoa, Alcan provides you with wide exposure to
aluminum. 
 Aluminum Corporation of China (NYSE: ACH): Like its name implies,
ACH is primarily engaged in the production of aluminum in the Chinese
market. I recommend this company, which trades on the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), because it provides you with a foothold in the alu-
minum Chinese market, which has the potential to be the biggest such
market in the future. Besides this competitive advantage, ACH is a well-
run company with profit margins that, during the writing of this book,
were in excess of 20 percent. 
A Visit to Dr. Copper
Copper, the third-most widely used metal in the world, has applications in
many sectors, including construction, electricity conduction, and engineering
large-scale industrial projects. Copper is sought after because of its high elec-
trical conductivity, resistance to corrosion, and malleability. Copper played a
huge role during the Industrial Revolution and in connecting and wiring the
modern world. Because of the current trends of industrialization and urban-
ization across the globe (see Chapter 2), demand for copper has been — and
will remain — very strong, making it a good investment. 
Quick copper facts
Copper is used for a wide variety of purposes, from building and construction
to electrical wiring and engineering. To get a better idea of its wide usage,
check out the breakdown of copper use by sector in Table 16-4.

You probably come across items made from copper on a daily basis but may
have never given too much thought about its ubiquity. Here are everyday
items that are made from copper:
 Electrical wiring
 Construction tubes, pipes and fittings
 High-speed internet cables
 Industrial sleeve bearings
 Doorknobs
 Plumbing tubes
 Artistic (bronze statues such as the Statue of Liberty)
 Coinage (US coins like the quarter and dime are over 90 percent copper)
 Musical instruments (brass instruments such as the trumpet and the
tuba)
Copper is often alloyed with other metals, usually with nickel and zinc (both
covered in Chapter 17). When copper and nickel are alloyed, the resulting
metal is bronze; when copper is alloyed with zinc it results in brass. It’s kind
of ironic but the US penny, which is the only US coin that’s a reddish/brown
color (the color of copper), is the only coin that only uses 2.5 percent
copper — 97.5 percent of the penny is made from zinc. The other coins in
US currency — which are all silvery/white colors — contain more than 90
percent copper. 
If you’re interested in finding out more about copper usage, I recommend 
you consult the Copper Development Association. Their Web site is www.
copper.org.

Copper futures contracts
Like most of the other important industrial metals, there is a futures market
available for copper trading. Most of this market is used by large industrial
producers and consumers of the metal, although you can also use it for
investment purposes. You have two copper contracts to choose from:
 LME Copper (LME: CAD): The copper contract on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) accounts for over 90 percent of total copper futures
activity. It represents a lot size of 25 tons. Note: Because the LME is
located in the United Kingdom, it is regulated by the British Financial
Services Authority (FSA). 
 COMEX Copper (COMEX: HG): This copper contract trades in the COMEX
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). COMEX copper,
which trades during the current month and subsequent 23 calendar
months, is traded both electronically and through the open outcry
system. It represents 25,000 pounds of copper and trades under the
symbol HG. 
Demand for copper from China, India, and other advanced developing coun-
tries is increasing, and that has put upward pressure on the price of copper.
Check out in Figure 16-2 the price of copper futures on the COMEX division of
the NYMEX.

Copper companies
Another investment vehicle I recommend is getting involved in companies
that specialize in mining and processing copper ore. The companies I list
here are leaders in their industry and are involved in all aspects of the
copper supply chain. The only drawback of investing in companies is that
you don’t get direct exposure to the price fluctuations of the metals. Still,
they’re a good option if you don’t want to venture into the futures markets. 
 Phelps Dodge Corporation (NYSE: PD): Founded in 1834, Phelps Dodge
is one of the oldest mining companies in the United States. It is also one
of the largest manufacturers and producers of copper and copper prod-
ucts in the world. The company has a global presence in copper mining,
with operations in the United States, South Africa, the Philippines, and
Peru, among others. Because of its size and experience in the industry,
Phelps Dodge is in a good position to capitalize from the increased
demand for copper. 
 Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX): One of the reasons why I like
Freeport-McMoRan is that it’s one of the lowest cost producers of
copper in the world. It has copper mining and smelting operations
across the globe and has a significant presence in Indonesia and Papua
New Guinea. The company specializes in the production of highly con-
centrated copper ore, which it then sells on the open market. FCX also
has some operations in gold and silver. 
I cover copper companies in-depth in Chapter 18. I also examine integrated
and diversified mining companies to help you design an investment strategy
that effectively allows you to “buy the market.”

Weighing Investments in Heavy

In This Chapter
 Sizing up the palladium market
 Examining investments in zinc 
 Developing an investment strategy for nickel
I
n this chapter, I go over a diverse group of metals: palladium, a precious
metal, and two industrial metals, zinc and nickel. These metals are impor-
tant components of the metals complex in their own right: palladium because
of its precious metal status and as a part of the Platinum Group Metals (PGM),
and nickel and zinc for their wide usage in industry. These metals may not
get much attention from the financial press, but you should still consider
including them in your portfolio because they’re essential building blocks
of the global economy. I outline the market characteristics of each of these
metals, so that you can determine whether they’re right for you. 
Palladium: Metal for 
the New Millennium
Palladium, which belongs to the Platinum Group Metals (PGM), is a popular
alternative to platinum in the automotive industry and the jewelry industry.
Its largest use is in the creation of pollution-reducing catalytic converters.
Palladium’s malleability and corrosion resistance make it the perfect metal
for such usage. In addition, because palladium is less expensive on a troy
ounce basis than platinum ($315/oz. vs. $1235/oz., 2006 figures), it is increas-
ingly becoming the metal of choice for the manufacture of these devices. 

Besides its usage in catalytic converters and jewelry, palladium is also used in
dentistry and electronics. I list in Table 17-1 the main consumers of palladium.

Palladium has benefited from more stringent fuel emission standards estab-
lished by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other international
environmental organizations. When pollution-reducing regulation was estab-
lished in the 1970s, demand for palladium skyrocketed as a direct result of
these changes. All things equal, if emissions standards are further improved
and require a new generation of catalytic converters, demand for palladium
will increase. Another reason to be bullish on palladium is that the number
of automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles equipped with platinum- and 
palladium-made catalytic converters is increasing, particularly in China. So
if you invest in palladium, make sure you keep an eye out on automobile 
manufacturing patterns. 
The palladium market is essentially dominated by two countries: Russia and
South Africa. These two countries account for over 85 percent of total palla-
dium production, as you can see in Table 17-2.

Because palladium production is dominated by these two countries, however,
any supply disruption from either country has a significant impact on palla-
dium prices. This was just the case in the beginning of the year 2000, when
the Russian government announced that shipments of palladium and other
platinum group metals would be halted for the year. As you can see in Figure
17-1, the price of palladium in the year 2000 almost doubled, partly in response
to Russian supply-side disruptions. 
The Russian government eventually announced a resumption of palladium
mining activity and prices dropped back to normal levels in 2001. As a result
of this price shock, mining companies have tried to diversify their activities
beyond Russia and South Africa. However, there’s just no way around the fact
that most of the world’s reserves of palladium ore are located in these two
countries. As a matter of fact, perhaps no two countries dominate a commod-
ity as much as Russia and South Africa dominate palladium.

Chapter 17: Weighing Investments in Heavy and Not-So-Heavy Metals

Make sure to keep in mind the unique market structure as you consider
investing in this precious metal. 
One of the best — albeit indirect — methods of getting exposure to the palla-
dium markets is by investing in companies that mine the metal. A number
of companies specialize in this activity, but here are a couple I recommend
taking a look at:
 Stillwater Mining Company (NYSE: SWC): Stillwater Mining, based in
Montana, is the largest producer of palladium outside South Africa and
Russia. Although it is involved in platinum and other PGM, its primary
mining output is palladium. It produces approximately 500,000 Ounces
of palladium a year, primarily through North American mines. 
 North American Palladium (AMEX: PAL): North American Palladium,
headquartered in Toronto, has a significant presence in the Canadian
palladium ore mining business. It is the largest producer of palladium in
Canada, with production in 2005 totaling almost 200,000 Ounces. North
American palladium is your entry into the lucrative Canadian palladium
mining sector.
Although these are the two largest companies that trade publicly on American
exchanges, several international companies have significantly larger palla-
dium mining activities. Just make sure you’re aware of the many regulatory
differences between American and overseas markets before investing in 
companies that trade in overseas stock markets. 
Here are a couple of international palladium companies to consider:
 Anglo Platinum Group (South Africa): While Anglo Platinum Group
invests in platinum group metals, as the name suggests, it is also one of
the largest producers of palladium in the world. The company produced
over 2.5 Million Ounces of palladium in 2005 and is estimated to have
reserves of over 200 Million Ounces (this includes other platinum group
metals). With its operations located primarily in South Africa, Anglo
Platinum Group is your gateway to South African palladium. Its shares
are traded in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), as well as the
London Stock Exchange (LSE). 
 Norilsk Nickel (Russia): Norilsk Nickel may not be a household name,
but it is the largest producer of palladium in the world. It dominates the
Russian palladium industry, which is the largest in the world (see Table
17-2). While the company has large palladium mining activities, it’s also
a major player in copper and nickel ore mining. The company’s shares
are available through the Moscow Inter-bank Currency Exchange (MICEX).
For folks who are comfortable in the futures markets, the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) offers a futures contract that tracks palladium. This con-
tract represents 100 Troy Ounces of palladium and trades both electronically
and during the open outcry session. It trades under the symbol PA.

Zinc and Grow Rich
Zinc is the fourth-most widely used metal, right behind iron/steel, aluminum,
and copper (which I cover in Chapter 16). Zinc, which has unique abilities to
resist corrosion and oxidation, is used for metal galvanization, the process of
applying a metal coating to another metal to prevent rust and corrosion. As
you can see from Table 17-3, galvanizing metals (particularly steel) is by far
the largest application of zinc.

The best way to invest in zinc is by going through the futures markets. The
London Metal Exchange (LME) offers a futures contract for zinc, which has
been trading since the early 1900s and is the industry benchmark for zinc
pricing. The contract trades in lots of 25 Tons and is available for trading
during the current month and the subsequent 27 months. Figure 17-2 charts
zinc’s recent performance.

You Won’t Get Nickel and Dimed
by Investing in Nickel
Nickel is a ferrous metal, which means it belongs to the iron group of metals.
It is an important industrial metal that is used as an alloy with metals such
as iron and copper, and it is sought-after because of its ductility, malleability,
and resistance to corrosion. 
One of nickel’s primary applications is in the creation of stainless steel. When
steel is alloyed with nickel, its resistance to corrosion increases dramatically.
Because stainless steel is a necessity of modern life, and a large portion of
nickel goes toward the creation of this important metal alloy, you can rest
assured that demand for nickel will remain strong. As you can see from Table
17-4, although there are a number of important uses for nickel, the creation of
stainless steel remains its primary application.

Australia has the largest reserves of nickel, and its proximity to the rapidly
industrializing Asian center — China and India — is a strategic advantage.
Another major player in the nickel markets is Russia; the Russian company
Norilsk Nickel (covered in the section on palladium) is the largest producer
of nickel in the world. Nickel mining is a labor-intensive industry, but those
countries that have large reserves of this special metal are poised to do very
well. Check out the countries with the largest reserves of nickel in Table 17-5.

The London Metal Exchange (LME) offers a futures contract for nickel. The
nickel futures contract on the LME provides you with the most direct access
to the nickel market. It trades in lots of 6 Tons, and its tick size is $5.00 per
ton. As with zinc, it trades during the first month, in addition to 27 subse-
quent months. 
Check out the historical performance of nickel on the LME in Figure 17-3.
The term nickel, used to denote the five-cent coin, is misleading because the
coin is actually primarily composed of copper (75 percent). Nickel, the metal,
only makes up 25 percent of nickel, the coin.

The London Metal Exchange
The London Metal Exchange (LME), where the
nickel and zinc contracts are traded, is one of the
oldest futures exchanges in the world. It traces
its origins back to the late 19th century, during
Britain’s Industrial Revolution. The Industrial
Revolution was in part fueled by large consump-
tion of metals, and metals producers and con-
sumers needed a place to establish benchmark
prices and transact with each other. That’s
where the LME came to play an important role.
Today, the LME is one of the only exchanges ded-
icated to trading non-ferrous metals. Besides
nickel and zinc, the exchange offers futures
contracts for aluminum, copper, lead, and tin.
The LME still has open outcry trading sessions,
although it has introduced electronic trading as
well. 

Chapter 18
Mine Your Own Business:
Unearthing the Top
Mining Companies
In This Chapter
 Understanding mining companies
 Determining the suitability of mining companies
 Identifying the mining conglomerates
 Examining specialized mining companies
T
rading metals outright — through the futures markets — can be tricky
for the uninitiated trader. You have to keep track of a number of moving
pieces, such as contract expiration dates, margin calls, trading months, and
other variables. In addition, metals on the futures markets can be subject to
extreme price volatility, and you can set yourself up for disastrous losses. So
it’s understandable if you’d rather not trade metals futures contracts. But
this doesn’t mean that you should ignore the whole metals sub-asset class
altogether because you could be missing out on some tasty returns. 
One possible avenue for opening up your portfolio to metals is investing in
companies that specialize in mining metals and minerals. A number of such
companies exist, and their performance has been stellar recently. For exam-
ple, Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTP), a mining conglomerate — which I discuss in this
chapter — saw its stock price surge from $60 in 2002 to over $200 in 2006.
Although not all mining companies have had similar performances, ignoring
such a large group of the market is not advisable. 
In this chapter, I look at the top mining companies — both the conglomerates
and the specialized ones — to help you identify the best ones to include in
your portfolio. 

Diversified Mining Companies
Like the large integrated energy companies — ExxonMobil and BP, covered in
Chapter 11 — diversified mining companies are involved in all aspects of the
metals production process. These companies, which often employ tens of
thousands of people, have operations in all four corners of the globe. They are
involved in the excavation of metals — both precious and base metals, ferrous
and non-ferrous — as well as the transformation of these metals into finished
products and subsequent distribution of the end products to consumers. 
Investing in one of these companies gives you exposure not only to a wide
variety of metals, but also to the whole mining supply chain. I’ve selected
the “best of breeds” and evaluate their investment suitability in the following
sections.
BHP Billiton
BHP Billiton (formed as a result of the merger between Broken Hill Proprietary —
an Australian company — and Billiton — an Anglo-Dutch company — in 2001)
is one of the largest mining companies in the world. BHP Billiton, headquartered
in Melbourne, Australia, has mining operations in over 25 countries including
Australia, Canada, the United States, South Africa, and Papua New Guinea.
The company processes a large number of metals, including aluminum,
copper, silver, and iron; it also has small oil and natural gas operations in
Algeria and Pakistan. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) under the symbol BHP. 
One of the reasons I like BHP Billiton is that it offers economies of scale. This
is a large company, by any standard. Here’s a snapshot of the company’s
financial performance. (All figures are for 2006.)
 Market Capitalization: $125 Billion
 Revenues: $32.30 Billion
 Net Income: $7.80 Billion
 Free Cash Flow: $8.27 Billion
 Profit Margins: 24.22%
I’m providing you here only a snapshot of recent financial performance.
Before you make an investment in Billiton, or any other company, you want
to look at a number of metrics to determine its financial health. You should
go through the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows —
among other key financial statements — with a fine-toothed comb. Once you
determine that the company has a clean financial bill of health and is poised
for growth, only then should you proceed with your investment. Make sure to
read Chapter 6 for more on the due diligence process. 
274
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

The company has benefited handsomely from the increasing prices of com-
modities such as copper and aluminum. As a result, BHP Billiton’s profit
increased by a staggering 90 percent between 2004 and 2005. This increase
is reflected in its stock price, illustrated in Figure 18-1.
Remember that past results do not guarantee future performance. Commodity
prices are cyclical in nature and prices for metals such as copper, silver, and
aluminum cannot go up in a straight line forever. Make sure you take into
account the cyclicality factor as you move forward with your commodity
investments. 
Rio Tinto
Rio Tinto is a mining company rich in both minerals and history. The com-
pany was founded in 1873 by the Rothschild banking family to mine ore
deposits in Spain. Today, Rio Tinto boasts operations in Africa, Australia,
Europe, the Pacific Rim, North America, Australia, and South America. It is a
true mining conglomerate that is involved in all facets of the mining supply
chain, from extraction to transformation and distribution. 
The company is involved in the production of a number of commodities,
including iron ore, copper, aluminum, and titanium. In addition, Rio Tinto
has interests in diamonds, manufacturing almost 30 percent of global natural
diamonds, processed primarily through its mining activities in Australia. 
By investing in Rio Tinto, you not only get a company that has extensive
operations across the mining complex but one that is in a solid financial

 Free Cash Flow: $3.20 Billion

These strong numbers, which reflect increased demand for the commodities
the company is involved in, have had a positive mid- to long-term impact on
the company’s stock, as you can see in Figure 18-2. Rio Tinto trades on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol RTP.
Anglo-American
Anglo-American PLC began mining gold in South Africa in 1917. It was a ven-
ture by British and American entrepreneurs (hence the name), who saw an
opportunity in developing South African mines. Ever since, it has played an
important role in the development of South Africa’s gold mining industry.
Today, Anglo-American has operations in all four corners of the globe and
operates in over 20 countries. It is involved in the production and distribu-
tion of a wide array of metals, minerals, and natural resources including gold,
silver, and platinum but also diamonds and paper packaging (it actually owns
45 percent of DeBeers, the diamond company). 
I recommend Anglo-American as a long-term investment because it has been
in the business for almost a century, it’s involved in almost all aspects of the
mining industry, and the scale of its operations is global. 
The company is listed in the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
AAL. In addition, it has American Depository Receipts listed in the NASDAQ
National Market that trade under the symbol AAUK. 
When a foreign company wants to access the American capital markets, it
has the option of issuing its shares as American Depository Receipts (ADRs).
ADRs are issued by a domestic bank (such as the Bank of New York, which is
actually the largest issuer of ADRs) to the American investing public, while

the bank holds shares of the foreign company overseas. The advantage of
the ADR is that it allows American investors to invest in foreign companies
without going through foreign exchanges. The ADRs trade in such a way that
they reflect the daily price movements of the underlying stock as it is traded
in a stock exchange overseas. For more information, you can check out the

Chapter 18: Mine Your Own Business: Unearthing the Top Mining Companies
Making money during the mining merger mania
Profiting from the merger activity in the mining
industry can be a good investment strategy.
Since the year 2000, a number of large compa-
nies have entered into merger agreements (the
marriage of the Australian BHP and the British
Billiton, which resulted in BHP Billiton, is a good
example), and this trend is likely to continue as
mining companies seek to add new capacity by
merging their activities and/or acquiring smaller
rivals. In 2004, for instance, there were a total of
49 deals in the mining industry valued at $5.6
Billion; in 2005 the number of deals increased to
85 with a total value of $7.4 Billion.
Due to the sustained levels of high commodity
prices, mining companies have large cash
reserves and are looking to spend them to beef
up their operations by acquiring other compa-
nies. Mergers and acquisitions present long-
term value opportunities to these companies
and their shareholders and are likely to continue
in the years to come. During the writing of this
book for example, Phelps Dodge (one of the
largest copper mining companies) launched a
simultaneous double bid to acquire Inco and
Falconbridge, both independent Canadian mining
companies, in a synchronized transaction valued
at over $40 Billion.
The caveat of profiting from merger announce-
ments, of course, is identifying the “hunter” and
the “hunted,” the acquirer and the target. This 
is not easy because, theoretically, there are 
an infinite number of merger and acquisition
combinations in any given sector. The best way
to do so is to regularly monitor the industry for
news, special announcements, or unusual trad-
ing activity. Specifically, keep your eye out for
any announcements by companies in Forms 8K
(filings with the SEC that announce special sit-
uations); read news stories about the compa-
nies in the industry (I recommend reading the
Wall Street Journal’s “Heard On The Street”
column); and remain alert to any sudden and
unusual movements in the companies’ stock
activity, such as an unusual spike in volume.
(Check out Chapter 10 for more on volume and
other technical metrics.) 
Identifying possible merger announcements is
not an exact science, but it can yield some phe-
nomenal returns. So much so that a lot of folks try
to get insider information regarding merger
deals, which is illegal and has led to some of the
biggest financial scandals. If you trade on
information that is not public, you could end up
going to jail. So make sure you don’t do it! Also
remember that, as a general rule, you want to
buy the “hunted” before any merger announce-
ments because the stock price of a target com-
pany tends to increase with any merger
announcement while that of the acquiring com-
pany decreases. The logic here is that the
acquiring company is paying a premium for its
acquisition and will have to bear the costs of
incorporating this new entity within its corporate
and operational structure. 

Specialized Mining Companies
The benefit of investing in diversified mining companies, like those profiled 
in the previous section, is that you get to “buy the market” in one fell swoop.
However, what if you spot a rally in gold, copper, or another individual metal
and want to profit from this specific trend? In this case, the most direct expo-
sure through the equity markets is by investing in companies that specialize
in specific metals. I identify and evaluate some of these companies in this
section. 
Newmont Mining — Gold
Newmont is headquartered in Colorado but operates gold mines all over the
world. It is the largest producer of gold in South America, one of the most
important gold regions, and has wholly owned subsidiaries or joint ventures
in Australia, Canada, and Uzbekistan. 
I recommend Newmont because it is a premier player in the competitive gold
mining industry. It has some competitive advantages, including its control of
50,000 square miles of land containing over 90 Million Equity Ounces of gold.
(Equity ounces is the amount of gold measured in troy ounces multiplied by
the current market price of gold as measured in US Dollars.) In addition, it
has a strong balance sheet and is in strong financial condition. Check out
some of Newmont’s numbers (2006 Figures):
 Market Capitalization: $23.8 Billion
 Revenues: $4.6 Billion
 Net Income: $502 Million
 Free Cash Flow: $47.8 Million
 Profit Margins: 9.70%
If you’re looking for a well-managed company with extensive experience and
operations in the gold mining industry, then you can’t go wrong with Newmont.
(Make sure to read Chapter 15 for in-depth coverage of the gold industry.)
Silver Wheaton — Silver
Silver Wheaton focuses on one thing and one thing only: silver. While some
mining companies may have small operations in secondary metals, Silver
Wheaton generates 100 percent of its revenues from silver mining. Specifically,
the company operates mines primarily in Mexico and Sweden. The company’s
modus operandi is to purchase silver directly from the mines and sell it on
278
Part IV: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals 

the open market for a profit. As a result, the company has very little — if any —
operating overhead. This results in strong revenues and cash flows, as you
can see:
 Market Capitalization: $1.95 Billion
 Revenues: $80.53 Million
 Net Income: $33.89 Million
 Operating Cash Flow: $38.7 Million
 Profit Margins: 42.08%
Silver Wheaton may not generate the same kinds of revenues as Anglo-American
or other large mining conglomerates, but it’s a well-run company with high
profit margins and stable revenues. 
Silver Wheaton’s numbers reflect a strong operating background. It is actually
the second producer of silver, in terms of annual output measured in troy
ounces. It produced over 15 Million Troy Ounces in 2005. 
While I was writing this book, UBS (the Swiss investment bank) initiated
research coverage of Silver Wheaton. It issued a “buy” rating for the stock,
which is a good sign for the company.  
For more information on the silver industry, including the top producers,
the largest consuming segments, and an analysis of additional investment
methodologies, please turn to Chapter 15. 
Phelps Dodge — Copper
Phelps Dodge has been in the copper business for over 150 years. It started
as a mining concern and played a key role in the industrialization of the United
States. Copper was in high demand by the growing nation, and Phelps Dodge
was there to supply it. Today, Phelps Dodge is still the market leader when it
comes to copper production, and it also has significant operations in the pro-
duction of molybdenum and molybdenum-based chemicals.
Molybdenum (pronounced mah-lib-den-um) is known as a transition metal
because it’s principally used as an alloy with a number of metals. It has wide
applications in industry, used, for instance, in the construction of oil pipelines,
aircraft engines, and missiles. 
Phelps Dodge has two distinct entities that operate independently of each
other: Phelps Dodge Mining and Phelps Dodge Industries. In addition, during
the writing of this book, the company entered into a deal to acquire two
mining companies: Inco and Falconbridge, both of Canada. This deal, which 
279
Chapter 18: Mine Your Own Business: Unearthing the Top Mining Companies

is still ongoing as of the writing, is sure to expand what is an already large
company, as you can see from the company’s 2006 figures:
 Market Capitalization: $15.86 Billion
 Revenues: $8.63 Billion
 Net Income: $1.55 Billion
 Operating Cash Flow: $800.2 Million
 Profit Margins: 17.43%
Because of the increasing price of copper, the company’s primary commod-
ity, the Phelps Dodge stock has performed well in recent years, as you can
see in Figure 18-3.
Phelps Dodge has an active hedging program, where it enters into agreements
with other market participants through the futures markets in order to hedge
against price risk. However, not all hedgers are created equal and Phelps
Dodge has taken some hits in the past as a result of its hedging activities.
During the second quarter of 2006, for instance, the company’s net income
fell to $471.1 Million from $682.3 Million the previous year-over-year quarter.
This was a direct result of losses it incurred in hedging-related activity. So
even though the price of copper was robust during this period, and the com-
pany would have benefited from these strong prices, its external activities
were negatively affected. Always make sure you know what’s going on with a
company before investing in it.
You can find more information about the copper market and industry in
Chapter 16. 
Alcoa — Aluminum

soda cans, and fighter jets are all partly made from aluminum, and Alcoa is
the primary supplier of this metal in the market today. Alcoa, whose acronym
stands for the Aluminum Company of America, is involved in all phases of the
aluminum supply chain. It provides aluminum-based products to a wide range
of customers, including the aerospace and automotive industries, individual
and commercial enterprises, the manufacturing sector, and the military. 
Another reason I like Alcoa is that it is making some aggressive moves overseas
and signing strategic, long-term pacts with some of the top aluminum produc-
ers. It recently entered into a partnership with the Aluminum Corporation of
China (NYSE: ACH), China’s largest aluminum producer, and is positioning
itself to capitalize on the Chinese market, possibly the largest aluminum
market in the future. 
The following numbers are proof of Alcoa’s influence in the market: 
 Market Capitalization: $25.89 Billion
 Revenues: $28.45 Billion
 Net Income: $1.83 Billion
 Free Cash Flow: $289.38 Million
 Profit Margins: 6.56%
As you can see in Figure 18-4, the stock’s performance has been choppy in
recent years, so you want to make sure you research the company as much
as possible before you take the plunge. 
Make sure to read Chapter 16 for a close examination of the aluminum market.

Mittal Steel and Arcelor. Mittal Steel, under the management of Indian-born
steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, launched an unsolicited bid to acquire Arcelor,
the Luxembourg-based high-end steel manufacturer, in January 2006. After a
long, protracted five-month takeover battle, which involved poison pill and
white knight takeover defense strategies, the boards of both companies agreed
to a merger of equals. 
In Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A), companies use a number of strategies to
fend off hostile takeovers. Two of the most popular defense strategies include
pursuing a merger or acquisition with a “friendly” company, known as a white
knight. The poison pill strategy involves making the company unattractive to
the acquirer, such as increasing levels of debt or increasing the number of
shares outstanding to dilute their value. 
The new company combines the Number 1 and Number 2 steel producers
in the world and will control over 10 percent of global steel output. Arcelor-
Mittal is going to be a truly global steel manufacturer with operations in all
four corners of the globe and across all stages of the steel-making process. If
the performance of the new company is anything like the recent performance
of Mittal stock, shown in Figure 18-5, then you would be missing out on some
healthy returns. 
Turn to Chapter 16 for an in-depth examination of the global steel industry.

from Coffee, Cocoa, Sugar, and

In This Chapter
 Recognizing the value of investing in coffee
 Developing a trading strategy for cocoa
 Evaluating the sugar markets
 Outlining a strategy for trading orange juice
T
he commodities I present in this chapter — coffee, cocoa, sugar, and
frozen concentrated orange juice — are known as soft commodities. Soft
commodities are those commodities that are usually grown, as opposed to
those that are mined, such as metals, or those that are raised, such as live-
stock. The softs, as they are sometimes known, represent a significant portion
of the commodities markets. They are indispensable and cyclical, just like
energy and metals, but they are also unique because they’re edible and sea-
sonal. Seasonality is actually a major distinguishing characteristic of soft
commodities because they can only be grown during specific times of the
year and in specific geographical locations — usually in tropical areas. (This
is why these commodities are also known as tropical commodities.) In this
chapter, I show you that there’s nothing soft about these soft commodities. 
Give Your Portfolio a Buzz 
by Investing in Coffee
Coffee, which originated in Arabia sometime in the 15th century, is today the
second-most widely traded commodity in terms of physical volume — behind
only crude oil. Coffee is an important global commodity because folks just

love a good cup of coffee. In this section, I show you how to stay grounded
while investing in this market.
Coffee: It’s time for your big break
Like a number of other commodities, coffee production is dominated by a
handful of countries. Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam are the largest producing
countries, as you can see in Table 19-1.

Large scale coffee production is measured in bags. One bag of coffee weighs
60 Kilograms or approximately 132 Pounds. 
If you want to investigate the ins and outs of the coffee markets further, I rec-
ommend consulting the following resources:
 International Coffee Organization: www.ico.org
 National Coffee Association of the USA: www.ncausa.org
If you’re interested in researching the coffee markets more thoroughly, I rec-
ommend Mark Pendergrast’s excellent book Uncommon Grounds: The History
of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World (Basic Books). This book will help
you understand the mechanics of the global coffee trade; you may then capi-
talize on this information by applying it towards your trading strategy.

Part V: Going Down to the Farm: Trading Agricultural Products 

Brewing the right investment strategy
Just like choosing the right flavor when buying your cup of coffee, knowing
the different types of coffees available for investment is important. The
world’s coffee production is pretty much made up of two types of beans:
 Arabica: Arabica coffee is the most widely grown coffee plant in the world,
accounting for over 60 percent of global coffee production. Arabica is
grown in countries as diverse as Brazil and Indonesia. It is the premium
coffee bean, adding a richer taste to any brew, and, as a result, is the
most expensive coffee bean in the world. Because of its high quality, it
serves as the benchmark for coffee prices all over the world. 
 Robusta: Robusta accounts for about 40 percent of total coffee produc-
tion. Because it’s easier to grow than Arabica coffee, it’s also less 
expensive.
You have several ways to invest in coffee production. One way is by buying
coffee in the futures markets, and the other is by investing in companies that
specialize in running gourmet coffee shops. 
The coffee futures contract: It could be your cup of tea
The coffee futures markets are used to determine the future price of coffee
and, more importantly, to protect producers and purchasers of coffee from
wild price swings (see Chapter 9 for more on futures contracts). In addition
to the hedging opportunities, the coffee futures markets allow individual
investors to profit from coffee price variations. The most liquid coffee 
futures contract is available on the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT). 
287
Chapter 19: Breakfast of Champions
The New York Board of Trade: The place 
for trading places and soft commodities
Besides being tropical commodities, the com-
modities I analyze in this chapter have another
common characteristic: They all trade on the
New York Board of Trade (NYBOT). The NYBOT
is one of the oldest exchanges in the United
States and is the premier location for the trade
of agricultural commodities. The NYBOT also
offers futures contracts that track cotton,
ethanol, and wood pulp (pulp is used to make
paper), as well as products that track several
financial futures, such as the Euro (the currency),
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index,
and the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index. The
NYBOT is also where the movie Trading Places,
with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, was shot.
In the final scene of the movie, Murphy and
Aykroyd corner the orange juice market and, in
the process, wipe out Randolph and Mortimer
Duke. 

Launched in 1882, the NYBOT coffee futures contract is one of the oldest
futures contract in the market today. Here are its contract specs:
 Contract Ticker Symbol: KC
 Contract Size: 37,500 Pounds
 Underlying Commodity: Pure Arabica Coffee 
 Price Fluctuation: $0.0005/pound ($18.75 per contract)
 Trading Months: March, May, July, September, December
The price chart in Figure 19-1 gives you an idea of the performance of the
coffee futures contract in recent years.
Because of seasonality, cyclicality, and geopolitical factors, coffee can be a
volatile commodity subject to extreme price swings. Make sure to research
the coffee markets inside and out before investing. 
Double tall iced white mocha valencia with sugar 
on top! Investing in gourmet coffee shops
In New York City, where I live, as in most other metropolitan areas, you can’t
walk a block without spotting two or three gourmet coffee shops, especially
Starbucks. Coffee shops are nothing new — Arabian coffee shops sprang up
in the Middle East as early as the 15th century. Today, coffee shops are still
a place where you can enjoy a nice (and big) cup of coffee while socializing
with friends.

But behind the relaxed, laid-back atmosphere is a complex money-making
operation. Coffee is serious business and you can profit from the coffee craze
that has gripped America (the largest consumer of coffee in the world) and is
spreading throughout Europe and newly-developing countries like India and
China by investing in the companies that are capitalizing on this trend. Find
out where your $4.50 for a cup of coffee is going and profit from it. 
While you’re probably familiar with Starbucks, a number of other gourmet
coffee shops and distributors provide you with a good investment opportu-
nity. I list these purveyors of coffee here:
 Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX): Perhaps no other brand has come
to represent an entire industry as Starbucks has coffee. (The only other
brands that come to mind are Kleenex with tissues and Xerox with 
photocopiers.) Starbucks is a cultural phenomenon but, more impor-
tantly, it’s also a financial Juggernaut. This is a $25 Billion company with
over $7 Billion in revenue (2006 figures). Starbucks dominates the entire
coffee supply chain, from purchasing and roasting to selling and market-
ing. It has over 10,000 stores worldwide, primarily in the United States
and Europe but also in China, Singapore, and even one in Saudi Arabia. 
 Peet’s Coffee and Tea, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEET): Peet’s Coffee only oper-
ates about 100 coffee shops, but their strength lies in distribution. The
company sells a large selection of coffees, produced in countries as
diverse as Guatemala and Kenya, to customers across the United States,
including restaurants and grocery stores. 
 Green Mountain Coffee Roaster, Inc. (NASDAQ: GMCR): Green Mountain
Coffee, with headquarters in Vermont, operates in the distribution of
specialized coffee products. It sells premium Arabica coffee to a number
of entities, such as convenience stores, specialty retailers, and restau-
rants. It has a large presence in the East Coast and has a partnership
with Paul Newman’s Newman’s Own company to provide organic coffee
to customers. This is a good company if you want exposure to the high-
end coffee distribution market in the Northeast. 
Warming Up to Cocoa
Cocoa is a fermented seed from the cacao tree, which is usually grown in
hot and rainy regions around the equator. The first cacao tree is said to
have originated in South America, where cocoa beans were used for both
consumption and monetary purposes. European traders came across the
cacao tree and were so impressed with the tasty beverages made from cocoa
beans that they brought some back to Europe, where cocoa beans were then
turned into chocolate. From Europe, the cacao tree was introduced to Africa
and, today, the cocoa trade is dominated by African countries, as you can see
in Table 19-2.

Like coffee, the cocoa market is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors that
have a large impact on price movements. Check out the price of the NYBOT
cocoa futures contract in recent years in Figure 19-2. As you can see, it can be
pretty volatile. 
Invest in Sugar: It’s Such a Sweet Move!
Sugar production is said to have started over 9000 years ago in southeastern
Asia, where it was used in India and China for medicinal purposes. It then
spread to southern Europe through Persia and Arabia around 400 B.C. In
Europe and the Middle East, sugar became a popular food sweetener. From
Europe, sugar spread to the New World in the fifteenth century and was par-
ticularly suitable for growing in Latin America. Today, Latin American coun-
tries dominate the sugar trade; Brazil is in fact the largest sugar producer in
the world today, as you can see in Table 19-3.

On a historical basis, Sugar #14 produced in the United States tends to be
more expensive than Sugar #11. However, Sugar #11 accounts for most of the
volume in the NYBOT sugar market. Check out the historical price of Sugar
#11 on the NYBOT in Figure 19-3.
Orange Juice: Refreshingly 
Good for Your Bottom Line
Orange juice is one of the only actively traded contracts in the futures mar-
kets that’s based on a tropical fruit: oranges. Oranges are widely grown in
the western hemisphere, particularly in Florida and Brazil. As you can see 
in Table 19-4, Brazil is by far the largest producer of oranges although the
United States — primarily Florida — is also a major player.

Because oranges are perishable, the futures contract tracks frozen concentrated
orange juice (FCOJ). This particular form is suitable for storage and fits one of
the criteria for inclusion in the futures arena — that the underlying commod-
ity be deliverable. This contract is available for trade on the New York Board
of Trade (NYBOT). The NYBOT includes two versions of the FCOJ contract:
one that tracks the Florida/Brazil oranges and another one based on global
production. 
Here are the contract specs of FCOJ on the NYBOT:
FCOJ-A (Florida/Brazil):
 Contract Ticker Symbol: OJ
 Contract Size: 15,000 Pounds
 Underlying Commodity: FCOJ from Brazil and/or Florida only 
 Price Fluctuation: $0.0005/pound ($7.50 per contract)

The production of oranges is very sensitive to weather. For instance, the hur-
ricane season common in the Florida region can have significant impact on
the prices of oranges both on the spot market and in the futures market. In
Figure 19-4, you can clearly see a huge spike in the price of the FCOJ contract
during the 2004–2005 period, which was a period of heavy hurricane activity.
Make sure to take into consideration weather and seasonality when investing
in FCOJ futures.

How to Gain from Grains: Trading
Corn, Wheat, and Soybeans
In This Chapter
 Exploring the corn markets
 Examining opportunities in the wheat markets
 Selecting the right strategy to trade soybeans
I
n this chapter, I take a look at some of the major agricultural commodities
that trade in the futures markets. These commodities, sometimes simply
known as ags, are a unique component of the broader commodities markets.
They are very labor intensive and are subject to volatility because of underly-
ing market fundamentals, which I explore in the following sections. However,
they also present solid investment opportunities. Corn, for example, is a major
food staple; wheat is an absolutely necessary commodity and, according to
archaeologists, may be the first commodity grown and traded by man; and
soybeans have a growing number of applications, ranging from fuel additives
to feedstock to trendy food products. I examine all three of these commodi-
ties and their investment opportunities in depth. 
For additional information on agricultural commodities in general, I recom-
mend checking out the following resources:
 National Grain and Feed Association: www.ngfa.org

Field of Dreams: How to 
Invest in Corn
In 2005, world corn production stood at about 700 Million Metric Tons.
Approximately 35 Million Hectares of land are used exclusively for the 
production of corn worldwide, a business that the U.S. Department of
Agriculture values at over $20 Billion a year. Corn is definitely big business,
and I provide you with all the information you need in this section to help
you invest in this major crop. 
Corn, like other commodities such as crude oil and coffee, comes in different
qualities. The most important types of corn you should be familiar with are
high-grade number 2 and number 3 yellow corn, which are both traded in the
futures markets. 
The most direct way of investing in corn is by going through the futures mar-
kets. A corn contract exists, courtesy of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT),
to help farmers, consumers, and investors manage and profit from the under-
lying market opportunities. Here are the contract specs:
 Contract Ticker Symbol: C
 Electronic Ticker: ZC
 Contract Size: 5000 Bushels
 Underlying Commodity: High grade No. 2 or No. 3 Yellow Corn 
 Price Fluctuation: $0.0025/bushel ($12.50 per contract)
 Trading Hours: 9:05 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Open Outcry, 6:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Electronic (Chicago Time)
It’s important to know the trading hours for corn and other commodities
that trade both on the open outcry and through electronic trading.
 Trading Months: March, May, July, September, December
Corn futures contracts are usually measured in bushels (such as the corn
contract offered by the CBOT). Large scale corn production and consumption
is generally measured in metric tons. 
Historically, the United States has dominated the corn markets, and still does
due to abundant land and helpful governmental subsidies. China is also a
major player and exhibits a lot of potential for being a market leader in the
coming years. Other notable producers include Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and
France. I list the top producers in Table 20-1.

Like other agricultural commodities, corn is subject to seasonal and cyclical
factors that have a direct, and often powerful, effect on prices. Prices for corn
can go through roller coaster rides, with wild swings in short periods of time,
as you can see in Figure 20-1.

The Chicago Board of Trade
Established in 1848, the Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT) is the oldest commodity exchange in the
world. All the commodities covered in this chap-
ter trade on the CBOT, and it is the go-to
exchange for grains and other agricultural prod-
ucts, such as oats, ethanol, and rice. The
exchange has also branched out to include 
several metals contracts targeted towards indi-
vidual investors, including the mini gold and mini
silver contracts. On the financial product side of
things, the CBOT offers the 30-year bond and
the 10-year note. For more information on the
CBOT, you can check out its Web site at www.

Welcome to the Bread Basket: 
Investing in Wheat
According archaeologists, wheat is one of the first agricultural products
grown by man. Evidence suggests that wheat production developed in the
Fertile Crescent region, an area that encompasses modern day Turkey and
Syria. Today wheat is the second most widely produced agricultural com-
modity in the world (on a per volume basis), right behind corn and ahead
of rice. World wheat production came in at 618 Million Metric Tons in 2005,
according to the USDA. 
Unlike other commodities that are dominated by single producers — Saudi
Arabia and oil, the Ivory Coast and cocoa, Russia and palladium — no one
country dominates wheat production. As a matter of fact, as you can see
from Table 20-2, the major wheat producers are a surprisingly eclectic group.
The advanced developing countries of China and India are the two largest
producers, while industrial countries like Canada and Germany also boast
significant wheat production capabilities.

Wheat is measured in bushels for investment and accounting purposes. Each
bushel contains approximately 60 pounds of wheat. As for most other agricultural
commodities, metric tons are used to quantify total production and consumption
figures on a national and international basis. 
The most direct way of accessing the wheat markets, short of owning a wheat
farm, is by trading the wheat futures contract. As with the other agricultural
commodities discussed in this chapter, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)
offers a futures contract for those interested in capturing profits from wheat
price movements — whether for hedging or speculative purposes. Here are
the specs for the CBOT futures contract:
 Contract Ticker Symbol: W
 Electronic Ticker: ZW
 Contract Size: 5000 Bushels
 Underlying Commodity: Premium Wheat 
 Price Fluctuation: $0.0025/bushel ($12.50 per contract)
 Trading Hours: 9:30 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. Open Outcry, 6:32 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.

 Trading Months: March, May, July, September, December
Wheat production, like that of corn and soybeans, is a seasonal enterprise
subject to various output disruptions. Kazakhstan for instance, an important
producer, has faced issues with wheat production in the past due to underin-
vestment in machinery and the misuse of fertilizers. This mismanagement of
resources has an impact on the acreage yield, which in turn impacts prices.
Such supply side disruptions can have a magnified effect on futures prices,
as evidenced by the numbers in Figure 20-2.

lowing sources:
 Wheat Foods Council: www.wheatfoods.org
 National Association of Wheat Growers: www.wheatworld.org
 U.S. Wheat Associates: www.uswheat.org
A number of organizations that offer information on specific commodities, such
as corn and wheat, are specialized lobby groups whose agenda — alongside
providing information to the public — includes promoting the consumption
of the products they represent. Keep this in mind as you consult any outside
resource for research purposes. 
Trading Soybeans: It’s Not Just Peanuts
The cultivation of soybeans, which developed in Asia, has been taking place
for centuries. Soybeans are a vital crop for the world economy, used for
everything from poultry feedstock to the creation of vegetable oil. In this 
section I introduce you to the different soybean extracts you can trade: soy-
beans themselves, soybean oil, and soybean meal.

Soybeans
Although most soybeans are used for the extraction of soybean oil (used as
vegetable oil for culinary purposes) and soybean meal (used primarily as
an agricultural feedstock), whole soybeans are also a tradable commodity.
Soybeans are edible, and if you’ve ever gone to a sushi restaurant you might
have been offered soybeans as appetizers, under the Japanese name edamame. 
The United States dominates the soybean market, accounting for over 50 
percent of total global production. Brazil is a distant second, with about 20
percent of the market. The crop in the United States begins in September,
and the production of soybeans is cyclical, as you can see from the price 
patterns in Figure 20-3.

 Contract Ticker Symbol: S
 Electronic Ticker: ZS
 Contract Size: 5000 Bushels
 Underlying Commodity: Premium No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 yellow soybean
bushels

Soybean oil
Soybean oil is an extract of soybeans that you and I know as vegetable oil.
Soybean oil is the most widely used culinary oil in the United States and
around the world, partly because of its healthy, nutritional characteristics. It
contains about 85 percent unsaturated fat and very little saturated fat, which
makes it appealing to health-conscious consumers. 
In addition to its gastronomic uses, soybean oil is becoming an increasingly
popular additive in alternative energy sources technology, such as bio-diesel.
An increasing number of cars in the United States and abroad, for example,
are being outfitted with engines that allow them to convert from regular
diesel to soybean oil during operation. Because of their economic fuel
mileage and low environmental impact, these soybean oil–enabled cars,
known as frybrids, are becoming more popular. 
Demand for soybean oil has increased in recent years as demand for these
cleaner-burning fuels increases and as the automotive technology is more
able to accommodate the usage of such bio-diesels. According to the
Commodity Research Bureau (CRB), production of soybean oil increased
from an average of 15 Billion Pounds in the mid-1990s to more than 22 Billion
Pounds in 2003. 
If you want to trade soybean oil, you need to go through the Chicago Board 
of Trade (CBOT), which offers the standard soybean oil contract. Here is the
contract information:

Soybean meal
Soybean meal, like soybean oil, is an extract of soybeans. Basically, whatever
is left after soybean oil is extracted from soybeans can then be converted to
soybean meal. Soybean meal is a high protein, high energy-content food that
is used primarily as a feedstock for cattle, hogs, and poultry (see Chapter 21). 
To invest in soybean meal, you can trade the soybean meal futures contract
on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Here is the information to help you

Alive and Kicking! How to Make
Money Trading Livestock
In This Chapter
 Identifying opportunities in the cattle markets
 Deciding whether trading lean hogs is right for you
 Examining the frozen pork bellies market
A
ccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, consumers spend roughly
20 percent of their total food and beverage allowances on meat products,
such as cattle and pork. Think of all those hamburgers and bacon sandwiches
you’ve had over the years. Livestock, like the tropical and grain commodities,
is a unique category in the agricultural commodities sub-asset class. It’s not 
a widely followed area of the commodities markets — unlike crude oil, for
example, you’re not likely to see feeder cattle prices quoted on the nightly
news — but this doesn’t mean you should ignore this area of the markets. 
That said, raising livestock is a time-consuming and labor-intensive undertak-
ing, and the markets are susceptible and sensitive to minor disruption. These
contracts are volatile (see the performance of frozen pork bellies in Figure
21-3), so you should venture into this area of the market only if you have an
iron clad grasp on the concepts behind futures trading — and have a high 
tolerance for risk. In this chapter I analyze the markets for cattle (both live
cattle and feeder cattle), lean hogs and frozen pork bellies.
Even by agricultural futures standards, livestock futures are notoriously
volatile and should be traded only by traders with a high level of risk toler-
ance. Keep in mind that trading agricultural futures requires an understand-
ing of the cyclicality and seasonality of the underlying commodity as well as
large capital reserves to help offset any margin calls that may arise from a
trade gone badly. If your risk tolerance is not elevated or you are not comfort-
able in the futures arena, then I recommend you don’t trade these contracts
because you could be setting yourself up for disastrous losses.

One resource I can recommend that provides fundamental data relating to
the consumption and production patterns of pork bellies, livestock, and
other commodities is the Commodity Research Bureau Yearbook. This book is
compiled by the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) and includes a large
number of data on some of the most important commodities, including the
identification of seasonal and cyclical patterns affecting the markets. For
more information on this publication, you can visit the Web site www.
crbtrader.com. 
Holy Cow! How to Invest in Cattle
Some historians claim that cattle were the first animals domesticated by
humans. Whether that is the case or not, one thing is for sure: Cattle have
played a unique role in history. Throughout the ages, cows have been valued
not only for their dietary value, but also monetary worth. Cows are literally a
special breed because they are low maintenance animals with high products
output: They eat almost nothing but grass yet they are used to produce milk,
to provide meat, and, in some cases, to create leather goods. This input to
output ratio means that cows occupy a special place in the agricultural 
complex.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME),
where all the commodities discussed in this
chapter are traded, is the largest and most
liquid futures exchange in the world. It has the
heaviest trading activity — and open interest —
of any exchange, partly because of the depth of
its products offerings. Besides agricultural com-
modities, it also trades economic derivatives
(contracts that track economic data such as
U.S. quarterly GDP and non-farm payrolls); for-
eign currencies (it offers a broad currency
selection ranging from the Hungarian forint to
the South Korean won); interest rates (including
the LIBOR — London Inter Bank Offered Rate);
and even weather derivatives (contracts that
track weather patterns in various regions of the
world). 
Because of its broad products listing, the CME
is perhaps the most versatile of the commodity
exchanges. In addition, the CME was one of the
first exchanges to launch an electronic trading
platform — the CME Globex — which has
become an instant hit with traders. It now
accounts for over 60 percent of the exchange’s
total volume. In 2006, the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) entered into an agreement
with the CME to trade its marquee energy and
metals contracts on the CME electronic plat-
form (www.nymexoncmeglobex.com). The
CME is also the first exchange to go public, and
investors greeted the IPO with enthusiasm, rais-
ing the stock from $40 in 2003 to over $500 in 2006.
(See Chapter 8 for more on the exchanges.) For
more on the CME you should check out its Web
site at www.cme.com, which also includes
helpful tutorials on all its products. 

Two futures contracts exist for the cattle trader and investor: the live cattle
and the feeder cattle contracts, which both trade on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME).
Live cattle
The live cattle futures contract, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME), is unique because it was the first contract launched by the CME to
track a commodity that’s actually alive. Prior to the live cattle futures, all
futures contracts were for storable commodities such as crude oil, copper,
and sugar. The CME live cattle futures contract, launched in 1964, heralded
a new era for the exchanges. This futures contract is now widely traded by
various market players, including cattle producers, packers, consumers, and
independent traders. 
Here are the specs of this futures contract:
 Contract Ticker Symbol: LC
 Electronic Ticker: LE
 Contract Size: 40,000 Pounds
 Underlying Commodity: Live Cattle 
 Price Fluctuation: $0.00025/pound ($10.00 per contract)

Don’t get mad: Considering the effect of mad 
cow disease on the livestock market
The live cattle and feeder cattle futures con-
tracts are very sensitive to any supply-side dis-
ruptions or demand variations. When news
broke out in the United Kingdom of a mad cow
outbreak, this news had a major impact on U.S.
live cattle futures prices. This event brought a
lot of uncertainty in the markets and generated
a lot of volatility. News of this sort is like a one-
two punch to the markets because both demand
and supply are affected simultaneously: Demand
drops dramatically because folks no longer
want to buy the products, and supply decreases
as measures are taken to eliminate affected
cattle. 
For U.S. beef producers, the threat of mad cow
disease also affects their bottom line because
their exports decrease dramatically. For
instance, when word came out of potential mad
cow disease in U.S. herds, Japan — which buys
over $1 Billion of U.S. beef a year — placed
restrictions on the imports of U.S. beef. This
caused a lot of pain to U.S. beef producers as
they confronted declining demand both at home
and abroad.

 Trading Months: February, April, June, August, October, December
One of the reasons for the popularity of the live cattle contract is that it
allows all interested parties to hedge their market positions in order to
reduce the volatility and uncertainty associated with livestock production
in general, and live cattle growing in particular. If you do trade this contract,
keep the following market risks in mind: seasonality, fluctuating prices of
feedstock, transportation costs, changing consumer demand, and the threat
of diseases (such as mad cow disease). 
As such, the market for the live cattle contract can be fairly volatile.
Check out the performance of the live cattle futures contract on the CME
in Figure 21-1. 
Feeder cattle
The CME launched a feeder cattle futures contract in 1971, only a few years
after the launch of the groundbreaking live cattle contract. The feeder cattle
contract is for calves that weigh in at the 650–849 Pound range, which are
sent to the feedlots to get fed, fattened, and then slaughtered. 
Because the CME feeder cattle futures contract is settled on a cash basis, 
the CME calculates an index for feeder cattle cash prices based on a 7-day

Lean and Mean: Checking Out Lean Hogs
The lean hog futures contract (which is a contract for the hog’s carcass)
trades on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and is used primarily
by producers of lean hogs — both domestic and international — and pork
importers/exporters. Launched in 1997, the lean hog contract is a fairly new
addition to the CME, launched as a replacement after the live hog futures
contract was retired. The lean hog contract replaced the live hog contract
since producers and consumers of these products don’t transact the live
animal (live hog), so it made more sense for the futures contract to track the
product traded in the marketplace. Here are the contract specs for lean hogs:
 Contract Ticker Symbol: LH
 Electronic Ticker: HE
 Contract Size: 40,000 Pounds
 Underlying Commodity: Lean Hogs 
 Price Fluctuation: $0.0001 per hundred pounds ($4.00 per contract)

Perhaps no other commodity, agricultural or otherwise, exhibits the same
level of volatility as the lean hogs futures contract (see Figure 21-2). One of the
reasons is that, compared to other products, this contract is not very liquid
because it is primarily used by commercial entities seeking to hedge against
price risk. Other commodities, say crude oil, that are actively traded by indi-
vidual speculators as well the commercial entities are far more liquid and thus
less volatile. If you are intent on trading this contract, keep in mind that you’re
up against some very experienced and large players in this market. 
You Want Bacon with That? How to
Trade Frozen Pork Bellies
Essentially, the term pork bellies is the traders’ way of saying bacon. Physically,
pork bellies come from the underside of a hog and weigh approximately 12
Pounds. These pork bellies are generally stored frozen for extended periods
of time, pending delivery to consumers.

As for most other livestock products, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange offers
a futures contract for frozen pork bellies. This contract, which was launched
by the CME in 1961, is the first ever contract on a commodity exchange where
the underlying deliverable commodity is a meat — albeit dead meat. (The
CME live cattle contract was the first contract based on a live animal. See live
cattle section.)
Here are the specs for the CME frozen pork bellies futures contract:
 Contract Ticker Symbol: PB

The pork bellies market is a seasonal market subject to wild price fluctuations.
Although production of pork bellies is a major determining factor of market
prices, other variables also have a significant impact on prices. A buildup in

Man against machine: 
The battle over the future of trading
All of the contracts I discuss in this chapter are
available for trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange’s electronic trading platform, the
CME Globex. Up until a few years ago, most of
the trading taking place in the futures markets
was done during the open outcry sessions by
humans buying and selling contracts from each
other. Recently, electronic trading — which
matches buyers and sellers electronically —
has overtaken the open outcry sessions as the
main venue for trading. In the CME for example,
over 60 percent of trading is now conducted
electronically. The advantages of electronic
trading are that it’s more efficient and can be
performed from remote locations. 
The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)
and the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) are
the only exchanges that still rely heavily on the
open outcry sessions. However, that is on the
decline, as the NYMEX recently signed an
agreement to have its contracts offered on the
CME Globex. And some exchanges, such as the
Intercontinental Exchange, don’t even own
physical trading facilities — all the trading is
done electronically through computer terminals.
It seems that the age when humans interacted
each other to establish prices for the world’s
most important commodities will soon be part of
a bygone era. 

pork belly inventories usually takes place in the beginning of the calendar
year, resulting in lower prices. But as inventories are depleted, the market
moves to a supply side bias, thereby placing upward pressure on market
prices. On the other side of the equation, consumer demand for bacon
and other meats is not easily predictable and fluctuates with the seasons. 
Because of the cyclicality of the supply side model, coupled with the season-
ality of the demand model, pork belly prices are subject to extreme volatility.
As a matter of fact, the pork bellies futures contract is one of the more volatile
contracts trading in the market today. Check out the price of frozen pork bel-
lies per pound in Figure 21-3.
Demand for bacon and other high-fat, high-cholesterol foods appears to be
waning as a result of the health-conscious eating trends sweeping the nation.
These dietary changes could have an impact on the prices of frozen pork 
bellies and other meats. Be aware of the impact of these dietary trends on
the prices of pork bellies and other meats before investing.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
include here the legendary For Dummies Part of Tens. In
these three chapters, I uncover the best investment
vehicles for commodities; pinpoint the major market indi-
cators you should monitor to help you get a sense of where
the markets are heading; and identify the top resources to
use when you invest in the markets. This part includes
invaluable advice that will help make you a better investor. 

Chapter 22
Top Ten Ways to Invest 
in Commodities
In This Chapter
 Investing through the futures markets
 Getting exposure through equities
 Uncovering the benefits of fund investing
B
ecause the commodities markets are so wide and deep, you have a
number of investment vehicles to access these markets. A common 
misconception among investors is that you can only trade commodities by
opening a futures account. While the futures markets certainly provide an
avenue into the commodities markets, you have other tools at your disposal.
I list the ten most important investment vehicles in this chapter. 
Futures Commission Merchant
Opening an account with a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) is the most
direct way for you to invest in commodities through the futures markets. An
FCM is registered with the National Futures Association (NFA) and its activi-
ties are monitored by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
When you open an account with an FCM, you can actually trade futures con-
tracts, options, and other derivative products directly through the main com-
modity exchanges. Your orders are sometimes routed electronically or are
placed during the open outcry trading session. However, you should only
open an account with an FCM if you have a solid grasp of trading futures and
options. For more on futures contracts, check out Chapter 9; I discuss FCMs
in depth in Chapter 6. 

Commodity Trading Advisor
A Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) is authorized by the CFTC and the NFA 
to trade on behalf of individual clients in the futures markets. The CTA is a
registered investment professional who has a good grasp of the concepts in
the futures markets. However, before you invest through a CTA, you should
research their track record and investment philosophy. Find out what you
should be looking for when shopping for a CTA in Chapter 6. 
Commodity Pool Operator
The Commodity Pool Operator (CPO) is similar to the CTA in that she has 
the authority to invest on behalf of clients in the futures markets. The biggest
difference is that CPOs are allowed to “pool” client accounts under one giant
account and enter the markets en masse. The pooling of client funds offers
two advantages: It increases the purchasing power of the fund and it provides
additional leverage. In addition, because a CPO is usually registered as a com-
pany, you can only lose your principal (in case things go wrong). In other
words, you won’t get any margin calls and owe the exchange money. Make
sure to read Chapter 6 for more information on CPOs. 
Integrated Commodity Companies
The equity markets offer a way for you to get exposure to commodities by
investing in companies that process these natural resources. Some of these
companies include large, integrated commodity-processing companies. In the
energy space, these are companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Total
(NYSE: TOT) that have exposure to crude oil and natural gas in both the
exploration and distribution phase of the supply chain. (I examine the inte-
grated energy companies in Chapter 11.) In the metals complex, companies
like Rio Tinto (NYSE: TRP) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) mine minerals and
metals as varied as palladium and nickel. These integrated mining companies
have operations throughout the globe. I cover them in Chapter 18. 
Specialized Commodity Companies
If you want to get exposure to a specific commodity through the equity mar-
kets, you can always invest in specialized commodity companies. These com-
panies focus on either one commodity or on one aspect of the supply chain.
For example, oil tanker operators focus on transporting crude oil from Point
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

A to Point B — that’s the extent of their activities, which I uncover in Chapter
14. Other such companies include Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) (Chapter 19),
which focuses strictly on selling and marketing coffee-related products.
These are good companies to invest in if you want exposure to a specific
commodity through the equity markets. 
Master Limited Partnerships
Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are hybrid investment vehicles that invest
in energy infrastructure. They are in fact private partnerships that trade on
public exchanges, just like stocks. This unique combination provides several
advantages. First, because the MLP is a partnership, it has tremendous tax
advantages because it does not pay taxes on the corporate level, only on the
individual level. It’s therefore not subject to the double taxation that many
corporations are subject to. Second, its mandate is to distribute practically
all its cash flow directly to shareholders. It’s therefore not uncommon to have
an MLP return $3 or $4 per unit owned. Check out MLPs in Chapter 6. 
Exchange Traded Funds
Since they first emerged on the scene a few years ago, the popularity of
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) has soared. And for good reason. They’re pri-
vately run funds that trade on a public exchange, just like stocks. This ease-of-
use has directly contributed to their popularity among investors. A number of
ETFs have been introduced in recent years, which track the performance of
commodity-related assets, such as gold, silver, and crude oil. But it’s not just
individual commodities that are now tracked by ETFs. Commodity indexes,
such as the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index (AMEX: DBC), also has an
ETF that tracks its performance. Turn to Chapter 6 for a complete listing of
ETFs on the market.
Commodity Mutual Funds
Investors who are used to investing in mutual funds will enjoy knowing that a
number of mutual funds invest directly in commodities. Two of the biggest
such mutual funds are the PIMCO commodity fund and the Oppenheimer
fund, both covered in Chapter 6. Some funds seek to mirror the performance
of various commodity benchmarks, while others invest in companies that
process commodities. 
319
Chapter 22: Top Ten Ways to Invest in Commodities

Commodity Indexes
A commodity index acts a lot like a stock index: It tracks a group of securities
for benchmarking and investing purposes. Commodity indexes are con-
structed and offered by different financial institutions, such as Goldman
Sachs and Standard & Poor’s, and they follow different construction method-
ologies. As such, the performance of the indexes — there are currently five —
is different across the board. Most of these indexes can be tracked either
through the futures markets or through ETFs. I devote all of Chapter 7 to
these indexes. 
Emerging Market Funds
Due to geographical happenstance, commodities are scattered across the
globe. No single country dominates all commodities across the board.
However, a few countries do dominate specific commodities. South Africa, 
for instance, has the largest reserves of gold in the world, Saudi Arabia has
the largest oil reserves, and Russia has the biggest palladium reserves. As 
the demand for commodities increases, the economies of these emerging
markets have been soaring. One way to play the commodities boom is by
opening up your portfolio to emerging market funds, which I discuss in
Chapter 6.

Chapter 23
Top Ten Market Indicators 
You Should Monitor
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of market indicators
 Identifying the major indicators 
 Monitoring the indicators on a regular basis
 Applying the data to improve your bottom line 
T
he commodity waters can be perilous at times, and knowing how to navi-
gate them is crucial. Keeping your eye on where the markets are heading —
and where they’ve been — will help you develop a winning investment strat-
egy. One way to identify where the markets are heading is by watching certain
market indicators. These key metrics provide insight into what the markets
are doing and help you design and calibrate an investment strategy based on
the market fundamentals. 
Consumer Price Index
The Consumer Price Index (CPI), compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS), is a statistically weighted average of a basket of goods and services
purchased by consumers around the country. The CPI is the closest thing to
a cost-of-living index and is sometimes used to gauge inflationary trends. If
the CPI is rising, economists — especially the ones at the Federal Reserve —
start worrying that inflation is creeping up. This may result in an increase in
the Federal Funds Rate (see later in the chapter). The CPI is sometimes
broken down further into the Core CPI, which excludes items like food and
energy. Comparing the CPI with the Core CPI can give you a good idea of how
much consumers, who account for two-thirds of economic activity, are
spending on commodities such as energy and agricultural products. Visit
www.bls.gov/cpi for the latest data on the CPI. 

EIA Inventory Reports
Energy traders are glued to their Bloomberg terminals every Wednesday
morning, at 10:30 a.m. EST to be precise, waiting for the latest inventory
reports. The inventory reports are released by the Energy Information
Administration (EIA), which is the statistical branch of the Department of
Energy (DOE), and they detail activity in the country’s energy sector. They
include a summary of weekly supply estimates, crude oil supply, and disposi-
tion rates (consumer consumption), as well as production, refinery utiliza-
tion, and any movement in stock changes. The EIA petroleum inventory
reports may not get wide coverage in the press, but they have a direct impact
on the price of crude oil and other energy products and should be monitored
regularly. You can find all the information about these reports by going to the
EIA Web site at www.eia.doe.gov. 
Federal Funds Rate
Perhaps no other market indicator is as closely watched by investors as the
Federal Funds Rate. When the financial press talks about interest rates going
up or down, they’re almost always referring to the Federal Funds Rate, which
is established by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This is the
short-term interest rate at which banks charge each other overnight for
Federal Reserve balances. When the Fed wants to stimulate a sluggish econ-
omy, it tends to decrease this short term rate. On the other hand, if the Fed
believes that the economy is overheating, and therefore subject to inflation, 
it increases this rate, which makes it more expensive to borrow money. 
Gross Domestic Product
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the most closely watched economic
indicators. GDP is essentially a measure of all the goods and services pro-
duced in a country by private consumers, the government, the business
sector, and trade (exports - imports). GDP, especially per capita GDP — which
essentially measures purchasing power on an individual level — is a good
indication of the likely demand for and activity in commodities. The higher
the GDP growth, the more likely a country is to spend more money on pur-
chasing crude oil, natural gas, and other natural resources. Of course, GDP
provides you with a big picture of the economic landscape and may not nec-
essarily identify specific trends. That said, solid and growing GDP is a good
measure of economic health and is a bullish indicator for commodities. While
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

you could theoretically analyze the GDP of all countries, I recommend looking
closely at U.S. GDP, the largest economy on the planet, and Chinese GDP, the
fastest-growing economy in the world. These two countries are also the
biggest purchasers of commodities such as crude oil and steel. 
London Gold Fix
Gold is a special commodity because it’s one of the only commodities that
has a monetary role. For decades, many currencies — including the US Dollar
and British Pound — were fixed to gold. Even though Nixon took the United
States off of the gold standard in 1971, thereby heralding a floating exchange
rate regime, gold is still used as a global monetary benchmark. The Federal
Reserve and other central banks hold gold bullion in vaults for monetary pur-
poses, and gold is sometimes used by economists as a measure of inflation.
Monitoring gold, both as a possible measure of inflation and for its monetary
stability, is a good idea. Spot gold prices are fixed in London daily — in what
is known as London Gold Fixing — by five leading members of the financial
community. The London Gold Fix is monitored closely by precious metals
dealers and is used as a global benchmark for gold spot prices. You could
also get an idea of where gold prices are heading by consulting the futures
markets, specifically the COMEX gold futures prices provided by the New
York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Visit www.nymex.com for more on gold
futures and www.goldfixing.com for the London Gold Fix. 
Non-farm Payrolls
Like the Consumer Price Index, non-farm payrolls are compiled by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. Statistically speaking, non-farm payrolls includes the
number of individuals with paid salaries employed by businesses around the
country. It does not include government employees, household employees
(homemakers), individuals who work in the non-profit sector, and those
involved in agriculture. Non-farm payrolls include information on about 80
percent of the nation’s total workforce, and this number is often used to
determine unemployment levels. The non-farm payroll report is released
monthly, on the first Friday of the month, and does not include total employ-
ment; rather it shows a change between the current employment levels and
previous employment levels as measured by the new number of jobs that
were added. The higher the number, the stronger the economy and the more
people hired by businesses — which all means that consumers have more
money to spend. Although the link is indirect, higher non-farm payroll num-
bers can be interpreted as a bullish sign for the commodities markets. Visit
www.bls.gov/ces for more information on non-farm payrolls. 
323
Chapter 23: Top Ten Market Indicators You Should Monitor

Purchasing Managers Index
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released by the Institute of Supply
Management (ISM), is a composite index and a good indicator of total manu-
facturing activity, which in turn is an important barometer of overall eco-
nomic activity. The manufacturing sector is a large consumer of commodities,
such as crude oil and natural gas, and a strong PMI signals that manufactur-
ers are doing well and are likely to spend additional dollars on commodities.
The PMI is released at 10 a.m. EST on the first business day of every month.
You can view the reports at www.ism.ws/ISMReport. 
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index is the oldest commodity index and is one of
the most widely followed commodity benchmarks in the market. Although
commodity indexes have their shortcomings — for example they only track
commodities on futures contracts, thereby ignoring important commodities
such as steel — they’re the best measure of where the commodities markets
as a whole are heading. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index tracks 19 commodi-
ties, everything from crude oil and silver to corn and nickel. Read Chapter 7
for more on commodity indexes. 
US Dollar
Keeping your eye on what the US Dollar is doing is critical for a variety of rea-
sons. As the world’s de facto currency, most of the world’s crucial commodi-
ties, from crude oil and gold to copper and coffee, are priced in USD. Any
shift in the dollar will have an indirect impact on these important markets.
For example, the integrated energy companies (the majors) have operations
around the globe and often deal with the local currency in the area where
they’re operating. Any shift in the local currency/US Dollar exchange rate will
have a direct impact on how the companies account for profits and expenses,
as well as other metrics. 
WTI Crude Oil
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is one of the most widely followed
benchmarks in the energy complex. WTI is a high-grade, low-sulfur, premium
crude produced in West Texas. This light, sweet crude is traded on the New
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) through a futures contract, which is
widely quoted in the financial press and in analyst reports as a benchmark
for global oil prices. More importantly, it is used by the industry players as a
benchmark for global oil prices. Of course, because the price of the NYMEX
WTI refers only to light, sweet crudes, the prices of heavy, sour crudes is
going to be different. Currently, most heavy, sour crudes are priced relative to
their lighter and sweeter counterparts. (Turn to Chapter 11 for more on the
different grades of crude oil.) 
An alternative global crude benchmark is the North Sea Brent, which is also a
high-quality crude that’s produced in the Norwegian/British North Sea. This
contract trades on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). For more on the WTI
contract please visit www.nymex.com, and visit www.theice.com for addi-
tional information on the North Sea Brent contract.

Ten or So Resources You 
Can’t Do Without
In This Chapter
 Using trade journals effectively
 Reading the financial press 
 Getting help from the government
L
iving in the information age can be both a curse and a blessing. The
advantage of the information revolution is that you have so many
sources of information to choose from; the drawback is how do you know
which ones to use. It’s easy to be overwhelmed with the amount of informa-
tion that’s out there. 
In this chapter, I list the top ten or so resources you should use when investing
in commodities. Although not all of these resources deal specifically with com-
modities, they are indispensable sources of information because they help you
get a sense of where the financial markets are heading. Information and its
application are what ultimately separate successful investors from the rest. 
Using these resources will help you keep up to date on the major events that
move markets and give you an edge over the competition. 
The Wall Street Journal
For daily intakes of financial news, nothing beats The Wall Street Journal. If
you want to be a successful trader, you need to keep abreast of all the infor-
mation that’s worth knowing. The Journal does a good job of presenting solid
analysis and in-depth coverage of the day’s main events. Its coverage of the
commodities markets in its online edition at www.wsj.com is actually fairly

extensive (a subscription is required), with interactive charts and graphs for
both cash prices and futures markets. Also, keep an eye out for the section
“Heard on the Street” because it includes a wealth of information to help you
develop winning strategies that take advantage of the market fundamentals. I
read The Journal every single day and couldn’t imagine my day without it. 
Bloomberg
The Bloomberg Web site at www.bloomberg.com is one of the best sources
of raw information and data available to investors. Visiting this site once a
day keeps you up on important developments in the markets. The Web site’s
commodity section at www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/
cfutures.html contains comprehensive information on all the major com-
modities, from crude oil and cocoa to natural gas and aluminum, including
regular price updates on the futures markets. If you trade futures, this is an
indispensable resource. 
Commodities-Investor.com
I set up this Web site, located at www.commodities-investor.com, to
serve as an online companion to Commodities For Dummies. While the book
provides you with a broad-based fundamental and technical approach to
commodities, the Web site offers you up-to-date information on the markets.
The world of commodities is fast-paced and staying on top of all the develop-
ments helps you improve your bottom line. So make sure to check out the
Web site for regular updates, unique investment strategies and tips on trad-
ing techniques on a regular basis. 
Nightly Business Report
I try to tune in every weeknight to my local PBS network to watch NBR’s Paul
Kangas, Susie Gharib, and the gang analyze the day’s events. Their special
features are insightful, and the market analysts they bring in are usually
knowledgeable about the issues at hand. Plus, it’s commercial free! Check

Morningstar
Morningstar is a heavyweight in the mutual fund analysis industry. Its Web
site at www.morningstar.com includes a plethora of information on the
latest mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and other investment vehicles
popular with investors. If you want to invest in commodities through a man-
aged fund, make sure you consult the Morningstar Web site before you do so. 
Yahoo! Finance
Yahoo! Finance at http://finance.yahoo.com is my browser’s default
home page, and I don’t plan on changing it anytime soon. I love this Web site
because it includes so many different sources of information all conveniently
located in one site. You have market analysis updated on an hourly basis, reg-
ular news alerts (you can sign up to receive these in your inbox), and one of
the best chart services on the Web. If you’re considering investing in compa-
nies that produce commodities, Yahoo! Finance is your one-stop-shop to get
information on the stock’s technical performance as well as its fundamental
outlook. 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the federal regulatory
body responsible for monitoring activities in the commodities markets.
Before you do anything related to commodities, make sure you have at least
one look at the Web site at www.cftc.gov. Before you invest, you need to
know your rights as an investor and the CFTC does a magnificent job of
informing you of your rights. Also make sure to check out their glossary,
which is the most comprehensive one I’ve come across. 
The Energy Information Administration
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is part of the U.S. Department 
of Energy and is the official source of energy statistics for the U.S. govern-
ment. The Web site, located at www.eia.doe.gov, is your number one
source for information on energy markets. They cover everything from crude

oil production and consumption to gasoline inventories and natural gas
transportation activity. If you want to invest in energy, make sure you check
out their Country Analysis Briefs, which give an overview of the global energy
supply chain country by country. That section of the site is located at
www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/contents.html. 
Stocks and Commodities Magazine
If your desire is to become a serious commodity futures trader, then you
can’t go without reading Stocks and Commodities magazine. Its articles
include market-tested trading strategies to help you place and execute

The Appendix

In this part . . .
T
he appendix consists of a comprehensive glossary
that explains all the technical terms I mention in the
book. Having a grasp on the concepts behind the words is
critical for your success as an investor, so make sure to
familiarize yourself with this technical terminology.

Appendix
Glossary of Technical Terms
T
rading commodities requires mastery of a wide variety of technical
terms. This glossary tells you what all those high-sounding financial
terms actually mean, so you too can talk the talk!
Aframax: The Aframax tanker, whose first four letters are an acronym for
Average Freight Rate Assessment, is considered the “workhorse” in the off-
shore oil tanker fleet. Because of its smaller size, it is ideally suited for short
haul voyages and has the ability to transport crude and products in most
ports around the world.
Alpha coefficient: In portfolio allocation, alpha is used to measure the ability
of an asset to generate returns independently of what the broader portfolio
or market is doing. 
Anthracite: Anthracite is the most valuable type of coal because it contains
high levels of carbon and releases the most energy on a per unit basis. 
Arbitrage: Arbitrage is a trading technique that seeks to exploit price dis-
crepancies of a particular security that trades in different exchanges. Ideally,
an arbitrageur will buy a security at a lower price on an exchange and sell it
for a profit at a higher price in another trading venue. 
Backwardation: Backwardation is a term used in the futures markets to refer
to a situation where spot prices are higher than forward futures prices. This
is the exact opposite of contango, where forward prices are higher than spot
prices. See contango. 
Base Metals: Base metals are metals that have low resistance to corrosion,
unlike precious metals (See Precious Metals). Base metals include most of the
industrial metals, such as copper, iron, nickel, and zinc. 
Basis: the price difference between the actual (spot) commodity and the
futures price.
Beta coefficient: In the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), beta measures the
returns of an asset relative to the broader portfolio. 

Bituminous: Bituminous is the second most valuable type of coal; it’s used
for both electricity generation and in the manufacturing of high quality steel. 
Bollinger Bands: Bollinger bands consist of three “bands” that seek to mea-
sure a security’s standard deviation from a moving average, usually the
Simple Moving Average (which is one of the three bands). The upper and
lower band track the price of the security on a simple moving average basis
and attempt to determine whether a security is overbought or oversold
based on its proximity to the two bands. If the price trend is flirting with the
lower band, the security is oversold — — it’s undervalued and it’s expected
to increase. On the other hand, if the security is approaching the upper band,
it is overbought and may be ready for a downward price correction. 
Brent, North Sea: North Sea Brent, Brent for short, is a premium grade of
crude oil that’s used as a global benchmark for crude oil prices. 
British Thermal Unit (BTU): BTU is the standard unit of measurement for
energy. Every bit of energy released from crude oil, natural gas, coal, or solar
power can be quantified using BTUs. This is because one BTU refers to the
amount of energy required to raise one pound of water by one degree
Fahrenheit. 
Buy in: A purchase that will offset a previous short sale. Covers or liquidates
a short position.
Call option: A call option is a contract in the futures markets that gives the
holder (buyer) of the contract the right, but not the obligation, to purchase
an underlying asset at a specific point in time at a specific price. This is the
opposite of a put option. 
Candlestick: In technical analysis, a candlestick is a type of chart that’s used
to indicate crucial pieces of information regarding the performance of a secu-
rity. Specifically, candlesticks indicate the security’s opening price, closing
price, daily high, and daily low. 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): In portfolio theory, CAPM helps calcu-
late the amount of returns an investor can expect based on the amount of
risk she is taking. The CAPM formula is fairly complex, but it stipulates that
investors should be compensated based on how long they hold an invest-
ment (Time Value of Money) and on the amount of risk they take on. 
Carrying charge: The cost to store and insure a physical commodity over a
period of time.
Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT): Although the CBOT offers a broad products
mix, this exchange dominates the grain markets, offering futures contracts
for grains such as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal.

Commodities For Dummies 

Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME): The CME is the largest exchange in the
world, based on total volume of contracts traded. It also offers the broadest
product selection, providing contracts for commodities as varied as interest
rates and butter. It’s also the destination for folks who want to trade livestock
because it has contracts for live cattle, feeder cattle, lean hogs, and frozen
pork bellies. 
Commodities Exchange (COMEX): A division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) that offers futures contracts and options on metals. 
Some of the metals on the COMEX include gold, silver, aluminum, and copper. 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): The CFTC is the regula-
tory body of the futures markets. It is a federal agency that is responsible for
the oversight of all the major commodity exchanges in the United States. In
addition, it’s responsible for monitoring the futures markets to make sure
that the public is not subject to fraud or other unnatural market risks. It has
the authority to investigate suspicious activity and prosecute cases. 
Commodity Pool Operator (CPO): A CPO is like a futures fund manager, in
that he can manage client assets under one fund for the purpose of investing
in the futures markets. 
Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA): A CTA could be a firm or individual,
licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who’s
allowed to invest on behalf of individual clients in the futures markets. 
Consumer Price Index (CPI): The CPI, compiled by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS), is a statistically weighted average of a basket of goods and
services purchased by consumers around the country. It’s the closest indica-
tor of how much consumers are spending on key products, including energy
and agricultural products.
Contango: In the futures markets, contango refers to a specific situation
where forward futures prices exceed spot prices, or where distant futures
prices exceed nearer term futures prices. Essentially, contango means that
prices are increasing across time in the futures markets. This is the opposite
of backwardation. See backwardation. 
Contract Month: The month in which a futures contract may be satisfied by
making or accepting delivery.
Delivery: The tender and receipt of the actual commodity or the warehouse
receipt in settlement of the future contract.
Delivery Notice: A notice of a clearing member’s intentions to deliver a
stated quantity of a commodity in settlement of a futures contract.
335
Appendix: Glossary of Technical Terms

Derivative: A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its value from
an underlying security. Examples of derivatives include futures contracts, 
forward contracts, and options on futures. The underlying security could be
anything from an interest rate to a metal such as palladium. 
Drill ship: The drill ship is essentially a ship with a drilling platform that’s
easily deployed to remote offshore locations for oil and gas drilling. 
Drilling barge: The drilling barge is a floating device usually towed by tug-
boat in still, shallow waters — such as rivers, lakes, and swamps — used for
offshore oil and natural gas drilling. 
Energy Information Administration (EIA): The EIA is the statistical arm of
the U.S. Department of Energy, which compiles information and statistics on
all aspects of the global energy industry. 
Enhanced Moving Average (EMA): In technical analysis, the EMA is a moving
average that emphasizes a security’s most recent prices. This is the opposite
of the Simple Moving Average that follows an equal weight approach to all
price closings. The EMA is also known as the Exponential Moving Average.
See also Simple Moving Average. 
Exchange Traded Fund (ETF): ETFs are funds that trade on public
exchanges, just like stocks. The benefit of investing in ETFs is that you can
invest in a fund — which could be investing in everything from commodity
indexes to crude oil — by simply buying its shares on an exchange. A number
of ETFs are available that cater specifically to the commodity trading commu-
nity. ETFs are now available for crude oil, gold, silver, and commodity indexes
such as the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index (DBLCI). 
Federal Funds Rate: Commonly referred to in the financial press simply 
as “short-term interest rates”, the federal funds rate is established by the
Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It is the rate at
which one depository institution charges another depository institution for
borrowing balances at the Federal Reserve overnight. 
Ferrous Metals: Ferrous — derived from the Latin ferrum, which means 
“iron” — is one method of classifying metals. Ferrous metals are metals 
that contain iron, such as nickel, steel, and iron itself. Metals that don’t 
contain iron are known as non-ferrous metals. See Non-Ferrous Metals. 
Financial Services Authority (FSA): The FSA is Britain’s leading independent
financial regulatory organization responsible for overseeing trading activity
on UK stock and commodity exchanges. If you consider doing business in the
UK, make sure you first consult the FSA.

Forward contract: A forward contract is similar to a futures contract except
that it’s an agreement entered into by two parties outside the scope of a regu-
lated exchange. A futures contract is standardized and must meet specific
standards and requirements established by the futures exchange it is traded
on. The forward contract agreement is crafted by two parties and falls out-
side the jurisdiction of a regulated exchange. See futures contract. 
Futures Commission Merchant (FCM): In the futures markets, an FCM is a
licensed provider of derivative products. An FCM is similar to a stock broker
and is allowed to act as a conduit between investors and the futures markets. 
Futures contract: A futures contract is a highly standardized financial instru-
ment where two parties enter into an agreement to exchange an underlying
security at a specific time in the future at a mutually agreed-upon price. Both
parties have the obligation of respecting the contractual obligations of the
agreement. 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP): GDP is a measure of all the goods and 
services produced in a country by private consumers, the government, 
the business sector, and through trade (exports–imports).
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE): ICE is one of the only exchanges that does
not have physical trading floors with open outcry pits. All of its trading is
done electronically via computer terminals. It offers the North Sea Brent
crude oil contract and has recently added the WTI crude oil contract as well. 
International Energy Agency (IEA): THE IEA, whose headquarters are 
in Paris, is an intergovernmental organization that’s affiliated with the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Besides
compiling statistical information about global energy consumption and pro-
duction, the IEA also acts as an energy advisor to member states. 
Jack-up rig: The jack-up rig is a hybrid vessel that is part floating barge, part
drilling platform used for offshore drilling purposes. 
Last Trading Day: The final day in which trading may occur for a particular
delivery month. After the last trading day any remaining commitment must
be settled by delivery.
Lignite coal: Lignite is the least valuable type of coal because of its low
energy value. It’s sometimes known as brown coal. 
London Metal Exchange (LME): The LME is one of the oldest exchanges in
the world, and it specializes in non-ferrous metal trading. It includes con-
tracts for aluminum, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc. 
337
Appendix: Glossary of Technical Terms

Master Limited Partnership (MLP): MLPs are hybrid investment vehicles
because they are private partnerships that trade on public exchanges. This
unique structure is advantageous to investors because the MLP has the tax
advantages associated with partnerships while having the benefit of trading
publicly like a corporation. In order for an entity to qualify as an MLP, it must
generate over 90 percent of its revenues from activities in the commodities
industry, such as operating gas storage facilities or crude oil pipelines. 
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT): MPT, the brainchild of economist Harry
Markowitz, stipulates that investors stand to benefit through diversification.
MPT emphasizes the importance of the portfolio (the whole) over individual
assets (the parts). 
Molybdenum: Molybdenum (pronounced mah-leb-dah-num) is known as a
transition metal because it is primarily used as an alloying metal. Its resis-
tance to corrosion and high melting points make it ideal as a coating for
metals such as steel and cast iron. 
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD): The NASD is a private
regulator of the securities industry in the United States. The NASD monitors
virtually every security traded on American exchanges, from stocks and
bonds to commodity futures and options. An individual who seeks to repre-
sent clients in the securities markets must pass rigorous qualification exami-
nations administered by the NASD. 
National Futures Association (NFA): The NFA is the future’s industry self-
regulatory body. Any individual or firm that seeks to transact in the futures
markets on behalf of the public must be registered with the NFA. The NFA
maintains a database on all its members. 
New York Board of Trade (NYBOT): The NYBOT is a commodity exchange
that focuses primarily on soft commodities, such as coffee, cocoa, sugar, and
orange juice. 
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX): The NYMEX is one of the major
commodities exchanges in the United States. It’s headquartered in New York
and offers a wide range of products to investors, from its marquee West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil contract to palladium futures. Its
Commodity Exchange (COMEX) division specializes in metals contracts. 
Non-farm payrolls: Compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), this
measures the increase or decrease of the number of jobs added by the busi-
ness sector during a given month. It’s a useful measure of unemployment. 
Non-Ferrous Metals: Non-Ferrous metals are metals that do not contain iron.
These metals include gold, silver, and platinum but also aluminum, copper, and
zinc. Metals that contain iron are known as ferrous metals. See Ferrous Metals.
338
Commodities For Dummies 

North Sea Brent: See Brent, North Sea. 
Open interest: In the futures markets, open interest represents the number of
outstanding contracts held by market participants at the end of the trading
day. While volume measures the amount of trading activity, open interest pro-
vides a measure of the amount of capital moving in and out of a specific secu-
rity or market. See volume. 
Option: Like a futures contract, an option is another type of derivative instru-
ment traded in the futures markets. Options on futures are an agreement
between a buyer and a seller. The buyer of the option, known as the holder,
has the right but not the obligation of exercising the contract. On the other
hand, the seller of the option, known as the underwriter, has both the right
and the obligation of fulfilling the contract’s terms if the holder exercises her
rights. See futures contract. 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC): OPEC is an organi-
zation that includes 11 of the world’s top oil exporting countries. As an orga-
nization, OPEC is responsible for making sure that member states adhere to
specific production and export quotas. Because OPEC’s members collectively
hold 60 percent of the world’s total crude reserves, the organization has sig-
nificant influence in the oil markets. 
Over-The-Counter (OTC): The OTC market is where a majority of transac-
tions involving commodity futures contracts, options, and other derivatives
take place. The transactions involved in the OTC are, by definition, outside
the purview of regulated commodity exchanges. One of the benefits of OTC
deals is that the parties that enter into these agreements can create specific
deals to suit specific needs (which regulated exchanges might not be able to
offer). The drawback is that the regulated exchanges do offer regulatory
oversight to all market participants. Despite this lack of oversight, or because
of it, the OTC market is huge. To give you an idea, there are trillions of dollars
of transactions conducted by the regulated exchanges, and that accounts for
only 20 percent of total activity. The other 80 percent of trading is done
through the OTC markets. 
Panamax: The Panamax oil tanker gets its name from its ability to transit
through the Panama Canal. This vessel is sometimes used for short haul voy-
ages between the ports in the Caribbean, Europe, and the United States.
Photovoltaic: In solar energy, this is the process whereby solar power is 
captured and converted into electricity. 
Precious Metals: One method of categorizing metals is based on their resis-
tance to corrosion. Metals that are highly resistant to corrosion, and therefore
don’t rust easily, are known as precious metals. These metals include gold,
silver, and the Platinum Group Metals such as platinum and palladium. Metals
that easily corrode are known as base metals. See Base Metals. 
339
Appendix: Glossary of Technical Terms

Purchasing Managers Index (PMI): The PMI, released by the Institute of
Supply Management (ISM), is a composite index that’s a good indicator of
total manufacturing activity, which in turn is an important barometer of over-
all economic activity.
Put option: In the futures markets, a put option gives the holder the right,
but not the obligation, of selling a security at a predetermined price at a 
specific point in the future. This is the opposite of a call option. 
Refinery production: Actual production of crude oil products in a refinery,
such as gasoline and heating oil.
Refinery throughput: The capacity for refining crude oil over a given period
of time, usually expressed in barrels. 
Refinery utilization: The difference between production capacity, the
throughput, and what’s actually produced.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): RSI is a metric used in technical analysis 
that helps measure the price velocity and momentum of a security. In other
words, it quantifies the momentum at which a security is increasing or
decreasing and offers insight into how long an investor can expect that 
security to keep going on the price trajectory it is in. 
Resistance: In technical analysis, resistance is where the number of sellers of
a security is so large that price cannot move beyond a certain level. The
number of sellers causes resistance to the security’s upside. See support. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): The SEC is the main regulatory
organization of U.S. capital markets. It has oversight over all aspects of the
capital markets, and its primary mandate is monitoring and regulating all the
transactions that take place in the securities industry. 
Semi-submersible rig: Sometimes referred to as a “semi”, this structure has
the capacity to drill in deep waters for energy under harsh and unforgiving
conditions. 
Simple Moving Average (SMA): In technical analysis, the SMA is a moving
average that follows an equal weighted approach to all trading days, which
the average tracks for a particular security. For example, a 50 Day SMA will
place the same emphasis on the price of the security in Day 15 as it does on
Day 48. See Enhanced Moving Average. 
Sub-bituminous: This type of coal is the second least valuable in the coal
family. It’s used primarily for electricity generation. 
340
Commodities For Dummies 

Submersible rig: The submersible rig is similar to a jack-up rig in that it is
primarily used for shallow water drilling activity. It is secured to the seabed.
Suezmax: This vessel is named thus because its design and size allow it to
transit through the Suez Canal in Egypt. The Suezmax, ideally suited for
medium haul voyages, is used to transport oil from the Persian Gulf to
Europe as well as to other destinations.
Support: In technical analysis, support is where demand for a security is
strong enough that prices for that security remain at or above a certain level.
Thus the price is supported by buying activity. See resistance. 
Troy Ounce: Troy ounce is the unit of measurement used to measure gold,
silver, and other metals. It is the equivalent of 31.10 grams. 
Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC): This type of vessel is used to carry large
amounts of oil across long distances.
Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC): The VLCC is ideally suited for interconti-
nental maritime transportation of crude oil. 
Volume: In finance, volume refers to the total number of shares, units, or con-
tracts traded in a security or market during a specific period of time. See
open interest. 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI): The WTI is a premium type of crude oil
that’s used as a benchmark for global oil prices. Like its name implies, WTI is
extracted from a region in West Texas that produces high-grade, low-sulfur
crude. The NYMEX crude oil futures contract, widely quoted in the financial
press as a standard for crude oil prices around the world, tracks the price of
WTI crude.
