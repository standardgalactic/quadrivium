Introduction
R

ight at the intersection of art and journalism, technology and storytelling, 
lies the infographic. Ranging in size and scope from a three-inch pie chart 
to a multipage, full-color spread, infographics add visual appeal and detail to 
virtually any story. This is an interesting time for infographics. On one hand, 
print media that routinely featured charts, graphs, diagrams, and graphic 
illustrations has diminished. On the other hand, we humans are connected 
to media all day, every day, through our computers, tablets, and phones. We 
crave information and entertainment, and in a world that’s crowded with data, 
an attractive visual presentation can help your story stand out. When print 
media was king, most graphics were static — designed only for reading and 
impossible to change after publication. In the Internet age, though, graphics 
are going live, with interactive features that reel in readers and make informa­
tion incredibly relevant, fun, and personal.
So, as you decide what data you want to illustrate with an infographic — your 
story — we’ll help you figure that out, along with our advice for combining 
smart research, design, and technical skills to turn your story into a great 
infographic. We’ll also teach you how to find the biggest and best audience 
for your work.
About This Book
This book is a collaborative, collective effort from the folks of Infographic 
World. We’re a visual communications agency focused on (you guessed it!) 
infographics, designing for corporations, sports leagues, television networks, 
media outlets, universities, and nonprofit entities (like hospitals and charities). 
These diverse clients all have one thing in common: the need to share their 
stories and messages in a compelling manner. We help them do that by telling 
their stories visually.
On our staff, we have a wide range of complimentary talents that mesh and 
help us achieve our goals. We have fantastic designers, strategists, writers, 
and managers. Even if you’re not working in a firm as fully developed as 
ours — you might be working solo, wearing many hats — these skillsets give 
you a broad feel for the steps to designing and deploying infographics.

2
Infographics For Dummies 
Our goal here is to lead you through every stage of infographic design and 
development. We begin by showing you the power of visual images, and how 
you can and should use them to make your message stand out. We show you 
how to develop your own style, while still working within guidelines of poten­
tial clients. We show you some of the best ways to use design software to add 
visual interest to your work.
And finally, because an infographic isn’t much use if it doesn’t have an audi­
ence, we show you how to attract readers and perhaps even how to get your 
graphic to go viral.
Foolish Assumptions
Yeah, it’s wrong to assume, but we had to make a few guesses about you, 
anyway:
	
✓	You want to or need to create infographics, whether for your job or 
a personal interest, like blogging.
	
✓	You have a computer (Mac or PC) and know how to use word-processing 
functions, navigate the Internet, and maybe even have some simple 
design program experience.
	
✓	You pay attention to the news and have some ideas of what topics inter­
est today’s readers.
	
✓	You’re savvy enough with social media that we don’t need to tell you 
what Facebook is.
Conventions and Icons Used in This Book
The whole point of an infographic is to communicate clearly. So, to avoid any 
misunderstandings, here are a few things you should know:
	
✓	We use the words “infographic” and “graphic” interchangeably.
	
✓	Although many infographic designers prefer to work on Mac computers, 
PCs are acceptable. So in cases where a keyboard command or a menu 
path is different for a Mac than on a PC, we specify what to do for each 
(Mac is always first) like this: ⌘+V/Ctrl+V.
	
✓	Web addresses and Photoshop layer names appear in monofont like 
this so they stand out from regular text.
	
✓	When we want you to follow a menu path, it looks like this: Choose 
Window➪New.

 Introduction
Like all Dummies books, this one uses a few simple icons to help highlight 
some important information. (Graphic symbols in a book about infographics? 
Nice synergy, huh?)
	
The Tip symbol calls attention to some important tips, tricks, and shortcuts. 
Some of these are of a technical nature, while others focus on the content of 
your infographic or ways to work efficiently.
	
The Remember icon highlights information that you may come back to time 
and again as you’re working with infographics. We may also use this symbol 
to remind you of information mentioned earlier in the book.
	
Don’t worry, we use this icon sparingly. The Warning icon points out some 
potential pitfalls as you work with your graphics. Some of the warnings may 
seem intuitive, like when we remind you to save your work, but they’re all 
worth noting.
Beyond the Book
We’ve provided additional information about infographics online to help you 
on your way:
	
✓	Cheat Sheet: Check out www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/
infographics.
	
✓	Online articles: On several of the pages that open each of this book’s 
parts, you’ll find links to what the folks at For Dummies call Web Extras, 
which expand on some concept we’ve discussed in that particular sec­
tion. You’ll find them at www.dummies.com/extras/infographics.
Where to Go from Here
Okay, it’s time to design. Take a look at the Table of Contents to determine 
where you’d like to begin. If you want a little theory behind your work, start 
at the beginning. If you’re wondering where to go to get the statistics that 
drive many an infographic, skip to Part II, where we talk about gathering 
data. Or, if you’ve been designing simple infographics already and are ready 
to apply some technical flourishes, you may want to head straight to Part III. 
Remember, the way you use this book is entirely up to you.
We’d love you to hang on our every word, of course, but Infographics For 
Dummies is organized so you can quickly find the information you need and 
bypass what you don’t. Perhaps you’re very proficient in Photoshop, but you’ve 
never worked in Adobe Illustrator. There’s an app — um, “chap” — for that.

Or maybe you’re wondering how to market your work to social media. You 
can skip to Chapter 13, which details how and when to share your infograph­
ics. You can always backtrack to the earlier chapters for some deeper reading 
when you have time.
And, if you want to seek inspiration from some of the amazing work that 
our staff designers have done, feel free to check out our website, http://

H

umans are incredibly visual creatures. Thousands of years ago, cave-
dwellers used visual images to track time, to depict their prey, and to 
record their celebrations. Later, civilizations created hieroglyphics and visual 
symbols for letters and numbers, providing a code to organize their communi­
cation. Visual communication can bridge cultures — travelers on any continent 
can find a pharmacy, a hospital, and the correct restroom thanks to the power 
of simple graphic images.
Flash back to the 1970s for a moment. Most Americans read a newspaper or 
two. The New York Times was so heavy with text that it was dubbed “The Old 
Gray Lady.” Most households had a TV. News was broadcast three times a 
day, on the three major networks. Corporate reports were very dense, with 
pages full of text and little more than the occasional headline to break them 
up. The Internet as we know it today was but a dream.
Also in the 70s, newspapers and magazines began to use infographics — charts, 
maps, and diagrams — to illustrate and illuminate news stories and break 
up columns of gray text. Infographics have been with us for a long time, but 
they’ve matured and become more and more dynamic, especially with the 
advent of the Internet. Nowadays, infographics can be quite sophisticated, 
showing condensed ways of looking at data and figures and information. You 
can pack quite a lot of valuable information in a small, attractive, and enter­
taining piece of content.

Recognizing the Value of Visuals
Speaking of the advent of the Internet. . . . No news flash here, but we live in 
an ever-increasing electronic and digital age. Most folks are barraged all day 
by some sort of media clamoring for attention. Most people have Internet 
access at their fingertips via smartphone, tablet, or computer. All that “Hey, 
look at me!” can make a person weary, and the overload of messaging and 
devices has taken a toll on the human attention span.
Those folks who deliver content — be it via television news, print journal­
ism, a corporate report, website — realize that they have a short window of 
opportunity to grab a viewer’s attention. And with only about eight seconds 
to do that, enter the increasing use of infographics, which are meaty mor­
sels of lots and lots of content in attractive, digestable, informative chunks, 
whether online or in print.
An increasingly multimedia and online technology climate shift has fostered 
an explosion of infographics within all forms of communication. The old way 
of communicating messages in a text-heavy manner is simply not effective 
anymore. There is simply too much research and science behind the power 
of visual storytelling to ignore. Companies and organizations cannot afford to 
be out of date. It’s time to embrace the power of visualization, and find a way 
to incorporate it into what you and your company do every day.
If we haven’t convinced you by now, plenty of research backs up this idea 
that visual communication can provide quicker, clearer comprehension of 
complex topics. Here are a few statistics:
	
✓	More than 80 percent of the learning we do takes place visually.
www.hp.com/large/ipg/assets/bus-solutions/power-of-visual-
communication.pdf
	
✓	The average person retains only 20 percent of what’s read when it’s 
delivered in text-only format.
www.hp.com/large/ipg/assets/bus-solutions/power-of-visual-
communication.pdf
Print isn’t dead
The New York Times produces some of the best, 
smartest infographics in the world. Corporate 
reports feature charts, graphs, and illustra­
tions to highlight information. Nonprofit orga­
nizations rely on infographics to spur potential 
donors and volunteers to action. Magazines 
like National Geographic create infographics 
that rival the excellence of their photography. 
Although an ever-growing number of websites 
and blogs compete to take the place of print 
vehicles, infographics still are widely used and 
very valuable to content providers.

✓	Images are liked on Facebook 200 percent more than text.

power-of-visual-content-infographic
	
✓	On average, websites register a 12-percent increase in traffic after pub­
lishing an infographic.
www.wpvirtuoso.com/a-guide-to-content-management-marketing
	
✓	The Wharton School of Business determined that when listening to 
presentations, 67 percent of the audience were persuaded by the verbal 
presentations that had accompanying visuals compared with 50 percent 
of the audience when it was verbal only.
www.macrovu.com/VTVCInterEffectiveness.html
	
	The same Wharton study found that visual language shortens meeting 
time by 24 percent. That’s some serious added productivity.
A great infographic leads readers on a visual journey, telling them a story 
along the way. Powerful infographics are able to capture people’s attention in 
the first few seconds with a strong title and visual image, and then reel them 
in to digest the entire message. Infographics have become an effective way to 
speak for the creator, conveying information and image simultaneously.
Here’s a hypothetical example to demonstrate this idea. You just completed 
detailed and accurate market research for your company, looking into all 
sorts of pinpointed information about your target demographic. The purpose 
of this market research is to help your sales and marketing teams better 
understand your customer. The results — hundreds (or thousands) of stats 
compiled in an Excel document — are then written up and presented in a PDF 
document using nothing but words.
Seeing is believing
In 2011, molecular biologist John Medina pub­
lished Brain Rules, a fascinating account of 
how the brain processes information. It’s a 
great book all around, but two rules are par­
ticularly interesting.
Rule #4: We don’t pay attention to boring things.
Returning to The New York Times and the cor­
porate reports examples, we know today that 
readers simply do not stick with material that 
is too dense. Medina’s book suggests that 
humans need a spark every ten minutes or so 
to entice us to pay attention. Infographics can 
provide that spark.
Rule #10: Vision trumps all other senses.
Medina’s research led him to determine that a 
person who hears information will remember 
ten percent of that information three days later. 
If pictures are added to that information, the 
subject remembers 65 percent of the informa­
tion three days later.
This opens the door for great graphic presen­
tations of information. Media outlets, corpora­
tions, nonprofit groups, sports leagues, and 
more now know that telling their stories with 
pictures as well as with words helps attract and 
retain readers.

10
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
This shouldn’t be a problem, right? The results are so compelling that people 
will be willing to read 50 pages of findings, right? Sorry. They won’t. You can 
have the greatest data in the world, but if you don’t have the proper way to 
communicate this data effectively, you won’t get anywhere.
The solution? Create a visual to showcase the market research findings in a 
way that people will actually digest. For the average Joe, choosing between 
wading through a 50-page text-heavy PDF or perusing a visual like the info­
graphic presented in Figure 1-1 is an obvious choice.
Figure 1-1: Concise, informative graphic that’s easy to consume.
The power of infographics is that it keeps things short and sweet. Instead of 
some 50-page tome, you could present three or four pages of infographics, 
with a few pointed sentences, to communicate your key data points.
The concise, pointed nature of an infographic works well with the fact that 
people’s attention span is decreasing significantly. This is especially the case 
online, where every website on the planet is competing for your reader’s 

11
 Chapter 1: Unlocking the Power of Infographics
attention at any given moment. It’s far too easy for someone to come to your 
website, lose interest and be gone all within a few seconds. It’s often said that 
you have four to six seconds to grab someone’s attention when they come to 
your website. Are you going to accomplish this by having a lot of text and a 
couple of charts or by having a stunning visualization front and center?
So You Want to Be an Infographic Designer
When you were a kid, and some well-meaning adult asked you what you 
wanted to be when you grew up, what did you say? A professional athlete? 
A doctor? Dancer? Firefighter?
We’ve never met a soul who set out to be an infographic designer — but we 
certainly know some great ones. A few followed logical paths toward infographic 
design, and a few more wound crazily through other careers and professional 
skills before coming to infographic design. Many professional infographic 
designers are artists or writers. Some are graphic designers, whose primary 
work responsibilities involve page layout and creation of art elements.
But this is a DIY world, and you can indeed teach yourself the art of the info­
graphic. Stick with us as we talk about everything you’ll need to do so, from 
research skills to technical tools.
Filling Your Toolbox
We spend a lot of time discussing specific creation (software) tools and tech­
niques later in the book, particularly in Chapter 3 (designing your approach 
to infographics), Chapter 9 (Adobe Illustrator), and Chapter 10 (Adobe 
Photoshop).
Assuming you’re just starting out with infographics, though, start with a good 
foundation. Our first recommendation is to be a voracious reader. Whether you 
prefer print or an online version, take a look at a few newspapers every day. 
Read something national in scope (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal) 
and a local newspaper, too. Because infographics distill data — sometimes, lots 
of data — consider yourself as a journalist who not only reports (without bias) 
but does research as well. Sure, graphics play a major role (go figure) in info­
graphics, but so does the data underlying your presentation.
	
As an infographic designer, you’re not just an artist. The best infographics 
designers are really considered “data journalists.” The more infographics you 
take time to really examine, you’ll start to get a sense of what type of material 
can be turned into a graphic.

12
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
As for more tangible tools you’ll need, make sure that your computer is in good 
working order and can support the design software you’ll need. It’s a designer’s 
worst nightmare to have repeated computer crashes as deadline looms. You’ll 
obviously need an online connection as well as basic office productivity apps, 
Adobe Acrobat, some sort of photo management app, and Adobe Creative 
Suite. Can’t forget about the behind-the-scenes code creation if you’re going to 
post online (and you should). Some folks like to create animated or interactive 
infographics (or add sound or movie files) program in Flash, but that can cause 
problems (we talk about that later). Probably the safest bet is to use HTML5 
and CSS3 and JavaScript.
We’re pretty proud of the information we present later in the book, but if you’d 
like some face-to-face tutorials, keep an eye out for classes in programs like 
Illustrator and Photoshop. Continuing education programs at local colleges 
and high schools often provide excellent ways to learn the basics of new com­
puter software.
	
Good planning before your project gets rolling can save you from a lot of 
stress later.
Assembling Your Team
In this section, we assume that you’re not working alone. Perhaps you work 
for a company looking to expand its marketing efforts by placing infograph­
ics on social media. Maybe you’re a writer for an online news site, and 
you’re hoping to generate more infographics. Or maybe you’re a university 
researcher, and it’s dawned on you that your research could use some 
graphic presentation to make sure people are reading and understanding 
your work.
Bottom line: You need to assemble some internal resources and work closely 
with the people who will make your plans come to fruition.
Using internal resources
When a company decides to use its own employees to create infographics, 
they are choosing to work with people who know the brand and the messag­
ing and feel of the company better than anyone outside the company ever 
will. Gut-checks like this are definitely very important when an infographic 
needs to align with a company’s brand.
Using in-house staffers also helps the assigning staffer confer with the art­
ists more easily than if using external freelancers. Granted, with the rise of 
telecommuting and people working remotely, this benefit is definitely less­
ened a bit.

13
 Chapter 1: Unlocking the Power of Infographics
If you’re going to build your infographic in-house, you’ll need to make sure 
you have people dedicated to the following tasks/roles:
	
✓	Brainstorming the idea for the infographic.
	
✓	Researching data to support the infographic and help tell the story.
	
✓	Fact-checking the data.
	
	Fact-checking should definitely be done by someone other than the 
person who did the research.
	
✓	Writing the copy.
	
✓	Editing the copy.
	
	Again, have this done by someone other than the copy writer.
	
✓	Coming up with the infographic concept and design ideas.
	
✓	Designing the infographic.
	
✓	Reviewing the entire infographic.
	
✓	Implementing any changes requested by supervisors.
This is not to say you need a different person for each task, but whoever 
you put in charge of the infographic should be mindful of all those duties. 
Depending upon the size and scope of your project, anywhere from one 
person to a team of three or four or more could take it on.
	
Having a tech person or two in the loop and on your side is a good idea. In 
today’s digital world, you want to make sure that all your work is compatible 
with the website, blog, or document that will eventually showcase your work.
	
In a larger company, the person you have in mind to work on infographics 
may have many other responsibilities as well. Your graphic may or may not 
take precedence. Depending upon your project’s priority level, you may have 
to wait before a request is handled. If your deadline is going to be tight, we 
recommend making sure that the artist can complete your work in the time­
line that you set. Sometimes you can help an artist clear a little time in his 
schedule by asking various department heads to be mindful of your project.
Working with your online team
Your online team is the group of people who handle all the content that goes 
onto a website. At this point, virtually every company has one although it 
might be outsourced. The online team is likely to include coders, web design­
ers, and any number of technical support staffers.
The online team knows the technical requirements of your particular website 
better than anyone. One important element that you’ll have to be mindful of 
as an infographic designer is the size limitations for content on a website. 
This is more important than it may seem.

14
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
Space on websites is measured in pixels. When you’re preparing to place your 
infographic, there may be other permanent items on the page, like advertise­
ments, or links to other areas of your website. This being the case, you need 
to know how many pixels your infographic should be to fit on the page prop­
erly and co-exist with other permanent content on the page.
The online team will also coordinate with you about the file formats you need 
to deliver to them, how long it will take to get the infographic onto the site (as 
with other teams at your company, they will likely be getting pulled in many 
different directions with requests), and other important tasks to launch the 
infographic.
Getting your social media team ready
The social media team will need to be prepared in advance of you launching 
the infographic. Given the importance of social media in the marketing and 
promotion of the infographic, everyone needs to be on the same page.
Your company’s social media experts (which may include marketing staffers, 
the webmaster, social media strategists, among others) will help you deter­
mine the best day and time to release your infographic and begin marketing 
and promoting it. (More on this is discussed in Chapter 13.) Bear in mind 
that the social media team will be balancing other requests to have material 
tweeted or posted to the company’s Facebook page. So again, collaboration is 
key: The more notice you give people about your project, the more smoothly 
things will go.
Speaking of professionals . . .
The obvious pro to hiring an infographic agency 
is very simple: They do nothing but create info­
graphics, every single day. Some obvious bias 
here. Justin is, after all, the CEO of Infographic 
World. Here is a brief list of projects that Fortune 
500 companies have hired us (at Infographic 
World), to do:
	✓	Help build more engaging PowerPoint pre­
sentations that don’t leave audiences with 
glazed eyes.
	✓	Create website content to help establish a 
client as a thought leader within its industry 
and drive more traffic to its website.
	✓	Improve SEO ranks by creating and placing 
infographics online, with the goal of getting 
other websites to link to them.
	✓	Create a visually stunning annual report or 
investor report.
	✓	Communicate market research.
	✓	Release content on social media channels 
to entice readers and encourage readers to 
share that content.
	✓	Create brochures and other documents for 
conferences.

15
 Chapter 1: Unlocking the Power of Infographics
Working with the social media team can also help you set the tone for your 
project. Depending on the content of the infographic and the target audience, 
you can set a tone that’s serious or snarky, news-oriented or feature-focused. 
This can help guarantee that you get the readers you want.
Working with a marketing team
These days, one of the primary goals for creators of infographics is to have 
them go viral. This generates traffic and links back to your website, which 
will help promote your work, your blog, or the company you’re working for.
If you’re creating a graphic for a company with a marketing team, taking advan­
tage of the marketing team’s insight and expertise early on will pay dividends 
in the end. The staff members most likely to handle these duties may fall under 
the labels “marketing,” “public relations,” or “communications.” These folks
	
✓	Prepare campaigns to get exposure for the infographic by building lists 
of websites to place the infographic, finding the best contact people, and 
determining how and when to pitch your infographic.
	
✓	Know what sorts of topics, statistics, and angles will be most effective 
in getting the infographic out to the masses and how content appeals to 
various audiences.
	
✓	Put more pairs of eyes on the infographic, finding things in the approach 
that might be misguided or a poor fit for your target audience, and share 
their take on how content appeals to various audiences.
Going with the professionals
The alternative to building an infographic in-house is to hire an infographic 
agency to build it for you. Like with the internal route, there are pros and 
cons for either path. You first need to determine whether you have the 
budget. Depending upon the company, the cost to get an infographic built by 
someone skilled can range from $700 to $6,000, depending on the size of the 
graphic and the scope of the content you want displayed, not to mention the 
quality of the infographic agency you want to hire.
Most agencies focused on infographics have systems in place to create proj­
ects efficiently and at a high quality. You may flinch at some quotes, but using 
an outside agency may actually be less expensive in the long run when you 
factor in the number of internal staffers and the cost of diverting them from 
their ordinary responsibilities.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
Working with Decision Makers
Whether you’re working solo or as part of a team, the first and most impor­
tant thing to do is keep the decision makers within your company or organi­
zation in the loop the entire time. Unless you’re the owner of the company 
(and even then, there might be investors who could qualify), you’ll have 
someone (or several “someones”) who needs to approve the infographic 
before it’s put onto your client’s website or into company marketing and 
sales materials. Here are a couple real-world examples you might encounter:
	
✓	If you’re working for a corporate client — say, designing charts and graphs 
for an annual report — you will probably work with everyone from the 
company’s art director to the CEO before getting sign off on your work.
	
✓	If you’re working with a team of journalists on a big event — say, cover­
ing the Olympics for Associated Press — your infographics will have to 
pass muster with sports editors, news editors, top managers, and ulti­
mately newspaper editors all around the world.
	
Real-world disclaimer: Our firm has had instances where all the work took 
place before the decision makers entered the process — never a good idea. 
The last thing you want is to go through the entire process of building an 
infographic — whether done internally or by hiring an infographic agency — 
only to have the decision makers see it after it’s fully complete. You’re just 
tempting fate that the decision makers will want major changes or disagree 
entirely with how the vision of the infographic was brought to life.
	
You should work with decision makers — not around them or against them — 
to make sure the final infographic project meets everyone’s needs. Here’s 
how things can go awry and how they could have been avoided.
	
1.	You get a great assignment to create an infographic for a large corpo­
rate client. Congratulations!
	
2.	Your contact person is a midlevel marketing manager.
	
	Wrong: You assume that she is the only person who will approve 
your work.
	
	Right: You immediately find out whether anyone else will be signing 
off on your project.
	
3.	You begin creating and revising your infographic. This stage can take 
weeks or months, depending on your client’s needs and deadlines.
	
	Wrong: You continue to work exclusively with your initial contact 
person. You’re incorporating her suggestions, unaware that other 
decision makers haven’t seen your work.
	
	Right: You make sure that your contact person is fully informing 
her boss as well as anyone else who will ultimately sign off on your 
infographic.

17
 Chapter 1: Unlocking the Power of Infographics
	
4.	You start to look for buy-in and approval.
	
	Wrong: The marketing manager signs off on your work. Trouble is, his 
boss hates it — and only now do you realize that the marketing man­
ager wasn’t the top decision maker. So, you begin revising your work. 
Then you find out that the boss’s boss loved your original product. 
The decision makers begin revising their vision of your work. Your 
previous weeks of work are down the drain. After another couple of 
weeks of revisions, the company signs off on your project. The job is 
finally done, but it wasn’t the wisest use of time and resources.
	
	Right: You make corrections and changes according to the whole 
team’s specifications. Your infographic gets final approval and is 
published. Well done!
	
If you’re not the final decision maker at your company, do yourself a favor 
and make sure to identify all decision makers upfront and then keep them in 
the loop as you work on your infographics. There’s just too much time and 
money to be lost and wasted by waiting until the end of the process to get 
their input.

nfographics may seem to be a modern means of communication, but their 
roots go way back to the eighteenth century. In 1786, the marvelously 
named William Playfair published The Commercial and Political Atlas, which 
used graphics to illustrate facts about the English economy. Playfair is generally 
accepted to be the inventor of the line graph, the bar chart, and the pie chart.
Infographics have come a long way since then. Today, the applications of 
infographics for information and marketing purposes are virtually limitless. 
Before you jump into the process of creating your own infographics, take the 
time to nail down the ultimate purpose of your work. Whether your goal is 
to inform, entertain, or convince, that goal will determine how you research, 
plan, design, and publish your information graphic.
Establishing Your Voice
Infographics generally fall into one of two categories: promotional or informa­
tional. And although you can certainly have a bit of both elements within one 
infographic, you almost always will have one or the other as your primary 
focus.
Over time, you will be able to establish a tone — “voice” — for your info­
graphics. Some designers’ work appears highly authoritative. Other artists 
bring a more whimsical touch. A critical first step in finding that voice is 
knowing your purpose.

20
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
	
Your infographic voice doesn’t always have to stay the same and certainly 
should change over time. As you develop and gain practice at creating info­
graphics, you may find your original way of doing things doesn’t work. Never 
stop growing and learning.
Promoting with brand infographics
Most infographics are marketing materials in one way or another; some 
advertising messages are just hidden better than others. Brand infographics 
can be appropriate for
	
✓	Promoting or explaining services and products
	
✓	Explaining sales or internal survey data
	
✓	Establishing your company as a thought leader
Most brand infographics will use corporate or campaign branding to help 
viewers identify them as part of a particular brand. At a minimum, brand info­
graphics should carry a corporate logo.
The most unobtrusive location for a logo is toward the bottom of the info­
graphic, as shown in Figure 2-1. We recommend resisting the urge to place 
your logo at the top of your infographic, as readers may be immediately 
turned off by what they view as a clear advertisement.
Figure 2-1: Place a simple, unobtrusive logo at the bottom of your graphic.

21
 Chapter 2: Exploring Infographics
In certain cases, a blatant advertising message is okay. (See Figure 2-2.) If you’re 
creating an infographic to be viewed by people within your own company or 
those you’re hoping will become clients, there’s very little need to be shy or 
coy about promoting your products or services. In these cases, your audience 
knows that they’re seeing an advertising or a marketing message, and they’re 
fine with it. So take advantage of the opportunity to promote your service or 
product in a clever, inventive way.
Figure 2-2: Clearly identify your marketing pieces as such.
Infographics like this can be appropriate for
	
✓	Trade shows
	
✓	Sales department leave-behinds
	
✓	Brochures
	
✓	Posters
	
✓	Product instructions

22
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
This type of graphic will most likely have an authoritative tone, but the desired 
tone varies depending upon the company. For example, an infographic for a 
snowboard manufacturer may incorporate the loose, fun vibe that has become 
associated with the sport.
Educating with informational editorial infographics
Editorial graphics are akin to news articles in that their primary purpose is 
to transmit information. Under the umbrella of editorial graphics, there are 
several different types, with different balances of bias versus objectivity. Here 
is a look at a few:
	
✓	A blizzard hit your town. The local newspaper creates a graphic that 
shows snowfall over the past 20 years, maps out the weather front that 
brought the blizzard, and shows which roads are designated as snow 
emergency routes. The graphic is purely informational, without any 
obvious bias.
	
✓	You come upon a graphic called “50 Incredible Facts About Skin.” The 
graphic is nicely researched, beautifully designed, and appears to be a 
simple collection of interesting tidbits about skin. But, wait! At the bottom 
of the graphic, you discover that it was created by a company that sells 
and delivers beauty products. Infographics like this straddle the line 
between informing and promoting. It’s up to the reader to discern the 
difference.
	
✓	It’s flu season, and in a parenting magazine, you see a cool infographic 
showing how the flu spreads. Sources are doctors. There’s no mention of 
any particular company or product. It’s probably pure editorial content.
	
	In a different magazine, you see a similar graphic on the flu. However, 
the copy recommends disinfecting your house with SuperClean wipes. 
Hmm. At the bottom of the page, in small type, you find that the content 
was sponsored by SuperClean Corp. This infographic is an ad although it 
is informational as well.
	
✓	You read a lively, engaging infographic on beers of the world. The tone 
might vary considerably depending upon who created it. If a journal­
ist created it for a men’s magazine, it probably has some attitude, with 
language targeted to appeal to a young male demographic. If a brewery 
created the infographic, it’s probably designed to inform and may have a 
more serious tone. 
One of the biggest benefits of skewing your work toward editorial infograph­
ics is they are more likely to be shared organically by web users than info­
graphics that carry heavy branding and are obvious advertisements. Totally 
unbranded infographics are ideal, but that’s not always possible because 
infographics can be expensive to produce.

23
 Chapter 2: Exploring Infographics
Editorial infographics can have myriad purposes, including:
	
✓	Stating facts or explaining processes
	
✓	Exploring the history of a person or topic
	
✓	Comparing companies, countries, educational institutions, teams, and 
so on
	
✓	Supporting a political ideology
These educational approaches will typically follow a somewhat standard flow:
	
1.	Establish a problem/topic/proposal.
	
	 What is the issue you’re going to be discussing or addressing in the info­
graphic? Think of this like a lede in a newspaper or a thesis statement of 
a term paper. You need to clearly state what the infographic is about. For 
instance, imagine that you’re going to create an infographic exploring the 
ways how everyday Internet users put their personal information at risk.
	
	 A lede is the introduction to a story or graphic. It’s a journalistic term 
that may have gotten its funky spelling to differentiate it from lead, as in 
the metal type that was formerly used to print newspapers and books.
	
2.	Offer statistics as evidence.
	
	 This is where the bulk of your research (read more about that in Chapter 5) 
comes in. Here, you offer data, facts, and analysis about the topic you just 
introduced. For example, you might offer statistics about identity theft, 
hacking, malware, passwords, and mobile security.
	
3.	Conclude with a “So what?” statement.
	
	 The most effective infographics will take some sort of stand even if it 
seems obvious. Readers will expect a destination at the end of the road; 
they won’t be happy if the pavement just stops. Continuing our example, 
your conclusion could offer some analysis on which anti-malware pro­
grams are the best, or what readers can expect to spend for the best 
protection.
Working with Infographics
Most infographics today are static: that is, without interactivity or animation. 
They are generally the least expensive to produce and post online (in terms 
of bandwidth), and the easiest for viewers to see/download, which makes 
them the go-to option for companies that want to communicate an idea 
through infographics.
	
Learn to walk before you run — that is, learn to create static infographics 
before other types of infographics.

Identifying what makes an infographic
You might not realize this, but you’ve been encountering infographics for most 
of your life. Have you ever seen a transit map? Then you’ve seen an infographic. 
Sure, you could read the list of the public transit lines in your city, but you’d 
only get a partial understanding of the scope of options. You wouldn’t see how 
the various lines intersect. The map takes the basic information and translates 
it into a better venue for your brain to process.
At its most basic, an infographic translates information into an image. This 
could mean taking U.S. unemployment data for the past ten years and creat­
ing a line chart to help people visualize the instability of the economy. Or 
it could mean taking that same data and creating a map so viewers can see 
which areas of the United States are struggling the most.
Every infographic should have the same basic components:
	
✓	Accurate, compelling data
	
✓	Clever, well-crafted (and limited) writing
	
✓	Creative data visualizations
	
✓	Consistent visual style
	
In a well-made infographic, those parts will feel seamless and organic — 
everything will seem as though it was meant to go together.
Sticking with what works
Most infographics are now optimized for use on the Internet. There’s a big 
benefit here in terms of content. Given that the Internet is a repository for, 
well, everything, there’s almost certainly an audience out there for what you 
have to say.
Technically speaking, working with an online format means that after you get 
the hang of designing infographics, you can use the same basic approach and 
format over and over again, provided you can come up with fresh content.
The typical static infographic is tall and vertical, allowing users to scroll to 
read all the information. This lends itself very easily to storytelling because 
readers are compelled to scroll to see the next bit of information. The flow is 
quite natural. Sticking with that format is a good idea.
Become a subject matter expert
We recommend becoming as well-versed as possible in one or more general 
topics so you can learn to speak with authority and become knowledgeable 
about the data related to that topic. If you want to create infographics about 

25
 Chapter 2: Exploring Infographics
business, learn to read annual SEC reports or stock information. If you want 
to develop infographics about professional sports, read box scores and learn 
about the teams and players. And after you become an expert, exploit those 
topics. Create infographics that are variations on a theme. For example, say 
you want to specialize in infographics related to social media: You could 
explore topics like these:
	
✓	General social media use
	
✓	Social media and relationships
	
✓	Workplace limitations on social media
	
✓	The technology of social media
	
✓	Social media evolution
	
✓	Social media and sports
	
✓	TV and social media
The point is to get really good at infographics in a few areas by exploring as 
many subtopics within those areas as you can. That not only gives you expe­
rience at creating different kinds of infographics, but it also allows you to 
position yourself as an expert and thought leader in the space.
Considering possibilities beyond 
the static infographic
Static infographics may be the most commonly produced type of infographic 
today, but they are far from the only kind. And for some topics, static storytell­
ing may have limitations that would damage a reader’s understanding of the 
topic.
In later sections, we’ll explore in more detail other types of infographics. 
Interactive and animated infographics are a growing field in infographic 
design and development. They take far longer to produce and are more 
expensive to produce, but an effective interactive or animated design can do 
things static infographics simply cannot.
Interactive graphics also tap into readers’ desire to share content. As we 
write this book, The New York Times’ graphic on regional dialects is sweeping 
the country. Based on Harvard research, the graphic asks readers to answer 
25 questions on various regional sayings, and then generates a guess on 
where the reader is from. It’s pretty brilliant, and it’s probably the future of 
infographics.

Predicting the Lifecycle of Infographics
Some infographics will see a huge amount of traffic right after they’re launched; 
others take more time to spread around the Internet. Which pattern is best is 
debatable and depends largely on the topic at hand, but in general, an info­
graphic should fall into one of three categories:
	
✓	Timely: Timely infographics are related to topics that take place only once 
and have a relatively brief window in the public consciousness. Major 
news events such celebrity deaths, corporate bankruptcies, and elections 
fall into this category. Holidays, anniversaries of major events, and other 
notable dates also fall into this category. An infographic about the career 
timeline of Michael Jackson, for instance, would apply.
	
✓	Related: Related infographics are inspired by news events, holidays, 
or notable dates but don’t deal directly with the event. Continuing our 
example, a graphic related to Michael Jackson could show the top-selling 
albums of all time (which includes Jackson’s iconic Thriller). It’s not a 
direct tie, but a related one.
	
✓	Evergreen: Evergreen infographics aren’t related to any event or person 
in the news. They have no seasonal component, and they’re not tied to 
anything timely. Sticking with our music theme, an infographic about 
how CDs are made would apply because it’s music-related but not spe­
cific to any artist or genre.
The follow sections explore the three general areas in more depth.
Timely: Sharing breaking news
Although your infographic is unlikely to be the sole source of breaking news, 
it can help readers’ understanding of a breaking news event. For instance, 
many people learned on Twitter in October, 2011 that Apple co-founder Steve 
Jobs had died. An infographic wasn’t going to be the first anybody heard of it.
But at Infographic World, we created an infographic looking back on his life 
and his accomplishments (we called it Farewell to a Genius), in a way to show­
case a visual story that had not been told yet. (See Figure 2-3.) So in that sense, 
the infographic was breaking news. This graphic ended up being a viral sensa­
tion, getting featured on Mashable for several weeks, and then getting picked 
up by tens of thousands of other websites across the world over time.
Another way your infographic can be seen as “breaking news” is by illuminat­
ing an issue or piece of data in a way people hadn’t considered before. Data 
by itself is interesting enough, but without context, understanding of it can 
be shallow. A good goal for your infographic should be to surprise people 
with your data. Tell them something they didn’t already know.

27
 Chapter 2: Exploring Infographics
Figure 2-3: Telling a visual story can illuminate breaking news.
For instance, did you know that more Americans are in prison than are active-
duty members of the military? After some research, you learn that in 2011, 
there were more than two million incarcerated offenders in the United States. 
In 2013, there were slightly less than 1.5 million active-duty members of the 
military.
By comparing the figures graphically, you’re taking existing data and looking 
at it and presenting it in a new way to tell an original story. Figure 2-4 shows 
how you could compare the two numbers in an infographic.
Timely infographics can be immensely successful, but be warned: Their pop­
ularity will wane as public interest in the news cools. We kept this in mind as 
we built the Steve Jobs graphic because we knew that as a story fades from 
the front pages, reader interest in our infographic wouldn’t last forever. For 
this reason, we created the infographic from beginning to end in less than 
30 hours following his death.

Related: Telling a relevant tale
You may not wish to rush into production with an extremely timely infographic. 
After all, that’s a major commitment of resources. Instead, maybe you want to 
take a news event, find a somewhat related topic, and develop an infographic 
inspired by the news event.
www.allitebooks.com

29
 Chapter 2: Exploring Infographics
When choosing these tangentially related topics, explore potentially unseen 
or previously unconsidered aspects of an event. Use the news event as a point 
of departure, allowing your topic to have a life of its own while still retaining a 
sense of timeliness.
In other words, don’t take on the news event directly. Take a different view of 
it. Broad ideas in this vein include
	
✓	The business of <fill in the blank>
	
✓	<fill in the blank> around the world
	
✓	The evolution of <fill in the blank>
	
• By state
	
• And kids
	
• And elderly people
	
✓	The future of <fill in the blank>
Approaches like this allow you to take advantage of the built-in popularity of 
current events while expanding the overall lifespan of your infographic. You’ll 
get the best of both worlds, giving your infographic a ready-made audience in 
the short term and allowing the audience to continue building even after the 
immediate interest fades.
	
You don’t have to even mention the news event in your infographic in many 
cases. Otherwise, you run the risk of the piece immediately becoming out­
dated in the case of rapidly developing news. The ideal approach is to make 
the infographic appear as though it were planned all along and is simply ben­
efitting from fortuitous timing.
Evergreen: Letting things build
The final approach to infographics is to completely ignore current events 
and explore ideas at your own pace. These evergreen pieces will have a virtu­
ally limitless shelf life (depending on the topic), so it’s wise to have a mix of 
timely and evergreen pieces.
Infographics of this type may not have a huge audience at first, but they can 
build viewers over time if the topic has interest year-round. These pieces 
often are the most appealing because they allow the data to take you wher­
ever it goes and craft a design that’s completely organic and springs totally 
from the content.
When you aren’t going for the immediate impact of a timely infographic, make 
sure your topic is interesting all on its own. The best way to do that is to 
explore the techniques we talk about earlier, including becoming an expert 

30
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
in a given field. This strategy gives you the best chance of knowing what 
will interest the audience. If you have some knowledge and expertise in sci­
ence, for example, you could craft an infographic on the lifecycle of the frog. 
If you’re an Internet expert, you could design an infographic showing how a 
search engine works.
Engaging Viewers with Animation and Motion
Traditional static infographics are powerful and certainly have their place, 
but some stories can’t be told through static imagery and charts alone. Some 
demand more bells and whistles, including motion, sound, and interactivity.
Although these techniques are relatively new, they are becoming extremely 
popular with readers who have come to crave constant entertainment and 
engagement. As you build your skills as an infographic designer, you’ll defi­
nitely want to add some of these design skills to your roster.
Bringing infographics to life with motion and sound
Animated and video-based infographics (we are using those terms inter­
changeably) give you the opportunity to present stories in ways that pro­
vide more depth and perspective than static infographics. Such stories can 
include highly complex processes, mechanical illustrations, or long stories.
How do you know when opting for an animated infographic is the best idea? 
That will most likely depend on the amount of information you have or the 
complexity of the story you need to tell. But mostly, the question you need to 
answer is deciding the best format to explain the information at hand.
	
As we discuss throughout the book, people are visual, and motion speaks to 
people in a way that static imagery simply can’t. To be sure, a static info­
graphic can have a similar effect, but it’s not nearly as powerful.
For example, infographics that include motion can help explain how the gears 
of a watch work by truly showing the viewer.
Motion infographics also allow you to tell the story in the exact order you 
want and be sure that viewers are consuming it as you intended. After all, 
with a static infographic, you can never really be sure whether viewers read 
the piece as you intended. If you’ve created the piece effectively, you have a 
good idea that they have, but you can never be totally sure. With a motion 
infographic, though, that concern isn’t present. After all, nobody is going to 
start a video in the middle.
Most animated or video infographics also will include a sound element, 
which could be a piece of music, sound effects, or voice narration — usually 

31
 Chapter 2: Exploring Infographics
a combination of all three. Sound gives you just another tool to help clearly, 
cleverly, and effectively explain the topic at hand. Sound is important in 
motion graphics for
	
✓	Establishing a mood
	
✓	Creating a sense of authority
	
✓	Connecting viewers
	
✓	Providing emotional depth
We’ve seen a narrated infographic on discovering celestial objects that used 
an outer-space backdrop, spinning asteroids, and mystical music to accom­
plish all of these effects.
Motion infographics are much more complex and expensive to produce than 
static infographics, but they give you such a unique method for storytelling 
that it’s critical not to overlook them as important tools.
Creating an interactive infographic experience
Much like motion graphics, interactive infographics provide you with another 
powerful way to involve your viewers in the topic. Interactive infographics 
include features that allow the readers to explore the infographic in their 
own ways. This customized view can come about in a number of different 
ways — whether by clicking on a part of the graphic to view data or by moving 
components of the graphic to access more information. Like motion graph­
ics, interactive graphics have their own unique benefits and reasons why you 
might choose them. A few include
	
✓	An abundance of data
	
✓	Overly complex processes or explanations
	
✓	Large, detailed maps
	
✓	Lengthy text
	
✓	Data that will affect different readers in different ways
Perhaps the most compelling reason to explore using an interactive solution 
to your topic is when you have a huge amount of data. Say you have data 
comparing every single state in the United States in a variety of categories. 
You could do this with a static approach, but you’d be asking your readers to 
stay tuned for a very long infographic. It’s difficult to hold interest that long.
Instead of expecting viewers to stick with you for a long time, you could 
instead provide them with an interactive experience that would allow them 
to explore the data on their own time and at their own pace.

32
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
One of our earlier interactive projects features a state-by-state comparison of 
a number of lifestyle factors, such as education, church attendance, obesity 
rates, crime rates, and more. We compiled the data for all 50 states and then 
created an interactive format allowing readers to see data for whatever states 
they want, in whichever categories they choose.
We then color-coded the states red or blue to show whether each state’s 
voters had chosen John McCain or Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential 
election. (See Figure 2-5.) We drew very few explicit conclusions about the 
data and the states’ political character. By letting the readers use the data in 
their own manner, we really left it up to them.
Figure 2-5: Using interactive features to let readers explore data.
A few elements that all effective interactives should have include
	
✓	Intuitive experience
	
✓	Clear organization
	
✓	Wise user control (let them do what they want, within reason)
	
✓	Multiple pages (rather than long scrolling)

33
 Chapter 2: Exploring Infographics
Choosing to create an interactive infographic isn’t the end of the discussion. 
In addition to the research, writing, and design aspects of interactives, you 
must decide which coding language to use to build your interactive.
You have two main options: Flash and HTML5. Using Flash allows you to 
create a, well, “flashier” experience in a shorter timeframe because you need 
to create less code on your own. The biggest drawback to using Flash is that 
it can’t be viewed on iOS devices and older Internet browsers with compat­
ibility issues. HTML5’s biggest drawback is that it takes a great deal of time 
because the coding process is long and complex. You’d be wise to develop 
talent in both options; you may encounter projects that call for either one.
Knowing when an interactive infographic 
is too much
Just because you have a ton of data doesn’t 
mean you should create an interactive info­
graphic. If you’re in the midst of coming up 
with the story and flow of your interactive, and 
it feels rather sparse and superfluous, that’s a 
good sign that you may not need to create an 
interactive after all. A static or even an animated 
infographic may work better for your purposes.
Consider paring down the information to only 
the most critical. What are the five pieces of 
data people need to know to understand the 
story you’re trying to tell? Trim what you’ve 
gathered only to that information.
And if you really believe the data you have gath­
ered is interesting enough and you want people 
to be able to absorb it all, you could create a 
series of infographics rather than jamming too 
much content into one single product.

In This Chapter

▶	Adopting solid design principles
▶	Respecting brand guidelines
▶	Getting your work approved
A

s you’re setting your course as an infographic designer, you’ll want to 
spend some time thinking about your philosophy. You’ll find many differ­
ent philosophical approaches to conceptualizing, building, and refining info­
graphics. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and your path will undoubtedly 
be influenced by your own taste and creative leanings.
For example, you may prefer simple infographics focused on charts and graphs. 
Or you may prefer to take charts and graphs and reinterpret them into a more 
complex visual scheme. Maybe you prefer visuals that are icon-based, or you 
want more elevated artwork.
The good news is that a market and audience exist for virtually any idea you 
can come up with as long you have the building blocks of good information 
and good design. In this chapter, we show you why it’s so important to develop 
a process for gathering information, deciding on a visual game plan, creating a 
design, refining the design, getting a project approved, and then releasing your 
completed infographic to your target audience.
Establishing a Work Process
As you begin your work as an infographic designer, we recommend establish­
ing systems for how you’ll work and the methods you’ll use to create your 
graphics. Of course, no two graphics are identical, so your process won’t be 
the same every time. Still, you’ll find that developing an assembly line–like 

36
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
approach that you repeat with every single project will mean that you can 
focus on the important things. Why do you think basketball players practice 
shooting for hours? When it’s time to launch their shot, they don’t have to 
think about how they make their hands and legs do what they need to do. It’s 
muscle memory.
Your process may look something like Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1: Develop your own creative process.
Process: Not one-size-fits-all
Although there is no single answer for every 
infographic producer when it comes to how the 
work gets done, what’s important is that you 
find a process that works for you — and stick 
to it. Also, don’t fear making changes to that 
process when something clearly isn’t working. 
Maybe getting approvals from your internal edi­
tors is taking too long. If so, address the issue, 
put a new policy in place, and move on.
Remember: Creating a standard approach for 
creating your infographics isn’t meant to 
make your job boring. Rather, it’s meant to free 
you, to allow you to focus on bigger picture 
issues — and those bigger picture issues will 
help build your skills and reputation as an info­
graphics producer.

37
 Chapter 3: Designing Your Approach to Infographics
Deciding on your eventual output
In Chapters 1 and 2, we discuss a myriad of ways in which infographics can 
bring a story to life. So now, assume that you received your assignment from 
a client or editor, or you came up with your own brilliant idea that you will 
pitch to an editor or create for your own website or blog.
Your next big decision is the eventual output for your work: namely, whether 
your infographic will be static or interactive, and whether it will be published 
in print or online. Will you be creating a traditional web-based infographic 
that’s tall and thin? Or is it a magazine graphic, where you’ll have to choose 
whether to lay it out horizontally or vertically? Is the piece interactive or ani­
mated? How much physical space or virtual bandwidth will your client give 
you? Knowing the answers to those questions is crucial to help you determine 
how much time and technical skill you’ll need for your project.
	
✓	Print
	
• Size: Single-column, two- or three-column, or full page
	
• Orientation: Vertical or horizontal
	
• Color: Black-and-white or color
	
• Print finishes: Whether the graphic will be used in a newspaper, 
magazine, or marketing brochure
	
✓	Static online
	
• Size: Usually width in pixels
	
	Check the specifications of any site or host that will be publishing 
your infographic.
	
• Orientation: Usually vertical, but can be horizontal
	
✓	Interactive online
	
• Size: Pixels are the standard measurement
	
	Specific requirements will vary by website.
	
• Coding language: Flash versus HTML and CSS
	
	Flash may be on its way out because of technical difficulties for iOS 
devices.
	
✓	Animated
	
• Size
	
	Don’t pile on too many features in an animated infographic because 
big files load slowly and perform poorly.
	
• File type: QuickTime, GIF, and so on

38
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
File size matters
Most infographics you create will be JPEG files, which can be easily shared 
via social media and e-mail. An optimal file size for easy sharing is about 1MB. 
This size allows the artwork and text to be crisp and clear without making 
the website hosting the infographic load too slowly.
If you expect your graphic to be widely viewed on mobile devices, aim for 
smaller than 1MB. Remember that mobile users pay for their bandwidth and 
often don’t have optimal download speeds. That being said, you must still 
make sure that your graphic is legible, so you may want to explore alterna­
tives to using one large graphic — perhaps you can tell your story in three 
smaller ones.
Social media concerns
With Facebook’s relatively frequent redesigns, you need to keep current on 
any changes made to its image specifications. You may want to create a pre­
view image for posting to Facebook so the infographic appears more easily in 
followers’ feeds. The same holds true for other social media channels, such 
as Twitter and Pinterest.
Gathering data
With a plan in hand for your project, you’ll begin to map out your story by gath­
ering data. At the core of every infographic is data — that’s the “info(rmation)” 
part of “info-graphic” — so gathering that information must be a crucial part of 
your process. Even if it isn’t the very first step (after all, you might think of an 
idea before you know what information is out there), information-gathering is 
always one of the first steps.
	
Good data serves as the foundation for everything to come after. If your data 
isn’t accurate, your infographic won’t be successful.
Just as there’s no one way to approach infographics, there’s no single way to 
gather data. You could
	
✓	Explore databases.
	
	Many government agencies and universities have publicly accessible 
databases.
	
✓	Examine tax records.
	
	Call or visit a township assessor’s office.
	
✓	Search historical records.
	
	Try a university library or county historical society.
www.allitebooks.com

39
 Chapter 3: Designing Your Approach to Infographics
	
✓	Conduct in-person research or interviews.
	
	Get out of the office and meet people.
	
✓	Read books, maps, and almanacs.
	
	Online or paper versions are great.
	
✓	Browse the Internet.
	
We discuss information-gathering in more depth in Chapter 5.
Also on your docket are the ways to keep track of your data: old-school note­
book, Microsoft Word file, spreadsheet program? All are viable options, depend­
ing on your work style and the type of research involved. For example, data 
tracked over several years works well in a spreadsheet. If you’re interviewing 
someone to get your data, take a practice run to see whether you prefer typing 
notes into a Word file or jotting them down in a notebook.
	
While you’re researching, keep close track of the sources you use. Any 
facts that make it into your final infographic should be attributed, most 
likely in a footnote at the base of your graphic. As long as you properly 
attribute, you won’t need to seek specific permission to use publicly avail­
able information.
Create narrative and flow
Remember that infographics tell a story. We talk about visual storytelling 
in Chapter 1, and you’ll see more evidence of the power of a cohesive story 
throughout the book. For now, as we help you establish your process, run 
through an example of how your graphic will flow, both textually and artistically.
Say it’s Olympics season. A young figure skater just captured the gold medal 
on the strength of her triple-axel jumps. You design an infographic that 
explains a triple axel.
A logical narrative would deconstruct the jump, from the skater’s first moment 
to the last. You would design art that shows each step, making sure the story 
and the visuals are in sync. Perhaps your graphic begins with some introduc­
tory text about the skater, but after that, stick closely to the narrative of this 
graphic — that gold-medal jump.
Develop and refine your visual plan
Starting with a blank canvas can prove intimidating. Hopefully, you won’t really 
have to do that. You’ve probably been mulling over some visual ideas in your 
mind as you compiled your data. Having an idea and translating it into a com­
pleted piece of work are, of course, very different prospects.

40
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
Various methods can help you along the way to ensure that the vision you have 
in your mind is carried through to the final product, whether you yourself are 
creating the design or you’re working with someone else to complete it. We rely 
on wireframes and mood boards.
Working with wireframes
Regardless of whether you or someone else will physically create the design, 
it’s still vital to produce a wireframe, which is a rough sketch that shows 
the layout and general design of your infographic. Depending on whether 
you’re creating the infographic for yourself or a client, it may also be part 
of a formal approval process. (Read about wireframes in more detail in 
Chapter 7.)
Wireframes help people imagine what the finished product will look like — 
which helps you as well as your client. For instance, you might have a grand 
visual idea, but after you start creating your wireframe, you realize that you 
have too much content (or not enough) to make it work.
Depending upon your client and/or your individual process, your wireframe 
may be quite simple and general. Say you’re creating a timeline of advances 
in medicine. Your wireframe could be basic, like Figure 3-2, without artwork, 
colors, or particular fonts.
Figure 3-2: Creating a simple wireframe for an infographic.
Or, your wireframe could be more developed, involving some of the specific 
elements you intend to use in the finished product, such as the colors you’re 
proposing to use. See Figure 3-3.

41
 Chapter 3: Designing Your Approach to Infographics
You can further develop your wireframe by including imagery in the style of 
what you intend to use in the finished product — something like Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-3: Providing more details in a wireframe.
Figure 3-4: Adding simple artwork to a wireframe.
Each more-developed wireframe example gives a good idea of the visual 
approach. The level of detail you use in a wireframe should match your cli­
ent’s specifications and skill. A client (or boss) who has experience in visu­
alizing artistic concepts may want only the most basic wireframe. Those 
who are not as adept at visualizing concepts may require a more detailed 
wireframe.

42
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
	
If your client doesn’t specify how detailed the wireframe should be, we rec­
ommend taking a middle-of-the road approach, so as to provide enough 
details to proceed but not lock into an official design.
Working with mood boards
Think of a mood board for an infographic like a Pinterest board. Say you’re 
redecorating your living room. You might pin images of furniture, paint 
swatches, lamps, rugs, and accessories. The images would provide inspira­
tion while you shop for the room. A mood board for an infographic can have 
the very same effect, providing inspiration and answers for you as you ask 
yourself the basics:
What colors should I use? What visual style should I use? What fonts would 
be appropriate? What sort of finishing touches could I use?
	
Inspiration can come from anywhere — other infographics, print design, TV 
commercials, fine art — so never close yourself off to inspiration. Keep an 
open mind.
Whether you share your mood board with your clients is up to you and will 
most likely be decided by the same measures you use to determine what type 
of wireframe to provide: Are they creative thinkers? Do they even want a high 
level of involvement? If not, a mood board can be your own little source of 
inspiration.
Build artwork and visuals
The most difficult — and most important — part of your process is crafting 
the visuals. Good design looks easy but never is.
The design process should take the lion’s share of the time allocated to the 
project. If you spend a week coming up with the content, spend two weeks on 
the design. A poor translation of solid content won’t get much traction.
We spend a lot more time discussing design, both later in this chapter and in 
all of Part III of this book. For the moment, just know that it will be the big­
gest expenditure of your time, and it will ultimately become your professional 
signature, so it’s got to be good.
Refine artwork and ensure accuracy
When your research and design work is done, you’ll combine them into an 
infographic that should roughly mirror the plan you made when you built 
your wireframe. Remember, though, that a wireframe is really just a draft. 
Now is the time to take a critical look at your work. If your artwork needs 

43
 Chapter 3: Designing Your Approach to Infographics
changes, go ahead and make them. If your data has any gaps or mistakes, fix 
them. You may alter your infographic dozens of times before handing it in for 
approval, and that’s fine — it’s all part of the process.
	
Leave yourself enough time to make any edits, both large and small. Most 
people aren’t very good at self-editing, and that goes for designers, too. Get 
as many pairs of eyes on the work as possible, and never take any edits 
personally.
Getting your project approved
Securing approval for your work is an important step that we visit several 
times in the course of this book. In this step, you can expect to work with a 
variety of people, including art directors, marketing directors, publications 
managers, and sometimes even the top executive at the company you’re 
working for.
Ask your contacts to explain the process you will have to follow. Chances 
are that it will vary from one client to the next. Some clients make changes 
in many incremental steps; others may ask for one extensive round of 
changes.
	
The changes you may have to make could include content, design, or both. 
Keep an open mind and be prepared to talk through all requests. No matter 
what processes you set up for yourself, you’ll need to remain flexible enough 
to work with any and all clients.
Sharing your creation with your audience
After you perfect the design (that’s possible, right?), it’s time to release your 
work to your audience. This could be as simple as tweeting it or sharing it on 
your Facebook page, or as complex as having a large-format poster printed at 
a professional shop.
In the case of interactive or animated infographics, you also often must con­
tend with unforeseen technical issues — errors hidden in code or incompat­
ibility with Internet browsers.
In today’s fast-paced, web-dominated media landscape, a goal of almost every 
infographic producer is for the piece to become viral. In other words, you 
want it to be shared around the Internet. We discuss this in greater detail in 
Chapter 13. A dream scenario could go something like Figure 3-5.
We’ll come back to this idea throughout the book. For now, start thinking 
about the ways in which you want to transmit your graphic to the world.

Assembling the Tools of the Trade
All the smart processes in the world won’t help much if you don’t have the 
proper tools in place to take advantage of them. Here’s what you should con­
sider as you make sure your technology, staff, and business relationships are 
in good working order.
Lining up your technology tools
The most important aspects of technology for infographic designers are design 
programs and tools. Think of it this way: You never want a picture in your 
head to be something you can’t re-create because you don’t have the digital 
tools you need to make it happen. This is a digital world, and you can’t rely on 
analog art tools like pens and sketchpads if you want to be successful in that 
digital landscape.

45
 Chapter 3: Designing Your Approach to Infographics
Here are some examples of the tools that you may want to gather. You 
don’t need all of these to get started as an infographic designer, but if 
you’ll be working with infographics on a regular basis, start accumulating 
the following:
	
✓	A really good computer
	
✓	Reliable Internet access
	
	There’s nothing worse than completing a project, and then having tech­
nical trouble transmitting it to a client or editor. Chances are that you’ll 
be relying heavily on the Internet for everything from research to shar­
ing work with colleagues to publishing your infographic, so make sure 
your connection is solid.
	
✓	A good-quality monitor
	
	Make sure your monitor is big enough to allow you to see your work 
in detail. Screen sizes tend to range from 15" to 30" inches (measured 
diagonally). Aim for 24" or bigger. Check out resolution numbers as well; 
these are improving all the time, and some monitors are as clear as high-
definition TV.
	
✓	Up-to-date graphic design software, such as Adobe Illustrator and 
Photoshop.
	
✓	Digital illustrating tools
	
	Illustrator and Photoshop dominate the category, but less-expensive 
options such as Corel’s Painter and Intaglio for the Mac are good ways to 
start dabbling.
	
✓	Interactive coding programs
	
	You don’t need to become a full-time coder to develop infographics. 
As more and more infographics showcase interactive features, though, 
it’s a terrific idea to develop some basic skills in HTML and CSS. One 
cool way to do so is through Code Avengers, a free tutorial (www.
codeavengers.com).
Mac or PC?
Macintosh computers, in their early days, 
were a clear favorite with graphic designers, 
who loved their reliability, ease of use, and 
attractive display. The differences between 
Macs and PCs have narrowed considerably, 
though.
Many infographic designers will take a strong 
stance in favor of a Mac or PC. We won’t. It really 
comes down to personal preference and acces­
sibility. Macs are more expensive. The programs 
you run are probably more important than the 
computer you use.

46
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
Design tools aren’t the only technology considerations to keep in mind. If 
enough work comes your way, you’ll need a system for keeping track of docu­
ments and files both internally and for your clients. Whether you use a free 
tool like Google or paid software like Basecamp (https://basecamp.com, 
a project management system) for managing content, creating a workflow 
is vital.
Gathering a work force
Nobody can do everything alone. Many hands touch an infographic during 
the process, including
	
✓	Researchers
	
✓	Writers
	
✓	Editors
	
✓	Designers
	
✓	Illustrators
	
✓	Interactive developers
	
✓	Publicists
Many websites and media concerns have their own publicists, who work to 
draw attention to certain stories. Some may not be familiar with infographics, 
but as the genre becomes more and more popular, they could start capturing 
more attention from publicists.
Each person plays a different role — and a person may play more than one — 
but infographic development is truly a team sport. If you know you have a weak­
ness in one of these areas, it may benefit you to hire someone to handle those 
aspects of infographic design. You can allot a certain percentage of your fee to 
the others that help you.
	
Assembling a team can pay big dividends over time because a strong team can 
help you avoid costly revisions and polish your reputation as a professional.
Building professional relationships
A huge part of creating viral content is establishing and developing relation­
ships with bloggers, thought leaders, business peers, reporters, and content 
editors. Targeting your infographics to blogs and news sites that specialize in 
the information you’re showcasing can help you build relationships and can 
also help you get your work published and shared.
If, say, you want to develop a relationship with tech bloggers, work to 
become an expert in one or two areas of technology and create infographics 
on those topics. This allows you to promote yourself as an expert in the area 

47
 Chapter 3: Designing Your Approach to Infographics
and encourage the blog to begin to see you as a partner in creating visual 
content.
Again, we’ll look more closely at how to get your work published later in the 
book. (See Part IV.) For now, just start thinking about where you’d like to see 
your work featured. Become a diligent reader of those websites or publica­
tions so you can see what they’ve published — and start polishing your ideas 
for future content.
Developing Design Principles
Good design is good design. This applies to graphic design, newspapers, and 
even interior design. There are several principles that you should know (and 
know when to bend).
Balance
Adequate balance gives your infographic visual stability, preventing one ele­
ment from dominating the visual and inappropriately pulling readers’ focus. 
It keeps the design from being top- or bottom-heavy or skewing to one side or 
the other.
A terrific rule of thumb for creating a balanced infographic is to divide your 
page into thirds, using a grid, as shown in Figure 3-6. The thirds can go from 
left to right, or from top to bottom. Either way, your dominant element — the 
part of the graphic that illustrates your main idea — should occupy about 
two-thirds of your design.
Figure 3-6: Balancing visual elements improves the look of your infographic.

48
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
Experimenting with balance
There’s more than one way to create a visually appealing infographic. Refer 
again to the three examples in Figure 3-6. The first features only three distinct 
art elements: one dominant chart at the top left, a smaller art element at the 
top right, and a fairly large element anchoring the bottom.
The second has six parts, so it is a bit more complex, but still nicely balanced 
and quite clear. Again, it has one visually dominant element. To unite the rest 
of the design, use spacing, subheads (generally a word or two that leads into 
a new section) or decks (a sentence or two that adds information), and color 
to guide the viewer through the narrative.
The third layout allows the dominant element to take up the entire top of the 
graphic. This might be a good choice if the artwork is very appealing, or if 
the story is really compelling. Supporting information takes a back seat, at 
the bottom of the infographic.
Any of these three layouts would work really well. The nature of the data and 
the character of the illustrations will determine which layout works best for 
your infographic.
Making the most of white space
“White space” is a really important element of design that can help you 
achieve balance in your infographics. First off, white space isn’t always 
white — it’s just the name for the open space between art and text elements.
White space allows the eye to take a break between one part of your info­
graphic and the next. It ensures that your graphic is clear and legible. You 
should build some white space into your design.
	
Don’t just slam together your artistic elements and let the gaps serve as your 
white space.
Figure 3-7 shows how random white space can actually damage the balance 
of an infographic. This graphic would be improved by bringing the smaller art 
elements into proportion with each other, and creating more equal amounts 
of white space between them all.
Consider the number and type of illustrations and charts you’re showing, and 
think about their content as well. You probably don’t want all your supporting 
elements to be line charts because that would be boring. You don’t want to 
create a hodgepodge of data visualization, either, because that can dilute your 
message. Experiment with forms that will support your dominant element 
without distracting from it.

Hierarchy
Creating hierarchy in visual elements helps readers know where to look for 
the most important information. This means establishing size and treatment 
for various elements:
	
✓	Main titles
	
	These will be the largest font size you use.
	
✓	Subtitles
	
	These will probably be the same font, or sometimes a different treat­
ment of the same font; for example, Times New Roman in bold for the 
headline and without bold for the subtitles. They will be in a smaller 
font size.
	
✓	Instructions
	
	These aren’t always in the form of text; some infographics show direc­
tion with arrows or other visual elements. Sometimes, though, you may 
guide a reader to the next section of your infographic with a text cue or 
transition, such as, “Then” or “As a result.” You may want to give this the 
same font as a subtitle, or you may opt for something subtly different.

50
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
	
✓	Body text
	
	This will often differ from the text used in the main title and subtitle. It 
will be smaller, but make sure it’s not too small to be legible.
	
✓	Interactive text
	
	Check with your art director or your client contact. Many publications 
use a slightly different font for interactive text, such as URLs.
	
✓	Chart labels
	
	These may be the same size as body text, but they are often a different 
font.
	
✓	Notes/sources
	
	Notes and sources are probably your smallest typeface. Create unity by 
making them the same as another element.
	
Viewers should never have to guess at what to look at next. And in the case 
of interactive infographics, they should have clear instructions about where 
to click and what to do.
Unity
Bringing the visual elements together creates a sense of unity. When all the 
pieces fall into place, the design will feel as if everything was meant to be 
where it is. This is easier to achieve when one person creates every visual 
element, but depending on the particular visual treatment, one person may 
create the artwork, and another person complete the design.
With different collaborators, the artists must communicate effectively about 
the style of the artwork as well as the colors and fonts being used so that ele­
ments don’t clash with each other.
Proportion
Visual hierarchy is important to the design principles of your infographic, but 
information integrity is also important. Be sure to consider the importance of 
various pieces of data to avoid creating misleading impressions in viewers’ 
minds. For example, if you’re doing an infographic on leading home run hit­
ters in Major League Baseball, your charts on hits and slugging percentage 
ought to be more dominant than stats on those players’ errors.
	
Avoid placing unrelated charts too close together. Not only could readers be 
confused as to why the charts are next to each other, but they could assume 
they are on the same scale — which they may not be.

51
 Chapter 3: Designing Your Approach to Infographics
Color
Each topic is different. A piece about politics may require more subdued colors, 
while something related to entertainment could call for a bright scheme. You 
may also wish to create a preferred color palette for your infographics (so long 
as your client doesn’t have other ideas) that create an identity for your pieces. 
This is fun and easy to do with a mood board, as we discuss earlier.
	
Regardless of your approach to color, there’s no doubt that color is possibly 
the most powerful way to set a mood.
Fonts
Include too few typefaces, and your infographic could feel boring. Include 
too many, and you run the risk of making it look like a ransom note. A general 
guideline is to use no more than three typefaces in your design.
We talk more about fonts in Chapter 7. For now, here are some basic things to 
keep in mind.
First of all, make sure the font you choose is readable. This sounds like an obvi­
ous rule, but as you experiment with different typefaces, you will discover that 
some fonts are most legible in large sizes, but become muddled or crowded 
in smaller point sizes. Check your fonts both on the computer screen and on 
paper because sometimes what looks great onscreen doesn’t translate as well 
to print documents.
Make the most of the fonts that come with your computer and the software 
you’ve already purchased. For example, the latest version of Adobe Illustrator 
comes with about 90 fonts. Adobe also sells add-on sets that could add dozens 
more fonts to your toolbox. Even Microsoft Word has dozens of fonts to 
choose from.
After you own these programs, you can use the fonts in any way you like — for 
personal projects, or for work that you intend to sell, like your infographic.
But if you actually read your End User License Agreement, you’ll discover 
that what you can’t do is give that font away to anyone else. As an infographic 
designer, a good way to prevent anyone from copying your font is to embed it in 
your work. We talk some about the technical aspect of embedding in Chapter 4. 
For now, just know that it’s a way to transmit and publish your file without leav­
ing the font accessible to others who might snatch it up for their own use.

52
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
And, a word on cost. The fonts that come with your software program 
certainly aren’t free, but when you bought the program, you bought those 
fonts. If you want to add to your collection by purchasing fonts individually 
from font designers or various design websites, you may pay $25 to $100 
per font. Is it really worth getting your heart set on one of these? It’s also 
possible that the designer hasn’t cleared the font for commercial use, which 
could land you in legal trouble.
	
Certainly, if your client wants an exclusive font, you must use it, but you may 
be able to include it in your bill for the project. Ask about this when you’re 
negotiating your pay.
Respecting Brand Guidelines
Working with clients will inevitably mean interpreting and following their 
brand guidelines and, occasionally, trying to stretch those guidelines. Keep 
your own branding guidelines in mind as well.
Consult brand guidelines to give you a sense of the overall corporate look 
and feel. Some companies will want to create a sense of elegance; others will 
be most comfortable with a sense of whimsy. Exploring brand guidelines can 
help determine which type of client you are working with.
Because your client will almost certainly want your work to fit in with 
their corporate identity, here is some of the terminology you’re likely to 
encounter. Any or all of these characteristics may be addressed in brand 
guidelines:
	
✓	Equity: The power a company derives from having a well-known name
	
✓	Experience: Whether your company is an established powerhouse, or a 
cool new kid
	
✓	Values: Whether your company has an affiliation with a particular social 
issue, such as the environment
	
✓	Personality: Young and fun, or serious and buttoned-down
	
✓	Positioning: Market dominance
	
✓	Vision: Focused on the future
	
✓	Tone of voice: Serious, humorous, snarky
	
✓	Strategy: Growth potential
Several areas of design should be covered in branding guidelines. Here’s a 
look at what you can expect in terms of fonts, colors, and logos.

53
 Chapter 3: Designing Your Approach to Infographics
Using recommended fonts
If your client has brand guidelines, font usage will be one of the most impor­
tant. Remember that your clients are used to seeing documents and com­
munication with particular fonts. Seeing things outside that font can be 
off-putting.
Pay attention not only to the font families preferred but to the specific 
styles of font preferred. You may want to see publications the client has 
approved in the past to help guide you in usage of the client’s preferred 
typefaces.
In the event you don’t have access to the client’s preferred fonts, you may 
ask the client to send the fonts for your usage or to reimburse you for pur­
chasing them.
Working with logos
Your client also should provide you with logos to use in the infographic. You 
will need high-resolution files of about 300 dpi (dots per inch) to ensure that 
the logo reproduces well in various sizes and in various formats. Vector-
based files are preferred.
Some clients will allow creative usage of their logos, but this is a risky pros­
pect because most companies are protective of their logos, and copyright 
rules may forbid altering the logo. Given that logos are the most identifiable 
visual element for most companies, it’s not hard to understand why compa­
nies generally want to maintain their integrity.
Working with colors
Many clients will allow a great deal of leeway in the colors used in an info­
graphic. This can allow you to set your work apart from other artists your 
client may have hired. If much of a client’s previous graphic material sticks 
to a monotonous color palette, maybe you could try something different. 
Pushing the limits could set you apart, especially if you can come up with a 
color scheme that really appeals to the client.
However, you may not want to stray too far from the guidelines they set 
forth. Just like with fonts, your client is probably accustomed to seeing 
certain colors, and seeing those familiar colors in your work may make 
the piece feel more comfortable for the client. Others simply stick to very 
specific choices to build up their brand identity, and we as designers must 
always respect that.

54
Part I: Getting Started with Infographics 
Using copy guidelines
Many companies will expect certain copy usage guidelines. Common copy 
stylebooks you’ll encounter include Associated Press, APA, The Chicago 
Manual of Style, and MLA. When in doubt, check a Merriam-Webster diction­
ary or its online incarnation, www.merriam-webster.com.
Outlining the Approval Process
An integral part of working with clients is having your work approved. If you’ve 
followed the basic steps we outline here, the process should be smooth. Still, 
it’s critical that you give your clients adequate time and opportunities to make 
their wishes and opinions known.
The approval process may look something like Figure 3-8.

At this point, you will most likely be asked to make several rounds of changes. 
Depending on how many people you’re reporting to, and how well your info­
graphic meets their needs, this process can be quick and painless or pains­
takingly slow.
	
Be polite, and communicate clearly.
After you secure full client approval, it’s time to publish!
	
Whatever your specific process, make sure that you follow it each time and 
that you communicate the steps to everyone involved — writers, designers, 
clients. There should be no guesswork involved on either side.
We recommend sending your client a schedule at the beginning of the pro­
cess. It could look something like this, depending on your client’s deadline 
and your own scheduling needs:

Although you might be tempted to give clients a chance to impose their own 
schedule, this inevitably leads clients to ask for shorter timeframes. We rec­
ommend resisting this temptation unless you have a very good reason to do 
otherwise. You need to give yourself every opportunity to make the work as 
creative and powerful as possible, and cutting time at any stage of the pro­
cess can endanger that.

efore you fire up Adobe Creative Suite — the package of graphic design 
and web development apps that you’ll probably use as you design 
infographics — you need to know what your graphic is about and who your 
audience is. Those factors largely determine what information you include as 
well as how you present it. The goal, of course, is to make your infographic 
as effective as possible. After all, with all the blood, sweat, and tears we 
know you put into each piece — whether it’s a graphic on school lunches in 
Albuquerque or mating habits of the buffy tufted-ear marmoset — you want 
it to have maximum impact. You want your audience, be it ten or ten million, 
to stare rapt and wide-eyed as they suddenly understand New Mexico school 
lunches or the buffy tufted-ear marmoset as they never have before.
Knowing what you want to say with your infographic and how to say it clearly 
and succinctly requires no mystical ability. It’s mostly a matter of taking a 
moment to actually think it through. Consider looking at a map to find the 
shortest, most direct route from point A to point B. Even if you know gener­
ally which direction you’re headed, you can save a lot of time and effort if you 
determine where you’re going before you start your trip.
This chapter delves into what you need to consider as you plan the route to 
your goal of an amazing and effective infographic. Specifically, we discuss 
how to precisely define and focus your infographic as well as what it means 
to target your intended audience, and then we cover the technical details of 
printing specs and web dimensions.

Part II: Starting with Data 
Determining Your Infographic’s Thesis
Every infographic needs a thesis, which is the point you’re trying to make 
with your infographic. It’s what your graphic, at its core, is about.
Generally speaking, infographics fall into the following camps: 
	
✓	Show how to do something or how something works: Visuals can be 
invaluable when demonstrating the steps of a process, whether it’s making 
a Caesar salad or showing how a combustion engine works. These graph­
ics use images to help the reader understand complicated multistep pro­
cesses. You can think of every instruction manual as an infographic.
	
	The point of the how-to type of infographic is fairly straightforward: to 
demonstrate a process. This type of infographic involves more questions 
and often more creative thinking, which is why this chapter focuses on 
how-to infographics.
	
✓	Illustrate a point: Information and statistics form the foundation of these 
infographics. Their purpose is essentially to illustrate a point with facts.
	
✓	Motivate you to act: A call to action urges the reader or viewer to do 
something.
Think of the thesis of your infographic as the argument it’s trying to make. 
For your infographic to argue effectively, it has to stay focused, or it won’t 
make an impact on the reader. To maintain focus, pin down your thesis as 
concretely as possible: You should be able to state it in a single sentence. 
Anything longer is likely overly complicated, which can quickly lead to an 
unfocused infographic.
Ideally, you know what your thesis is right from the start. But if you’re not 
sure, two simple tips can help you formulate your thesis:
	
✓	Ask yourself the five W’s: who, what, when, where, why. Answering 
how each relates to the point you’re trying to make can help you work 
out what’s important and what you need your infographic to convey.
	
✓	Put your infographic’s purpose into words. Just because you’re work­
ing in a visual medium doesn’t mean you shouldn’t write things out. Try 
writing a headline or a one-sentence summary of your infographic. Doing 
so will force you to put your thoughts into concrete terms and define the 
relationships between the elements in your graphic.
	
The underlying assumption here is that you might truly not know exactly what 
your infographic is about — and that can happen more often than you might 
think, particularly if you’re creating a graphic for a client who has only a 
vague idea of what he wants.

61
 Chapter 4: Informing Yourself
Why spend so much time hammering out a thesis? Without one, your graphic 
may become convoluted and fail at its job of helping the reader understand — 
perhaps filling space with data that’s interesting but not directly relevant.
Here’s an example. Say you’re working on a graphic with this thesis:
Health issues caused by hospital mistakes are rising.
Say you find some interesting data showing that hospitals are closing in record 
numbers across the country. So, should you include that factoid? Well, unless 
you can also find a clear, proven link between hospital mistakes and hospital 
closures, the latter doesn’t belong in your infographic. Our point: Add too 
much unnecessary information, and your point becomes unclear.
After you define your thesis, the next step is to figure out how to put your 
data, visuals, and text together into an actual infographic that’s as informative 
and compelling as possible.
Thinking of the infographic’s main points
Your thesis is the argument you’re making. The data in your graphic is the 
evidence you present in support of that argument. You can also use data that 
provides the reader with context and a deeper understanding of your thesis 
to enrich your argument.
To achieve that goal, all the data you present has to relate to your thesis in 
a concrete way. Data that loosely centers on a theme isn’t quite enough. A 
reader will recognize it for what it is: disjointed and unfocused information 
with no ultimate goal in mind.
As you think of the data you want to present, consider the points we describe 
in this section. The first is essential. The rest are elements to think about if 
you have remaining space to work in and want to elaborate on your thesis 
with data that adds depth and richness to your argument.
Using data to illustrate your thesis
Figure out what data directly proves your argument, which (after all) is the 
cornerstone of your infographic. For example, an infographic on the rising 
popularity of tofu in Europe should include stats showing that sales or con­
sumption of tofu have gone up. Or, an infographic exploring the obscure 
subcultures that exist around online games might be composed entirely of 
examples and explanations of these subcultures.
Adding details to flesh out the main point
Other data you will likely want to include comprises anything that explains 
your thesis. This data provides your readers with context and enriches their 
understanding of the topic. Is tofu booming in Europe because vegetarianism 

62
Part II: Starting with Data 
is becoming more popular? Has a bumper year for soy beans made the crop 
suddenly inexpensive? As a journalist, it’s always good to ask, “Why?”
	
Make sure there’s a solid link between the data and your thesis. Avoid 
coincidence.
Looking for implications of your thesis
If your thesis has significant consequences, showing what they are helps illus­
trate why the point you’re making is important. Say your graphic centers on 
a city’s new subway system, and as a result of that system, people are driving 
less, and carbon emissions have fallen 20 percent. If it’s relevant to your overall 
thesis, that information can demonstrate why the issue is worth the attention.
	
You should have already answered the “Why?” Answering the remaining 
W’s — who, what, when, and where — can provide valuable context to your 
reader. Not every graphic needs to answer all these questions, but knowing 
the answers in your mind can help you clearly present your information and 
can also add another layer of interest to your infographic.
Correlation and causation
A well-known saying in the fields of science 
and statistics goes like this: Correlation does 
not imply causation. In other words, just 
because two events or trends occur together 
doesn’t mean that one is the cause of the other.
Keep this in mind as you determine what to 
include in your infographic. Say you have two 
sets of data that seem linked. For example, one 
set shows that obesity is on the rise in a par­
ticular city, and another shows that healthcare 
costs are also going up in that city. The obvious 
conclusion one might draw is that the increase 
in obesity is pushing up the cost of healthcare, 
but the real reason may be more complicated 
than that. Perhaps healthcare costs have been 
rising in that area for years, and obesity is but 
one relatively insignificant factor in the trend. 
Being clear and accurate with your data in a 
situation like this is of the utmost importance.
So how do you verify a link between two data 
sets? Your own research may be enough, but if 
it isn’t or if you have questions, get directly in 
touch with the persons or group that compiled 
the statistics. Ask them whether they have 
any idea what the cause is for the trend. They 
may have a very clear idea, or they may have 
only educated guesses. Talking with an expert 
should help you determine whether you can 
say outright that something is a cause or effect, 
or if you should put it forward your premise as 
only a suggested possibility.
The best way to make these distinctions clear 
is through your language. A text box and a few 
words can be enough to clarify something that 
might otherwise be misleading to a reader. And 
if your source tells you they only think there’s 
a link — but really aren’t certain — you can say 
that. Use language such as “experts believe” 
or “evidence suggests” that fits the situation. 
And don’t worry that you’re being noncommittal 
or wishy-washy; it’s being accurate.

 Chapter 4: Informing Yourself
Using extra information wisely
Sometimes the most interesting information doesn’t explain your thesis at 
all but acts as an engrossing subtopic or tangent. An infographic on how a 
disease works might delve into the latest treatment options, for instance. 
You might also find some obscure bit of data that isn’t necessarily of great 
consequence but is still just plain fun or fascinating. Maybe the disease got 
its name from some bizarre reason that merits a small space in your graphic. 
There’s nothing wrong with including that sort of information, especially if 
you know it will delight your readers. Just use your judgment and consider 
whether it will make your infographic better or detract from your point.
	
As you construct your graphic, periodically ask yourself whether each ele­
ment relates to your thesis in a concrete way and also whether it adds value. 
If you find the answer is “no” with any element, cut it.
Organizing your information
The goal of your graphic is to convey information. To do that effectively, you 
need to plan your structure accordingly. Information works best in a hierarchy. 
The structure guides the reader, letting him know the main points as well as 
what information is supplementary. Think of this from a reader’s viewpoint. If 
everything on the page is given equal treatment (see Figure 4-1), where should 
the reader start? A lot of data in your graphic can come across as information 
overload — and that feeling is more likely to alienate readers than draw them.
Figure 4-1: A graphic with no distinction among icons, statistics, and text.

64
Part II: Starting with Data 
	
An infographic, like a story, should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. 
The beginning is where your readers’ eyes go when they first look at the 
page. If you’re doing your infographic as a single page, with a chart that’s 
larger than all the rest and contains an assortment of bright colors, that’s 
where the readers’ eyes are headed. That spot — the focal point of your 
graphic — should contain the most critical information.
From there, decide where you want your readers’ eyes go next. Steer them to 
the next most important piece of information. Figure 4-2 actually guides the 
reader from a clear starting point to the conclusion with the help of subhead­
ings and visuals along the way.
Figure 4-2: Guide the reader through the information clearly.

65
 Chapter 4: Informing Yourself
On that note, here are a few points to consider as you determine how you 
want to structure your information:
	
✓	Real estate: How much space you devote to a graphic element should 
match its importance. The data proving your thesis should get a rela­
tively large amount of space. On the other hand, relatively insignificant 
data that requires a large map to display might be best reworked into a 
smaller element or even omitted.
	
✓	Location: People generally read from top to bottom, so elements at the 
top of the page tend to attract eyes first. This is true whether you’re 
reading in print or online; however, online reading habits hew to an even 
tighter visual frame. Researchers have found what they call a Google 
golden triangle, which describes how users read all the way through 
the search result at the top of the page but then read a bit less of every 
search result below it, resulting in a rough triangle of material that is 
thoroughly read. The Google golden triangle is something to keep in 
mind as you’re designing.
	
	Think about where to put your focal point, and how you want the graphic 
to flow into the other data you’re including.
	
	That said, size can still trump location, meaning that an exceptionally 
large element at the bottom of the page might be where the reader’s gaze 
goes first.
	
✓	Colors: Bright colors draw attention, as do graphical elements that employ 
several colors instead of being monochromatic. We don’t recommend that 
your main chart should be a neon collage visible from space, but consider 
where your readers’ eyes will go first — and where you want them to go 
from there.
	
The best infographics build a narrative in much the same way a story does, 
starting with a premise and then revealing something new at each turn. To a 
large degree, you can decide how your story unfolds by directing the readers’ 
eyes to where you want them to go next.
At the end of this chapter, we discuss printing or publishing your graphics 
according to size specifications. The size of your graphic affects the ease of 
publishing it, so keep size in mind as you map out your visual story.
Calling out a call-to-action
The call-to-action infographic is another type of graphic that partially illus­
trates a point, but also has a larger job: to incite readers to action. A visual 
representation of a problem can make the problem feel more understand­
able and immediate than words alone, which is why nonprofit agencies and 

66
Part II: Starting with Data 
charities use these types of graphics frequently to solicit donations or get 
people involved in their cause.
Because the underlying goal of a call-to-action infographic is to get people to 
act, the information you select and how you organize it needs to be tailored 
to that purpose. That makes the call-to-action graphic slightly different than 
graphics created, say, to go with a newspaper article. Where the thesis of a 
news graphic might be implied but not stated outright, the thesis of a call-
to-action infographic will usually be spelled out prominently. A strong call-
to-action infographic also tends to dispense with nuance in favor of a blunt, 
direct approach.
In this section, we give you a few guidelines for creating an effective call-to-
action infographic.
Your call-to-action is your focal point
Earlier in this chapter, we state that your thesis should be the focus of your 
infographic. Forget that for a minute. In a call-to-action infographic, you’ll 
likely want the appeal to the reader to be the center of attention. The first 
place your readers’ eyes should go is to the call that directs them to act. 
Think of it this way: If you have your readers’ eyes for only a second, you 
want the message they walk away with to be, “Go! Act!”
The data you present now falls into more of a supporting role: It helps con­
vince the reader to act. The design elements we mention earlier — real estate, 
location, and colors — are very important as you design your call-to-action 
and any charts you’re including.
Maximize your impact with minimum information
A call-to-action infographic needs to convey its message as quickly and briefly 
as possible.
	
The point, again, isn’t to provide a nuanced view of a complex topic, but to 
prompt the reader to act.
As an example, say you have a client combatting poverty in a particular city, 
and you have a dataset showing the gradual increase over the past 20 years 
in that city’s poverty rate. You could show that rate with a fever line — a line 
that charts the change in a single value over time. We show a fever line on the 
left in Figure 4-3. Or you could create a full bar chart, but that’s not ideal for 
this information because the gradual increase won’t look dramatic.

67
 Chapter 4: Informing Yourself
Figure 4-3: Heighten the impact of a chart by focusing on the end points of your data.
The best option for this graphic is using a bar chart with just two bars (shown 
on the right in Figure 4-3): the first showing the percentage of the population 
living in poverty for the first year of the dataset, and the second showing the 
same population in the last year of the dataset. (You may want to experiment 
with your visuals to see which approach is most effective in your situation.) 
The rise in poverty will be stark and instantly apparent, making the need to 
act more urgent. You can see the difference between the two approaches 
in Figure 4-3, and you achieve that impact by actually cutting all the data in 
between and using visuals to emphasize the change.
Favor individual stories over statistics
Research shows that appealing to people’s emotions rather than their intel­
lects is more effective in getting them to act, and stories about individuals 
tap into readers’ emotions more powerfully than statistics. The reason is 
that statistics are abstract. They deal with people and events en masse. But 
individuals, including the ones you’re trying to incite to action, don’t identify 
with whole populations: They identify with other individuals.
The point is particularly apt if you’re creating a graphic for a nonprofit or char­
ity that’s soliciting donations. Showing readers the plight of a nation in charts 
doesn’t generate the same response as showing them the plight of one identifi­
able victim. In fact, a 2007 study by a University of Pennsylvania professor was 
titled “Sympathy and callousness: The impact of deliberative thought on dona­
tions to identifiable and statistical victims.” You can find the study here:
http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/library/J2007OBHDP_DAS_
sympathy.pdf

68
Part II: Starting with Data 
The researchers found that even including statistical information beside the 
story of an identifiable victim resulted in fewer donations. The takeaway: 
Charitable giving isn’t based on reason, so appealing to reason won’t work. 
Avoid the head (logic); go right for the heart (emotion), as shown in Figure 4-4.
Figure 4-4: Clearly state the issue, the goal, and how viewers 
can help.
Appealing to the Target Audience
What one person finds fascinating can be completely different from what 
draws another person’s interest. Getting your readers’ attention and then 
hanging onto it first requires that you have some sense of who your reader is 
or who you want your reader to be. That reader is your target audience, and 
to make your graphic as compelling and amazing as possible, you need to 
tailor it to appeal to that audience directly.
To use two extremely different audiences to illustrate this point, think of what 
you’d want an infographic on rockets to be like if your target audience were 
a group of rocket scientists. Now think of what you’d want it to be like if your 
target were children. Everything in the graphic changes, from the information 
to the appearance.
In some cases, your target audience could be described as captive. For exam­
ple, if your graphic on flying buttresses is going to be handed out as a promo­
tional item at an architecture conference, your target audience is (or probably 
www.allitebooks.com

69
 Chapter 4: Informing Yourself
should be) architects, and you’re almost guaranteed to get their eyes on your 
work. If the same graphic will appear in a brochure at a museum, something 
about it must be compelling enough to make people want to pick it up.
	
No matter who your audience members are, or whether they’re sitting in con­
ference seats or running around town, you still have to grab their attention. 
You want your graphic to draw readers in and hold their interest — and 
doing that requires a targeted approach. We write about this in much greater 
detail in Chapters 5 and 6.
Here’s a brief rundown of different factors to consider as you tailor your info­
graphic to appeal to a specific audience.
Complexity
One aspect of your graphic you need to be aware of is the complexity of the 
information you’re presenting: how much data is packed into each chart and 
how difficult that data is to understand. Including a large amount of data in a 
single chart increases the effort needed to untangle it, so you need to deter­
mine what amount is acceptable for your target audience. Figure 4-5 (left) 
shows an example of a chart containing a great deal of data and a compara­
tive version (right) that’s been pared down.
Figure 4-5: A chart with a large amount of data and a pared-down version.
Say for Figure 4-5, the infographic on the left is focused on France, but you’re 
including data for other countries as context. Well, maybe you don’t need to 
include data for that many other countries. Focusing on just a few key coun­
tries (the simple version on the right of the figure) might be enough to get 
your point across.

70
Part II: Starting with Data 
Your audience is also important to consider when you think of whether to use 
data that requires some work to understand. For the general public, a simpler 
approach is more suitable. Figure 4-6 shows charts using real data that dem­
onstrate this point: The chart on the left shows the ratio of people age 0–14 to 
those 65+ in a population over time. The chart on the right shows the actual 
populations of each age group.
Figure 4-6: When possible, simplify how data is presented.
	
If your audience is the general public, you typically want to keep the complexity 
to a minimum. The data needs to be accessible to everyone, including people 
who may know very little about the subject. That doesn’t mean you need to 
dumb-down anything. On the contrary, one of the joys of a good graphic is 
exploring the visual representation of a large, intricate set of data. But there is a 
line beyond which exploring becomes struggling to understand. Knowing the 
difference is a matter of judgment. (A notable exception to this point is when 
the goal of your graphic is to demonstrate the complexity of a topic.)
On the other hand, highly complex charts may be desirable if your audience 
is a group of specialists. Telecom engineers, for example, may enjoy working 
through a flow chart on the evolution of cellular standards through the years. 
As the designer of the infographic, you decide the appropriate level of com­
plexity for your target audience.

71
 Chapter 4: Informing Yourself
Density
As opposed to complexity, density in this context refers to how many charts 
are in your graphic as a whole. To a great degree, design principles will govern 
how many you pack in and don’t forget your all-important white space! (We 
talk about white space and design in Chapters 7 and 8.) But ultimately, you 
determine how data-dense your graphic is.
The rules on density follow the rules on complexity: If your audience is the 
general public, keep the density a bit lower than it would be if you were creat­
ing something for an audience of specialists. An infographic that looks like a 
wall of data can be alienating rather than inviting. An audience of specialists, 
on the other hand, can be more willing to engage with a very dense graphic if 
it covers their area of expertise.
Appearance
The look of your infographic, from the layout to the style of your drawings 
to the colors, should also be tailored to your audience. Earlier in this sec­
tion, we touch on the example of a rocket infographic that appeals to rocket 
scientists versus one for children. You would expect a clear contrast in how 
each version looks. The graphic for scientists might feature cutaway photos 
or drawings detailing the rocket’s engines. It would probably feature a rela­
tively large amount of text, written at a college reading level. By comparison, 
the art for the children’s graphic would be simple, perhaps even cartoonish, 
with only the major parts of the rocket labeled. You’d want to keep the text 
extremely simple.
Obviously, most infographics don’t face such a stark choice between audi­
ences, but the point is that you need to think of what’s going to attract — and 
please — your reader’s eye.
To use another example, a chart showing the performance of the U.S. stock 
market that’s running on an irreverent news site isn’t going to look the same 
as it would if it were running in a venerable financial journal. The whole visual 
feel of the two charts should be different even though they contain the exact 
same information.
Getting the Logistics
How you intend to distribute your infographic is another matter to consider. 
Most graphics today are published online, which is relatively inexpensive and 
immediate, making your work easily shareable with a wide audience. In some 
cases, however, printing your graphic may be the preferred way to distribute 
it, like if you want to release it as a flyer or poster, or are publishing it in a 
newspaper or magazine.

72
Part II: Starting with Data 
Each format comes with its own set of variables to think about as you prepare 
to publish, and in this section, we go over some of the basics you need to know. 
Being aware of your size specifications now can help you focus your work.
Why do you need to worry about this while you’re determining your thesis? 
Well, remember that infographics must explain information as clearly and 
concisely as possible. One of the smartest ways to make sure your graphic 
gets to the point without taking up unnecessary bandwidth is to continuously 
review whether all graphic components support your thesis.
Printing considerations
Unless you have professional printing equipment in your home or office, cre­
ating a professional-quality print of your graphic is a little more complicated 
than just clicking the Print command on your computer or printer. You have to 
take your work to a printing house, which entails being able to explain to the 
printer exactly what you want. This section will cover some of the variables 
you should be prepared to contend with.
	
One note before we move on: Speak to the folks at your printer ahead of time 
to see whether their shop has specific requirements for the digital file you’re 
printing from or certain limitations regarding what they’re able to do. You may 
want your infographic printed on a long banner for a medical sales booth, but 
they don’t have a printer that can handle the job. Or, you may be banking on 
heavy card stock that they don’t have. You can save a great deal of time and 
effort if you’re prepared for such issues before you try to print your work, so 
the first step is always to talk to them about your needs.
Print size
Obviously, the size of your poster or print can vary quite a bit. If you don’t 
have a specific requirement or a particular size in mind, you may find it help­
ful to consider one of the standard poster sizes you’ll find at most copy shops 
that do digital printing. The sizes in Table 4-1, which includes both inches and 
millimeters, are typically available.

By no means are you limited to the sizes in Table 4-1. In fact, if you’re hiring a 
professional printing house, the size you can print at is limited only by the size 
of its presses. Most will have no problem printing a poster up to 40" (1,016mm) 
wide, not to mention any increment up to that width. Also, because the paper 
for these presses comes in a roll, you can make the length essentially anything 
you want (with limitations, of course; talk to your printer).
If you find that neither digital printing nor a printing press suits your needs, 
and you require something capable of printing even larger, you can always 
seek out a large-format inkjet printer. In North America, commercial copy 
centers (such as FedEx Office and Staples) often have them, and they can 
print up to about 60" (1,524mm) in width. And again, because the paper used 
comes in a roll, the length available to you is virtually endless. Depending 
on the colors you use and what material you print on, price can range from 
about $7 to $30 per square foot.
These larger shops, or local sign-making businesses, are also a good option 
if you’re printing your work on a medium other than paper, such as mylar, 
canvas, or film positives.
Image size/resolution
You need to size your graphic according to what the actual print size will be. 
You also need to know the print resolution in dots per inch (dpi) that you 
want to print at. A publication like a newspaper typically prints at a resolu­
tion of 200 dpi or less, a regular magazine might print at 300 dpi, and a glossy 
magazine or photography book could print at a resolution of 2,400 dpi. The 
decision depends on where your graphic will appear and how crisp and clear 
you want or need the image to be. Again, this is yet another topic to discuss 
with your printer before you send a file.
	
After determining the final print size and resolution, the graphic should be 
sized at 100% in the document for printing.
File format
Check what file types the printer accepts. Among the most widely used are AI, 
EPS, JPG/JPEG, and PDF files. The GIF format is good for basic web graphics 
with simple animation.

Part II: Starting with Data 
Several other types include PNG, which is good for smaller file sizes, as well 
as TIFF and BMP files. These less-common file types might have to be con­
verted before you submit them.
Fonts
One variable you should check with your printer is any nonstandard font that 
isn’t embedded in your infographic. If your printer doesn’t have that font, 
they can’t print your infographic as you designed it. If the font is embedded 
like an image, though, it won’t be an issue. You don’t have to worry about this 
with rasterized files, for example. We explain more on this subject when we 
discuss Photoshop and Illustrator in Chapters 9 through 11.
	
If the font isn’t embedded, you may have to include it with the file containing 
your infographic that you send to your printer. Be aware, however, that many 
nonstandard fonts are under license, which means that you’re technically not 
supposed to distribute them, regardless of whether you paid for the font. 
Sometimes it’s a good idea to have a backup font in mind in case the printing 
issue can’t be quickly resolved.
Bleed
If your image goes to the edge of the poster or print, you need to be sure to 
extend your image past what will be its actual size. That extended print area 
is called “bleed,” and the printer trims off the extra, leaving a clean edge. 
What you don’t want is to end up with blank space between your infographic 
and the edge of the page or poster. Bleed requirements vary by printer, but 
3mm — about one-fifth of an inch — is generally the minimum.
Web dimensions
The challenge of sizing a graphic for the web is design sizes are now so vari­
able, there are no standards to speak of. The “responsive design” brought 
about with the advent of HTML5 changed the web design landscape perma­
nently. Unlike a printed graphic, where everyone who sees it experiences it 
in the same size, the actual size of a web graphic changes depending on the 
readers’ devices. A device screen can range from 27" for a desktop computer 
to 5" for a smartphone.
	
Always optimize for your audience. Use web analytics software to determine 
how people are accessing your site and base your decisions on that data.
That said, you do need to think about a few elements when you’re publishing 
work online.
Screen aspect ratio
Responsive design is the web design principle that tries to make visual images 
clear and legible across a wide range of devices. For an infographic designer, 
the beauty of this approach is that your work will automatically fit itself to 

75
 Chapter 4: Informing Yourself
the screen it’s viewed on. As a designer, you don’t need to come up with one 
aspect ratio for work that will be seen on a laptop and another adapted to 
smartphones. The increasing use of HTML technology has made responsive 
design a standard. We touch on HTML and CSS in other chapters; just know 
that you don’t have to be a programmer to use and benefit from these tech­
nologies. Phasing this technology into your work will make it much more 
accessible and readable and will certainly be a valuable job skill for you as an 
infographic designer.
If you’re not using responsive design, think of where your target audience will 
be viewing your infographic and work backward from there. If most of your 
readers are getting your material on a specific platform or screen proportion, 
you design with that in mind.
	
Users don’t always want to scroll down to see more, so think of what informa­
tion you want your readers to see when they first look at your infographic.
	
For work that needs to be scaled for concurrent print and web use — say you 
work at a newspaper, and your infographic will run in both the print edition 
and online at that website — stick to using vector files. They’ll make it easy 
for you to scale your work.
Screen resolution
One of the most common and basic questions asked in website design is 
what monitor screen resolution to use. The somewhat unhelpful answer is 
that your work should be optimized for the most common resolution, but it 
should work for all of them. On the other hand, no design exists that looks 
the same in every resolution, platform, and browser, so creating one isn’t a 
realistic goal. What you’re aiming for is a balance — something that looks 
perfect under the most common conditions and still looks really good in less 
typical conditions.
	
The website StatCounter monitors statistics on a variety of factors you may 
find useful, including the top screen resolutions, mobile resolutions, and brows­
ers in use. You can find those statistics at http://gs.statcounter.com.
	
Always check your work by looking at it in different browsers and resizing the 
browser windows to see how your work looks under different conditions. 
And always design with your audience in mind. For example, if you know the 
target audience mostly uses mobile devices, design with mobile in mind.
Type point (size)
You always need to be aware of how legible the type in your work will be when 
people view it. Text has to be large enough and clear enough that people can 
read it. Common design standards dictate that body type shouldn’t be smaller 

76
Part II: Starting with Data 
than 10 points (pt), and it’s recommended in most cases to use 12pt or 14pt 
type. Many web design purists are now even calling for a 16pt minimum.
If your body type is between 12 and 16 points, scale up and down from there 
to determine the size for headlines, footnotes, and other features. So, your 
headline might be about 24pt type (or larger if it’s a big graphic and needs a 
large headline). Footnotes will probably be 8pt type.
	
In Illustrator, you can test what your work will look like before exporting. From 
the View menu at the top of your Illustrator window, choose the Actual Size 
option to get a good sense of how your work will look when published. That 
way, you can check whether your type will be large enough to see clearly. You 
can also choose File➪Save for Web for work you intend to publish online. You 
find out much more about Illustrator in Chapter 9.
No matter what the characteristics of your infographic, you should keep 
these three questions in mind:
	
✓	Is my key information visible when readers first navigate to my graphic?
	
✓	Can readers easily read the text on the page?
	
✓	Does it look right under a variety of conditions, on different screen sizes 
and resolutions, and when viewed through different browsers?
New technologies debut all the time, and keeping up with them is virtually 
impossible. Getting some working knowledge of HTML and CSS can help 
designers make sure that their content continues to be legible and attractive 
even after technology marches on. If you had to answer “no” to any of the 
preceding questions, head back to the drawing board.

Gathering Your Data
In This Chapter
▶	Finding data on the Internet
▶	Making sure data sources are reliable
▶	Turning data into relevant information
A

good infographic can visually tell a story or make some abstract or 
numerical point easy to understand, but none of this happens without a 
good base of data. Data is the underlying structure that gives shape to every­
thing else — the skeleton on which hangs the flesh of design. It’s the — well, 
you get the idea.
In his hugely influential first book, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 
famed infographic guru Edward Tufte wrote that the “overwhelming fact of data 
graphics is that they stand or fall on their content, gracefully displayed.” In his 
philosophy, visual ornamentation, no matter how skillfully done or meticulously 
realized, should never get in the way of a graphic’s real purpose: conveying 
information. He even coined the term chartjunk to refer to all that extraneous 
visual noise that can clutter up a graphic and distract from the point.
Being an efficient researcher is its own skill, but it’s not a difficult one to hone. 
For the most part, researching involves knowing where — and how — to look. 
This chapter covers some of the best ways to gather and pull together the 
data you need to create the foundation of your infographic — and you’ll find 
much of what you need online.
Searching Online
The single most powerful tool in a researcher’s toolbox today is the Internet. 
That fact may be obvious to everyone, but not so long ago, you needed a 
trip to an actual office or library to find the data you wanted. So no matter 
what information you’re looking for — whether it’s a government database, a 
newspaper article, or an academic paper — make the Internet the first step 
in your search.

78
Part II: Starting with Data 
The Internet runs a large number of search engines, including some specialized 
ones that could benefit you if you’re doing very targeted research. For example, 
quora.com is a terrific search engine that focuses on technology; artcyclopedia.
com provides a wealth of information on art and artists. General-purpose search 
engines include Bing, ask.com, and Yahoo. But, king of them all is Google.
Doing simple Google searches
The Internet search market still bows before Google. The name itself has 
become a verb — as in, “Just Google it” — placing Google alongside the likes 
of companies like Xerox and Band-Aid whose brands are synonymous with a 
whole category of product. And for good reason, too, because Google is still 
widely considered the best online search option available.
Perhaps the best thing about Google is how easy it is to use. It ignores capital­
ization and punctuation, so no need to worry about that. It also has a built in 
spell-checker and will automatically search for the correct spelling, which can 
be helpful if you’re looking for, say, statistics on appendectomies and forget that 
the word is spelled with two p’s. Google doesn’t do all the work for you, though. 
To use it effectively, you need to keep a few basic principles in mind. Here are 
some helpful tips that will get you the search results you’re looking for:
	
✓	Keep it simple. Avoid using unnecessary words. You don’t need to search 
on a complete sentence. In fact, doing so can result in Google looking for 
words that aren’t important. Also, the simpler your search, the broader the 
results will be. If it turns out to be too broad (too many hits), you can later 
add additional terms to narrow the results. Another highly effective way of 
narrowing your search is to put quotes around the exact term you’re look­
ing up. For example, a search for “John Quincy Adams” will prominently 
display information specifically about him. Typing john quincy adams, with­
out quotes, will get you some of the information you need, but it will turn 
up lots of extraneous information, too.
	
✓	Use linguistically appropriate search terms. In other words, think about 
the sources most likely to have the information you want and what termi­
nology and jargon they use. Those are the terms you need to search for. 
A government or medical database, for instance, will probably use more 
technical language: for example, searching on “influenza” rather than “flu.”
	
✓	Be exact in your phrasing. If you want to know how many people are mur­
dered each year in Hawaii, murder is one of the terms you need to search 
for. Using terms that are close may not actually get you the data you want. 
For example, looking for death rate is much too broad; crime is better but 
still too general given the very specific figure you are looking for.
	
✓	Employ some creative thinking. Ask yourself whether there are ways 
to find what you want by using other terms. If you’re looking for data on 
murders in Hawaii, you could also search with the term by state. What 
you find may not be restricted to just Hawaii, but Hawaii’s figures should 
be included.

 Chapter 5: Gathering Your Data
	
The rise of Internet advertising and search-engine optimization calls for some 
critical reading skills. When you do a Google search, “results” at the side of 
the page are advertisements. The “results” that have tiny yellow boxes with 
the word “ad” in them? Those, too, are ads. Some of them may, in fact, turn 
out to be decent sources, but bear in mind that someone paid to put them 
there. Google is good about sniffing out the best content to display high in its 
search results, but you need to be on the ball, too.
Here are a few examples of searches you might enter to find that information:
	
✓	How many people are killed per year in Hawaii: Not good. This string isn’t 
exact enough. People are killed by causes other than murder, so this 
search doesn’t focus on murder. In fact, the top results are all about shark 
attacks.
	
✓	How many people murdered per year Hawaii: Getting closer. At least now 
the search specifies “murder.” But it’s still too wordy and isn’t using the 
best language possible.
	
✓	Murder rate Hawaii: Great. The search string is simple and directly to 
the point, using the terminology likely found in a government database, 
which is the best source for this sort of information. Compared with the 
previous two search strings, this one returns the best results.
	
✓	Murder rate by state: Also great. The same merits of the preceding bullet 
apply here as well, only this version uses a little creative thinking to 
come up with different search terms that will still get you the informa­
tion you want.
Talk the talk
Many fields (think medicine and economics) 
have their own jargon that will be helpful to 
know when conducting good web searches or 
understanding what you’re looking at when you 
find a data set. For example, in medicine, the 
number of new cases of a disease in a given 
time frame is its incidence, and the proportion 
of a population that has the disease is preva­
lence. Luckily, good glossaries are available 
online (and here are three) that can help you 
decipher this sort of language. If you need a 
glossary for a different field, usually searching 
on “glossary field terms” will find it.
	✓	Medical terms: Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC)

Part II: Starting with Data 
Refining your Google searches
You can use the filter options Google gives you on your search results 
page to search for images, include maps, and find items available for sale. 
Additionally, you can employ specialized search terms to refine your 
searches and further narrow your results. Figure 5-1 shows the toolbar on 
the Google search results page with the following filter options:
	
✓	Web: This shows you all the results Google was able to find on the Web. 
	
✓	Images: Shows pages of only images from your regular search, including 
photos and logos.
	
	Note: Google has a “usage rights” feature that shows you whether 
images are acceptable for public use or protected by copyright. Use it 
carefully — sometimes, an image that Google thinks is appropriate for 
reuse was actually stolen or misrepresented.
	
✓	Maps: With this filter selected, Google will place your search results on 
one of its satellite maps. For example, searching for preschools in a par­
ticular city will show several preschools on the map.
	
✓	Shopping: This organizes search results in terms of retail possibilities. 
For example, a search for used Mac computers will show a list of various 
products, with links to the websites where you can purchase them. If 
you were trying to research used Mac computers, but not purchase one, 
this type of search probably wouldn’t be your best bet.
	
✓	Books: This filter turns up a list of books about your topic, which could 
be very helpful if you’re working on a long-term project and have time to 
buy and read a book.
	
✓	More: This drop-down menu lets you choose from a few other filters, 
including apps, videos, news coverage, and more.
	
✓	Search Tools: Within any search results page, Search Tools further 
refines your search results by additional factors. For example, while 
using the Images filter, clicking Search Tools provides choices that let 
you specify the size and color of the images you want to see.
At the top right of the Google search results page, you’ll see a few additional 
features, which let you set some privacy and web safety standards. Spend a 
little time experimenting with these, and you’ll find the setup that works best 
for your needs.
Google is so vast that it can be very helpful to learn a few tricks to target 
your searches. By adding some select phrases or commands, you can help 
Google narrow the results so that you’re more likely to get exactly the infor­
mation you need.

81
 Chapter 5: Gathering Your Data
Figure 5-1: The Google search toolbar is your friend.
	
✓	Search for an exact phrase. Put quotation marks around your terms to 
search for that exact phrase with the words in that exact order. So, in 
our running Hawaiian crime example, typing “‘murder rate’ Hawaii” may 
be even better than “murder rate Hawaii.” 
	
✓	Exclude or include words in your search. If you want a specific term 
omitted from your search results, place a hyphen (-) in front of it. If you 
want Google to find a particular word that it normally ignores — such as 
and or the — put it in quotation marks, such as murder rate Hawaii “and” 
1985. You may already be familiar with some advanced Google Search 
options, but if you happen to be a novice, here’s a couple we find unique.
Searching within a time range
Follow these steps to search within a defined time period.
	
1.	Do a simple search for whatever you’re looking for.
	
	 See the previous section for information related to a simple search.
	
	 Just below the search box, on the page showing your results, is the 
Google search toolbar (refer to Figure 5-1).

82
Part II: Starting with Data 
	
2.	Click the Search Tools option (at the far right of the toolbar) to see 
additional options.
	
	 The first of the additional options is Any Time, with a down arrow indi­
cating a drop-down menu.
	
3.	Click to open the Any Time drop-down menu and choose a time 
period to limit your search.
	
	 Google offers various options, including Past 24 Hours and Past Year. Or 
you can choose the Custom Range option and set a custom time frame.
The refined search results appear automatically after you choose an option.
Searching for page types
Yet another type of advanced search allows you to search for specific types 
of pages. For instance, you can search just U.S. patents or limit your results to 
scholarly papers on a topic. You can find all these search options, as shown in 
Figure 5-2, on the Google Products page under the Specialized Search heading. 
To reach the Products page, click the About Google link at the bottom of any 
Google page and then click the Products link. The URL for the Products page is
www.google.com/intl/en/about/products/index.html.
Figure 5-2: The Google Products page offers a variety of different search options.

 Chapter 5: Gathering Your Data
Finding Additional Sources
Just because Google (or whatever search engine you choose) lists a page as 
its top result doesn’t mean it’s the best source for the information you want. 
Don’t misconstrue its search ranking as an endorsement of its content. Google 
has taken steps to reward great websites with prominent placement, which 
in itself weeds out sites that rely on search-engine trickery. But the system 
is far from perfect, so you’ll need to train yourself to find other accurate and 
relevant sources.
	
Watch out for content farms, or content mills, that exist specifically to game the 
online searching system. They generate huge numbers of articles on all sorts 
of subjects and use headlines, keywords, and other tricks to get their articles 
into the top search results. All the clicks they earn from that prominent place­
ment bring in revenue. Not every article from a content farm will be full of 
falsehoods, but being accurate is not their top priority, so they’re generally 
best to avoid. It helps that Google works constantly to weed them out.
A word on Wikipedia
Wikipedia ranks among the top results for many 
searches, but the accuracy of its information has 
been the subject of a great deal of debate over 
the years. In fact, countless news organizations 
and publishers have strict policies in place that 
prohibit reporters using Wikipedia as a source. 
Pretty much anyone can write or edit an article 
on Wikipedia, so there’s no way to ensure that 
what you’re reading is accurate. In theory, let­
ting just about anyone edit pages allows inac­
curacies to be corrected as soon as they’re 
spotted — but that doesn’t always happen.
In a somewhat bizarre incident in 2012, Philip 
Roth took to the pages of The New Yorker 
to address an error in Wikipedia’s entry on 
his novel “The Human Stain.” Roth, through 
an official intermediary, had previously peti­
tioned Wikipedia to delete the error. Wikipedia 
responded that although Roth was obviously 
an authority on his own book, his word was not 
enough. They needed secondary sources as 
well. Evidently without any other recourse, Roth 
made his grievance public.
Still, studies have found that Wikipedia’s error 
rate isn’t significantly greater than that of sup­
posedly authoritative encyclopedias. And, in 
some instances, Wikipedia may (in fact) offer 
a thorough and accurate overview of a topic. 
The problem is that you just can’t be sure, and 
rather than trust Wikipedia more because 
its error rate is commensurate with those of 
other encyclopedias, we should really trust 
those other encyclopedias less. No matter 
your source, checking your facts is absolutely 
crucial, and having more than one reputable 
source is a good way to guarantee the accu­
racy of your work.
Wikipedia does have its uses, however. The site 
does a good job of allowing its authors and edi­
tors to link to the sources of their information in 
footnotes, and those links can offer a researcher 
valuable leads. So if you do use Wikipedia, think 
of it as an avenue to get to the information you 
want — just not a source unto itself.

84
Part II: Starting with Data 
So, how to do your own weeding? Well, there’s no simple way to know whether 
a page is reliable — although, if you see the same text word-for-word turn up 
on a few pages, that’s usually a good indicator it was created by a farm. You 
have to use your discretion. If you have any doubts about any source, read up 
on it. If you find good data but aren’t sure you can trust it, try to find another 
source to verify it. If you still have doubts, follow your gut and don’t use the 
information.
Discovering government databases
The world’s governments and intergovernmental organizations maintain 
databases on all sorts of statistics. Demographic, economic, health, and cul­
tural data for countless countries are available online for anyone interested. 
Assuming the information you’re seeking isn’t too obscure, you can prob­
ably find it.
Here’s a list of useful governmental and intergovernmental databases and 
where they can be found online. A select few university pages have also been 
included. The University of Florida’s library, for instance, has compiled links 
to the central statistical offices of many countries, organized by region.

The greatest obstacle in your search may be navigating the database itself. 
For example, the website of the U.S. Census Bureau can feel maddeningly 
mazelike to the uninitiated. It contains so many pages filled with so much 
information that knowing where to start can be daunting — particularly 
difficult if you’re looking for historical data and need to compare reports 
from various years. When that happens, sometimes there’s no recourse but 
to call the U.S. Census Bureau and ask for assistance. Its public relations 
department can often connect you with an expert who can lead you through 
the virtual hedge maze.
Using company resources
A number of private companies and nonprofits exist that specialize in data. 
Some focus on a particular topic, such as the income gap between the 
world’s rich and poor, and others are generalists. Many of these sources use 
information from the government or intergovernmental databases in the 
previous section, but they sometimes offer analysis or a different perspec­
tive on the information. They can also make what you’re looking for easy 
to find.
As opposed to the many government databases that can seem geared toward 
specialists or people within the government, these sites are intended for 
public use. That means they’re designed to be accessible, and they can 
prove a valuable resource to a journalist, especially on a deadline. Here’s a 
sampling of some of the best:
	
✓	datacatalogs.org: Links to the open data catalogs for various cities and 
towns around the world. If you want to know how to find the public 
database of Ann Arbor, Michigan, or Venice, Italy, this is a great place 
to look.
	
	http://datacatalogs.org

88
Part II: Starting with Data 
	
✓	DataMarket: Aggregates public data and makes it easily searchable. The 
site organizes data in a few ways, including by country and industry, 
which is useful if you’re looking for stats on a sector (such as retail or 
the auto industry) but aren’t sure what’s available.
	
	http://datamarket.com
	
✓	Gapminder: A terrific resource if you’re looking for anything related to 
development. You can sort data in several ways and look at what’s avail­
able on subjects such as causes of child deaths, poverty and inequality, 
and population growth.
	
	www.gapminder.org
	
✓	Harvard WorldMap: Run by the Center for Geographic Analysis at 
Harvard University, it allows users to create maps of any location in the 
world or to view maps submitted by other users.
	
	http://worldmap.harvard.edu
	
✓	Influence Explorer: Tracks money as it flows through Washington, DC. It 
allows users to search detailed records on topics such as lobbying dol­
lars, earmarks, and who has received what contracts.
	
	http://data.influenceexplorer.com
	
✓	Knoema: Lets you search for stats on a wide variety of topics, from African 
tourism to European patent applications. You can browse by topic, data 
source, and region, or use its search engine if you know what you’re after.
	
	http://knoema.com
	
Sometimes the issue isn’t finding data but analyzing it. If you have a vast 
spreadsheet of figures in front of you, the hard part is often making sense of it 
all. Thankfully, websites specialize in performing statistical calculations and 
offer users ways to organize and analyze messy datasets. The following sites 
are worth checking out to see whether they work for you: 
	
✓	Stanford University DataWrangler

Reading company reports
If you’re making an infographic that involves information on a specific com­
pany, sometimes your best source is going to be the company itself. Say, for 
instance, you’re making a chart about a public company’s sales or financial 

89
 Chapter 5: Gathering Your Data
performance. Public companies must make that information available, and 
you can get it by simply reading the company’s latest financial report (avail­
able on virtually every public company’s website). Or, if a drug company has 
just released an exciting new drug, and you’re assigned to put together an 
infographic showing how it works, your best source is obviously going to be 
the company that created it.
The best place to search for this information is a company’s online news­
room, alternatively called a “press room,” “media room,” or something in that 
vein. That’s where many companies house public info that might be useful to 
a journalist. There’s no single location where all companies put their news­
room on their website, but there are some general guidelines to finding it.
	
✓	Go to the company’s home page. You may get lucky and find a link right 
at the top of the page, but if not, scroll to the bottom. Many websites 
have an assortment of links to less frequently accessed parts of the site 
all the way at the bottom of their home page.
	
✓	Look for an About page. If you still don’t see a link to the newsroom, 
try to find a link to the company About page. Most company websites 
have one that functions as a catchall for general info about the company. 
Often you can find corporate information there as well as a link to the 
company’s newsroom.
	
✓	Search for the company name with the term “corporate.” When 
searching for the newsroom of certain types of companies, particularly 
retailers or companies that sell a product, it helps to search the term 
corporate along with the company’s name. Otherwise, you’ll usually 
come up with the company’s e-commerce site or a promotional page all 
about its products.
	
	Gap Inc. is a good example. A web search for Gap brings you to the Gap 
e-commerce site. If you search GAP corporate, the first result is its corpo­
rate page with information relevant to investors and media.
What you’ll find in the newsroom is anything the company wants to share 
with the press, such as press releases. Some companies include a wealth of 
information in their newsroom, particularly if they have a product they really 
want to promote, so you might find everything you need for your infographic. 
Other companies, especially those that are privately owned, keep the data 
they release to a minimum, which doesn’t mean the data isn’t available. You’ll 
probably have to call or send an e-mail to their press contact to get what 
you need.
	
If you can’t find the name and contact information of a press contact in a 
company’s newsroom, try looking at a few of its press releases, which fre­
quently offer contact info for reporters looking for information.
With public companies, one resource you can usually access online is the 
company’s financial records. Knowing how to find these statements is cru­
cial for business journalists. For the most part, locating them is the same 

90
Part II: Starting with Data 
as locating a company’s newsroom, but the page you’re looking for may be 
called something like Investor Relations. It helps to know that large com­
panies, such as the Ford Motor Company or General Electric, often have a 
dedicated corporate website (as opposed to one for consumers) where this 
information is readily available.
Reaching out to experts
Sometimes your best resource is going to be an actual human being with a 
specialized area of knowledge — in other words, an expert. That can be par­
ticularly true if you need help understanding a highly complex topic, such as 
quantum mechanics. Even if you’re dealing in more obscure subjects, an expert 
can often tell you where to go if you’ve hit a wall in your search for information.
Finding experts isn’t difficult, and generally they’re willing to help. Try look­
ing at the following sources when you find yourself in need of an authority on 
your topic:
	
✓	Books: An author who has written about the subject you’re researching 
can be a great source of information. He may have the data you’re look­
ing for, but even if he doesn’t, he’ll likely know who does. If you can’t 
find the author’s direct contact info from a web search, the media rela­
tions department of the book’s publisher can often get you in touch.
	
✓	Research institutes and think tanks: These organizations are filled with 
subject matter experts. Find one that has done research on your sub­
ject and contact their press department. The PR team will find the right 
person for you to speak to.
	
✓	Universities: The website of a university will have dedicated pages for 
their different departments, typically listing the faculty and staff within 
that branch. Find the department that’s relevant to you, and you can 
often find an expert, as well as her contact information, directly through 
the site. If you’re not sure who is your best contact, call or e-mail the 
department and explain what you need to see whether you can get in 
touch with the best person.
Placing It All Together
Finding the information was the hard part. Assembling it into a coherent 
infographic is just a matter of focusing it. Depending on the size of the proj­
ect you’re working on, that process can be very simple or take a little more 
effort. The guidelines that follow apply whether your project is large or small.
	
The larger the project, the more you’ll probably find you have to work to 
maintain that focus.

91
 Chapter 5: Gathering Your Data
Getting back to your thesis
The amount of information available to you can seem nearly unlimited. Not 
all of it, of course, is relevant to your project. You may find some surprising 
statistics that rock your world while you’re researching; if those numbers 
aren’t directly pertinent to the topic at hand, get rid of them. When evaluat­
ing what information to include and what to exclude from your infographic, 
ask yourself the following questions:
	
✓	What is my thesis? In other words, what point are you trying to make 
with this information? Hopefully, you’ve kept this in mind as you’ve 
collected data, but it doesn’t hurt to reiterate it as you consider what 
should make it into your infographic.
	
	Read more about setting a thesis in Chapter 4.
	
✓	Is this information directly relevant to my thesis? Keep the data that 
supports the point you’re making, and jettison the rest. If your thesis is 
that child mortality rates are higher in the developing world, including a 
chart on malaria rates among adults might not make sense.
	
✓	Does this information help explain my thesis? Statistics that don’t nec­
essarily prove your point but help explain it may be worth including. For 
instance, if your thesis is that child mortality is higher in the developing 
world, it would help to include information showing the top causes of 
child mortality. If one of those causes is the unavailability of clean drink­
ing water, it may even make sense to include a chart on what percentage 
of the population has access to clean water.
	
✓	Does the information bear out my thesis? If in the process of gather­
ing data you find statistics that contradict your thesis, you may need to 
revise or qualify your thesis. Keep in mind that you’re acting as a jour­
nalist, and your commitment is to accuracy — not necessarily proving a 
foregone conclusion.
Citing your sources
Always make sure you give credit where it’s due. You should name the source 
of every piece of information in your infographic. After all, without sources, 
you wouldn’t have a graphic, and you could infringe on someone’s copyright. 
When dealing with experts, ask them how they would like to be cited. Some 
may prefer not to be listed by name and just give their organization instead.
The standard is to list sources in order of how much information they con­
tributed. The source that provided 90 percent of your data should get top 
billing over the source that contributed 10 percent. Sources can go anywhere 
unobtrusive, but standard practice is to put them at the bottom of your 
infographic and to format them in a small type point.

nfographics traffic in data. They’re made up of charts and graphs and 
­drawings, all filled with facts and statistics and more facts. For all this data 
to be meaningful to readers, however, it has to tell them something worth 
knowing about its subject. What readers learn can be something surprising, 
something new, something disturbing. The graphic can show how something 
has changed or how the subject is likely to change in the future. The pos­
sibilities are endless. Without a story to tell, though, a fact unto itself isn’t 
notably significant.
This chapter explores how to find the story in your facts as well as how to 
frame that story in your infographic. We look specifically at why trends and 
patterns are important, how to present data so it provides the reader with 
insight about a subject, and how to begin crafting a narrative flow — which 
has both visual and textual pieces — with your information.
Analyzing and Organizing Your Information
In Chapter 5, you can read how to gather data. Now it’s time to analyze your 
information, pulling out the most interesting, relevant facts for your info­
graphic. Digging through the data to find the best nuggets of information will 
help you craft a graphic that truly tells a story.
Looking for trends
One way to make a fact more meaningful to readers is to place it in context. 
For example, telling readers that the May unemployment rate in the United 
States is 9.4 percent doesn’t provide much education or illustration on its 
own, as shown in Figure 6-1. Is that rate good or bad? Is unemployment getting 
worse or easing up?

94
Part II: Starting with Data 
Figure 6-1: A statistic on its own doesn’t help the reader understand 
the news.
When you place that rate on a bar graph with the unemployment rates of an 
entire year, though, a picture of economic health begins to develop: a trend 
(see Figure 6-2).
Some trends reveal themselves easily. Any numbers collected at regular 
intervals — such as state or national economic data, education statistics, 
demographic information, and certain medical and scientific data — can 
be used to show a trend. Here are some examples of data that can easily 
reveal trends:
	
✓	Government spending
	
✓	Voter turnout
	
✓	Birth and death rates
	
✓	Employment rates
	
✓	Household and individual income

95
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
	
✓	Mortgage rates
	
✓	College enrollment
	
✓	Recycling rates
Figure 6-2: By charting statistics over time, you can see a trend 
developing.
Government agencies are a rich source of this type of data, and many of them 
update their statistics every month, making it easy to see trends developing. 
As a de facto reporter, though, you can and should seek out information from 
more than one source. At times, you’ll be able to find links between the data 
offered by various agencies. You might need to create your own database to 
compare these two seemingly disparate figures.
For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve System releases information on consumer 
debt each quarter. Referring to the unemployment rate example in Figure 6-2, 
correlating that chart with consumer-debt statistics may reveal something 

96
Part II: Starting with Data 
interesting about Americans’ spending habits. Are Americans spending less 
as unemployment rises or are they resorting to debt because more people are 
without regular paychecks? Or is there no apparent relationship?
	
Don’t try to force a relationship into your infographic. Let the data prove 
your point, not the other way around.
The big takeaway here is that looking for trends and charting them graphi­
cally can help a researcher craft a compelling narrative by posing and 
answering questions based on data.
	
When you present a correlation between two trends, be sure that a concrete 
link actually exists. Just because two trends occur at the same time doesn’t 
necessarily mean that they’re related. Do your research and make certain 
what you’re saying has a basis in fact, using clear language so the reader 
knows exactly the relation between two trends.
In that vast sea of data out there, navigating it isn’t always easy. When you’re 
looking for patterns and connections, make certain that your comparisons 
and correlations are accurate. When in doubt, interview an expert. All those 
agencies we mentioned have media relations officers who can clear up your 
questions or connect you with experts who can help you.
Employing comparisons
Context is everything. Readers can’t form opinions about issues and won’t 
feel well informed without having information for comparison.
Here’s an example. How much does the United States spend on elementary 
education each year? Say the total is $250 million. To the average person, 
that’s a lot of money, and to be sure, if you found this deposited into your 
checking account, you’d be having a pretty good day. But on the scale of a 
government with 300 million citizens, is $250 million really a lot of money? 
To figure that out, you could compare education spending in America with 
spending on other areas, such as defense, healthcare, and more. Say you 
found out that America spends $500 million yearly on healthcare. That’s 
twice the amount spent on education. Now, in context, the amount spent on 
education seems smaller.
And take a moment to think about why comparing these budgets adds mean­
ing. These numbers aren’t just dollar amounts — they’re about priorities. 
Comparing how much a government spends on different sectors suggests 
something about where that government places value. If you compare the 
budgets of different presidential administrations, you wouldn’t just have 
a picture of their financial behavior; you’d also have a sense of what each 
administration thinks is important. That level of meaning — that story — isn’t 
evident without making a comparison.

97
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
Using the right comparison
You need to think of all the variables potentially involved in any comparison 
you make. Otherwise, you run the risk of saying something misleading or 
inaccurate. You can avoid that mistake, however, by making sure you use the 
right comparison.
To give an example, put the hypothetical U.S. education budget into a global 
context. How does the $250 million spent annually by the United States 
stack up against other countries? If you found out that Japan spends only 
$200 million annually, it would seem that America spends — and thus, by 
suggestion, also values — education more than Japan does, which is what 
Figure 6-3 implies.
Figure 6-3: Numbers out of context present an unfair comparison.

98
Part II: Starting with Data 
But is that really a fair comparison? After all, Japan’s population is about 
one-third that of the U.S. population. So, although the Japanese government 
spends less on education in absolute terms, it actually spends far more per 
person (per capita), which is shown in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4: A bet ter comparison breaks down spending by population.
	
Always strive to use numbers that take context, such as a country’s population, 
into account. That way, the information you present to the reader offers real 
insight and doesn’t create a false picture. Using per capita information rather 
than absolute totals, for instance, is a great way to create a more accurate com­
parison between two countries, or states, or cities. You get the idea.
Many databases keep per capita figures. Even if they don’t, determining this 
data isn’t difficult. The formula is simply the amount in question divided by 
the population.
amount/population = amount per capita

99
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
Here’s a simple, real-life example to figure out the U.S. national gross domestic 
product (GDP), which is the total value of all goods and services produced by 
a given country.
Follow these steps to calculate a per capita figure:
	
1.	Find the amount in question for which you want to find the per capita 
figure.
	
	 In this case, the U.S. GDP is $15,600,000,000,000, according to the World 
Bank.
	
2.	Determine the population of the given country, state, or city.
	
	 The U.S. population is 316,000,000, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau.
	
3.	Apply this formula:
	
	 amount/population = amount per capita
	
	 $15,600,000,000,000/316,000,000 = $49,367 per capita
Understanding why the right comparison matters
So what story does this per capita figure have to tell, and why is it more 
revealing than absolute GDP? Well, America has by far the world’s larg­
est GDP, but it has only the tenth highest per capita GDP. This means that 
relative to other countries, the American economy is not the strongest. 
Without figuring out the right number to use and then employing a com­
parison, this story wouldn’t be at all evident.
Thinking about history
The biggest cause of death of Americans since 1921 is heart disease (see 
Figure 6-5), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
In that same time frame, pneumonia and influenza (combined) fell from the 
second-leading cause of death to ninth. The riddle is discovering why. Did 
humans suddenly become less susceptible to such infections or more sus­
ceptible to other infections? Or did something else intervene?
Of course, scientists have developed effective treatments that have vastly 
improved doctors’ abilities to treat and cure those conditions. Now, a bout of 
pneumonia is no longer a death sentence for most people.

100
Part II: Starting with Data 
Figure 6-5: This infographic illustrates changes over time in causes of death in the U.S.
Any major shift over time should prompt you to ask, “Why?” On the 2011 list 
of causes of death, you can see multiple conditions usually related to age: 
cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease. Is this change related to longer lifes­
pans? More exposure to toxins in the environment? And note that premature 
birth dropped off the list entirely. Is that thanks to better family planning or 
better obstetric care overall? Suicide is now a leading cause of death. Are U.S. 
citizens becoming more depressed people? Considering historical develop­
ments can help you shape the graphic you’re presently working on and gen­
erate ideas for future projects.
	
Asking “Why?” is how you find the story in this sort of data. The answers you 
discover can help you turn your infographic into an engrossing picture of his­
toric changes that your reader can pore over at length. The feeling your 
reader gets of being both educated and entertained is one of the main charms 
of a great infographic.

101
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
Finding the outliers
Some data points — known as outliers — lay so far outside the norm as to call 
attention to themselves. In the most severe cases, they can even skew data 
and create a misleading picture of the subject. You need to recognize when 
you have an outlier and then decide what to do about it.
Table 6-1 contains a simple example to demonstrate this idea. The two data­
sets represent a student’s grades, for eight weeks, on two weekly exams; 
the numbers are the percent correct on the exam. The dataset on the left 
(the first exam) doesn’t contain an outlier, but the dataset on the right (the 
second exam) does. The one outlier is shown in bold.
Table 6-1	
Weekly Exam Grades

Grades (one outlier)

The average in the middle column paints quite an accurate picture of that 
student’s achievement in regular testing. The single (bold) outlier (50%) in 
the dataset on the right throws a wrench into the works, though, dropping 
the student’s average by four percentage points and skewing the data.
What does a data journalist do in such a case? Here are a few options:
	
✓	Throw out the outlier. If you’re using only the average in your graphic 
and are concerned that it’s misleading, eliminate the outlier as an aber­
ration and then calculate the average without that week, as shown in 
Figure 6-6. In this example, throwing out the outlier would mean this 
student’s average test score jumps up to 87%, which (as the first column 
shows) is a better representation of achievement over the term.

102
Part II: Starting with Data 
	
	If you go with this option, be sure to add a footnote explaining every­
thing: in this case, the deletion of a data point. Always be as transparent 
as possible.
Figure 6-6: Showing data, using no outlier.
	
✓	Show the data as-is. Whether you’re using just the average in your 
graphic or plotting all the data in a chart, you can always present the 
data exactly as it came to you, as shown in Figure 6-7.
	
	In this case, we also recommend adding a footnote calling out the outlier 
so that your reader is fully aware of it.

103
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
Figure 6-7: Using an outlier can change the whole story.
	
✓	Construct a “line of best fit.” This option applies only if you’re going 
to create a chart showing all the data. A line of best fit — also called a 
linear regression — is a visual average of your data: literally the line that 
represents your scattered data points best.
Recognizing patterns
The human brain naturally seeks out patterns. Even your ability to read this 
sentence is thanks to your brain being trained to recognize letters arranged 
in particular patterns as words.
Spotting patterns is vital to creating compelling content for infographics 
because patterns point to a layer of meaning behind the data and suggest 
the presence of an underlying relationship or structure to investigate and 
unearth. In short, patterns are another important way that a data journalist 
finds the story in the facts.

104
Part II: Starting with Data 
Here’s an example from professional American football. Say you’re working 
on a simple graphic comparing the top ten current quarterbacks. You know, 
either from your love of football or from your research, that Peyton Manning 
dominated the NFL as an Indianapolis Colt before missing an entire season 
due to a neck injury. How did the Colts perform with and without him?
Indianapolis Colts’ winning percentage
	
✓	1998–2010 (with Manning): 68%
	
✓	2011 (without Manning): 13%
Clearly, the Colts did much better with Manning on the field. Manning, however, 
moved to a new job with the Denver Broncos. Over the same time period, take a 
look at how Denver performed before and after Manning played with the team.
Denver Broncos’ winning percentage
	
✓	1999–2011 (with at least five quarterbacks, but not including Manning): 53%
	
✓	2012 (with Manning): 81%
The pattern you see emerging is that teams led by Peyton Manning tend to be 
successful. To be sure, many other factors affected each team’s winning per­
centage, but simply isolating this one pattern reveals just how instrumental 
Peyton Manning is in the success of the team he plays for.
You can take this ball and run with it. Now, perhaps your simple graphic on the 
top ten quarterbacks becomes a look at how one player can change a team’s 
fortunes. Perhaps Manning becomes the focus of the graphic, and the top-ten 
data becomes supporting background information. Your entire visual story 
may change based on the patterns you find through your research.
Thinking of a Narrative
After you know broadly what story you want to tell with your data, you assem­
ble that story. A good infographic needs a narrative flow that carries the reader 
from one point to the next, so how you lay out your graphic and arrange its var­
ious elements determines how the reader proceeds through the information. 
That structure can be as important as the data itself in determining whether 
your graphic is great or merely good. After all, even though you’re using visuals 
and charts rather than just words, you’re still telling a story.

105
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
Creating a flow
How the narrative of your graphic flows depends on a variety of factors. 
Because infographics are a visual medium, much of your decision-making will 
relate to the look and function of the graphic. You’ll use some combination 
of drawings, photos, charts, and text, and each element has a specific role to 
play. We talk more about this in Chapter 8. For now, here’s how you can start 
thinking about turning your terrific information into a coherent final product.
This section focuses on a few of the factors that determine the flow of a graphic, 
and how to make sure your graphic is functional as well as eye-catching.
Purpose
The purpose of your graphic is perhaps the most fundamental aspect to con­
sider. After all, that purpose tempers virtually every decision made about 
the overall approach of your graphic. Always bear in mind the interaction of 
two factors: content and audience. In other words, what’s your purpose in 
sharing this content with this audience? Is the infographic meant for general 
online consumption? Is it a print piece being distributed to the news media? 
Is it going to be part of a corporate presentation? The answers to these ques­
tions will factor into every element of your graphic.
	
A good way to ground yourself before you begin designing is to create a basic 
outline after your research is complete. Doing so allows you to get an over­
view of your information and forces you to consider how you want to move 
from one point to the next.
Here’s an example. Say you’re developing an infographic for the Internet 
aimed at informing the general public about breast cancer. Your outline could 
look like this:
TOPIC: Breast cancer
FORMAT: Online, vertically oriented infographic
AUDIENCE: Health bloggers, women’s health sites, health reporters
CONTENT FLOW:
	
1.	History of breast cancer awareness, from ancient times to modern era
	
	 Arrange in horizontal timeline starting with older dates.
	
2.	Health-related statistics
	
	 How many women will be diagnosed this year? How many will die? How 
many women are at risk? Which states and/or countries have the highest 
diagnosis and death rates? Look at trends over time. Are more women 
being diagnosed, fewer, or the same? What racial/ethnic/other demo­
graphic differences can be seen in the rates?

106
Part II: Starting with Data 
	
3.	Diagnosis and treatment
	
	 How is breast cancer discovered and treated? What are the stages and 
the survival rates? How can women detect breast cancer on their own? 
What new advances have been made in recent research?
	
4.	Research and fundraising success
	
	 To end on a positive note, how much money has been raised for 
research over the years? Perhaps there are state-by-state figures to 
be revealed here.
Now change the purpose of your graphic. Say you’re creating the piece for a 
nonprofit entity trying to raise funds for research. You may switch the order 
of the preceding sections to 2-4-3-1, or you may drop sections 1 and 3 entirely. 
You may also start with the story of a real woman who survived breast 
cancer.
Format
Your infographic can exist in one of two forms: print or electronic (published 
online). Each format has some common features as well as advantages and 
disadvantages.
Web graphics
Web graphics let the reader scroll down through the information, but print 
graphics are usually designed in a single, wider block. (See Figure 6-8.)
Most graphics published online have a long, vertical orientation. Readers 
start at the top of the web page and scroll down to discover information 
“below the fold.”
The term “the fold” is borrowed from newspaper publishing, when the whole 
newspaper is folded in half, like in a newsstand. What you first see — only 
the top half of the front page — is “above the fold.” In an online or mobile 
device setting, above the fold is simply what a visitor sees when first visiting 
a site — or in this case, the first section of information.
What you place above and below the fold is something to keep in mind as 
a designer because you can control your graphic’s effect on the reader by 
changing the order in which you reveal things. As readers scroll down the 
page, they’re following a storyline in which new facts come to light.
One disadvantage of web graphics is that the width is limited to the size 
of the reader’s screen (the viewport), which can be particularly narrow 
on a smartphone. In this case, think of your graphic in terms of sections 
the reader will pause on while scrolling through. The flow of your graphic 
becomes determined by what information you put in each section, like chap­
ters in a book.

107
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
Figure 6-8: Web versus print graphics.
Because technology never stops evolving, it can be challenging to stay on top 
of the best ways to design infographics for mobile devices. Presently, we rec­
ommend using HTML or CSS to deliver your text content. You don’t have to 
become an expert — you just have to ensure that your infographic is as user-
friendly as possible. Using HTML or CSS to create a graphic with fewer bells 
and whistles can make the infographic faster to load. It also sucks up less 

108
Part II: Starting with Data 
bandwidth and removes some of the sluggishness if the viewer is in a place 
with a weak connection.
Going forward, you may be asked to design infographics for multiple formats — 
mobile devices and tablets as well as personal computers. Exploring web-based 
solutions can also provide new ways for getting your point across, such as 
using interactivity, providing links to supporting information, or including calls-
to-action that wouldn’t be possible with printed materials.
On the other hand, one of the great advantages of using web graphics is that 
you have nearly unlimited length (height), which allows you to incorporate 
a great deal of information. We don’t recommended, of course, that you con­
struct your graphic so it scrolls on and on with no regard for keeping your 
graphic concise and focused. The point is simply that height dimensions 
don’t decide how much data you can include. As long as your information is 
compelling and relevant to your main point, the flow of your narrative can 
continue beyond what you may be able to include on a printed page.
Print graphics
In terms of width, a printed graphic may offer a little more space than a web 
graphic — or even a lot more if you’re working with a poster-sized print. 
Moreover, a printed graphic is more likely to be contained in a single page 
(refer to Figure 6-8) and therefore fully visible all at once compared to a 
web graphic where some information becomes visible only when the reader 
scrolls down.
The flow of a printed graphic functions differently as a result. You’re not 
restricted to a vertically oriented layout, which can be a great advantage, and 
controlling the flow of your narrative is mostly a matter of design. You can 
direct the movement of your reader’s eye by thinking of the sizes of the ele­
ments on the page (larger ones tend to draw attention), their locations, and 
the colors you use.
A graphic showing how nuclear fusion works in the sun, for example, could 
be organized around a large, central image with information arranged around 
it. The flow of your graphic begins at the center and radiates outward. Some 
graphics — such as timelines — are better horizontally oriented, flowing 
from left to right (in Western cultures).
	
At least in the global West, readers are accustomed to reading top-to-bottom 
and left-to-right. That doesn’t mean that every graphic has to be structured 
that way. However, using a design approach that’s too unconventional — say, 
a graphic that begins in the bottom-right corner and directs the reader to the 
top left — can feel forced and unnatural.
Perhaps the greatest disadvantage of print graphics is a strictly defined size, 
which limits the amount of data you can include. This limitation becomes 
very noticeable when you have precious little space in which to explain the 

109
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
nuances of a complex topic. Creating a narrative flow under these conditions 
can be difficult with the temptation to squeeze in information wherever it fits.
With practice, you’ll get the hang of creating that flow. In the meantime, here 
are a few potential solutions:
	
✓	Bulleted lists: Instead of writing large blocks of text, break out important 
elements into bullet points. Like this one.
	
✓	Transitional elements: Use your visual design to create transitions 
instead of writing them out. For example, arrows are an obvious but 
effective way of guiding a reader through an infographic.
	
✓	Focused, streamlined design: Edit relentlessly. Ask yourself whether 
every piece of your infographic is necessary and effective. If it’s not, cut it.
Desired impact
The flow of your graphic strongly influences the effect your work has on its 
reader. The choices you make as the designer can alter that effect. Some 
graphics, for instance, seem to explode off the page from the moment you look 
at them, and every bit of information is treated like a major element. Other 
graphics reveal themselves slowly. They may have a few primary elements and 
then a great deal of subsidiary information for the reader to explore.
Figure 6-9 shows two infographics, one with each approach. On the left is an 
infographic that highlights a smaller amount of information but makes a bold 
visual statement. The second infographic (on the right) is more subdued and 
packs a lot of information into its subtle design.
Each approach has its place. The former can be great if you don’t have a 
lot of complex information to present and you need to make a statement as 
quickly as possible, like in a brief sales presentation. The latter may be more 
appropriate for an academic journal, where readers expect detailed data and 
will have time to consider it.
Look at another example. Say you have information you think is quite surpris­
ing, and you want to use the flow of your graphic to heighten that surprise in 
the reader. In this instance, you’ll likely want to find a way to build some sus­
pense and then reveal this surprising information at the end.
	
Using this structure properly can be a little tricky. You really need the right 
information to support it. First, you have to grab your reader’s attention at the 
beginning, so you need relatively compelling data to start at the top. Second, 
you need information you can then use to build to your surprise in much the 
same way a thriller builds suspense before a shock.

EXPLOSIVE
SUBTLE
Figure 6-9: Two good graphics; two different approaches.
To give you an example, say you’re creating an infographic for a company 
that has found several ways to modify a standard home so it uses dramati­
cally less energy than a typical home. Here’s a hypothetical structure out­
lined step by step:
	
1.	Draw in readers.
	
	 Begin with a detailed drawing of a home and point out the modifications.
	
2.	Build suspense.
	
	 Go through the energy savings of each modification.
	
3.	Reveal surprise.
	
	 Show the (ideally quite dramatic) collected total energy savings of these 
various tweaks, as shown in Figure 6-10.

111
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
Figure 6-10: The price tag clearly shows a key statistic, which can 
make a reader feel satisfied.
You can see how the flow here works to a climax to create the desired impact. 
Now as a mental exercise, imagine the impact on a reader if you were to place 
the total energy savings at the top and then break it down piece by piece. 
Our original approach feels dramatic, while the second feels more analytical. 
Again, each has its place.
Writing copy
Because infographics are a visual medium, the amount of copy — text — is 
minimal in most infographics. The general rule is that if a piece of text 
doesn’t add to a reader’s understanding of the topic, get rid of it.

112
Part II: Starting with Data 
Of course, including copy can be extremely useful. And because copy is so min­
imal, each word becomes all the more vital. Some different types of copy that 
you’d see in a typical infographic include the following, as shown in Figure 6-11:
	
✓	Title
	
✓	Introduction
	
✓	Section subheadings
	
✓	Chart and graph labels
	
✓	Data explainers
	
✓	Sources and footnotes
	
✓	Branding and copyright information
	
✓	Supporting narrative
Figure 6-11: Each piece of copy in an infographic plays an important role.

113
 Chapter 6: Discovering the Story
The following sections discuss each type in more detail.
Title
Your title tells your reader very quickly what the infographic is about. As 
such, a title should be informative yet also draw in the reader. Good titles are 
often catchy and creative, but they should also match the tone of your info­
graphic. Here’s an example of how the tone of a title can vary:
	
✓	Straightforward and serious: The Importance of Small Business
	
✓	Clever and catchy: Small Business, Big Impact
	
✓	Provocative and funny: It’s Not the Size That Matters
The approach you choose depends largely on the audience you’re hoping to 
attract and also where your infographic will be published.
Introduction
The first full sentences in your graphic explain to readers what they’re about 
to see. In essence, you want these few lines to sum what your graphic is as 
clearly and succinctly as possible. Of course, the approach you take for your 
intro matters quite a bit because you ideally want to draw readers in right 
from the start while also striking the right tone.
Section subheadings
Subheadings are used to identify different topics within the graphic as a whole, 
and they also help guide the reader from one section to the next. They serve 
the very practical purposes of directing the reader’s eye and providing visual 
breaks.
Chart and graph labels
Labels accompany data tables to help explain what’s being shown in the table. 
They generally consist of only a few words or even just one word.
Data explainers
Close cousins to chart labels, data explainers do just what their name indicates: 
They explain data, much like a caption explains a photograph. For instance, you 
might not want to literally use the following: “99.7% of employers are consid­
ered small businesses.” Instead, you might present the information as follows:
99.7%
Employers considered small businesses
The line of text is the data explainer. Presenting information this way — rather 
than as the earlier sentence — gives you more design freedom and allows you 
to heighten the impact of your data. Generally, a data explainer is treated as 

114
Part II: Starting with Data 
a standalone phrase, so the first word in the phrase is capitalized, and the 
phrase does not use a closing period.
Sources and footnotes
Some infographics provide footnotes for each particular piece of data. If you 
choose to do so, how you cite data is really a matter of following a house 
style or even just your preference. In some cases, you may need to use a spe­
cific academic citation style, such as MLA or APA. Typically, in a web graphic, 
simple superscript numbers follow the data point and correspond to a URL at 
the bottom of the infographic that links to the source of that figure.
Alternatively, you may choose not to use footnotes at all to avoid distracting the 
reader. In this case, just list all your sources at the bottom of the infographic, 
generally starting with those that provided you with the most information.
	
In either case, listing sources is absolutely vital to ensuring credibility. 
Readers should be able to verify your data.
Branding and copyright
If you’re designing infographics for a specific client, that client will probably 
require you to publish its name in some way. It may also want to ensure copy­
right protection. Often, the company name appears with or near source infor­
mation at the bottom of an infographic. Follow all orders set out by a client’s 
brand guidelines.
If you’re working on your own, chances are good that you’ll want your info­
graphic to be widely copied and shared. Still, you can protect your work from 
being stolen, inappropriately altered, or plagiarized by setting up some simple 
guidelines for reuse. One way to do this is to create a Creative Commons 
license. It’s simple to set up via http://creativecommons.org.
Supporting narrative
Supporting narrative copy frequently appears in text boxes that run alongside 
your visual elements, and here is where the amount of text will vary greatly 
depending on the topic and how you choose to illustrate your information. 
Some supporting narrative comprises only a few words, but the text you write 
for another infographic could include a great deal of context and analysis. 
What you don’t want to do is simply put in writing what’s already evident from 
your visuals. You need to ask yourself frequently: Is the text adding value?
Writing this type of copy certainly requires a deft touch. Often, you need to 
condense complex information into a small space without sacrificing accu­
racy or basic grammar. The key point to remember is that you don’t need to 
explain everything. Let your visuals do the heavy lifting.

A

wireframe is nothing more than a visual representation of your info­
graphic’s structure — actually a simple conceptual tool that can make 
your job as an infographic designer much easier. Like the outline of a term 
paper, the wireframe process will help provide structure to all the elements 
of your infographic. This is where you map out the best way to combine your 
graphics, text, and data into a strong, coherent visual plan.
The wireframe can help you determine how various text and data points will 
be illustrated and will reveal a visual roadmap of sorts. Which data points are 
most important? Where will the reader’s eye be drawn first?
This process can reveal flaws with data or problems with the narrative. Will 
the infographic be top-heavy? Boring in the middle? Lacking an ending punch? 
Maybe your wireframe seems light on details, which is a clue that the graphic 
is light on substance and might need some more research. A good wireframe 
also doesn’t give too much away; you don’t want to hamstring yourself or 
another designer by committing too heavily to a specific visual scheme.
If your infographic is being created for a client, the wireframe process is vital. 
Your client might want to have some approximation of the design before 
giving the green light to proceed with the project. And a good wireframe will 
help keep you from redoing work down the line.
This chapter delves into all these topics to help you start down the right path 
to creating your infographic.

118
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Outlining Your Wireframe
There is no single best strategy for designing a wireframe. Depending on the 
size and simplicity of the graphic, a rough sketch on paper or a whiteboard 
will do just fine. If your project is more complex (or you love working at 
your computer) you could use Microsoft Word or go right to Photoshop or 
Illustrator. Although more expensive and more high-tech than most projects 
would require, Microsoft Visio (a sophisticated diagramming software pro­
gram) is useful for mapping out more complex projects.
And how much time should you allot? Well, that’s really tough to quantify. It 
could really be a few minutes’ work on the back of an envelope, or it could 
take a couple of days. It depends on complexity, client relationship, deadline 
pressure, and more.
Regardless of the medium used to create your wireframe, it should consist of 
the following elements (see Figure 7-1):
	
✓	Spots for title and introduction
	
✓	Rough renderings of charts, graphs, and other data visualization
	
✓	Approximations of illustrations in use (whether you sketch something 
out or use a service like Shutterstock to find placeholder images)
	
✓	Spots for section headings (if you’re using them)
	
✓	Rough placement of data, particularly if the data will relate or connect to 
an element within the background of the visual itself
	
✓	Fonts and color palettes (optional)
Figure 7-1: Most infographics start with a sketch.

119
 Chapter 7: Creating Wireframes and Managing Mood Boards
Most infographics will follow, more or less, the same structure as a news 
article: Each infographic needs a title, a beginning (the introduction to the 
infographic), a middle (the body), and an end (generally, a call to action). 
Crafting your wireframe at the start of your project can help you guarantee 
that your infographic has those basic elements, which we discuss next.
The title: Creating the viewer’s first impression
Whether your infographic is for a print publication (newspaper, magazine, 
corporate report) or a website, information generally begins at the top and 
then trickles down. Either format has some advantages and presents some 
challenges to the designer.
The title of your infographic works like a newspaper headline. You have to grab 
the reader’s attention, and you have to set the stage for the content that fol­
lows. That means that language should be clear and your thesis — your main 
idea — must make sense. (Read more on theses in Chapters 4 and 5.) This is 
also the place to set a visual tone for your graphic, whether it’s whimsical or 
purely informational.
	
Some readers never go any farther than the headline, so the title of your 
graphic is really important. The title should be clever and catchy, and the 
illustrations with it should serve the title and theme in some way.
A well-planned title area could take one of several approaches:
	
✓	An illustration that encapsulates what’s being described in the title:
	
• I Wrecked My Car — What Should I Do Now?: This title area could 
show a drawing of a person in a car crash with a quizzical look on 
his face.
	
• The Wired World of Sports: This title image could be a collection of 
sports imagery (basketballs, footballs, baseball bats) rendered as 
computer chips.
	
✓	An illustration that fits with an overall visual metaphor:
	
• Navigating the Hospital of the Future: This title could be rendered as 
the sign atop a hospital building, as shown in Figure 7-2. It would 
set the tone nicely for a graphic that displayed its data as parts of 
a hospital — beds, rooms, surgical equipment, and so on.
	
• Science of Sleep: This title could be part of an overall theme that 
calls to mind antique medical books, with pencil-type sketches and 
ornate typography, as shown in Figure 7-3.
	
✓	A functional, utilitarian title with or without visual embellishment:
	
• What the Boss Doesn’t Know: The title for this could simply be large 
type of a font used throughout the graphic with color treatment 
that reinforces the palette selected.

Title are important, but they don’t have to be huge. While you’re mapping out 
your project, reserve about 80 to 90 percent of the physical space for the 
body of information. The title will take up roughly five to ten percent, as will 
the conclusion.

121
 Chapter 7: Creating Wireframes and Managing Mood Boards
The introduction: Presenting your 
most important data
Most infographics have some introductory text that sets the scene and deliv­
ers the most important information. Many principles of news writing come 
into play here. Taking a page from journalists, we provide some do’s and 
don’ts for effective infographic introductions in Table 7-1.
Table 7-1	
Writing Effective Infographic Introductions
Do
Don’t
Be concise and to the point.
Give too much away.
Tease the reader with a fact that 
encapsulates the infographic’s 
purpose.
Use information readers already know 
or present it in an unsurprising way.
Provide sufficient reason for readers 
to explore your infographic.
Use marketing jargon. Readers know 
when they’re being sold something.
By the time you’re sketching out this part of your wireframe, you should have 
truly absorbed all the data you’re using, and you should be able to answer a 
simple question: Why should anyone read this infographic? You’ve done a good 
job making a title that lures viewers in, but now you need to hold their inter­
est. Your introduction should do just that. If you find that the words just aren’t 
flowing, take another look at your data and ask yourself, “What’s the point?”
	
Your intro must be supported by the remainder of the information, so if an 
angle isn’t really illustrated in the infographic, don’t bring it up in your intro­
duction. For instance, don’t tell readers that your infographic will help them 
choose a college if the rest of the information is about college education in 
general but doesn’t provide any analysis about specific areas to consider 
when making a college choice.
The visual treatment of the introduction should generally follow the same 
principles as the title. You could weave it into an overall visual metaphor; 
you could render it in a style that fits with the overall tone of the infographic; 
or you could simply treat it as text.
	
Whatever the visual treatment, make sure that the introduction is connected 
somehow to the title, whether it’s through using a visual metaphor or simply 
placing the intro close to the title.

122
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
The body: Building the content of your infographic
After you construct a clever title and insightful introduction, the fun can begin. 
With 80–90 percent of the visual space in the infographic being devoted to the 
body of the piece, ensuring a smooth flow of visuals and information is key.
	
Every bit of information included in the infographic should serve to reinforce 
the title, intro, and basic premise of the graphic. If a bit of data is interesting 
but ultimately doesn’t help you make your point, get rid of it. Your readers 
will appreciate a tightly focused infographic that tells them only what they 
need to know to understand the point.
	
Make sure the body of the graphic supports and is supported by the title and 
intro. At the top of the graphic, you introduce the topic; but the middle of the 
infographic is all about proving your point.
One major benefit of using a traditional, vertical arrangement of an info­
graphic is that you can easily lead the reader through your information. Using 
a horizontal graphic can prove more challenging, forcing readers to go in the 
direction you desire. Either way, you must ensure the flow of information is 
logical. People should learn one bit of information before they learn the next, 
and each subsequent bit of data should naturally build on what came before.
Organizing information, like the following, does not create a logical, effective 
flow:
Incorrect flow of information
Title, intro
Offer solutions to problem
Introduce problem
Explore history and context of problem
Here is a much better approach to organizing information that creates a 
logical, effective flow:
Correct flow of information
Title, intro (lead-in text)
Introduce problem
Explore history and context of problem
Offer solutions

123
 Chapter 7: Creating Wireframes and Managing Mood Boards
The job of an infographic designer is clear: You do all the work as the writer/
designer/developer to make sure readers get the information they need and 
nothing else. In the previous example, it may be tempting to reveal the solu­
tion to the problem first, particularly if that’s the newest bit of information 
you have. But that would mean that you wouldn’t be building your case for 
the solution first: rather like knowing the end of a book before you read it.
Proper flow can also help eliminate any misinterpretation of the data. By 
placing data in proper context, you ensure that readers get an accurate, com­
plete picture of the thesis of the infographic. When you’re working on your 
wireframe, consider any of these elements to help you organize your data:
	
✓	Section headings and subheadings
	
✓	Clearly labeled charts and graphs
	
✓	Consistent use of color throughout
	
✓	Illustrations that connect accurately to data
The call-to-action: Drawing a strong conclusion
When your reader reaches the end of the infographic, what do you want him 
to do next? Or, how do you want him to feel? These are questions you should 
answer while you’re compiling your data and writing your narrative. Often, 
the answer will reveal itself as you are sketching out your wireframe.
Here are a few common takeaways from infographics:
	
✓	I now see a problem (in the field of education, economics, business, 
science, medicine, and so forth) needs to be addressed.
	
✓	I agree/disagree with a political standpoint.
	
✓	I have a better understanding of the nuances of a problem.
	
✓	I learned something about the history of a topic that changes/reinforces 
my opinions on that topic.
	
✓	I will buy a particular product.
	
If readers get to the end of the infographic and realize they’ve learned noth­
ing and no new information or position has been revealed to them, they’ll 
consider their time wasted.
Some infographics feature a clear call to action that might motivate readers to 
do something, such as quit smoking, vote for a certain candidate, or support 
a charity.

124
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
As you’re working on your wireframe, think about whether the content flows 
logically to the conclusion you intended. If it doesn’t, this is a good time to 
revise earlier sections: Add more information, take out data that doesn’t sup­
port your point, or perhaps add an illustration to reinforce your message.
	
Regardless of whether your conclusion is obvious or subtle, the most impor­
tant thing is that you hint at it in the intro and that every bit of data rein­
forces it and naturally leads readers to that destination.
Editing Your Story
Wireframing is a preliminary process, and you’ll probably have plenty of time 
to change your plan as you build your infographic. Perhaps your research will 
lead you to rewrite your title. Maybe you’ll decide to emphasize a new ele­
ment of the story, requiring you to redesign at least some of the infographic.
Still, it’s never too soon to start editing your story. Infographics must present 
information as clearly and concisely as possible. So, while you’re mapping 
out your graphic, make sure that everything you include — text, art, charts, 
and so on — supports your main idea. While you’re sketching out your ideas, 
ask yourself whether every component supports your main idea. If it doesn’t, 
ditch it. This can prevent you from wasting time later.
Clarifying the “big idea”
Your infographic no doubt will have a variety of subtopics, sections, and 
types of information. But in all those various elements, there should always 
be one nugget of information or one conclusion that’s more important than 
everything else. If a reader had to tell a friend what your infographic was 
about, have you given that reader the tools to do so?
That single big idea doesn’t always have to be groundbreaking; in many 
cases, you won’t be revealing brand-new information. But that doesn’t mean 
the core of the infographic can’t still be new and surprising to people.
Say you have information on how much time the average person spends watch­
ing TV. By itself, that’s probably information your reader doesn’t have, so it is 
new even if it’s not particularly interesting. What if you were able to compare 
that information with another piece of data, though? For instance, the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics conducts an American Time Use Survey, which shows that 
Americans spend 18 minutes per day reading, and 2.7 hours watching TV. Now 
a picture is revealed about the relative value people place on various activities.

125
 Chapter 7: Creating Wireframes and Managing Mood Boards
As an infographic designer, you can connect the dots in ways that illuminate 
the numbers while tickling the readers’ sense of humor and curiosity. By 
doing the math, you see that people watch TV for nine times as many min­
utes as they read. So, perhaps you could play around with one drawing of a 
book and nine drawings of TVs.
	
The point is that having data isn’t enough: You need to provide context and 
analysis of that data. That will allow you to present that one big idea that res­
onates with readers long after they finish your infographic.
In your wireframe, now it’s time to consider which type of graphic element — 
pie charts, bar charts, among others — provides the best support for your 
main idea.
For instance, if you have groups of numbers totaling 100 percent, using a pie 
chart may seem like the logical choice. But other ways of representing 100 
may be more visually interesting and just as accurate. Say, for example, your 
percentages are 25%, 25%, 40%, and 10%. Using 100 people-shaped icons, as 
shown in Figure 7-4, you could shade them appropriately and create a more 
memorable but still totally accurate chart.
Figure 7-4: Show percentages in creative ways.

126
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 7-5 is another creative way of showing the same data.
Figure 7-5: A modified pie chart.
	
A pie chart seems as easy as . . . well, pie. It can be a fine way to show a very 
drastic difference between a large percentage and a small percentage. But for 
more complex surveys, a pie chart may be too simplistic. For example, if a 
survey breaks out results in ten different percentages, the text required to 
label each piece of the pie may clutter your infographic and may be hard 
to read.
Conceptualizing an overall layout
Having a theme in mind as you work can be helpful, but it’s not mandatory. 
After you have your information together and have some idea of the types of 
charts and illustrations you’ll use, you may have several ideas for an overall 
theme or particular layout.
The topics shown in Table 7-2 are all broad topics that have obvious, familiar, 
and well-known visual imagery that people associate with them.

127
 Chapter 7: Creating Wireframes and Managing Mood Boards
Table 7-2	
Broad Topics and Their Associated Imagery
Topic
Associated imagery
Environment
Trees, animals, leaves, water, Earth

Economics
Currency, coins, dollar signs, green colors
Food
Food items, drinks, culinary tools, eating utensils
Sports
Balls, players, coaches, fields, arenas
Space
Planets, rockets, comets, stars
	
If your topic doesn’t lend itself immediately to attractive visual images, you 
may want to run a quick Internet search to see how others have illustrated 
your topic. Or, rather than trying to brainstorm specific images, you may 
want to think of your topic in general terms. For example, if you are working 
on an infographic on the consumer price index, broaden your focus to 
economics.
Some topics lend themselves to integrating the data into the background 
imagery, as we describe in this list:
	
✓	If you have information about forest health, use the background of a 
forest and create illustrations that play off that. For instance, use leaves 
and tree trunks to illustrate percentages, or make your bar graphs look 
like branches.
	
✓	If your infographic is about gasoline consumption around the world, 
create a street scene that depicts cars painted with the national flags 
driving down a street. Or, you could make the cars sized proportional to 
their consumption, so the real gas-guzzlers are larger than the cars from 
countries that use less gas.
	
✓	A cutaway of a house could give you a fun way to depict spending and 
budgeting. If the family spent $1,200 on their TV, show the TV displaying 
that dollar amount on its screen. Maybe they spend $300 a week on gro­
ceries; have a family member open the refrigerator door to reveal a milk 
carton with the dollar amount on the carton.
You may have ideas on a theme well before you begin researching and writ­
ing, and the wireframe is a great way to get them down on paper before com­
mitting. The risk of planning a theme before you do a bit of research is that 
the data you reveal may not fit into that plan, and you will have to rethink 
things if you paint yourself into a corner.
	
In the end, allow the data to guide the visual, not the other way around.

128
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Visualizing transitions
In writing, transitions help content flow logically from point to point. Without 
transitions, content can become terribly stilted. The same is true for good 
design. You should be as thoughtful in creating visual transitions in your 
wireframe as you are in crafting your narrative.
Section headers can provide natural transition points, but don’t rely on them 
completely to reinforce your theme. Consider varying colors of the back­
grounds of section headers or creating unique imagery that fits within the 
overall visual to go with each one, so that readers have subtle visual cues 
leading them through the infographic.
The layout of your infographic should work with the way the human eye 
functions. We naturally read from top to bottom and from left to right. At the 
same time, our eyes subtly seek out transitions that lead us from one piece of 
information to another. Without them, your infographic can appear choppy, 
or can seem to be a random assortment of charts.
Sometimes, you’ll see obvious cues, like a timeline or arrows. Other times, a 
simple change in color provides the cue. Here’s an example, in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-6: Use clear transitions in your infographic.

129
 Chapter 7: Creating Wireframes and Managing Mood Boards
Some graphic elements will lend themselves naturally to transitions between 
points of data and between sections. Those include
	
✓	Flowcharts
	
✓	Process illustrations
	
✓	Themes with roads or paths
	
✓	Timelines
	
✓	Side-by-side comparisons
	
✓	Growth charts
Use of color is helpful, too, providing a subconscious transition from one sec­
tion to another. A change in color, even if it is subtle, can help the reader’s 
eye make the transition into the next part of the graphic. See Chapter 8 for 
more about developing a color palette for your infographic and incorporating 
patterns and textures.
Mapping your illustrations
After you have a solid idea of all the different types of illustrations you’ll need, 
lay them into your wireframe. Exact placement isn’t critical at this stage, but 
you do want to begin to get a feel for overall size and distance around each 
illustration. Use placeholders — rough sketches or dummy type (refer to 
Figure 7-1) — to stand in as needed.
Arrange the illustrations or their proxies according to the vision in your 
mind. Place the intro and title illustrations (if they exist); otherwise, leave 
adequate space for them. Place subheadings, whether the font is chosen yet 
or not.
Then, when you get everything arranged according to your vision, look at the 
picture as a whole. Is one side too heavy or light with charts? Do you have 
too many of the same types of illustrations in one section? If so, consider 
changing placement or rethink the type of illustration.
Blocking: Creating a visual roadmap
Placing text and art elements — a simple process known as “blocking” — will 
give you a good visual plan. The amount of detail in your wireframe will 
vary depending on the type of graphic. A timeline probably won’t be highly 
detailed, but a more complex infographic in which you are weaving informa­
tion into a visual theme will be.
	
As always, step back. Make sure to look at your wireframe with a critical eye. 
Are you putting too much emphasis in the wrong section? Does the flow seem 
natural?

130
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Here are a few things to avoid:
	
✓	Sparse areas
	
✓	Overly busy areas
	
✓	Juxtaposed illustrations that might create inaccurate impressions
	
✓	Overly long subheadings
	
✓	Too many chart types in one area or overall
	
✓	Charts that are too long or too short to provide the best context
By this point in the process, you should really start to see the piece come 
together. Ideally, your work on the wireframe will make the final design go 
more quickly and smoothly.
Working with Fonts
One last component of your wireframing process should be choosing — or 
at least thinking about — font choice. As we discuss in Chapter 3, sometimes 
clients will require you to use certain fonts. If that’s the case, just jot them 
down on your wireframe, and perhaps do a quick review of your computer to 
make sure you have all the fonts you’ll need.
If you’re not working with preordained guidelines, the wireframing phase is a 
great time to plot out your own font choices.
	
A wireframe is really a rough draft, and you can always revise as you go.
Choosing text styles
As with any type of design, there is a hierarchy in fonts. Appropriately sized 
typography shows the reader which information is most important. The same 
way a news page designer wants the top headline to be the largest and most 
dominant, infographic designers want the title font to be the largest.
Effective design varies font size and weight in smart ways. Here are some of 
the different elements that will need typographical consideration, including 
overall font choice, size, and weight: 
	
✓	Title and intro
	
✓	Section headings
	
✓	Section intros

131
 Chapter 7: Creating Wireframes and Managing Mood Boards
	
✓	Body text
	
✓	Body text with special emphasis
	
✓	Chart intros
	
✓	Chart labels
	
✓	Image captions
	
✓	Callout bubbles
	
✓	Ending text/call to action
Not only will organizing the text into general guidelines by size help guide 
the reader, but it will help speed up the work you’ll need to do to finish your 
graphic. You will be able to look at any given piece of text and know immedi­
ately what size it needs to be.
	
Text sizes in general should follow some sense of hierarchy and proportion. 
You don’t want to call too much attention (“highlight”) text by making it 
larger if it’s not all that important.
Following the three-font rule
Variety is the spice of good design, but when it comes to fonts, the wise 
designer knows when enough is enough. Choosing more than three typefaces 
puts you at risk of making your infographic look like a ransom note or com­
munity newsletter.
Choose font families that have several options for weights to help you to 
create a seamless flow because your typefaces will fit together. This will keep 
you from needing to choose another typeface for a specific purpose. In gen­
eral, opting for a serif, sans serif, and special display typeface should provide 
you with plenty of variation to make your infographic eye catching.
	
When combining typefaces, don’t simply pick randomly or choose fonts that 
you personally prefer. You should have a good reason for choosing the fonts 
you choose. To that end, these guidelines can help you pick fonts:
	
✓	Use typefaces that provide complementary moods to reinforce the 
overall feel of your infographic, whether it’s upbeat or more somber. For 
example, don’t use a whimsical font for a serious topic.
	
✓	Avoid using fonts that are too similar to each other; this creates visual 
dissonance and can be seen by readers as a mistake. By the same token, 
don’t choose typefaces that are wildly disparate. See an example in 
Figure 7-7.

Figure 7-7: Not the best font choices.
	
✓	Use distinctive fonts, but not everywhere. If you want to use a very dra­
matic font, make sure the typefaces around it are more neutral.
	
✓	When in doubt, stick with two typefaces that provide a huge range of 
weights and choices. A well-chosen pairing should give you all the fonts 
you need. See Figure 7-8.
	
Chances are that your boss, or the client who hired you, is willing to take a 
look at your wireframe at this point, too. Take the opportunity to find out 
whether you’re on the right track, and whether all those elements you’ve 
sketched out are leading the reader to the right conclusion. If you aren’t, it’s a 
lot easier to make changes at the wireframe stage than during the creation of 
the infographic itself.
If you’re working with a client, you may want to establish early whether she 
wants to approve your wireframe. Taking a little extra time to share your 
vision and make sure it’s in line with the client’s needs can save hours of 
work later on.

133
 Chapter 7: Creating Wireframes and Managing Mood Boards
Figure 7-8: Font pairings should work 
harmoniously with each other.
Putting Your Mood Board to Work
As we talk about elsewhere in the book, a mood board is a collage or collec­
tion of images, colors, typography, and other art elements that allow you to 
show the direction you’re headed — and that’s a really useful thing in the 
early stage of a project to help you organize your thoughts. Knowing what 
you want the overall effect to be, or the style you want to use, will focus your 
efforts.
Your mood board can also be used in early discussions with your client. The 
mantra “Show, don’t tell” should be pinned up somewhere in your studio. 
(After all, it applies to much of the infographic process.) Verbally describing 
the style you plan to use leaves room for confusion. Using visuals, displayed 
neatly for a client to study, can provide a much clearer sense of your ideas.
	
You don’t have to reveal every element of your finished product in a mood 
board. They’re simply a way to organize your preferences and test what 
works.

134
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Some art departments make a conscious practice of keeping inspiration, 
from a variety of sources, visible for the team. That’s a great idea. But you 
can develop your own mood boards, whether they’re as old-school as images 
stuck to a bulletin board or as modern as a Pinterest site.
Now, what’s the difference between a mood board and a wireframe? In some 
cases, they may be very similar. But in general, mood boards loosely orga­
nize your preferences for design, while a wireframe is a true rough draft of 
a specific project. You can draw on your mood boards as you create your 
wireframe. You can also add to a mood board at any time, and come back to 
it for inspiration for many different projects. It may be part of your quest to 
develop your custom style, as we discuss in Chapter 8.
By contrast, you’ll be done with your wireframe as soon as you’ve turned it 
into a finished infographic.
Working with mood boards in the digital age
Keeping a mood board in a digital space is easy and fun. Flickr (www.
flickr.com) is a suitable vehicle, and a variety of other programs are 
available in which artists and clients can work collaboratively in a shared 
visual space. Pinterest (www.pinterest.com) has become one of the 
most frequently used ways to keep mood boards organized. It’s an intuitive 
and elegant way to keep track of great ideas.
To work in Pinterest, sign up and create a profile. It’s free. Then create as 
many boards as you like, perhaps one for each project. Or, you could create 
boards for “color palettes,” “favorite fonts,” “amazing infographics I’ve seen,” 
and so on.
In the upper right of the Pinterest interface, look for a plus-sign (+) symbol. 
Click that, and the resulting drop-down menu gives you choices to upload a 
pin from your hard drive, add a pin from a website, or create a new board.
So, create your mood board and add collaborators if you like. That could be 
co-workers or clients — whoever you want to be able to see and add to the 
board. By default, boards are public and searchable on the web.
	
We recommend “following” people or companies with content that inspires 
you. If you follow enough good contributors, you’ll get fresh inspiration every 
time you log onto the site. When you see something you want to keep, “Like” 
or repin it to one of your own boards.

Designing Around a Theme
In This Chapter
▶	Choosing visual elements that match your topic
▶	Learning to work with a client’s brand guidelines
▶	Choosing a custom style for your graphic
▶	Getting inspired from outside sources
T

here’s a fine line in infographics: They must be eye-catching enough to 
attract readers yet subtle enough to maintain clarity and fit in with the 
style guides of the newspaper, magazine, or website that will publish them. 
Establishing a theme can be a great way to enliven a pie chart or bar chart, 
and marry art with data. And in complex graphics with multiple parts, a 
theme often unifies the package.
USA Today uses lots of themes in its infographics. Their artists turn an ordinary 
pie chart on pitching averages into a baseball. It’s simple, effective, and eye-
catching. Or, a bar chart on smoking trends to look like . . . what else? Cigarettes 
spilling out of a pack.
In this chapter, we will talk about how to use those whimsical thematic ele­
ments without distracting readers from the content. We talk about how to 
design creatively while working within a client’s brand guidelines and color 
palettes. We’ll show you how choice of fonts and graphic style and the use of 
textures and patterns can spotlight the most important information. And we 
give you some suggestions on how and where to find inspiration when your 
creative well runs dry.

136

Matching Visuals to Your Topic
By now, if you have secured your assignment and gathered your data, you 
may already have a brilliant idea for a theme. Be careful, though — creating a 
theme should take up only about five percent of your creative power. Making 
it work with your information will be another 91 percent. (That leaves about 
three percent for hand-wringing and one percent for excuse-making when you 
have to start over.) Your brilliant ideas may not sit well with those that are 
waiting for you to produce. To please a client, an editor, or an art director, you 
may need a backup plan.
	
Have five good ideas for a theme. It helps to put your big idea down on paper, 
and then physically move it aside. Then brainstorm another four ideas. Some 
might be better than your original thought. Some might be boring to you but 
exactly what your client wants. Or, maybe you got it right the first time, and 
your initial sketch does become the final theme. Either way, the brainstorm­
ing process really helps stimulate creativity. Getting your first idea out of the 
way — literally and figuratively — gives you the space to generate new ideas.
You are setting the tone for this graphic. Don’t think of anything as a bad 
idea. Only think in terms of better ideas, and ultimately, the best.
As we discuss in Chapter 7, doing rough sketches of your graphics is a power­
ful way to organize your information and make sure that your graphic is well 
thought-out. It can also help you generate ideas for a theme. You can con­
sider a wireframe or opt for any other organizational scheme. Drawing noth­
ing more than boxes on a sheet of paper can help you map out an infographic 
and drum up ideas for a theme. Here’s one way to use a sketch to lead you to 
your visual theme:
	
1.	Organize information by including the following items in roughly this 
order:
	
a.	Branding logo or company name, if applicable
	
b.	Headline
	
c.	Major point, with a chart to show statistics
	
d.	Major point breakdown; perhaps another chart to illuminate an inter­
esting subtopic
	
e.	Outlook for future, and any additional charts
	
f.	Branding logo, if it works better here than at the top

137
 Chapter 8: Designing Around a Theme
	
2.	Now ask yourself some questions about your topic:
	
•	Does your subject and storyline have something in common? A famous 
song? Sporting event? Holiday? Saying? Cliché? Nursery rhyme? It 
doesn’t have to be a perfect fit, but thinking of these links can spur 
creativity.
	
•	Does your storyline have a logo or iconic symbol associated with it? 
For instance, breast cancer research uses a pink ribbon to identify 
the cause. Can you implement that in your design?
	
•	Does your storyline have a pop culture connotation? If your info­
graphic is about the top-grossing movies of the year, you might tie 
in movie reels, popcorn, or an Oscar statuette.
	
•	Can you design around a headline? Sometimes a catchy headline 
will allow you to play out a theme by simply breaking it down. For 
instance, “A Stitch in Time” could be used as a theme in a graphic 
about wedding gown designers.
	
3.	Sketch out the basic theme to see how the information from Step 1 fits 
into the theme from beginning to end.
	
	 At this point, you may really be sketching your artistic elements. They’ll 
still be very rough, but doing some actual drawing will help you make 
sure that your artistic theme is clear and supports the main idea of your 
infographic.
Figure 8-1 is a piece of our graphic with a personal finance theme showing 
how Americans are trying to get their finances back into shape. To represent 
the American people, a stylized Uncle Sam is used in a gym training scenario 
to illustrate multiple financial statistics. For instance, Uncle Sam’s jump rope 
is a fever line chart that tracks revolving debt and bankruptcy filings.
	
Ever shut your eyes to concentrate and come up with an idea only to get zilch? 
It’s happened to us, too. Thanks to the Internet, though, inspiration can come 
with a few keystrokes. For a quick kick in the creative behind, take a look at 
online photo sites such as Shutterstock or Depositphotos. You can search by 
theme and get a wealth of new ideas to inspire you. Also, check out the 
“Finding Inspiration” section, later in this chapter, for a wealth of sources — 
both online and off — to get your creative juices flowing.
	
Your graphics should reflect the information, not the other way around. The 
information is the most important thing here, so visuals should come second. 
Many times, a great artistic idea may not work with the information, or may 
even distract from it. If that happens to you, throw out that idea and start 
again, perhaps saving it for a future project.

Figure 8-1: Use a consistent theme throughout several elements of 
your graphic.
Following Brand Guidelines
A typical assignment for our graphics firm is to create infographics for a 
corporate interest or business that will publish them on a company website. 
In some cases, the graphic will be used for an internal company publication. 
These graphics usually have to follow a specific set of design parameters so 
that the company’s identity can easily be recognized.

139
 Chapter 8: Designing Around a Theme
Sometimes, the client company provides brand guidelines. In a case like this, 
your theme has been chosen for you — to support and promote the company 
or its cause. The company may have provided some of the art elements, too. 
Regardless, everything you design must fit with their mission.
Depending on the size of the company, these design rule books can be as long 
as 200 pages, filled with strict regulations meant to corral wayward design­
ers into the company pen. This is understandable. Companies rely on con­
sistency of color, font, tone, and more, to establish and protect their brand 
image and copyrights. Designers are artists, innately geared to rebel. Brand 
guidelines are a useful tool in uniting the two parties.
Using guidelines for logos, color, and font
In general, brand guidelines provide specifications for these elements:
	
✓	Logo treatment: How a logo can look and should look. Guidelines on 
the logo may include how it should be displayed, how to resize it with 
the correct ratios, or how to use alternate versions, such as a darker 
reverse. (Take a look at Figure 8-2 to see Infographic World’s logo; this is 
how we would expect to see it reproduced in any publication.)
Figure 8-2: Using brand guidelines to maintain 
consistency in logos.
	
✓	Color palettes: Many companies spend millions of dollars to have their 
branding designed by a “colorist” or “packaging designer.” The simple 
fire-engine red bulls-eye of Target department stores is unmistakable. 
Small children learn very quickly that red and yellow means McDonald’s. 
And, not to toot our own horn, but readers looking for the best how-to 
books on the market know to seek out the yellow and black of the For 
Dummies franchise.

140
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
	To ensure consistency of their brand identity, companies mandate the 
range of colors a publication should use when reproducing their logos. 
You will often see the colors of the corporate logo, plus a range of second­
ary colors that the client uses in its marketing materials and publications. 
Figure 8-3 shows a swatch of colors, which is what you typically receive 
when designing an infographic for a client with specific brand guidelines.
Figure 8-3: Providing specifications on colors 
and tones.
	
✓	Font usage: Many companies use a certain font to cement their brand 
identity. They’ve done the hard work of choosing a recognizable typeface 
for their company; it’s your duty to carry it throughout their graphics. 
Many times a font included in a brand guidelines package is designed for 
that company and no one else. (See Figure 8-4.)
Figure 8-4: Maintaining 
consistent fonts in 
infographics.

141
 Chapter 8: Designing Around a Theme
Working with your client’s specifications
Following brand guidelines can make your job easier, dramatically cutting down 
on the time you’d spend searching for the “perfect” font or color. Sometimes, 
guideline booklets even suggest a specific type of illustration or graphic that 
the client likes. Follow their lead, and you’ll probably have a happy client.
	
1.	Discuss brand guidelines with your clients. 
	
	 Most clients will be happy to send their guidelines to you as a PDF, via 
e-mail.
	
2.	Have the client send you the fonts they prefer.
	
	 Fonts can be costly. Buying an entire family of fonts can run into the hun­
dreds of dollars. Often, clients will send you their fonts for your one-time 
use in creating their materials.
	
3.	Keep in mind the sizing of the graphic and its usage.
	
	 Printed material, advertising, animated content, and web graphics have 
varying size requirements, all of which can affect your design. For instance, 
a graphic used in a newspaper may call for a certain height and column 
width, whereas an assignment for a web graphic may specify pixel size.
Give the client a rough draft of the graphic showing their guidelines clearly 
applied to your work. This will signal the client that you were aware of the 
rules and implemented them.
Keep it in the font family
You can’t use artist’s drawings or writer’s words 
without proper attribution. If a piece of work is 
protected by a copyright, it cannot be repro­
duced without permission. Fonts present a simi­
lar situation and a bit of a gray area.
A little-known difference between fonts and 
typefaces: A typeface is the artistic treatment of 
letters, numbers, and symbols, applied consis­
tently. A font is the computer file or program that 
tells the computer to use a certain typeface.
In the United States, typefaces are not covered 
by copyright law. Courts have determined that 
they are basic “utilitarian” objects that don’t 
need protection. However, courts have ruled 
in favor of protecting fonts. The most common 
copyright protection comes in the form of End 
User License Agreements, which may state that 
the font is licensed for use on only one com­
puter. If that’s the case, do not start swapping 
and copying fonts with friends or colleagues.
While you are starting out as an infographic 
designer, stick to the fonts that come with your 
design software. Nowadays, the choices are 
pretty extensive. Plenty of fonts and font fami­
lies are also available for purchase, but you 
might find that most projects are well-served 
by fonts you already own.

142
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Designing a Custom Style
If information is the engine that drives a graphic, style is the Porsche 911 
body of the car. The style grabs the reader, excites the senses, and makes 
you want to spend time checking out the product. The information is the only 
reason this baby is running, but the style of the graphic can make it fly.
Style is relative to the audience. Readers of The New York Times will expect 
their infographics to look different than the graphics published in USA Today. 
Both create great graphics, but you’d never confuse one for the other. That’s 
what style is all about.
While creating your own style, you focus on four main design elements: 
colors, fonts, illustrations, and textures or patterns, all of which are visible in 
Figure 8-5. You won’t use all of these elements every time. For example, some 
graphics will feature plain backgrounds, without any texture. Some simple 
charts, such as an infographic showing the latest unemployment figures, may 
not need illustration. But in general, the relationship between those elements 
is what ultimately creates your style as an infographic artist.
The key to styling a graphic is to make it attractive to look at while not dis­
tracting from the information. Graphics have to be legible and compelling. 
The reader has to want to read the graphic and get your desired message. So, 
again, simple rules can make your graphics more effective and more attractive.
The red, white, and blue in the client’s logo (refer to Figure 8-5) helped the 
designer pick the Uncle Sam theme, keeping with the patriotic colors; whereas, 
the green adds contrast and draws attention to important items. Texture (the 
dotted backgrounds) helps to visually organize the sections, and the digital 
font on the statistics looks as though they’re coming right from Uncle Sam’s 
calculator. Finally, the clear, legible font in the body and headline copy is Arial.
Creating color palettes
There was a time when many infographics were designed and printed in 
black-and-white only. Most newspapers reserved color for the front page, and 
(of course) the Internet didn’t exist.
Today, most graphics are designed with the potential to work across media 
platforms. That means that the whole world of color is available to graphic 
designers. Color is an easy way to enhance the artistic elements of your 
graphic — and when done well, can make a graphic leap off the page or screen.
	
Approach using color as systematically as you approach the rest of your 
design. An editor once told us that adding color to an illustration that didn’t 
enhance the accompanying text was “Putting lipstick on a pig.” All the color 
in the world won’t make up for a graphic that doesn’t work.
Here are a few tips on color that will work with your custom theme.

Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Using color to set a tone
Every story has a tone or level of emotion that needs to be conveyed. If the 
information is a call for action, consider more exciting tones in the yellow 
and orange range. If the information is more somber and muted, so should 
the colors: Think blues and muted violets. At times, the theme can really help 
determine your color palette. For example, an infographic about economics 
might feature green, black, and gray tones, calling to mind dollar bills.
Developing a color palette
Whether to satisfy a client’s guidelines or to solidify your own style, you may 
want to create a color palette (as shown in Figure 8-6) for your work.
Figure 8-6: Using a color palette.
Remember the color wheel you worked with in childhood art class? All the 
rules you learned back then still apply. In short:
	
✓	Colors opposite each other on the color wheel complement each other, 
creating visual appeal and excitement. See Figure 8-7.
	
✓	Colors next to each other match each other, and can be used together to 
create harmonious design.
	
✓	Red, yellow, and orange are warm colors; green, blue, and purple are 
cool colors. Choosing one group over another is a simple but effective 
way to create a certain mood.

145
 Chapter 8: Designing Around a Theme
You will naturally prefer some colors and come back to them repeatedly. 
Over time, using your favorite colors and others that complement them can 
become part of your signature style.
A neat way to devise your own personal color palette to revisit for each proj­
ect is the Adobe Kuler tool (https://kuler.adobe.com). The Kuler tool 
is a color inspiration community where you can browse color schemes other 
users have uploaded. You can also create your own color themes. Then, if 
you save a color palette on the Kuler website, it will automatically import to 
your Kuler tool in Illustrator.
Several other color palette websites can help you choose the perfect palette for 
your graphic. Do a Google search for “color palette generator” or “color palette 
creator.” You will get a host of tools for developing functional color palettes.
Sampling colors
We delve deeply into the wonders of Adobe Photoshop in Chapter 10, but for 
now, here’s a cool trick that can help you while you’re working with color. If 
you have a photo you plan to use in your graphic, Photoshop’s Eyedropper 
tool lets you sample colors from it. It’s easy and fun; you use an eyedropper-
shaped tool to click a color from the photo. The eyedropper takes that color 
and makes it the foreground. This helps your design in two ways:
	
✓	You can match the tones of your graphic with those of the photo.
	
✓	You have a standard that you’ve already found appealing.
	
And, don’t be afraid to experiment. Particularly if you have some time before 
your deadline, why not try your infographic in a few different colors? This 
will show you how color choice can affect the entire look and mood of an 
infographic.

other on the color wheel.

Feeling out the right fonts
In the early days of infographic design, artists sometimes got a bit carried 
away by all the exciting possibilities for illustrating the news. Much of the 
work was drawn by hand, including our headlines. We used the fonts we saw 
in magazines, on album covers, or on billboards. Our fonts looked great at 
the time, but now make our graphics look as dated as a 1950s magazine.
Today, technology has given us many more options (so it’s highly unlikely 
you’ll be crafting any headlines by hand) that add elegance and consistency 
to prevent your work from looking dated in another 20 years. Adobe Creative 
Suite offers hundreds of font faces. Regular, Medium, and Bold-faced fonts 
have given way to Light, Light Extended, and Light Condensed. The number 
of fonts has multiplied dramatically, and if your software doesn’t offer a font 
you want, thousands more are at your digital fingertips, available for down­
load. Here are some tips on choosing a font that will work for your project:
	
✓	Take stock of the fonts you have in your personal library. It pays to 
look around and get a feel for what you have in your computer’s font 
library. You will be surprised at the variations and styles that are at your 
disposal.
	
✓	Keep a font favorites list. When designing a graphic, we have a list of 
go-to fonts we love to work with. Some fonts lend themselves better to 
headlines; others are great for body text. We like to keep track of a few 
headline and body-text pairs as go-to choices for any infographics proj­
ect. Figure 8-8 shows some of our favorites. 
Figure 8-8: Maintaining a list of favorite fonts.
	
✓	Consider your preference for sans fonts or serif fonts. Sans fonts — 
also known as sans serif fonts — are typefaces that do not have a little 
toe or spike on the ends of the letters. Serif fonts have a toe or spike on 

147
 Chapter 8: Designing Around a Theme
the ends. For instance, Times is a serif font. Helvetica is a sans font. In 
general, we tend to use sans fonts, but sometimes a headline just works 
with a serif font. If the headline is a serif font, we generally make the 
body text a sans font.
	
✓	Decide whether your projects call for bold, light, or regular fonts. This 
is normally an easy choice. Bold fonts are most often used in headlines 
and portions of the graphic you would like to call attention to. Regular 
or light fonts tend to be body text and labels that need to be played back 
in a design.
	
✓	Remember to read the branding guidelines to see whether the client 
insists on using a specific font. Brand guidelines will spell out font usage 
and many times, include the font with the guideline package.
	
✓	Experiment with fonts that are unfamiliar. Take a moment to try out a 
font that you may not have run across, but remember to strike the right 
chord with the tone of your graphic. For example, a Black Extended font 
may not work with a story or project about yoga. It may look too leaden 
and heavy; whereas, a lighter but equally elegant script font may help 
illustrate the theme. (See Figure 8-9.)
Figure 8-9: A stylized font looks right at home in a yoga-themed graphic.

148
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
✓	Don’t overdo it: Sometimes in an attempt to add visual excitement, a 
graphic’s design can fall short because of bad font uses, overly busy sec­
tions, or odd font alignments. In Figure 8-10, a skewed effect to the head­
line, a 3D tilt, and contrasting angles make the information hard to read.
Figure 8-10: This infographic fizzles because of an over-attempt to dazzle.
	
Take a tour of some font sites on the web. Just searching for fonts will gener­
ally be enough to peek at what’s out there. While looking, keep a wish list of 
fonts you would like to work with. When times are tough and you’re tired of 
the same-old look and feel, consult the list.
When searching for the right font for your theme, try several font websites. 
Many sites will let you try the font out by typing it and seeing how your head­
line looks in that font. You can then take it to your graphic and see how it 
plays with your design before buying.
Including illustrations
A good infographic (obviously) should include good art. Illustrations promote 
the storyline, define elements visually, and brighten a page that might other­
wise be filled with gray type. An illustration can be a physical drawing, some 
sort of chart or graph, or even a time line. Our everyday lives are filled with 
examples of how illustrations entertain and inform: Consider simple elements 
like the icons on a TV remote control or the capital S and the P on salt and 
pepper shakers. Infographics rely similarly on clear, intriguing visual elements.
Your illustrations will be a major part of your infographic theme. They will 
help you carry home your message, cement the seriousness or humor of 
your work, and will attract and delight your readers.

149
 Chapter 8: Designing Around a Theme
	
The illustrations used in the infographic must reflect — not distract from — 
the information that the graphic is displaying.
To help you choose and use the right art in your graphic, follow these tips:
	
✓	Consider which type of art element can best present the information 
in your infographic. If your graphic depicts a scene, like devastation to 
forest trees after a storm, you’ll probably want to draw an illustration. If 
the information uses numbers to show a trend, a fever line chart might 
work. If the graphic breaks out percentages, a pie chart is effective. A 
comparative list of numbers over time may call for a bar chart.
	
✓	Sketch your graphic to help the client or your editor see what you’re 
going for with your design. Most people need help to see what you’re 
envisioning. After all, that’s why graphics are around in the first place: 
They break down elements of a story to increase the readers’ under­
standing. A quick sketch and explanation of the sketch will assist you in 
your presentation to the boss or client who may have to sign off on it.
	
✓	If you’re not producing the art yourself, include examples of the art­
ist’s work when presenting your graphic to a client or editor. You may 
know what kind of work the artist produces, but the editor/client won’t.
	
✓	Keep a file of graphics that you like. Refer to these when you need help 
generating ideas for future projects. Also, when dealing with a potential 
client, using sample illustrations to accompany your custom-themed 
graphic can help you share your vision.
Testing out textures and patterns
Sometimes you can’t rely on just the right information, design, and fonts. 
Texture and pattern can pack a punch in graphic design, subtle though they 
may be. Adding a texture or a pattern can provide a more polished graphic 
that adds visual appeal for the reader. These design elements can support 
your theme, by developing the mood of the piece and enhancing your art. For 
example, a light-hearted graphic on expenditures for a baby in its first year of 
life might have a background of pale blue and pink polka dots.
Adding textures and patterns to your infographic can also help you highlight 
different sections of the graphic or to spotlight the most important facts. 
Take a look at the subtle textures we show in Figure 8-11. Using one of them 
to highlight the thesis of your graphic can help ensure that the reader’s eyes 
go there. Using a different texture on other information (or no texture at all) 
can create a visual signal to move on to the next section.
Follow this cardinal rule when choosing texture, pattern, or background for 
your graphic: Will this help communicate the message of this graphic, or will it 
hinder it? In general, these features must be used sparingly. A light touch can 
enhance, but a heavy touch can make your graphic virtually unreadable.

150
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 8-11: Creating background textures in a graphic.
Textures and patterns are available in Photoshop and Illustrator (more on 
these in Chapters 9 and 10). When you choose a texture or pattern, the 
programs also allow you to choose the percentage of density. Opt for a low 
percentage — 30 percent, for example — and see whether you like it and 
whether you can read all the text. Then scale it up or down as you like. Using 
a lighter touch allows texture and pattern to play a subordinate role in the 
graphic and highlights the important parts of the information.
In a more complex graphic, adding a background pattern can unify the final 
product. Again, you’ll want to be subtle. In the segment of the graphic shown 
in Figure 8-12, the pattern doesn’t distract the eye — all the information 
remains fully legible — but the pattern adds a little depth and visual interest 
to the graphic, helping to draw in the reader.

 Chapter 8: Designing Around a Theme
Finding Inspiration
Customizing anything — a car, house, room, T-shirt, or web page — is noth­
ing short of a message from the heart. The customized piece leaves an 
impression of you when the work is done. Custom style is all in the name of 
the project, of course. But who is to say it’s for the client or editor alone? 
Ideally, your readers will connect with and embrace your customized info­
graphic’s theme.
When planning your theme, if you reach deep down into your very existence 
and come up with cobwebs, don’t panic. Sources for inspiration abound. 
When you need inspiration immediately, a few sources of graphics genius can 
be your best friend.
	
Targeted web searching can provide you inspiration. Try using specific 
search terms to find images that pertain to your subject. For example, try 
“life insurance icons,” or “term life insurance images” instead of simply 
searching “life insurance.”
For less-targeted searching and general browsing for ideas, take a tour of 
websites run by the graphics greats:

nent. Even its more feature-oriented graphics, without a strong news 
peg, will surprise you with their brilliance.

Designing Infographics in 
Adobe Illustrator
In This Chapter
▶	Arranging your workspace
▶	Getting to know basic Illustrator tools
▶	Working with common Illustrator effects
W

hen completing a graphic or illustration, it’s important to keep the 
details as simple as the information will allow. This way, the artwork 
gives way to the message you are trying to convey. The message is forever 
the most important objective.
That said, there is plenty of room left for a good drawing. Many times, simple 
shapes can bring home the point better than a photograph.
Adobe Illustrator, which debuted in the late 1980s, is the gold standard for 
graphic design across print and digital media. Graphics created in Illustrator 
are easy to resize, which makes it appealing for web graphics. Illustrator 
features allow you to polish and improve your art, lending your infographics 
some added polish and visual appeal. This full-featured and robust program 
can appear overwhelming, but with some practice, you’ll come to appreciate 
its many user-friendly features.
Setting Up Illustrator
Opening an Illustrator document can be pretty overwhelming. Upon first 
glimpse of this powerful program, it almost feels like a David and Goliath 
standoff. (You’re David, by the way.)
Illustrator can be intimidating, yes, but with a little patience and a goal, you 
can surely tame the giant and get it to work to your benefit. Taking the time to 
arrange your workspace can dramatically improve your efficiency. Illustrator 
includes a lot of tools that you can tailor to your own work habits and prefer­
ences. Start off by taking a look at how to use them.

154
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Navigating the workspace
Arranging the workspace (work area) simply means arranging panels and 
other workspace elements to best suit your needs. The Illustrator workspace 
allows you to organize elements so that your favorite tools are the most 
accessible. You can even make your own custom workspace; read how in 
“Making your own workspace.” And, if you are working on multiple projects 
at one time, you can run more than one workspace.
Windows and tools can be moved, deleted, or added to match the way you 
work. Spending some time upfront getting to know your way around Illustrator’s 
workspace can save you time down the line.
The first window you will see has a configuration that is straight-out-of-the-
box standard. After you open the program and start a new document (by 
choosing File➪New), a standard, letter-size page will appear.
Working with toolbars and palettes
Illustrator organizes its tools into a few bars. Here’s a look at where you can 
find some of the program’s main features.
The tools panel
This area is a one-stop-shop for creative tools you need to produce art on the 
artboard, which is the blank white space that functions like a piece of paper. It 
has the selection tools, the Pen tool, and the Shapes tool. As you work, you’ll 
have to select a tool before you can use it. More on Illustrator’s tools later in 
this chapter.
The application bar
Across the top of the screen are application controls, including a workspace 
switcher. You can hide it by opening the Window menu and deselecting 
Application Bar.
The panel title bar
You can organize, stack, and rearrange palettes and panes in this area (typi­
cally on the right side where palettes sit) to best suit the requirements of 
each project. For instance, if you’re drawing, you could put the Color pane 
on top because you’ll be using that frequently. Or, if you’re working on some­
thing like a newspaper graphic, you could put the Text pane on top.
Determining the essentials
One of the charms of Adobe Illustrator is that its developers really try to 
anticipate what users will want. Check out the Essentials Switcher, acces­
sible by clicking the Essentials button at the top-right of the window. 

155
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
This drop-down menu holds a list of several workspace presets: Automation, 
Essentials, Layout, Painting, Printing and Proofing, Tracing, Typography, Web, 
and a lower menu that we talk about later. These are preset configurations for 
what Adobe thinks would be some typical workspace arrangements.
Choosing a preset workspace
When you click and hold the Essentials button in the upper-right corner 
of the Illustrator window, you see the list of preset workspaces. Here is a 
rundown:
	
✓	Automation: This workspace arranges the palette menus down the left 
side of the window in a way that concentrates workflows on automated 
commands like the Actions palette (automatically performs commands by 
assigning quick keys); Links palette (allows you to keep track of imported 
items); Variables palette (where a linked image, a text object, a graph, or 
an object can be made dynamic or changeable); and Layers palette (con­
tent can be arranged on separate layers to allow for easier editing).
	
✓	Essentials: This is just the basics. The palettes bar on the right is col­
lapsed, but any of the palettes are available from the Window menu.
	
✓	Layout: This workspace has the essential editing palettes for any 
single or multi-page layout you may have to perform. It includes the 
Artboards palette (allows for added artboards for multi-page layouts); 
the Stroke, Swatches, and Graphic Styles palettes (for line editing, 
quick color swatches, or background patterns); the Color palette (for 
editing line, text, or fill colors); the Transform palette (for editing size 
of objects); and the Type palette (for text editing).
	
✓	Painting: For the artist who loves to draw, paint, and create. This work­
space features the Color, Swatches, and Kuler palettes (for finding color 
palettes through a web-hosted community); the Color Guide palette 
(some preset color schemes); the Brushes, Stroke, and Symbols palettes 
(for choosing brush tools, line editing, and quick symbol generation); 
and the Layers palette.
	
✓	Printing and Proofing: After you complete a project, you can switch 
to this workspace to help usher your way through the production pro­
cess. This workspace offers the Layers palette, the Info palette (you can 
view attributes on any object in the work area), and the Links and the 
Artboards palettes. It also contains the Swatches palette, Appearance 
palette (for quick editing of stroke, fill, and opacity in an object), the 
Transparency palette (for another quick opacity edit), and the Color pal­
ette. After those, you have the Separations Preview palette (for viewing 
preproduction cyan, magenta, yellow, and black layers of an artwork or 
photo), the Document Info palette (for a quick rundown of various objects 
in the project), and the Attributes palette (for adding overprint options or 
fill options).

156
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
✓	Tracing: This workspace offers the Image Trace palette, which allows for 
photo tracing or quick and easy autotracing. This workspace also has 
the Navigator palette (you can quickly view where you are on the proj­
ect by pushing the navigation box around the work area in this palette), 
and the Info palette. It also includes the Color, Swatches, Color Guide, 
Layers, and Links palettes.
	
✓	Typography: This workspace gives the user the most important palettes 
for editing text color and editing, plus the Open Type palette (gives the 
user the ability to change Open Type fonts within the fonts list).
	
✓	Web: When designing projects for the web, this setup comes in handy 
for preparing files for interactivity.
	
When working on a project, you may end up with a lot of palettes strewn 
across the work area. You can easily get back to an organized workspace by 
clicking a preset workspace above or a new customized workspace of your 
choosing.
Making your own workspace
Getting used to Adobe Illustrator is a bit like moving into a new neighbor­
hood. You slowly learn who likes to chat, who likes to keep to herself, who 
keeps his yard nice, and who practices opera at 6 a.m.
Imagine if you could move into a new neighborhood and customize your 
neighbors. Well, that’s pretty much what you’re doing with Illustrator’s work­
space customization. Here’s how to make this program livable for you:
	
1.	Choose Window➪Workspace➪New Workspace.
	
2.	In the New Workspace dialog box that appears, name your workspace.
	
3.	Open the Window menu at the top and select the palettes you’d like to 
add to this custom workspace.
	
	 Those palettes will appear on the artboard.
	
4.	Drag any palettes to the right side of your artboard. You can repeat 
this addition with as many palettes as you can fit.
	
After you arrange your customized workspace, you can always switch to it 
from any other workspace by choosing it from the workspace switcher, found 
under the Essentials button.
As an example of Illustrator’s tools and palettes we’ll show how we can put 
together an information graphic on personal finance. Figure 9-1 is a sketch for 
a client of a graphic dealing with financial matters.

157
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Figure 9-1: Starting with a sketch.
The graphic uses a fitness theme to show how the U.S. economy was begin­
ning to inch back to life after a dismal few years. As a theme, Uncle Sam (rep­
resenting the U.S. economy) is training for the fight of his life (recovery from 
economic recession) by running on a treadmill (charts showing recovering 
economy). Figure 9-2 shows the finished infographic.

 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Mastering Illustrator Basics
Adobe Illustrator has some unbelievably cool features you can use to add all 
sorts of flourishes to your graphics. Before you get into those, however, take 
a look at some of the basic features of the program for a little taste of the 
technical wizardry you can add to your infographic.
	
Glitches can arise at a moment’s notice. Save your artwork frequently by 
pressing ⌘+S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (Windows). The first time you save your work, 
the computer prompts you to name the file and place it in a certain folder on 
your computer.
Using the Selection and Direct Selection tools
While you work, two “selection” tools allow you to perform certain functions 
to each element of your infographic. You’ll experiment with them later in this 
chapter, but the Selection tool (the black arrow in the tools panel) allows 
you to move or resize an object. If you have objects grouped together, the 
Selection tool allows you to move the entire group.
The Direct Selection tool (the white arrow to the right of the Selection tool) 
allows you to grab points on an object and manipulate them individually. Or, if 
you click a line that’s between two points, you can manipulate the whole line.
Maximizing the Pen tool
The Pen tool is one of the most basic components of Adobe Illustrator. You 
use it to draw straight and curved lines, forming the foundation of almost 
anything you’d want to include in an infographic.
When you open Adobe Illustrator, on the left side of the window is a thin row 
of tools called the toolbar. The fifth tool down the toolbar is the Pen tool, 
which looks like the nib of an old-time fountain pen.
Just click the Pen tool to activate it. It will turn dark to show that it’s high­
lighted and active.
	
You can also press P (on your keyboard) to select the Pen tool.
Now have some fun. With the Pen tool selected, try a few clicks on the empty 
artboard to the right. You’ll probably end up with a random shape, filled with 
black and surrounded by blue lines and dots. The lines are paths, and the 
dots are anchor points, which all have handles. The handles on the anchor 
points allow you to change and control the bend in the line.

160
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
To begin drawing Uncle Sam, select All on your artboard by choosing Select➪All 
on the main menu or pressing ⌘+A (Mac) or Ctrl+A (Windows). Then hit Delete 
to clear any experimental points you just made. In this example (Figure 9-3), I 
used the Pen tool to draw the hat brim, stripes, and top. In the first example 
(left), I filled with white to show the shapes. In the second, I filled the shapes 
with color.
Perhaps you want to outline your shape. You can choose Stroke to outline 
the edge of your shape in any width and color you’d like. Both commands are 
accessible from the Tools panel.
You might also wish to do one of the following:
	
✓	Fill your shape with a different color (or none).
	
	There are several ways to add a color. You can click a color in the Control 
panel, the Color panel, Swatches panel, Gradient panel, or the swatch 
library. Additionally, you can double-click the Fill box and then select a 
color from the Color Picker.
	
	You can also fill your shape with no color by selecting the check box 
with the red hash mark through it in the lower left.
Figure 9-3: Use the Pen tool to outline your shape.

161
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
	
	If you fill your shape with None and then click anywhere outside of the 
shape, it will simply disappear. Don’t panic, though — your shape is still 
there. It’s just not filled or stroked (discussed in a bit) with a color. To find 
it again, you can choose Select All, and the shape will appear as points and 
borders. Or, you can use the selection tool to draw a box around the area 
where you believe the object to be. It will show the points and borders.
	
✓	Add a stroke to your shape.
	
a.	Reselect your drawn shape.
	
b.	Go to the color fill menu as before and select the box shape under 
the color fill box. This is the Stroke color box.
	
	You can toggle between Fill and Stroke color by pressing X on your 
keyboard. This will save you time clicking the actual color boxes.
	
c.	Click the little black box in the lower-right corner of the color menu 
to stroke your shape with a black color.
	
✓	Make the shape a closed image.
	
a.	Use the Pen tool and click one of the handles with the Pen.
	
	A small hash symbol appears near the tip of your Pen tool. Now 
the Pen is ready to add to your existing shape.
	
b.	Select that point and then go to the opposing end handle with your 
Pen tool.
	
c.	When a small circle appears at the tip of your Pen tool to show 
that the additional point will close the shape, click there to close 
the shape.
	
✓	Edit your shape.
	
a.	Click and hold the Pen tool.
	
	Four tools choices appear: the Pen tool, the Add Anchor Point tool, 
the Delete Anchor Point tool, and the Convert Anchor Point tool.
	
b.	Move any point in your shape. Activate the Direct Selection tool 
(the second arrow down from the top of the Tool palette: a hollow, 
NW-pointing arrow) to move the points.
	
	With this tool, just select and drag points to edit the shape as 
you like.
	
c.	(Optional) Choose the Delete Anchor Point tool to delete points 
you think are unnecessary for your artwork.
	
d.	(Optional) Try using the Convert Anchor Point tool to add arches 
or curves to your art by simply clicking and dragging the point you 
wish to be curved.
	
	Use this tool to turn a corner point to a curved line. It works from 
the center of the point and curves the line outward. It takes a little 
practice to master this tool.

Continuing with the Uncle Sam drawing we can add stars to his hat by either 
drawing them with the Pen tool (by clicking and adding anchor points in a 
star shape) or by using the Shape tool. This tool is in the tools palette far­
ther down than the Pen tool. The star Shape tool resides under the Shape 
tool icon (a square box). Click and hold the Shape tool and a fly out menu 
will appear. Scroll down to the star Shape tool. Simply click and drag the star 
shape onto the artboard. (See Figure 9-4.)
Figure 9-4: Use the Shape tool’s star shape rather than using the 
Pen tool.
The rest of the hat can be completed by drawing curves with the Pen tool. 
Here’s how to draw curves:
	
1.	With the Pen tool, click the artboard.
	
	 That creates an anchor point

163
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
	
2.	Moving slightly to the left or right, click and drag.
	
	 The line creates a curve.
	
3.	Move slightly again and complete the arch with a single click.
	
4.	You can repeat these actions over and over to complete the hat brim 
or to add curves to the stripes in the hat.
	
Always save your artwork every time you think of it. The computer, the pro­
gram, and your work are all built by humans. Glitches can arise at a moment’s 
notice, so saving your work is imperative.
Placing a text box
Text boxes organize all the type in your graphic, from headlines to blocks 
of text that tell your story to the tiny type that gives credit to your sources. 
By the time you are building your infographic with Illustrator, you should 
have all your research complete, and you should have written your text (also 
known as copy). Now, it’s time to lay it out like you planned in your wire­
frame, and make sure that your text and art support each other.
To create a text box, click the Type tool on the Tools palette and then click 
anywhere on your artboard. Then type your text. You can create a specific 
size for your text box by clicking the Type tool on the artboard, then holding 
and dragging in a diagonal fashion downward. After you create a text box and 
fill it with copy, you can move this block of text around the infographic by 
using the Selection tool and then clicking, holding, and dragging the text box 
around your layout. You can also click any text box handle to drag that side 
of the box in or out. Because text boxes are so easy to move and resize, they 
can help you as you modify and edit your infographic.
Changing fonts with the Type tool
The Type tool in Illustrator is a quick and easy way to find the best font for 
your graphic. With just a few clicks, you can find a typeface that suits your 
project — anything from an infographic on revenue for a company’s annual 
report to a diagram of a race car’s engine for an infographic on Formula One 
racing.
You’ll find the Type tool on the Tools palette (down the left side of the screen). 
It’s the big letter T (for Type). (By the way, this is an excellent example of a 
simple icon!)
When you click and hold the Type tool, options for type formatting pop up. 
For now, though, just concentrate on the first option: the Type tool itself.

164
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Here’s a simple exercise to get you started using the Type tool:
	
1.	Select the Type tool and move the cursor to the artboard.
	
2.	Click in the empty text field.
	
	 This sets the incursion marker or cursor in the middle of the field. In 
essence, you’re selecting a place to begin your text.
	
3.	At the blinking cursor that appears, enter some simple sample text.
	
	 The font doesn’t matter at this point. See Figure 9-5.
Figure 9-5: Start with a simple font.
	
4.	Press Esc (the Escape key) on the keyboard.
	
	 This releases the Type tool and automatically returns you to the black 
Selection Tool.
With your basic text entered, you can now adjust your text.
In the Uncle Sam Personal Finance Graphic, I used a special font called 
Featured Item. I wanted something that reflected the Industrial-style look 
I was going for.
Along the top of the artboard are several options that Illustrator places when 
you choose the Type tool including the font name, style, and font size. You 
can change the font by clicking the Character drop-down menu and scrolling 
to any font. It is always interesting to see how each font may enhance the 
theme in your graphic. (See Figure 9-6.)

165
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Figure 9-6: Investigate other font options.
Start experimenting by changing the font.
	
1.	Choose the font (the first drop-down menu).
	
a.	Click and hold the small white arrow of font family to open its 
drop-down menu.
	
b.	When the array of Illustrator fonts appears, scroll and select the 
one you want.
	
2.	Set the font style (the second drop-down menu).
	
a.	Click and hold the small white arrow to open this list of font styles 
that come with that particular font.
	
b.	Scroll and choose the style you want.
	
	In most cases, your choices are limited to Regular, Italic, Bold, and 
Bold Italic. Some fonts, though, come with more variety, such as 
Condensed and Bold Condensed.
	
3.	Set the font size (the third drop-down menu).
	
	 You know the drill by now. Font size, by the way, is set in points (pt). For 
reference, 72pt is one inch.
Using the Direct Selection tool
The Direct Selection tool is the second tool down on the Tools palette. Some 
folks call it the “empty arrow” (in comparison with the black-filled Selection 
arrow). Whereas you use Selection to select an object or group of objects, 
you use Direct Selection to select individual handles or points on a vector 
drawing or Pen drawing in Illustrator and edit them. You can work with any 
object that is a vector or AI Pen-drawn shape.

166
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Try this. Start by creating a simple shape:
	
1.	Activate the Shapes tool (the eighth icon down on the Tools palette, 
that looks like a basic rectangle with a little shading in the SE corner).
	
2.	From the menu of shapes that opens, choose something simple, like a 
basic rectangle (opt for the Rectangle tool) and then click the workspace.
Now you can use Direct Selection to manipulate the shape:
	
1.	Activate the Direct Selection tool (press A for a shortcut).
	
2.	Click and hold any anchor point and then drag it.
	
	 If you select the upper-left anchor of a rectangle and drag it toward the 
center, you get a trapezoid. For fun, do the same with the upper-right 
anchor point: Select it and move it to the same place as the first point. 
That gives you a triangle.
	
	 If you hold down Shift while doing these movements, it will constrain 
them to parallel, vertical, or 45-degree movements.
	
	 The direct selection tool has a really useful “marquee” feature that 
allows you to draw a box around a portion of your work and then drag 
or move everything that’s inside the box.
You can also use the Direct Selection tool to move only selected lines between 
two points. Just click any line in a shape, holding and dragging.
Grouping objects
Grouping objects (choose Object➪Group) can help you move them around a 
design or piece of art. A group combines objects into a single unit, which can 
then be moved or altered as one, without having to change the qualities of 
every single component. These components can be polygons, text elements, 
rasterized images, or any combination of the above.
Repeating yourself is good sometimes
Here’s how to duplicate an object or text box.
	 1.	 With the black Selection arrow active, 
click/hold the object.
	 2.	 Press and hold Option/Alt.
	 3.	 Drag the object anywhere on the artboard.
	 4.	 Release the mouse.
	
	 You have a clone!
	 5.	 Repeat as often as you wish.
This duplication trick comes in useful quite 
often. In the Uncle Sam example, I used this 
duplication maneuver to create a second hand 
rail for the treadmill.

167
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
When you click and hold the Direct Selection tool, a menu appears holding 
the Group Selection tool. Use this tool to select items within a group one item 
at a time.
	
Toggle between the Direct Selection tool and the Group Selection tool by 
holding down Shift. When Direct Selection is selected and then you hold 
down Shift, a small plus sign (+) appears below the tool’s icon.
Use this technique to move an entire grouped object without leaving anything 
behind. Try it out.
	
1.	Activate the Group Selection tool.
	
2.	Click some artwork you’ve created.
	
• Click the object. One of the items will be selected.
	
• Click the object twice. All items within the group are selected.
	
3.	With the objects selected, you click and drag to move them en masse.
	
If you hold down Shift while using the Group Selection tool, you can deselect 
objects within the group.
Discovering the beauty of the Brush tool
The quintessential image of the artist is a picture of a painter with a paint­
brush. The brush is an old tool, but even in the digital age, it’s not obsolete — 
but instead of paintbrush and paint, you use a paintbrush and pixels.
The Brush tool (a paintbrush icon) is located nine icons down on the Tools 
palette. Here are basics of how to use it.
	
1.	Activate the Brush tool.
	
2.	Take a swipe on the artboard to the right.
	
	 The tool paints a thick line in black. The default setting is 5pt Round.
In the area above your drawing is a series of options and menus. From left to 
right, here’s a rundown.
	
✓	Path: This tells you the object type you have selected.
	
✓	Fill: Your path won’t have a fill at this time, which is denoted by a white 
box crossed with a red line (universal in CS for “no fill”).
	
✓	Stroke Color: Click and hold this menu to open a color picker for the 
desired color.
	
✓	Line Size: Here is where you can change line width. Click and hold this 
menu to see line width options. Try a few to see the effect.

168
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
	Another way to change path line width is to select the path, and then 
press the left bracket ( [ ) to decrease the width of your line or the right 
bracket ( ] ) to increase it.
	
✓	Variable Width Profile: This option is interesting when dealing with the 
Pen tool but not particularly useful for the Brush tool.
	
✓	Brush Definition: As we mention earlier, the default setting is 5pt Round. 
Click and hold this menu to open a list of great brush definitions: for 
example, 5pt Flat is great for calligraphic lettering, and Charcoal Feather is 
good for a painterly look.
	
	To try different brush definitions from this option, duplicate your path 
several times (selecting the path and press ⌘+D/Ctrl+D) and then choos­
ing different options.
There is a whole library of brush options to play with. On the right side of the 
workspace, click the fifth icon down to bring up the Brushes Options dialog 
box. In the upper right of this dialog box, click the a little “list” icon to bring 
up another list of options to use. If you scroll near the bottom of this list, you 
will find Open Brush libraries, which provides a bevy of brush types.
	
You can also call up the brush library by clicking the little Library icon on the 
lower left of the Brush Options dialog box.
Getting geometric with the Shape tool
Other than the Pen tool, the Shape tool is one of the most widely used Illustrator 
features. You use it to create rectangles, rounded rectangles, ellipses, polygons, 
stars, and flares.
The Rectangle tool
The Shape tool is located eight tools down on the Tools palette. Just click the 
Rectangle tool and then click and drag on the artboard to create the shape.
	
The shortcut for the rectangle tool is pressing keyboard letter M.
Remember your geometry teach saying how all squares are rectangles? This 
is where you will use that math in real life. To create a square, hold down 
Shift while creating the rectangle. You will get a perfect square while dragging 
on the artboard.
	
To open a dialog box where you can set strict measurement parameters for 
your object, select the Rectangle tool and then click once on the artboard.

169
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
The Rounded Rectangle tool
As you might surmise, a rounded rectangle is a regular ol’ rectangle but with 
sloped shoulders. To use it, click and hold the Rectangle tool in the Tools pal­
ette. A fly-out menu appears with an array of shapes to choose from.
	
1.	Drag the pointer to the Rounded Rectangle tool.
	
2.	Click and drag on the artboard.
	
	 When you release the mouse, you see an object that looks a bit like a bar 
of soap — great for text boxes, picture frames, a corner on a neighbor­
hood block. The possibilities are endless!
	
	 While clicking and dragging the shape of the rounded rectangle, adjust 
the rounded corner radius by pressing the up- and down-arrows keys on 
the keyboard. Pressing up arrow increases the radius, and pressing the 
down arrow decreases it.
	
	 To open a dialog box where you can put in your own specific measured 
parameters (radius of the corners and size of the sides on the rectangle), 
activate the Rounded Rectangle tool and simply click on the artboard.
The Ellipse tool
Just like using the Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle tool, click the Ellipse 
tool and then drag to create an ellipse or oval on your artboard.
	
To create a circle at any size your monitor will allow, activate the Ellipse tool 
and hold down Shift while creating the shape.
Edit a circle shape by activating the Direct Selection tool and then clicking and 
dragging any of its points to reshape the circle. When you click a point, notice 
that the selection produces two more handles on either side of the point. These 
arc-editing handles can be used to reshape the arc within that circle.
The Polygon tool
Moving on to the next tool in the Shapes menu, click and hold the Shape tool 
icon to find and select the Polygon Shape tool. Click and drag on the art­
board, and a hexagon appears.
	
To edit the polygon while creating it, use the up and down arrows on the 
keyboard to change the number of sides on the shape you’re creating. 
Pressing the up arrow adds more sides; pressing the down arrow decreases 
the number of sides. You can make something as complicated as an octagon 
or as simple as a triangle by simply tapping the up and down arrows on the 
keyboard.

170
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
The Star tool
Find the Star tool icon in the fly-out menu that opens under the Shape tool. 
To make (and tweak) stars, select the Star tool and then click and drag on the 
artboard to create a star shape.
To edit a star, use the arrow keys on the keyboard. You can create a sun shape 
by pressing the up arrow or go as far as a triangle shape by pressing the down 
arrow. This comes in handy for making light flashes or just stars for a flag.
While clicking and dragging to make the star shape, hold down ⌘/Ctrl to pull 
out the points on the star shape to make for more pronounced shine spikes.
If you activate the Star tool and click the artboard, a dialog box appears 
where you can add more precise measurements for your star artwork: for 
example, the size of radius 1 (the inner points of the star) and radius 2 (the 
outer points of the start) as well as the overall number of outer points. (See 
Figure 9-7.)
Figure 9-7: Edit your star shape.
The Flare tool
The Flare tool is a specialty item with dramatic properties: not really a shape 
but kinda. Think of a photo you’ve shot or seen that has lens flare, when it’s 
not well exposed and is marred with big balls and streaks of light. (Okay, 
sometimes lens flare is pretty cool.) The one drawback to using the Flare tool 
is that it must be used on a black background.

 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Making charts and graphs with the Graph tool
Illustrator has a very flexible Graph tool. You can make charts and graphs 
styled any way you want, while still keeping them “live.” This means that you 
can change the look of the chart to fit your publication’s style without chang­
ing your ability to add new numbers later.
Creating a chart
Activate the Graph tool on the tool bar. If you click and hold it, a menu appears 
of the various graphing options. Just for fun, choose the Line Graph tool. This 
format is useful for showing data over time, or for showing values that create a 
trend of some kind.
In the workspace, click and drag to define the size of the chart. (Don’t worry, 
you can always adjust the size later.) When you release the mouse, a dialog 
box opens where you can save your data.
Populating your chart
You can start entering your data directly into it — or, even better, cut and 
paste already formatted data from a program like Excel. Comma-separated 
values (CVS) data flows neatly into a variety of programs without losing the 
essential column and row organization. So you can edit data in a powerful 
program like Excel (sorting, for example, so that the numbers go from biggest 
to smallest) and then just copy and paste your clean data into the Illustrator 
data field.
	
If your chart doesn’t turn out the way you expected, or you see an error mes­
sage, the problem is likely the data format. Illustrator reads numbers with 
commas in them as text. Likewise, if you have a column of dates that are just 
numbers, you need to add quotes for Illustrator to understand that those 
numbers are categories.
The second button from the left — Transpose Data — allows you to flip how 
your data is organized. Click it to see what happens; then click it again to 
toggle to the original orientation. When you close the data dialog box, it will 
query whether you want to save your chart. Assuming that you select Yes, 
you can get to the data again by choosing Object➪Graph➪Data or by right-
clicking the chart and choosing Data from the context menu.
Get a head of yourself
Remember to add a title to your chart. State 
what is being measured as well as what quanti­
ties are being used in that measurement. And 
just like remembering to save your progress 
at regular intervals, the graphic artist should 
develop a habit of double-checking data. “Am 
I really showing thousands of dollars, or is it 
millions?”

172
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Here’s how to modify the look of your chart:
	
1.	Click and hold the Selection tool at the top of the Tools palette.
	
2.	Choose the Direct Selection tool from the options that appear and 
then click the fever line (chart line) within your chart.
	
	 The Direct Selection Tool allows you to select only the fever line in your 
chart. Although it will only select a portion of the line, you can select the 
entire line by holding down Option/Alt while clicking the line.
	
3.	With the entire line selected, change the color of the line by choosing 
Window➪Color and then selecting the color you want.
	
	 You can choose any color you like for the line color. You can also choose a 
different line width for the fever line by using the Window➪Stroke menu.
	
	 If you’re working with a client, make sure your choices work with any 
required brand guidelines.
Now you can change the chart font and type size:
	
1.	Deselect everything by clicking an empty part of your pasteboard.
	
2.	Click your chart once to select the full chart.
	
3.	Change the type attributes from the top tool bar.
Now you can choose different chart types to see what your data looks like 
expressed in different chart forms:
	
1.	⌘+right-click your chart without deselecting.
	
	 It’s not uncommon to click and miss the target item, thereby deselecting 
the target object. If that happens, just click the target object again.
	
	 That brings up a dialog box where you can change many more things 
about how your chart looks.
	
2.	Click Type to see a selection of options.
	
• Chart type: Along the top are icons for different chart types. If you 
want to see what your data looks like expressed in different chart 
forms, change it now. (You can always change it back.)
	
• Column/Cluster width: At the bottom of that same dialog box are 
Column Width and Cluster Width, which control the width of the 
bar and how far apart the bars are, respectively.
	
• Graph options: From the Graph Options drop-down menu at the 
very top of the dialog box, you can change aspects of the x and 
y axes, including the range of the numbers and the length of tick 
marks in your chart.

Time to save. Choose from
	
✓	An AI (.ai) or a PDF (.pdf) if you want it to remain editable
	
	If you choose to save as an Illustrator file, you (obviously) can open the 
file to edit it in illustrator. For a PDF file (.pdf), you can open the file in 
illustrator or a .pdf reader program (in case you don’t have Illustrator). 
And that’s a good thing in the case your client isn’t graphic savvy or 
doesn’t have the required software to view the graphic.
	
✓	A rastorized JPEG (.jpg) image if you want to include it as an image 
for use in another program
	
✓	An SVG (.svg), a GIFF (.gif), or a PNG (.png) for web use
	
If you choose the Save for Web & Devices option (just Save for Web in Adobe 
CC), you can specify the exact pixel size you want your chart image without 
physically changing the size of the chart itself or the pasteboard. This is 
handy if you’re exporting the same graphic for use on multiple platforms.
Using the Eyedropper tool
The Eyedropper tool is one of the most useful in Illustrator’s toolbox. Use it 
to copy attributes — for example color, font, or level of transparency — from 
anything in your document and then apply those attributes to virtually any­
thing else in your document.

174
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Say you have a photo with a shade of blue that you would like to use in your 
graphic. Here’s how easy it is:
	
1.	Paste the photo into your Illustrator document by choosing File➪Place.
	
2.	In the file-browsing dialog box that Illustrator opens, search for the 
image you want.
	
3.	Double-click the file in the dialog box and click the place within your 
document where you want to put the photo.
	
4.	Activate the Eyedropper tool from the Tools palette.
	
5.	In the pasted photo, click the color you want to copy.
	
	 The Eyedropper “picks up” the information. You’ll see the color show up 
in the box at the bottom of your toolbar.
	
6.	Activate a drawing tool — say, the Pen tool — and draw a shape.
	
	 It will automatically have the color you just picked up.
	
	 The picked-up color becomes a part of your working file, isolating/
defining that color with the Eyedropper allows you to add the color to 
a shape or text, and you can also add it to your color swatches for use 
later.
	
	 Press D on your keyboard at any point to return that box to your default 
color.
Here’s how to change the color of a shape already in your design. For this 
example, assume you have a blue box and a red circle, but you want the 
circle to also become blue.
	
1.	Select the shape — in this case, the red circle.
	
	 You can change attributes for more than one shape at a time. Select as 
many polygons and type elements as you want, and change them all at 
once. Just hold down Shift while you click to select multiple items.
	
2.	Activate the Eyedropper tool and click the blue box.
	
	 The red circle takes on the same color and stroke as the blue box.
	
	 If you hold down Option/Alt while clicking, the Eyedropper tool works 
the opposite way — turning the box red.

 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Adding icons with the Symbols tool
Using the Symbols tool is pretty straightforward — an easy way to add icons, 
which are increasingly useful in the age of shareable graphics. To test-drive it, 
start by choosing Window➪Symbols. The Symbols tab will open empty.
To make a symbol, simply select a vector object or a photo and drag it into 
the box. It’s that easy. Or go to the drop-down menu from the Symbols panel 
and choose Open Symbol Library. (Take a look around there first; there might 
be some fun stuff already made. Just click individual symbols to add them to 
your palette.)
Here’s how to make a symbol from scratch. We’ll star — um, start — with stars.
	
1.	From the Tools palette, click and hold the Rectangle tool and then 
select the Star tool from the menu that opens.
	
2.	Make the star, select it, and drag it into your open Symbols palette.
	
	 A dialog box opens where you can name the symbol.
	
	 Give it an easy-to-remember name in case you end up with a lot of 
symbols.
	
3.	Choose what kind of symbol you want it to be, as shown in Figure 9-8:
	
• Movie Clip: Movie Clip is important only if you plan to animate it 
later in Flash.
	
• Graphic: This is what you want.
	
	You could also change the registration point of your object — the 
“center” that your object rotates around. You probably won’t need 
to change that very often.
	
4.	Click OK to finish creating the star symbol.
Custom Eyedropper
If you don’t want the Eyedropper tool to pick 
up all the attributes of whatever you’re copy­
ing, you can customize the tool. Double-click 
the Eyedropper icon in the Tools palette to bring 
up a dialog box where you can select what the 
Eyedropper will affect. For example, if you want 
it to use only the level of transparency, clear all 
check boxes but that one. The red circle in our 
example now picks up only the amount of trans­
parency applied to the blue box, not the color or 
stroke. The same function allows you to copy 
font information.

176
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 9-8: Creating symbols of your own.
Using your symbols
Activate the Symbol Sprayer tool, which is found in the Symbols panel and 
looks like a can of spray paint. If you click and hold it, a menu appears with 
all the tools in this set. Click the right edge of that window, and the tool will 
pop out into its own box. You can always just close it like any window in 
Illustrator.
With the star symbol selected, give the tools a test drive:
	
✓	The Symbol Sprayer tool acts like a can of spray paint. Click and drag 
for a heavy effect, or just dab for individual instances of your star.
	
	Use the Symbol Sprayer to (in effect) create clones of the same “shape,” 
which makes using a symbol easier than a shape sometimes. (See 
Figure 9-9.)
	
✓	Use the Shifter tool to move entire sets of symbols. You can move the sym­
bols after they have landed, pull in stragglers, or move whole sections.
	
✓	The Symbol Scruncher condenses areas, pulling the symbols more 
tightly together as you click and drag over key spots.
	
✓	The Symbol Sizer has you click and drag to change the size of your 
symbol. This makes the collection of symbols less uniform.
	
✓	The Symbol Spinner changes the direction of the symbols.

177
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Figure 9-9: Spraying a shape creates clones quickly.
	
✓	The Symbol Stainer tool changes the color of the symbols. Select a 
color, and then click and drag over the stars to see how the color is 
applied.
	
✓	The Symbol Screener controls opacity levels. Like the Color Change 
tool, now your stars have varied levels of transparency.
	
✓	The Symbol Styler tool allows you to apply specific styles to your sym­
bols from the graphics style palette. Just click and drag over leaves to 
change to whatever style you chose from the palette. You can find the 
graphics style palette by choosing Window➪Graphics. Look at the fly-
out menu to find a library of styles that you can experiment with. Select 
a style and click the stars to see the results.
For more control, double-click any of these tools. The Options dialog box will 
open, giving you the ability to control the tools numerically.
Editing your symbols
The drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the Symbols palette offers 
a full array of options for editing your symbols. Some of the functions are 
also available along the bottom of the symbols window. These are shortcuts 
to the most common actions.
Making the most of the Symbol tool
To swap a symbol with another, select a symbol on your pasteboard and then 
select the symbol icon in the panel that you want to use in its place. From the 
drop-down menu, choose Replace Symbol.

178
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
To change one instance of the symbol, select it. Then, from the drop-down 
menu, choose Break Links to Symbol. Now what you have are just regular 
graphics. When you make changes to those vector graphics, the symbol 
remains unchanged.
The Edit Symbol command opens the symbol itself. You can make changes to 
the vectors. You can add parts, change the shapes, whatever you like. Then 
when you go back to the main document (arrow at upper left of document), 
your changes will appear in that symbol. Those changes are not reflected in 
symbol libraries, though — just in the symbol within your document.
Saving your symbols
The Symbols panel shows what you’re working with at the time, within any 
given document.
To save a group of symbols — for example, to share with other designers, orga­
nize them into themes, or to keep a version untouched by edits — choose Save 
Symbol Library at the bottom of the drop-down menu. Whatever you have in 
your palette will be saved as a new Illustrator document. The default will be to 
save your selection to the Symbols folder, but you can save it anywhere you 
like. For example, you could save it to your desktop and e-mail that document 
to other collaborators.
Using the Pathfinder tool to create shapes
The Pathfinder tool is a real workhorse tool. Use it to create shapes, even 
very complex shapes, without drawing them from scratch. This section 
shows you how to draw with the Pathfinder tool. Then, amazingly, you’ll see 
how the Shapefinder tool does the same thing, only faster.
Pathfinder uses Boolean technology, which essentially uses one shape to 
change another. When you have two shapes, you can use the Pathfinder tool 
to “add” those two shapes together, “subtract” one from the other, or just cut 
them into separate parts.
Start by choosing Window➪Pathfinder. The dialog box that opens has several 
different pictograms of the actions that it can perform.
The top row — Shape Modes — are live effects: that is, you can position one 
shape over another, click the “action” of choice, and still move and adjust the 
individual shapes at will. When the shapes are where you want them to be, 
click the Expand button on the right side of the dialog box to complete the 
action. If you choose the Minus Front shape mode (second from the left), the 
shape that was on top will cut out the part of the lower shape where the two 
shapes overlapped.
The lower row perform similar cuts and adds, but they are immediate and 
can be changed only with the Undo command.

179
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
The Shapefinder tool is newer and can be found in the Tools palette. See 
Figure 9-10. You can select many shapes at once and, without ungrouping 
anything, just select individual parts of the group to merge or cut. This tool 
behaves basically the same way as the Pathfinder tool but in a much more 
direct way.
Figure 9-10: Using one shape to change another.
Editing paths with the Eraser tool
You can take a vector object — any vector object — and erase parts of it as 
easily as you can with the Eraser tool in Photoshop . . . perhaps even more 
easily than with pencil and paper.
The powerful Eraser tool does several functions at once. In essence, it draws 
a brushstroke, expanding that brush stroke to make an actual shape, and 
then uses that shape to cut into other vector shapes in the same way the 
Pathfinder tool works. Incredibly complex, but it’s quite easy to use.
Getting started with the Eraser tool
Double-click the Eraser tool (about one-third of the way down the Tools pal­
ette, and looks like, well, an eraser).
	
Double-clicking any of Illustrator’s tools opens a dialog box offering precise 
control over the way that tool behaves.

180
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
If you have a Wacom tablet, the Eraser tool gives you the ability to become 
“pressure sensitive.” See the Fixed option? Check out that drop-down menu 
and marvel.
The Eraser is just as much fun if you’re using a mouse, though. Here’s some­
thing you can try.
	
1.	Draw an apple.
	
2.	Select the shape, activate the Eraser tool, and start cutting.
	
	 For fun, draw a bite-shaped cut. See Figure 9-11.
	
	 After you cut the shape, the stroke around the edge of the apple now 
goes around everything that hasn’t been erased. If there is a stroke, the 
tool reapplies it to all of the edges. If there isn’t, then the cuts are simply 
cuts. The Eraser cuts a narrow line because the size of the Eraser tool is 
small.
	
3.	Select the cut-out piece and delete it.
Figure 9-11: Working with the Eraser tool.
Working with straight edges and lines
Hold Option/Alt while you click and drag with the tool to create a cutting area 
shaped like a rectangle. Cut whole straight-edged chunks off anything you’ve 
drawn. Hold Shift+Option/Alt, and the Eraser tool constrains it to a square.
Another really excellent use of the Eraser tool is to refine drawn brush 
lines. Brush stroke lines can be cut or sculpted with the Eraser, as shown 
in Figure 9-12. If your line end is too rounded and blunt, select the line and 
shave away unwanted parts with the eraser.

181
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Figure 9-12: Perfect brush lines with the Eraser tool.
Dealing with snafus
You may find that parts of your illustration are erased, while others are not. 
There are a couple of reasons why this may happen.
	
✓	The Eraser tool works only on vectors. If you have a rasterized image in 
your graphic, you can’t edit it this way.
	
✓	Maybe only part of your illustration was selected. The Eraser tool 
works only on the part that is selected. Or, if nothing is selected, it will 
affect everything — except rasterized images (see the preceding bullet).
	
✓	If you erase a part of a line and the result is surprising, you may need 
to “expand” the look of the line before you use the Eraser on it. If your 
line has an effect applied to it (like an artistic brushstroke) and you cut 
the line with the Eraser, each new part of the line has the effect applied 
to it separately.

182
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
	The results can sometimes be unexpected. If you want the Eraser tool to 
cut the shape as the shape is shown, use the “expand” option under the 
Object menu to turn paths into straightforward vector shapes that you 
can erase.
	
✓	You may be trying to erase type. You can’t erase type unless you’ve 
turned it into a vector object (Type➪Create Outlines). You also can’t 
erase charts or blends until they are ungrouped or expanded.
Experimenting with Illustrator Effects
With the basic functions of Adobe Illustrator under your belt, you may want 
to play around with some features that add extra artistic flair to your work. 
You certainly don’t need all these features in your bag of tricks, but they’re 
fun, and sometimes they add the perfect finishing touch to an infographic.
Gaining contrast with a gradient
Using the Gradient tool is pretty straightforward. A gradient is simply one 
color fading into another color. For example, filling a square with a gradient 
that goes from blue at the top to white at the bottom would create a quick-
and-easy sky background in a drawing.
But, the fact that you can have multiple colors in a blend, can blend to 
100 percent transparency, and can decide between a straight (linear) blend or 
a circular (radial) makes this tool one of the most powerful drawing tools in 
Illustrator’s toolbox. The uses for the tool are limited only by one’s imagination.
	
Gradients can be applied to any vector object as long as it’s a closed shape.
You can apply a gradient fill to type, to shapes that you have drawn, or 
across several shapes at once. And, as of Illustrator CS6, a gradient can even 
be applied to a line or stroke. So if you try to apply a gradient, and it looks 
like it didn’t happen, check that you didn’t accidentally apply it to the stroke 
instead of the fill.
To understand how the tool works, here’s a simple example to create con­
trast and depth in a drawing. Here we show you how to make two red circles 
and use a radial fill to make the first one look more 3D.
	
1.	Create two red circles.
	
2.	Choose Window➪Gradient.
	
3.	Select the first red circle and apply a blend.
	
	 Illustrator provides some default blends to start, which you can access 
from the Gradient tab or from among the swatches. (Note: Any blends 
that you create and want to keep can be saved to your swatches when 
you’re done.)

183
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
	
4.	Now change the colors in the gradient. Change the white part of the 
gradient to red:
	
a.	Select the white swatch.
	
b.	Adjust the color in your color window or by double-clicking the 
white square to open a color swatch list that you can select from.
At this point, the gradient is “linear,” going from left to right. Changing it to a 
radial fill will make the shading look more ball-like. Follow the bouncing ball:
	
1.	With the circle selected, activate the Gradient tool found in the Tools 
palette.
	
2.	Click and drag from a point within the circle.
	
	 The start point will be red, and the end will be black. Experiment with 
where you click and drag to get your gradient just where you want it. 
You can also physically move and rotate the gradient annotator bar with 
your gradient tool. See Figure 9-13.
Figure 9-13: Changing the fill to alter appearance.
Add a third color:
	
1.	Hover the cursor underneath the gradient slider on the Gradient tab.
	
	 You’ll get a little plus symbol.
	
2.	Click to add a third color.
	
	 Move the three color stops left and right to see how they change where 
the color transitions happen.
	
3.	Change the black swatch to a dark red.
	
	 Now the shading looks more subtle. You can add as many color stops 
as you want, including white at the far left if you want to create a really 
sharp contrast. See Figure 9-14.

Building depth with the Blend tool
The Blend tool is a robust function within Illustrator that can be used in a 
wide variety of ways. It’s definitely worth experimenting with. It can blend 
lines, colors, shapes, and type, and it does each of these blends along a 
dynamic path that you can edit.
Locating the Blend tool
Blend is available on the Tools palette bar or from choosing Object➪Blend.
If you access Blend from the Tools palette, the dialog box that opens gives 
you the ability to choose the following blending options: Smooth Color, 
Specified Steps, Specified Distance, and Orientation. (You need to double-
click the option to open it.)
The Smooth Color option makes a seamless blend from one shape to the 
other. If that isn’t what you want, choose the next option from the drop-down 
menu and set the number of steps manually. Fewer steps make a more abrupt 
transition; more steps make a smoother transition. Specified Distance is how 
far apart each of the objects in the transition are set from one another.
If you choose Object➪Blend, you get a few additional options:
	
✓	Release: Undo the blend.
	
✓	Expand: Flatten your dynamic blend into a set of editable vectors.
	
✓	Blend Options: These are the same elements available from the Tools 
palette.
	
✓	Spline commands: Affect the path that the blend is following.
One more difference between accessing the tool from the Object menu versus 
the Tools palette is that from Object, you can choose Make Blend with both 
objects selected to make the blend. If you’re using the Tools palette Blend 
tool, you select the tool, click the first object, and then click the second 
object.

185
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
	
Be careful: Where you click the objects can determine object rotation in the 
blend. If you click in the center of the objects, you get a standard blend. 
Clicking the corners and edges of the objects creates a rotation in the blend, 
which can be fun and useful — but a shock if you aren’t expecting it.
Determining what you can blend
The good news is that you can blend anything that is a vector. All you have 
to do is select both items and then choose Object➪Blend➪Make. You’ll auto­
matically get a blend from one object to the other that will show a transition 
of size, color, and shape.
Blending shapes can mean creating a transition from a small circle to a large 
star, or a small square to a large piece of type. Illustrator now treats type as 
a vector object even without creating “outlines” of it, which can be really 
handy. See Figure 9-15.
Figure 9-15: Creating a simple blend.
The Blend tool can also be a quick way to create a set number of items, which 
can be handy in graphics with representations of large numbers. If you know 
you need exactly 50 of something, you can use the blend steps to create that 
number within a defined distance. Try blending one star to another of the 
same size. If you set the number of steps to 48, you know you have 48 plus 
the 2 stars you used to make the blend.

Using the blend’s spline
The objects that you blend are treated as one grouped object if you’re using 
the Selection tool. However, if you’re using the Direct Selection tool, you 
can get into that blend the same way as you can any grouped object. You 
can select one of your blend objects and change the color, and the blend is 
updated instantly.
You can also see, especially when you’re in preview mode, a line that shows up 
between the two objects. That line is the blend’s spline. You can interact with 
it by clicking it with the Direct Selection tool. Select one end point, and you 
can move that end of the line. Turn that anchor point into a curve by using the 
anchor point information box along the top of your workspace. Using Convert 
(under the Pen tool) changes curve points to corners and vice versa.
Then, when your endpoint is a curve, you can use the handles to control the 
arc of your spline.
You can also swap out that “spline” line for any other line. If you suddenly want 
your blend to be in a zigzag line, the solution is quite simple. Draw your zigzag 
line, select it and your blended object, and then choose Object➪Blend➪Replace 
Spline. The blend is now attached to your new zigzag line. Cool!
Creating dynamic graphics with a warp
Illustrator has a set of warp tools that can add a dynamic flair to your designs 
with just a couple of clicks. Find these tools on the Tools palette, under the 
Variable Width tool. These tools all do basically the same task: distorting your 
vector elements, a lot or a little, depending on how far you click and drag.
Click and hold the Variable Width tool, located about halfway down the Tools 
palette. The warp tools will show up in the drop-down menu.
	
Click the tear-away bar at the right of the window to separate it from your 
Tools palette to see the tools all at once and access them easily.
The Variable Width tool affects only lines or strokes. If you click a line in your 
design, it will change the width as you click and drag. This tool is good for 
making your lines look like brushstrokes from a paintbrush, among other 
things. If you hold down Option/Alt while you drag, only one side of the 
line expands. If you like the kind of line you just made and want to keep it 
to apply to other lines later, add it to the Variable Width profiles drop-down 
menu, located along the top. There, you can choose from the menu of saved 
presets or add a new one.
So, to save your finished line, select it, and open the Variable Width profile 
menu in the control panel. Click the Add to Profile button at the bottom 
(looks like a tiny floppy disk). Then you can name and save the changes you 
made to your line into the Presets menu. It will be available to use later on 
any other line in your document.

187
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
The Variable Width tool is conceptually similar to the warp tools, but it’s dif­
ferent in one key way. The lines themselves are not changed; it’s just an effect 
that’s applied and can be edited at any time. Look at your line in preview 
mode (⌘+Y/Ctrl+Y) to see that your line and its points are all still as you ini­
tially drew them.
The warp tools, however, actually change the geometry of the line or shape 
that you use them on.
	
	
✓	Warp: Behaves a bit like the Smudge tool in Photoshop, moving your 
lines or edges in the direction you push.
	
	
✓	Twirl: Creates spiral shapes. Select the tool, and then click and hold a 
spot on your line. The longer you hold it, the tighter the spiral. If you 
press Option/Alt after you start the spiral, the spiral will spin in the 
opposite direction.
	
	
✓	Pucker: Pulls in parts of your drawing like cinching in a waistline or 
tightening a belt.
	
	
✓	Bloat: Does the opposite of the Pucker tool. It adds organic scaling or 
“bloating” to parts of your vector shape.
	
	
✓	Scallop: Creates scallops (dips between points) that become deeper the 
longer you click and hold. Hold it for a couple of seconds, and your scal­
lop shapes become thin enough that they now look like hair, grass, or 
cracks on a mirror.
	
	
✓	Crystallize: Similar to the Scallop tool but jagged. The effect looks a bit 
like how explosions are drawn in comic books.
	
	
✓	Wrinkle: Also similar to the Scallop and Crystallize tools but smoother. 
The distortions to your edges look more like waves.
All these tools can be adjusted and controlled numerically for really precise 
handling. Double-click the tool icon itself, and an Options dialog box appears 
where you can change size, angle, intensity, and more.
Multiple effects can be applied to the same vector object or line. You can 
start with the Bloat tool, for example, and add scalloping to it for a paint 
splatter effect. Or create spirals and then further distort those spirals with 
one of the other tools. The results of these tools are quite complex and can 
really add a lot of visual interest to your work.
Joining objects with a compound path
As you likely have figured out by now, there’s often more than one way to 
complete a task in Illustrator. For instance, to draw a circle, you can use the 
Ellipse tool, or you could draw a circle manually with the Pen tool, or you 
could draw a square and reshape the corners to rounded arcs. Any of these 
techniques would be fine. You might notice subtle differences, but the end 
product will be a circle.

188
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Some designs are a little more complex, with really only a couple of options 
for completing them. For example, take a shape that needs to be edited to 
include a “see-through” hole, like a donut. Illustrator’s Compound Path selec­
tion is your best bet (choose Object➪Compound Path). Compound Path 
turns several grouped polygons into what the program recognizes as one 
polygon. It can also take one object and subtract it from another.
If you make two circles, one inside the other, you can punch a hole out of one 
in the shape of the other. See Figure 9-16. For the best results, be sure to make 
the circle on top smaller than the one behind. Choose Object➪Compound 
Path➪Make. This will produce a donut shape. Then, Illustrator sees this as one 
object — not as a grouped object — which makes it simple to move around 
your design.
Figure 9-16: Creating an object with the compound path.
With Pathfinder, you can also produce compound paths. First, select the 
donut and choose Object➪Compound Path➪Release. This will ungroup the 
donut polygons and become two separate shapes again. Duplicate these 
three more times by copy/pasting the pair (choose Edit➪Copy, Edit➪Paste). 
You can use these as examples for the Pathfinder tool.
Move them into a configuration that will best show the Pathfinder results. 
That is, place them in a line — not atop each other.
With the Pathfinder selected, select the first group of circles. With both small 
and large circles selected, go to the Pathfinder and select the first pathfinder 
option — Unite — which will combine the two shapes into one shape.
With the second group of circles selected, click the Subtract function in the 
Pathfinder. This, much like the Compound Path tool, will subtract the top 
from the bottom shape.
The third option — Intersect —leaves only the areas that overlap in the 
selections. The fourth option — Exclude —does the opposite of the Intersect 
option (leaves out overlapping sections of the shapes). See Figure 9-17.

189
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Figure 9-17: Detailed work with the compound path.
Use the Pathfinder and the Compound Path tools to help create drawings where 
you need a hole in a wall, bites out of a sandwich, or a key hole in a door lock. 
They are immensely useful and will be a great addition to your drawing tools.
Cropping illustrations with clipping masks
Illustrator, like Photoshop, allows you to mask elements of your design. 
Illustrator has two types of masks: clipping and opacity.
The Clipping mask allows you to mask any shape with any other shape 
simply by selecting them all (hold down Shift to select multiple items) and 
then choosing Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make. The object on the top (the 
other shapes are behind it) becomes the mask, or window, through which the 
bottom layers are seen.
For example, make a red rectangle. Then for a little excitement, put some white 
stripes across the top of that rectangle. Draw a white line, make it nice and thick 
(say, 10pt). While holding down Option/Alt, drag the line down a little ways. (If 
you hold Shift down as well, the movement is constrained to a single direction.)
Now you should have two lines.
Press ⌘+D/Ctrl+D to get a third line evenly spaced from the second. Do this a 
couple more times, and you’ll have a bunch of stripes.
Now draw another shape on top. It could be a circle, a star, or even just the 
word “stripes.”
It doesn’t matter what color that object is because the color won’t show. It’s just 
important that this last shape be on top of the others. Select all those elements 
and choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make or press ⌘+7/Ctrl+7. (See Figure 9-18.)
You should have a masked version of your stripes now. You can choose 
Object➪Clipping Mask➪Release to undo the mask at any point, and use the 
Direct Selection tool to select and move any masked object, leaving every­
thing else untouched.

190
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 9-18: Experimenting with the clipping mask.
The Opacity mask works basically the same way but uses tones to establish 
what shows through and what doesn’t. This allows for a more subtle transi­
tion between visible and not visible.
Give it a try:
	
1.	Take the same red rectangle and stripes and draw a new shape on top.
	
2.	Fill that shape with a gradient fill: say, a black and white gradient.
	
	 It doesn’t matter whether you choose a radial or linear style of fill. Either 
will work.
	
3.	With all the shapes selected, choose Window➪Transparency.
	
4.	Click the Make Mask button in the Transparency dialog box.
	
	 What you masked shows through in the white parts and less so where 
the gradient was darker.
	
	 If you select the Invert Mask box, the opposite happens: The lighter 
parts will be hidden, and the darker parts will show through.
Here’s another example. Draw another shape and fill it with a color — say, 
black — and then move it behind your image (choose Object➪Arrange➪Send 
to Back). You can see that the edges of your image really are being masked in 
a gradual way.
You can use either technique to mask vector shapes, text, and photographs. 
Illustrator also allows you to create masks within masks, allowing you to 
create complex designs very quickly.

191
 Chapter 9: Designing Infographics in Adobe Illustrator
Importing sketches into Illustrator 
to use as a template
Even in our wired world, artists still love to sketch. Great news! Your rough 
sketches can be easily worked into your drafts of infographics. You can scan 
sketches or snap a picture of your sketch with your phone and e-mail it to 
yourself. They don’t need to be color, just clear enough for you to work with.
You can also import your sketch directly into Illustrator. To use a sketch as a 
template, open your Illustrator document and simply place the image the way 
you would any photo. Put it on its own layer so you can turn the visibility on 
and off to check your progress. You can lock that layer or make it a “template” 
layer, which will enable you to dim the image, making it easier to draw on top of.
Sketches can also become part of your infographic. You can colorize a pencil 
drawing in a number of ways. Most simply, you can draw color layers and 
then set the transparency on your traced image to Multiply. This will make 
the black-and-white image combine with the colors to create a Photoshop-like 
result, as illustrated in Figure 9-19.
Figure 9-19: Apply color to a black-and-white drawing.

192
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Or, you can select the live trace option from the Windows menu (with a placed 
image selected, choose Object➪Image Trace) to turn your drawings into vector 
objects, which will look more polished and will remain fully editable as your 
work progresses. This technique works best with stronger contrast sketches, 
like ones done with ink or marker. From the Image Trace dialog box, you can 
control the tolerance, which sets how tightly the trace will follow the lines 
of your drawing. More precise tolerance will result in more anchor points. 
“Expand” will break the tracing into editable vector shapes, which allows you 
to see your art in greater detail.
You can also click the Image Trace button in the Control panel, or select a 
preset from the Tracing Presets button.

dobe Photoshop gives ordinary folks the power to edit photos to appear 
extraordinary by smoothing away blemishes, adding features, and alter­
ing composition. Photoshop, which has added features over the years, has 
become a standard tool for graphic designers. Photoshop is a key part of the 
Adobe Creative Suite, and as of 2013, is available through Adobe’s Creative 
Cloud (CC) subscription service.
If you’re working in the Creative Cloud (CC) versions of Adobe’s Creative 
Suite software, you’ll likely notice similarities between your workspace in 
Photoshop and Illustrator. Adobe has designed a common user interface 
between related programs, making it easier to apply what you know about 
one program when you’re learning another. The workspaces look very similar 
and have similar commands, panels, and tools. Read more about all this in 
Chapter 11.
Photoshop is a raster graphics editor, which means that users can create or 
edit drawings or photographic images by manipulating pixels. Compare that 
with vector image editors — like Illustrator — which allow users to manipulate 
lines and shapes. (Read all about using Illustrator in Chapter 9.)
	
Different tasks may call for different programs; we’ll talk about some of the 
benefits and drawbacks of both kinds of programs. Nowadays, an infographic 
designer should have a good working knowledge of both. We’ll use the same 
infographic we use in Chapter 9 to show you how designers typically use 
Photoshop in their infographic projects. Here’s how to get started with 
Photoshop.

194
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Getting Started with Photoshop
Has a parent or coach ever told you, “You have to walk before you can run”? 
Photoshop is a bit like that. Mastering the basics and getting a handle on how 
to organize your work will help you build a good foundation for the trickier 
features that can really make your work stand out. In this section, we talk 
about some of Photoshop’s essential functions and give you some tips for 
keeping your work organized so that you don’t lose track of your hard work.
Labeling layers
Photoshop allows you to work with different layers, applying features to 
them individually or in groups. Using layers allows you to create great depth 
and visual interest in your projects. Also, a layered structure allows you a 
high degree of control. For example, it’s pretty easy to fine-tune your design 
by altering color, shadows, and special techniques.
Here’s how to get started with layers.
	
1.	Open or create a new Photoshop document.
	
2.	Open the Layers palette by choosing Window➪Layers.
	
	 When you create a new Photoshop document, it will start with one layer 
by default. That layer is called Background and is locked. That layer 
can be unlocked, used, or deleted. See Figure 10-1.
Think of layers as a stack of individual images on your canvas. The image you 
see in your workspace depends on the opacity, order, and position of each 
layer. Layers can be sorted, grouped, or locked; and the visibility of that layer 
can be turned on or off. In Figure 10-2, you can see that each main element of 
the Uncle Sam graphic has its own layer.
Using layers allows you to edit or apply effects to particular parts of your image 
without affecting the rest. You can try out changes and effects to your image, 
and then simply turn that layer off or delete it if you change your mind, leaving 
the rest of your work intact.
Here are a few other layer basics:
	
✓	To create a new layer
	
a.	Click the icon at the top right of the Layers palette.
	
b.	From the fly-out menu that appears, choose New Layer.
	
c.	In the New Layer dialog box that appears, you can name that layer 
and also select a highlight color.

195
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
Figure 10-1: Get ting started with Photoshop’s layers palette.
	
	Name the layer something descriptive to help you easily identify 
layers as you work. For example, if you have a picture of an apple 
and want to try adding a highlight, name the image layer apple 
and the highlight layer above it apple_highlight.
	
✓	To rename an existing layer
	
a.	With the ⌘/Ctrl key pressed, click the layer.
	
b.	Select layer then go to Layer/Rename layer from the dropdown 
menu along the top. The name field of your layer will become active, 
­allowing you to type in the new name.
	
	Even easier, just double-click the name itself within the Layers pal­
ette. The name becomes editable, and you can start typing a new 
and better name.
Using folders and groups
The Layers palette can get difficult to navigate pretty quickly as your docu­
ment gets more complex. In addition to naming your layers, we recommend 
grouping your layers.

196
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 10-2: Give each major element 
of your infographic a name.
Grouping of layers is done with several layers that will reside in a separate 
folder within the layers palette. “The group” and “folder of layers” are 
synonymous.
The advantages to grouping layers are
	
✓	Layers within a group or a folder can be moved together. They behave 
as a single object. Layer groups can be moved around the document 
canvas, and moved up or down in your layer order.
	
✓	Groups can have effects applied to all layers within the group at once. 
For example, the transparency of a group can be changed from the 
Opacity field at the top of the Layers palette. The default blend mode 
for a group you create is Pass Through, which means that the individual 
modes for each layer will remain intact. Changing the folder’s blend 
mode will apply that change to all layers.
	
✓	Your Layers palette and your document will be more organized. Putting 
layers within groups or nesting groups within other groups keeps the 
parts of your image in order.
To create a folder, click the Create New Group icon at the bottom of the Layers 
palette. This makes an empty folder into which you can drag individual layers.
A more efficient way, however, is to select the layers you want to group and 
then create a group.

197
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
	
A group can help the user more quickly locate things within the Layers palette. 
A group can also make it much easier to move several objects at once within 
the design. For example, a drawing of a person would have several distinct 
parts: a head, arms, legs, clothing, and so on. If you want to move that person 
when you’re assembling your infographic, it’s much easier to select those 
body parts as a group rather than one by one. Also, using groups reduces clut­
ter and allows for greater organization in the Layers panel.
	
1.	Hold Shift (keyboard) as you select layers.
	
	 To select contiguous layers, click the top layer and then Shift-click the 
last or bottom-most layer you want to include. All the layers in between 
become selected as well. To select noncontiguous layers, press ⌘/Ctrl 
and select the desired layers.
	
	 Groups work best with layers that are ordered immediately above and 
below one another.
	
2.	With the layers selected, click the Menu icon at the top right of the 
Layers palette.
	
3.	Choose New Group from Layers.
	
	 A dialog box appears where you can name the new group, and all your 
layers will be inside.
To open the folder, click the triangle to the left of the group name. The folder 
will open, displaying all the layers inside. See Figure 10-3. Those layers can 
still be selected and manipulated individually. New layers can be dragged into 
that group at any point. Click the triangle again to collapse (close) the folder.
Folders can be renamed at any point by double-clicking the folder name to edit it.
Figure 10-3: Use folders to keep 
work organized.

Learning the Basic Photoshop Tools
Conveniently, Photoshop and Illustrator share many similar functions. At 
times, you’ll have to decide which program to use, but there’s really not a 
wrong answer. Many infographic designers use Photoshop and Illustrator 
(see Chapter 9), sometimes alone and sometimes together. Here’s a look at 
some of the most common Photoshop functions.
If you’re working in the Creative Cloud (CC) versions of Adobe’s Creative 
Suite software, you likely noticed the similarities between your workspace 
in Photoshop and Illustrator. Adobe has designed a common user interface 
between related programs, making it easier to apply what you know about 
one program when you’re learning another. The workspaces look very similar 
and have similar commands, panels, and tools. There’s no definitive answer 
about which program is better, but here’s a look at some of the similarities and 
differences you’ll notice in some commonly used tools.
Selection tools
Use selection tools to isolate a particular part of your infographic to move or 
change it in some way.
	
✓	The Selection tool and Direct Selection tools in Illustrator are similar to 
the Move tool and Path Selection tool in Photoshop.
	
✓	The familiar Hand tool allows the user to move the visible area in both 
programs.
	
✓	The Magic Wand tool selects related areas of tone or color, and it can be 
found in Illustrator as well as Photoshop.
	
✓	The Lasso tools are the same. In Illustrator, the Lasso selects vector 
shapes, lines, and anchor points. In Photoshop, the Lasso tool selects 
pixels within the defined area.
	
✓	The Eyedropper tool behaves the same way in both programs, picking 
up colors from selected points in an image.
Drawing tools
Drawing tools are those tools within Photoshop that behave, virtually, like 
actual drawing tools. They allow you to create, color, or affect pixels in a way 
that simulates the use of a pencil or a brush.
	
✓	The Pen tools are virtually the same. Getting used to drawing with anchor 
points and handles may be tricky when you’re starting out, but at least 
you won’t have to learn it twice.

199
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
	
✓	The Pencil tool is available in both programs, but it still provides much 
less control than the Bezier Pen tool, so we recommend that you don’t 
bother with it.
	
✓	Both programs have Rectangle and Ellipse tools that draw editable 
paths.
	
✓	Brushes are controlled similarly in the two programs. The main difference 
is that brush strokes in Illustrator are more editable, both when they are 
being used as a line, and even after they have been expanded to create a 
vector shape. Brushes in Photoshop behave more like actual paintbrushes. 
They are intuitive, especially if you’re using a tablet and stylus instead of a 
mouse, but they create areas of colored pixels that are edited by adding or 
erasing pixels.
	
✓	Gradients have become remarkably similar. The fact that the color choice 
and distances are governed by the same system of color stops in both pro­
grams makes gradients much easier to understand. Linear and radial fills 
are created the same way and look the same. The difference in Photoshop 
is the flexibility to use them as a layer effect to modify the pixels on other 
layers.
	
	Gradients are a color fill rather than an actual tool. Gradients are used 
when a fade in color is needed or if the illustration needs one more level 
of realistic detail — for example, light-to-dark shadows on an illustration. 
As a tool that applies color and tone (albeit in a very sophisticated way), 
gradients count as a drawing tool.
	
✓	The Eraser tool also behaves similarly in both programs.
	
	In Photoshop — as in real life — an eraser is indeed a drawing tool. For 
instance, if you’re drawing on a dark background, you can use the Eraser 
tool to subtract darks by drawing with it on the dark surface. Essentially, 
the Eraser tool acts just like a pencil eraser: It takes away detail rather than 
create it.

200
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
✓	The color option is similar on both toolbars but reflects the differences in 
the basic uses between Illustrator and Photoshop. In Illustrator, the tool­
bar options are Fill and Stroke; in Photoshop, the options at the bottom 
of the toolbar are Foreground and Background. Toggling between the 
two colors as well as color selection are quite similar.
Transformation tools
Tools used to scale, rotate, skew, warp, and create perspective are found on 
the Tools palette in Illustrator, but Photoshop has traditionally put those 
functions via Edit➪Transform. Users of both programs will still find what 
they need in the same places, but Illustrator has a Free Transform tool on 
the Tools palette that will appeal to Photoshop users.
Type tools
Photoshop has moved forward in leaps and bounds in the Type tools. The 
familiar T is available on both toolbars and now behaves even more similarly 
between the two programs. The regular character and paragraph parameters 
(Font, Color, Leading, Alignment, and so on) are controlled in windows and 
tabs that are laid out the same way between programs. Photoshop also now 
allows you to click and drag to define a text box, like in Illustrator, which 
makes it easier to handle a text block (sometimes called “area type”) the 
same way with both programs.
Photographic tools
Regardless of how close the two programs get, if you’re editing photos, you 
will most likely be editing them in Photoshop. Tools like Burn, Dodge, Sponge, 
Blur, Sharpen, and Smudge are key tools in the Photoshop Tools palette, 
whereas Illustrator keeps tools for handling vector-based elements front and 
center.
Changing Fonts with Character Styles
Setting up styles for your text is a great way to save time and to ensure that 
your text is consistent. And, the best place to start the process is to adjust 
your workspace.
The character window, character style window, and paragraph styles windows 
can all be accessed individually from the Window menu at the top. We find 
it much easier to use the drop-down Essentials menu, at the upper right of 
Photoshop’s interface, which will instantly set up your workspace with all the 
typography windows.

201
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
Like everything in Photoshop, there are several ways to accomplish your 
tasks. You can make character and paragraph styles by
	
✓	Changing all parameters of the type first: Then, with your type selected, 
choose New Paragraph Style or New Character Style from the fly-out 
menu at the upper right of the relevant tab. The new style will have the 
characteristics of the text that you have made.
	
✓	Creating the new styles first: Then apply them to text that you add to 
your document later.
	
Whichever route you take, be sure to name your layers with names that will 
make sense to you later, like Headline text or Body copy. All styles can 
be imported from document to document, so having clear naming conven­
tions will come in handy.
We find the most efficient way to use styles is to set up as much of your text 
formats in the paragraph styles first because character styles override para­
graph styles information.
Follow along to create a new paragraph style.
	
1.	Double-click the style’s name to bring up its options.
	
	 You can change a host of basic and advanced aspects of the type within 
the Paragraph Style Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-4.
Figure 10-4: Choose text styles here.
	
2.	Pick a font, alignment, size, and more.
	
3.	When you’re satisfied with what you set up, apply it to your text by 
clicking the name of the style in the Character Styles (or Paragraph 
Styles) palette.

202
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
	 Notice that the changes are applied to whatever text is selected. If nothing 
is selected, the changes are applied to everything. If nothing happens, per­
haps an override has applied manually to the type. To fix it, choose Clear 
Override from the Styles palette fly-out menu.
Here’s how to create a new type style:
	
1.	Double-click a style to see its options.
	
	 The Character Style Options dialog box appears. If you don’t have any 
type selected, most of the format options should be blank, which is what 
you want.
	
2.	Change something.
	
	 For this example, change the color — at the bottom of the dialog box — 
to red.
	
3.	Name the style.
	
	 Red would be a grand name.
	
	 Now you can change the color of text throughout your document with­
out also getting a surprise change to the font or size.
	
You don’t have to change styles exactly this way, but whatever way you 
choose, try to make your system methodical.
Another great thing about styles is that you can import them from other docu­
ments. So, perhaps you wrote the copy for your Uncle Sam infographic in Word, 

203
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
or perhaps you had been working in Illustrator and now want to bring your text 
into your Photoshop document. From the fly-out menu options for both styles, 
choose Load Character/Paragraph Styles. See Figure 10-5. Navigate to the file 
with the style you want to load and click Open, and the style will be loaded into 
the appropriate tab.
Figure 10-5: Carry over styles from different documents.
Creating Boundaries with Layer 
Masks and Clipping Paths
A mask allows you to hide or reveal parts of your image. Separate masks can 
be applied individually to different layers within your Photoshop document, 
allowing you the ability to affect the properties and visibility of those layers.
Say you have a photo with a background you’d like to get rid of. A natural 
impulse would be to use the Eraser tool and literally start erasing what you 
don’t want. However, using the Eraser or the Crop tool permanently gets rid 
of those pixels. You should keep those pixels — just hide them. That way, you 
preserve your ability to change your mind and to make precise edits.
That’s called nondestructive editing, which we can’t recommend highly enough. 
It could save your sanity some day when you’re deep into a complicated proj­
ect. If you save your document as a layered PSF or TIFF file, those masks (and 
pixels) will still be there next time you open your document.
Photoshop offers you two main types of masks: layer masks and clipping 
paths.

204
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Layer masks are bitmap images that are edited with the painting or selection 
tools. If you want the image or project to appear masked when it’s opened in 
Photoshop, you can use a layer mask.
Clipping paths can be made by the Pen tool, the Shape tool, or even with text. 
A clipping path is a masking option that can leave your original photo looking 
the same but also enable a mask to be used when the image or project is saved 
for use in Adobe Illustrator. For instance, if you want the photo or project to 
seem untouched when opened in Photoshop, but also want it to be masked 
when observed in Illustrator, you can create a path with the Pen tool and then 
save it by choosing Window➪Path➪Clipping Path.
Layer masks and clipping paths both really do the same things, but a clipping 
path allows for import into Illustrator as a masked object.
Building a layer mask by cropping
Here how to create a mask with the Crop tool:
	
1.	Activate the Crop tool.
	
	 The Crop tool is the fifth tool down on the Tools palette. It looks like an 
overlapping set of squares (a traditional drafting tool).
	
2.	Click and drag to create a rectangle over the part of the picture that 
you want to keep.
	
3.	Double-click or press Return/Enter or click the check mark at the top 
of your workspace
	
	 The crop is made. The Crop tool deletes the area outside the cropped area.
Go ahead and try it. You can always undo the edit by pressing ⌘+Z/Ctrl+Z.
	
Like we said, cropping works, but it’s destructive editing. Those pixels are 
gone. Not good. Information that could be used is lost if a crop is made and 
the project is saved. That is why we warn against using this liberally.
To have a happier ending, look at the top of your workspace for the Delete 
Cropped Pixels check box and make sure that it’s not selected. Now if you 
draw the crop boundary and double-click, you get a layer mask.
	
You can change the size and proportions of that crop box by dragging the 
handles at the sides and corners of the selected area.
When you choose the Move tool (the first one on the Tools palette) before 
clicking the to-be-edited photo, you’ll find you can change what you see. The 
masked area (your canvas) acts like a window through which you can see 
a part of your image. Move the image around or even scale it, and different 
parts of your photo are shown.

205
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
Using layer masks to hide or reveal 
selected parts of an image
Here’s how to use a layer mask to hide or reveal selected parts of an image:
	
1.	Define an area using the Quick Selection tool (fourth from the top of 
the Tools palette).
	
2.	Click a part of your image with that tool.
	
	 It begins to select pixels that are similar in color.
	
3.	Select the part that you would like to hide: the background, for 
example.
	
4.	On the Select tab, choose Select Inverse.
	
	 Select is located on the main menu at the top of the program. Choose 
Select➪Inverse to reverse the selection originally made if you want to 
mask out everything inside your selection. Choose Select➪Inverse again, 
and the opposite will be selected to mask.
	
	 You want to opt for this because whatever is selected when you make 
the mask is the part that will be revealed by that mask.
	
5.	Click the Refine Edge button (at the top).
	
	 The dialog box that appears gives you precise control over the edge of 
your selection. You can experiment with it for a bit.
	
6.	For the Output To choice, use Layer Mask.
	
7.	Click OK.
Now take a look at your Layers pane. The resulting mask is visible as a thumb­
nail on that image layer. The black part is what is hidden, or 0% visible. The 
white part is 100% visible.
Double-click the thumbnail of that mask to see and control the properties of 
the mask. See Figure 10-6. Clicking the Invert button, for example, automatically 
flips which parts are shown and which parts are hidden.
The boxing glove in our Uncle Sam graphic uses a layer mask, and by manipu­
lating the properties of the boxing glove, the artist could achieve many differ­
ent looks.
	
The same principle can be employed with adjustment layers as with an image 
layer. An adjustment layer is a layer (go figure) that when added, allows you to 
edit the layers below it with color balance, editing curves, contrast, and so 
on. A layer mask can be added to this layer, to mask the area needed for the 
adjustment.

206
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 10-6: Working with a layer mask.
Click Create New Adjustment Layer at the bottom of the Layers palette. 
Choose Black and White for grins to see really obvious effects. Your image 
now looks black and white, and the adjustment layer you made has a white 
layer mask thumbnail image.
Select that layer mask and use a Brush tool to paint black areas into the mask. 
The adjustment layer is hidden, and the colored image below is revealed, 
wherever you paint.

207
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
Creating a clipping path
Clipping paths are a similar concept, but are created a little differently. A clip­
ping path is a masking option that can leave your original photo looking the 
same but also enables a mask to be used when the image or project is saved 
for use in Adobe Illustrator. For instance, if you want the photo or project to 
seem untouched when opened in Photoshop, but also want it to be masked 
when observed in Adobe Illustrator, you can create a path with the Pen tool 
and then save it by choosing Window➪Path➪Clipping Path. If you want the 
image or project to appear masked when it is opened in Photoshop, use a 
layer mask. They both really do the same things, but a clipping path allows 
for import into other programs, including Illustrator as a masked object.
Here’s how to make one:
	
1.	Create a new layer.
	
2.	On that layer, draw any shape.
	
	 It could be a rectangle, a complex shape done with the Pen tool, or even 
some text. Try text first because it’s fun.
	
3.	Type a word, make it nice and big, and then drag it below the layer 
you want to mask.
	
4.	Select the layer you want to mask (your image).
	
	 Choose Layer➪Create Clipping Mask, or choose Create Clipping Mask 
from the fly-out menu.
	
	 Voilà! You’re left with only the word.

208
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
In Figure 10-7, an image of a brick is placed above a type layer with a word 
(BRICK) on it. When you select the image layer — above the type layer — and 
apply the clipping path, the word below that image layer becomes the clip­
ping path/mask for the image.
Figure 10-7: Use a clipping path to mask a layer.
Making Your Graphics Pop
After you master the basics of Photoshop, graduate to some of the more 
advanced moves to add professional polish to your work. Again, many of 
these techniques have a similar version in Illustrator (see Chapter 9).
Creating depth with blend modes
Blend modes are available at the top left of the Layers palette. The default 
setting is Normal, but a wealth of options are hidden in that drop-down menu. 
These options can be used to correct an image’s exposure, create contrast, 
and give a professional finish to your image. Or, you can use them simply for 
fun special effects.
	
The blend modes allow layers to intersect with each other. You see both 
layers, but one changes the look of the other. Different modes combine the 
layers in different ways. Working with blend modes is a very visual process. 
Expect surprises and be prepared to experiment until you get the effect 
you’re looking for.

209
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
Think of it this way. You have a base layer with an image, with a blend layer 
on top of it. The blend layer can also have an image, a pattern, or a solid 
color on it, but it’s the layer to which the blend mode is applied. Pixels on the 
blend layer combine with pixels on the base layer to create the visual result.
The types of blending effects (see Figure 10-8) are grouped by the type of 
result they create.
Figure 10-8: Using blending effects in Photoshop.
The options in the first set tend to darken the layer they’re affecting. We find 
that Multiply is the handiest of that group, and explaining how it works will 
help you understand what’s going on with the rest.
The colors on the Multiply blend layer show up if they are as dark or darker 
than the pixels on the layer below. So, for example, if your Multiply layer has 
a graduated fill from white to black, anything lighter than the pixel below 
it would just not show up. And, the darker areas would be compounded, 
making the overall image appear darker.

210
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
If you have an image that’s too light, you could duplicate that layer, set the 
mode to Multiply, and instantly get a much darker, stronger version of your 
image.
The next set of blend modes tend to lighten as they’re combined. Screen is 
essentially the opposite of Multiply. Wherever the pixels on Screen mode 
are lighter than the pixel below, the lighter pixels shows up. Wherever the 
blended image is darker than the one below it, the image disappears. This 
creates a lighter and brighter version of your image below.
The next group of options are light-based, and the names describe their effects 
pretty accurately. The effects mix colors with varying degrees of harshness or 
contrast. Most of these blends affect the darker and lighter pixels, leaving the 
midtones relatively untouched. You will probably find that the most useful of 
that set is Soft Light. The effects in that group get increasingly dramatic cumu­
lating with Hard Mix, which has no gradients. Colors are either On or Off, and 
the effect is like posterization.
	
Posterization gives your image a harsh hard mix of bright and dark colors. It’s 
almost the same effect as a high-contrast copy on a copy machine but with 
multiple colors.
The next set of modes are specialty modes that exclude, invert, or cancel 
out parts of your image. And, at the bottom of the menu, are the component 
blend modes that affect a single aspect of the blended color. Perhaps the 
most useful of that set is the Color mode in which you can add a solid color 
across your whole image, or you can paint spot colors. A good way to test-
drive Color mode is to colorize a black-and-white image. See Figure 10-9 for a 
simple example of using just a touch of color on a black-and-white image.
	
Before you start
	
✓	If your photo is black and white, make sure to change your document 
mode to a color mode.
	
✓	If your photo is color, you can just put a black-and-white adjustment 
layer on top of your image layer. On the Layers tab, choose Layer➪New 
Adjustment Layer➪Black and White.
	
	Turn the visibility of the adjustment layer off and on if you want reassur­
ance that the colors are still there. Adjustment layers are covered earlier 
in this chapter.

211
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
Figure 10-9: Blend modes allow you to experiment with color, and with light and dark.
To use Color mode
	
1.	Make a new layer above your other layers.
	
	 When you create a new layer, Photoshop places the layer immediately 
above the layer you’re working in. If you create a layer where you don’t 
want it to be, just select it and drag it up or down your layer list.
	
2.	Call the Color mode layer Color Layer or something similar.
	
3.	With that color layer selected, go to the drop-down menu and choose 
Color from the available blend modes.
	
	 You won’t see anything yet.
	
4.	Select a brush and a nice, bright color, and then start painting on that 
layer.
	
	 You’ll see the addition of color to the black-and-white layer, but in a 
transparent way. You still see all the information in your black-and-white 
photo, but now some parts will look colorized. See Figure 10-10.

212
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 10-10: Add color to your work.
	
Blend mode layers are like all the other layers. You can always control the 
opacity. Turn the layer up to 100% for the full effect, or turn it down for an 
increasingly subtle result.
Changing colors with a color overlay
There are two quick and easy ways to change colors in your Photoshop docu­
ment using color overlays.
Find the first one, available in Photoshop CC, by choosing Layer➪Layer 
Style➪Color Overlay. With this method, color can be applied as an effect 
to specific Photoshop layers. If the layer you want to affect is a full image, 
choose Layers➪Layers Style when that particular layer is active. The Layers 
Style dialog box is self-explanatory, offering the ability to change color, blend 
mode, and opacity. Make your selections and click OK.
In the Layers palette, you can then see the effect listed below the layer’s 
name. Any time you want, double-click Color Overlay for that layer, and 
change the color to something else. The view is updated dynamically, so you 
can keep changing the color until it’s just right.

213
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
This approach can be used to make changes to isolated areas in your image 
as well. A type layer that’s rasterized (choose Type➪Rasterize Type Layer) 
or any layer with a colored shape can have the color overlay effect applied 
the same way, allowing you to change the color throughout your document 
with ease.
	
It’s fun to experiment with the blending modes in the Color Overlay dialog 
box to see which suits your needs. Some add strong surface colors, and 
others are more subtle.
The second way to change colors in your Photoshop document using color 
overlays can also be used in older versions of Photoshop, and behaves 
similarly.
Click the Create New Adjustment Layer button (at the bottom center of the 
Layers palette) and select the Solid Color option. The dialog box that appears 
gives you the chance to select the right color. Click OK, and you have a layer 
that is filled with your color of choice.
The blending mode and opacity options at the top of the Layers palette can 
be used in the same manner. The color is added in whatever style or level 
of transparency you choose. Double-click the color box that shows up to 
change the color quickly and easily.
To do the same thing to individual parts of your image, create a selection. Draw 
a path or a square, or use the Magic Wand tool (under the Quick Selection tool) 
to select the parts that you want to affect.
With the selection active, click Create New Adjustment Layer. The solid color 
is created with a mask, so only that part will show up with the color you 
choose. Edit the opacity and blending as you see fit. See Figure 10-11.
Giving graphics depth: gradients, bevels, and satin
Photoshop provides a variety of effects, such as drop shadows or glows, that 
you can apply to your layers. The advantages to using layer effects are speed 
and sophistication of design. Also, the effects are nondestructive. As we 
discuss earlier, effects change the look of your layer but can be turned off or 
edited at any time.
	
You can also modify the content of a layer, and the effects are instantly 
applied to the modified content.

214
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 10-11: Working with a color overlay.
Working with gradients
The gradient effect is a good place to start. Gradients applied to a shape can 
create a feeling of depth. For example, as in Illustrator, applying a radial fill 
can make a circle look like a 3D ball. The popular Glossy Button effect, which 
makes a circle look like a 3D object made of glass, is achieved this way, using 
a linear gradient effect.
Here’s another example, using our Uncle Sam infographic. Uncle Sam is wearing 
a boxing glove to show that he’s ready to fight back against rising debt. Using a 
plain red boxing glove would look fine. But by adding a gradient effect, as shown 
in Figure 10-12, the art looks more three-dimensional, is more eye-catching, and 
gives the impression of movement. Here’s how to do that.
With the glove layer selected (active), choose Layer➪Layer Style from the 
menu bar. In the Layer Style dialog box that appears, select the Gradient 
Overlay check box on the left.

215
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
Figure 10-12: Adding depth with the gradient effect.
You will most likely see a white-to-black, linear default gradient. In the Layer 
Style dialog box, set the colors and features that define the boxing glove. Move 
the Opacity slider toward 0 to see your initial color increasingly show through.
	
If your radial fill is putting the black at the center, select the Reverse check 
box. White should now be at the center. Move the Scale slider to see the 
lighter area get bigger and smaller.
Okay, your glove has depth now, regardless of how much of your initial color 
shows through. Now it’s time to change the colors in the gradient.
Click directly on the Gradient color picker (below the Opacity slider) to open 
the Gradient Editor to find a selection of presets. You can even create your 
own gradient.
In the Gradient Editor, click any of the color stops (see the small squares in 
Figure 10-13) along the underside of the gradient. Then, at the bottom of the 
editor, open the Color menu. A color picker opens, and now you can select 
any color you like.
The stops along the upper side of the gradient control color opacity. If you 
create a gradient that goes from dark blue to light blue, and the opacity is set 
at 100%, you would end up with a blue ball no matter what color you initially 
drew for your circle.

216
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 10-13: Choose colors and opacity with the
 Gradient Editor.
Click OK to apply the style to your layer. Or, to keep the style to use again, 
save it to presets by clicking the New button (upper right of the dialog box). 
You will be prompted to name the new style. Click OK, and your custom gra­
dient will be saved to the Styles panel (choose Windows➪Style).
	
Applying style is faster than drawing and coloring a gradient-filled object. 
And, if you need to change the color later, you can. Nondestructive editing 
and sophisticated control of your effect — what could be better?
	
When you want to edit the gradient effect, or any layer effect, simply go to 
your Layers palette. Underneath the layer, look for Effects and then below 
that, Gradient Overlay.
Beautifying with the bevel function
Bevel & Emboss effects add various combinations of highlights and shadows 
to a layer to simulate depth. You can make text look like a solid 3D element or 
give it a raised or embossed appearance.
The effect can be applied to any object on any layer (or layer group) — as 
long as that layer is unlocked. To see how it looks, type any word in any color 
and then apply your layer effect.

217
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
	
For an even faster way to apply a layer style, double-click the layer itself (not 
on the thumbnail or the layer name) to bring up the Layer Style dialog box.
From the styles along the left of the Layer Style dialog box, select the Bevel 
& Emboss check box. Then click directly on the words Bevel & Emboss to 
advance the dialog box to the options that control the structure of the bevel. 
See Figure 10-14.
Figure 10-14: Exploring options for the bevel function.
From the Style drop-down menu, choose from
	
✓	Inner Bevel: Create a highlight at the top left and apply the effect within 
the area defined by the type.
	
✓	Outer Bevel: Create the effect outside the shape and put the highlight at 
bottom right.
	
✓	Pillow Emboss: Inset the shape, or type, into an outer bevel.

218
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Experiment with the other options here. Selecting the Up or Down radio but­
tons allows you to toggle between whether the effect appears to come out of 
the image or appears set into it. Use the Depth slider to change the intensity 
of the effect. From the Technique menu, change how sharp the bevel effect 
appears. Select the Anti-aliased check box to smooth out any appearance of 
pixelation along your edges.
Adding a satin effect
The Satin effect (select the Satin check box in the Styles column, left side is 
the Layer Style dialog box) works like Bevel & Emboss, but it works within the 
defined shape, creating a rippled or satin-y surface finish.
Try out the various profiles from the Contour drop-down menu (of Satin) to 
see a variety of ripples that you can apply.
Striking strokes
To see how strokes can add to your design, Option-click/right-click that layer 
to bring up the Blending Options. There, select Stroke; see Figure 10-15. Make 
sure you’re in the proper editing field by clicking the word Stroke itself.
Figure 10-15: Experimenting with strokes.

219
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
	
✓	Size: The Size slider controls the width of the line. Turn it up to 10 or 
more pixels (px) to get a big heavy line.
	
✓	Position: From the Position drop-down menu, set where the line is drawn 
relative to the actual selection. If you choose Outside, the line looks 
curved at the corners. Choosing Inside makes the corners become sharp.
	
✓	Fill Type: From the Fill Type drop-down menu, you will see that strokes 
can now be gradients or patterns as well as colors.
	
Strokes, like any layer effect, can be applied to type, combined with other 
effects and applied to paths that you have drawn or imported.
Layer effects aren’t the only way to create a stroke, however. Follow along to 
see what we mean.
	
1.	Create a new layer.
	
2.	Select the Pen tool (press P on the keyboard) to start making a path.
	
	 Make sure the Auto Add and Delete check boxes (at the top of the work­
space) are selected. That way, you can add and delete points without 
having to change the Pen type.
	
3.	Start drawing.
	
	 The Bezier Pen tool works basically the same way in Photoshop as it does 
in Illustrator. Clicking alone makes corner points; clicking and dragging 
makes curving points with editable handles. To edit one handle without 
affecting the other, hold down Option/Alt while you push or pull the handle.
	
4.	When you finish drawing the shape, open your Paths window (choose 
Window➪Paths).
	
	 What you drew is shown in that window as Work Path.
	
	 In the fly-out menu at the upper right of the Paths window, find the 
Stroke Path option. This gives you the ability to add a pencil or brush-
like stroke to your path. Selecting the Simulate Pressure check box can 
give you a nice effect, too.
To see yet another way to apply a stroke, draw another path. From the Paths 
fly-out menu, choose Make Selection. Then choose Edit➪Stroke to bring up a 
dialog box with position, width, and color options.

220
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
Apply strokes as layer effects whenever possible because they are infinitely 
editable. Strokes created using the other methods are bitmapped lines — 
colored pixels that become part of your image. Changing them later would 
be a pain.
Showcasing elements with shadows
Another layer effect that will come in tremendously handy is a drop shadow, 
which you can use underneath text, photos, or objects to give the effect that 
these objects are on top of the background or image below.
Start by making a series of shapes that you can apply shadows to. That will 
allow you to see the kind of options you have.
	
1.	Open a new document.
	
2.	Click the Custom Shape Tool (near the bottom of the Tools palette, it 
looks like a squished gingerbread man).
	
	 A drop-down menu of available shapes shows up along the top of your 
workspace when the tool is selected.
	
3.	Choose a simple shape from the drop-down menu.
	
	 For this running example, start with a star.
	
4.	Create a series of stars (or whatever shape you want).
	
a.	Create the star on the left side of the canvas.
	
b.	Click OK.
	
c.	Duplicate that layer twice.
	
d.	Select the topmost of your copied layers and move it to the right side 
of your canvas.
	
e.	Hold down Shift and then select the first shape and the copy layers.
	
f.	Choose Distribute Widths from the Align tool (at the top of your 
workspace).

221
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
	
	 You’ll have a nice line of repeated shapes that you can start adding 
­shadows to.
You first shadow can be a nice, soft shadow. Here’s how:
	
1.	With the first shape layer selected, click the FX (fx) icon at the bottom 
of your Layers palette and choose Drop Shadow.
	
	 This is just one of several ways that Photoshop lets you select layer 
effects. They are also available from Layer➪Layer Style.
	
	 The Drop Shadow dialog box appears, revealing options much like those 
in other layer effects. The Opacity setting controls the strength of the 
shadow.
	
2.	Bring Opacity down to about 50%.
	
	 Angle and Distance controls which side the shadow falls to and how far 
away it is from the object. You can also select the shadow itself and 
move it around manually. The numbers in the dialog box change to 
reflect the moves you make.
	
3.	Click OK.
	
4.	Copy the shadow directly onto the next shape.
	
a.	Hold down Option/Alt and select the “Drop shadow” in your image 
layer.
	
b.	Drag it onto the next image layer.
	
	Both layers should now have the same shadow.
	
	If you hold down ⌘/Ctrl instead of Option/Alt, you can move the 
effects — transferring them to another layer rather than duplicat­
ing them.
For the next shadow, make it sharper-edged. (Note: Typically, shadows are 
sharper when the light is stronger, and the shape is closer to the surface that 
the shadow is to be cast on.) To edit this shadow
	
1.	Double-click the words Drop shadow in that layer.
	
2.	When the dialog box opens, simply reduce the size and distance of 
your shadow to get the right effect.
	
3.	Click OK.
If you moved the direction or “angle” of your shadow before you click OK, 
you may have seen the shadow under your first shape move as well. That 
happens because of the Use Global Light check box. When it’s selected, all 

222
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
shadows behave as if they are lit from the same light, which is great for unity 
within your design. If you don’t want the shadows to behave that way, simply 
clear that check box.
For the third shape, try something different.
	
1.	With the third layer selected, click the FX button again.
	
2.	Choose Inner Shadow.
	
	 This creates the illusion that your shape has been cut out of the back­
ground layer.
	
3.	Play with the parameters to change how deep the hole into your back­
ground looks.
Managing Your Workflow
If you’ve followed the chapter to this point, you can see how Photoshop’s 
features can transform your infographic into a work of art. All those bells and 
whistles come with some potential pitfalls, though. In this section, we discuss 
how to work with all those layers and also how to avoid piling on too many 
special effects.
Copying style effects from one layer to another
Copying effects between layers is easy. To see it in action, follow along.
	
1.	Open a new Photoshop document.
	
2.	With the Text tool, write something in big font size and a nice, bright 
color.
	
3.	With that layer selected, click the FX button at the bottom of your 
Layers panel to give your text a drop shadow. While you’re in there, 
go nuts and give it a white stroke and a bevel as well.
	
4.	Copy the layer.
	
	 Photoshop allows you to copy layers. You can
	
• Press ⌘+J/Ctrl+J to duplicate your layer.
	
	or
	
• Holding down Option/Alt key, click and drag over the text you 
typed.
	
5.	Move your copied type down enough so that both words are visible.
	
6.	In the copy layer, double-click the T icon to begin editing your text.

223
 Chapter 10: Designing Infographics in Photoshop
	
7.	Type in a completely new word.
	
	 Note that the effects are all still working.
	
8.	With your new word selected, choose Window➪Character.
	
9.	Change the color, font size, or any other attribute.
	
	 The layer styles you have applied remain intact.
An easier and even more flexible option is available:
	
1.	Create a new layer (press the New Layer icon at the bottom of your 
Layers pane).
	
2.	Draw a colored rectangle (click and drag with the Rectangle Marquee 
tool).
	
3.	Hold down the Option/Alt key, click the word Effects in one of your 
type layers, drag the styles onto your rectangle, and release.
	
Clicking the word Effects brings all the styles in that group to your rectangle. 
Selecting a single effect — say, just a drop shadow — to click and drag to 
your rectangle layer means that only that effect is copied.
Using effects sparingly
It’s easy to spot an infographic done by someone who has recently discovered 
the joys of Photoshop. Many an enthusiastic designer has piled on all the spe­
cial effects, and unwittingly created a jumbled, distracting mess.
It takes a lot of trial and error to find out which Photoshop effects work best 
for each project. The good news is that no matter what tool you try, it’s easy 
to undo your work and start again. The better news is that it’s all pretty fun.

I

f you’ve been through the preceding two chapters, you have a good 
beginner’s start on Adobe’s powerful design programs, Illustrator and 
Photoshop. Sometimes you’ll have to choose which program you’re going to 
use for a project, and other times, you’ll use both in conjunction.
In this chapter, we take a look at how to integrate Illustrator and Photoshop 
into your design arsenal. Once you get the hang of them, you can use them 
for many phases of your infographic design. We also explore the big question 
of how to choose between the two, depending on the requirements of your 
infographic project. You’ll discover some ways of using the best that each 
program has to offer. And we show you a few additional tools for increasing 
the level of polish and sophistication in your infographics.
Starting Your Project with Illustrator
There is rarely just one way to create an infographic. However, Illustrator 
is arguably the best place to start your project. For one thing, Illustrator’s 
vector shapes are very easy to scale, which makes this program a good 
choice for things such as creating logos, which may need to be reused at 
many different sizes.
Also, Illustrator handles type really nicely. If you start your graphic in Illustrator, 
the process can be easier at the outset and also more flexible throughout.

226
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
The Symbols function is also something to bear in mind at the beginning 
of your process. If you have navigation buttons in your interactive graphic, 
simple numbered bullets in your flat graphic, or even an arrow style that 
may need to be changed at the end of the process, using Illustrator symbols 
makes the changes a simple matter.
Starting an Illustrator wireframe can vary a little depending on whether your 
graphic is for print, web, or other, but the process is basically as follows:
	
1.	Create a new document, and set your artboard size to reflect the final 
use size.
	
	 If your graphic is going to be for web use, set the document profile as Web.
	
2.	Set all units to pixels.
	
	 Everything is easier if your measurements match between all your 
design programs.
	
3.	Turn on pixel-grid alignment for objects.
	
	 The corners of your vector shapes will be anti-aliased — smoothed out 
rather than pixelated — but lines stay crisp.
	
4.	Set up your guides.
	
	 This could involve margins, columns, headline locations, or some other 
measurement important to your project.
	
5.	Set up your layers.
	
	 You’ll want
	
• A guide layer
	
• A background layer
	
• Layers for elements that are “fixed”
	
	A fixed element could be an icon that appears on every page or 
layer of your information graphic.
	
• Layers for any content parts that you want to affect separately
	
6.	Start to organize the visual and narrative hierarchy of your information.
Figure 11-1 shows the set-up process in creation.
	
Because Illustrator makes all these upfront nuts-and-bolts setup steps easy 
and fast, we recommend starting there regardless of whether your design 
incorporates graphic vector elements.

Figure 11-1: Working with Illustrator layers.
Opening Photoshop Files in Illustrator
As we discuss in this chapter, you can “place” Photoshop images in Illustrator, 
which is a great function that allows your photo to remain linked to the origi­
nal. This means that the original image is not technically part of the file; rather, 
it stays in an external file. Relinking to your photo allows you to update it at 
any time, say to reflect changes to the image or to bring in a higher-resolution 
version. Illustrator also now shows a preview of the image while you’re plac­
ing it and lets you place multiple images at once, which is great. Hmm. But 
what if you want to keep the layers of your PSD file intact?
The answer is pretty simple. In Illustrator
	
1.	Choose File➪Open.
	
2.	Navigate to and open your Photoshop document.

228
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
	
3.	Click OK.
	
4.	In the Photoshop Import Options dialog box that opens, make sure 
that the Convert Layer to Objects radio button is enabled and then 
click OK. See Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2: Importing Photoshop images into Illustrator.
	
	 The document comes in with the layers intact. The layers are separate 
rasterized images that can be moved, scaled, and affected the same way 
as any photo can be in Illustrator.
	
	 Like other photos, though, they can’t be scaled up larger than their origi­
nal Photoshop size without looking pixelated.
	
Watch out for layer effects, blend modes, and adjustment layers when you 
import files. If you have effects (such as drop shadows) applied to one layer, 
Illustrator will merge all visible layers upon import. If you want to keep your 
layers separate, rasterize any effects layers before opening the file in Illustrator.

229
 Chapter 11: Expanding Your Tools and Techniques
Using Illustrator Graphics in Photoshop
Many designers like to take their Illustrator graphics into Photoshop to take 
advantage of the very sophisticated filters and effects. And, exporting your 
graphics directly from Illustrator lets you keep all your layers intact as well 
as your type editable. So, after you have your elements the way you like 
them, export your layers to Photoshop, copy and paste them into Photoshop, 
or import them from within Photoshop.
To get Illustrator graphics into Photoshop, you can simply copy an image in 
Illustrator and then paste it into Photoshop. When you do that, Photoshop 
will ask whether you want to paste the work as a smart object. You do, so 
click OK in that confirmation dialog box. As you’ll find out shortly, smart objects 
are tremendously useful.
To try this out, try this example. You’ll start with an Illustrator file with three 
layers:
	
1.	Make the bottom layer a gradient fill that goes from blue to white (or 
really any color that you feel represents sky), and name that layer Sky.
	
2.	Make a second layer with some nice bold type on it, and call that 
layer Type.
	
	 Sensing a pattern?
	
3.	Make a third layer, above the Type layer, draw a few clouds on it, and 
call that layer whatever you want. (We named ours Clouds.) Then 
change the opacity on some of the clouds and move them around so 
that you can see the type through at least one cloud.
	
4.	Choose File➪Export.
	
5.	In the Format dialog box that appears, choose .PSD as the file type and 
then click Export.
	
	 The Photoshop Export Options dialog box appears, allowing you to choose 
the file resolution. See Figure 11-3.
	
6.	Select the Write Layers radio button and the Preserve Text Editability 
check box, and then click OK.
	
	 At this point, you can also choose the resolution you want.
	
7.	Open that PSD file in Photoshop.
You’ll see that all three named layers are there and that the transparencies 
that you set in Illustrator show up in Photoshop. The text layer can also be 
edited with the Photoshop Type tool.

230
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 11-3: Exporting layers from Illustrator to 
Photoshop.
The cloud layer, however, has become a group rather than a regular layer. If 
you open that group (by toggling the triangle beside the folder icon), you can 
see that each cloud is its own layer. You can move them individually or turn 
them on and off.
Each layer in this file can now have Photoshop’s layer effects applied to them. 
For grins, apply a bevel effect to your type. Cool, right?
Scaling between Programs
If you’re using Illustrator and Photoshop together, you’ll likely start to find 
the similarities comforting. The concepts behind most actions are the same. 
“Scaling,” however, is one area where the programs’ essential differences 
really show up.
Photoshop is a bitmap or pixel-based software. Each pixel in these raster 
images can be edited individually. That’s why you can easily paint out blemishes 
with a Paintbrush tool, and why the image looks blocky when you zoom in 
really close.
Illustrator, on the other hand, is a vector-based program, and editing is 
focused on whole objects rather than on individual pixels. Each shape or line 
is mathematically created by the software’s code, and thus can be scaled or 
redrawn to any size without any concern for the pixels. Your design or draw­
ing maintains its sharp definition at any size — and that is a key benefit in 
creating files like logo design.

231
 Chapter 11: Expanding Your Tools and Techniques
Check out Figure 11-4 to see what a difference scaling can make in both 
programs.
The programs work in a complementary way, but that basic difference is 
something to be aware of when you are planning your project.
Figure 11-4: Seeing the differences between Photoshop 
and Illustrator.
So, if your workflow involves placing Photoshop images into Illustrator, you 
can rotate the images and scale them up and down, but you can’t success­
fully scale an image any larger than the original placed image. The photo will 
look increasingly blocky and blurry once you start making it larger than the 
original Photoshop file.
You can place a low-resolution photo image in Illustrator and then sub in a 
higher-resolution version of the same image afterward, but you have to plan 
for it. Here’s how:
	
1.	Select a photo that you’ve embedded in Illustrator.
	
2.	In the Links palette, open the flyout menu and choose Relink.
	
	 This allows you to search for and select the higher-resolution image.
	
3.	Click OK.
	
	 The image will replace the original placed file.
	
	 If the images are not the same in every way except resolution, however, 
the new image won’t fall in the same place.
If you’re creating vector objects in Illustrator for use as smart objects in 
Photoshop, your scaling options are much more flexible. In Illustrator, you 
can scale your vector graphics as much as you like with no loss of quality.
You can do the same thing after the Illustrator image is in Photoshop — if you 
pasted it in as a smart object. To make your smart object vector layer larger, 

232
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
you could scale it by simply choosing Edit➪Transform➪Scale, but that would 
pixelate your image.
To scale it properly
	
1.	Double-click the smart object’s thumbnail to edit the image.
	
	 It will open in Illustrator.
	
2.	Make your object bigger, and then save and close the Illustrator object.
	
	 Your changes are automatically applied within the Photoshop document.
In general, smart objects make sizing up and down a nondestructive process. 
If the smart object is an Illustrator vector, you can take advantage of another 
great Illustrator trick: Transform Each.
Say you’re creating a map with several city dots on it. If you decide that the 
dots are too small in relation to the rest of the image, yeah, you could select 
each dot and scale each one up. That becomes annoying pretty quickly.
But, if the map is an Illustrator smart object (wait for it), you can select all 
the city dots at once and choose Object➪Transform➪Transform Each. (See 
Figure 11-5.) Then, scale all the dots at the same time, scaling each from their 
own center point, which keeps them all in their proper places. Sweet.
Figure 11-5: Make changes quickly with the 
Transform Each command.

233
 Chapter 11: Expanding Your Tools and Techniques
Whatever your project, the best thing you can do for yourself is to find out 
the necessary production resolution at the start. Magazines, for example, 
need much higher resolution than will an online graphics — and you can’t 
fake pixel resolution after the fact.
Discovering the Benefits of a Smart Object
Smart objects can be raster or vector images, but the important feature is 
that they can be transformed (scaled, skewed, rotated, warped, or distorted) 
without losing any of the original image data. Have you ever scaled down 
an image in Photoshop, but then changed your mind and scaled it back up 
only to find that the image had become low resolution? That doesn’t have to 
happen anymore. And vector images never have to be rasterized. They can 
keep Illustrator’s power to scale them and edit them, indefinitely.
You can make a smart object by
	
✓	Pasting the content into Photoshop and selecting Smart Object in the 
dialog box that appears.
	
✓	Converting one or more selected layers by choosing Convert to Smart 
Object from the flyout menu at the top-right corner of your Layers palette.
Smart objects behave a lot like symbols do in Illustrator. You can duplicate 
smart object layers, scaling and transforming each one separately. You could 
make a tank full of fish that way, for example.
To continue our running example, go ahead and make — then make copies 
of — a smart object.
Then double-click any of the smart objects or copies in your Layers palette to 
open and edit the image. If the image is an Illustrator vector, the smart object 
will open up in Illustrator. If it’s a raster image, a separate Photoshop editing 
window will open up.
You can apply any of the regular layer effects, filters, or Illustrator changes 
you want. For example, you could change the color, and then save and close 
the editing window. The change you made to that smart object will have been 
made to all the related smart object copies at the same time. Figure 11-6 
shows how you can apply these changes.
The fact that those changes are layers within the smart object means that the 
process is nondestructive as well as fast. If you don’t want that filter or color 
applied anymore, just open an instance and turn off the effect layer.

234
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Figure 11-6: Change properties easily with smart objects.
You can also use smart objects as a tool for cleaning up your Layers palette. 
You never need to merge or flatten layers again. Just select several layers at 
once and convert them to a smart object, and they essentially become one 
still-editable layer.
Working with Smart Filters
If you’re seeing the benefits of smart objects, you’ll enjoy working with smart 
filters, too.
They work like layer effects. They can be turned off and on, or thrown in the 
trash without harming the original layer. They are a handy, nondestructive 
editing feature, and they can speed up workflow.
Control-click/right-click a smart object, and a context menu appears. Choose 
the Replace Contents function to swap out your image for an image with higher 
resolution. That means you can do all your edits and finessing on a lighter and 
faster low-resolution file, and then add the heavy image at the end.
Or you could set up a PSD (Photoshop) file with a series of smart filters applied, 
and then use the Replace Contents command to swap in completely different 
photos as often as you need to, as we demonstrate in Figure 11-7. Your pub­
lication or website could have a signature look for all its photos, used every 
day, but created by filters that you set up but once.

Determining which Program 
Works Best for Your Needs
Sometimes, one of Adobe’s powerhouse programs will work better than the 
other one. Over time, you’ll develop a sense of whether Illustrator or Photoshop 
is a better fit for various tasks. Until then, here’s a primer on how each program 
handles various elements of graphic design work:
Graphing
Photoshop is not a graphing program. You can create graphs but not 
dynamically from data. The process is more like hand-drawing a chart.
Illustrator offers flexibility. Built as a graphing program, Illustrator lets 
you create several distinctly different types of graphs and customize 
them to suit your needs.

236
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Detailed icons
Photoshop has sophisticated visual effects. Its blend modes and layer 
effects are first-rate and can provide a high level of polish to icons. The 
color overlay feature enables you to change icon colors quickly.
Illustrator offers scalability and sophisticated visual effects. Vector icons 
can be used small on business cards, or blown up to billboard size without 
any changes or loss of quality. However, Photoshop offers more robust 
options regarding drop shadows and opacity changes.
Patterns
Photoshop has a pattern overlay feature, which is a layer effect that can 
create a scalable seamless pattern to use in concert with other layer 
effects and blend modes. Custom shape tool has great presets that can 
be used to create patterns.
Illustrator offers a Pattern Creation tool that allows you to make seam­
less patterns you can save as swatches and apply to any shape. More 
precise control with drawing tools makes creating custom objects for 
patterns easier than in Photoshop.
Type manipulation
Photoshop
	
•	Area type: Larger type blocks can be put into area type blocks instead 
of as regular point type, and you can control alignment and leading, 
as with Illustrator, but setting up columns is not as easy.
	
•	Type alignment: Photoshop has vertical and horizontal type align­
ment tools, but no Align to Path options.
	
•	Type masking: There are several ways to use live type to mask pho­
tographs, which can help you create sophisticated effects in your 
infographics.
	
•	Type styles: These allow easy formatting and changes to type styles.
Illustrator
	
•	Touch Type tool: Use this tool to work with letters as individual 
objects, scaling and rotating them at will, without separating them 
from the rest of your type. This tool is also compatible with touch­
screen or direct-touch devices, making the letter manipulation 
even more organic and intuitive.
	
•	Type alignment: In addition to left, right, and center, type can be 
aligned vertically or aligned to a path. (For fun, align some type to 
a spiral line to see what happens.)
	
•	Type masking: Create by choosing Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make.
	
•	Type styles: These allow easy formatting and changes to type styles.

Working with Other Design Tools
Here at Infographic World, we’ve known for some time that infographics are 
an increasingly popular form of sharing information. The mechanics of craft­
ing an infographic have historically been a bit complex, requiring that you 
need certain software and design skills. Lately, though, some “new kids on 
the block” offer some interesting and simplified ways of making and sharing 
infographics. Working with these tools can be a good way to practice some of 
your developing skills as an infographic designer.
Online, you can find a few free sites to help you create nice-looking graphics 
without buying and navigating graphics software — and without too big of 
a time commitment. And in this section, we’ll show you some “new kids” to 
meet and become friends with.
	
What makes a graphic good is the content — not the decoration. You can use 
the best icon, font, and color choice these websites can offer, but if you don’t 
have good content as a base, your graphic runs the risk of becoming just 
another piece of visual static.
Microsoft programs
If you’re truly just starting out, or if you want to create a simple graphic with­
out buying a new software package, you can make basic infographics with 
two Microsoft programs, which you may already have on your computer:
	
✓	PowerPoint: Think about it: PowerPoint presentations are often filled 
with statistics, facts, and dense data, so using PowerPoint to create an 
infographic is a natural match.
	
	Various sources have published free templates for making infographics 
in PowerPoint, so check out these options to add visual interest to your 
PowerPoint session.

Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
Infogr.am
Infogr.am (http://infogr.am), which touts itself as “the world’s simplest 
application for making infographics,” is an online graphics creation and shar­
ing site. You can share the graphics by sending them directly to Facebook and 
Twitter, or copy the embed code to paste the graphic into your website. The 
graphics are clean and legible, the colors are editable, and there are several 
design themes to choose from.
After you register and log onto the site, you’ll find the interface extremely easy 
to navigate. All you need to do is select the Infographic tab or the Charts tab, 
pick your design theme, and get started.
The instructions are really straightforward. For example, following such simple 
directions as Double-click to edit chart leads you to placeholder text 
fields for your headline and description text, so just start filling in the fields. 
(See Figure 11-8.) You can customize by adding or deleting elements to suit 
your needs.
In the Infographic design area, you’ll see a few icons on the right that allow 
you to add pictures, text, maps, charts, and even video.
The Charts section features 14 main chart types, most of which come with 
subtypes or variations. Click Add Chart and you get the same editing features 
as are found in the Infographic field.
	
Although we like a lot of things about Infogr.am, keep in mind the fact that 
your content is public. Anything you upload is visible and shareable by anyone. 
Upgrading to the subscription Pro level for $18 per month allows you to share 
graphics privately, which you probably want if you’re creating proprietary 
graphics for a client. The Pro level also allows you to download your graphics 
in editable formats, such as PDF.
Easel.ly
Easel.ly (www.easel.ly) is another free graphics-creation site. The site is 
still in beta, but it works pretty well. Easel.ly has an upload function that lets 
you load images from your desktop, so you could work in another program 
and upload a static chart to your layout if you needed a chart.
To get started, you first need to register. Then simply log in and get to work.
The interface is straightforward. All the elements you need to work are along 
the top. The Vhemes (Easel.ly’s contraction of the term “Visual Themes”) tab 
gives you some templates to work with. Choose your elements, including 
background color, some useful shapes, and text from the menus along the top. 
Adding them to your graphics is as easy as dragging them onto your canvas. 
The size of the canvas is determined under the same menu as background color.

Figure 11-8: Use Infogr.am to create an infographic.
Many fonts are available as well as a variety of objects that you can drag into 
your composition. Objects, grouped into broad general categories such as 
People and Transportation, are pre-made drawings and icons. You can drag 
the images into your graphic and then edit the color and opacity to suit your 
design.
The Upload feature lets you upload your own JPG and SVG formats. For 
uploaded SVG files, you can edit the colors and opacity the same way as you 
can edit Easel.ly’s content.
Edit the text, save your graphic, and then click Share to download a JPG of your 
graphic, view it in a browser, copy the web link, or get the embed code and 
post it on your own site. Unlike Infogr.am, Easel.ly lets you set the graphic 
settings to public or private without an extra charge.

240
Part III: Depicting with Delightful Design 
An interesting feature of Easel.ly is that you can open, edit, save, and post 
other people’s graphics — which is perhaps a point to consider before you 
set your own beautiful creation to “public.”
Creative Market
Creative Market (https://creativemarket.com) is kind of like a version 
of Etsy for digital products. Individual designers post products, manage their 
own content, and set their own prices.
You can browse for graphics (vector illustrations, 3D, patterns, and so on) to 
use in your designs, or you can buy templates for everything from business 
cards and resumes to presentations and responsive web designs. Other 
products include fonts, themes, and add-ons that include custom designed 
Photoshop brushes, actions, and effects.
The products are searchable in a couple of different ways, so you can view 
by type or just pop in to see what’s recent. The site makes it easy to pay by 
PayPal, but the process involves buying credits in various increments. For 
example, you may have found the most perfect $4 icon set, but the smallest 
increment of credits that you can buy is $20. (This probably won’t be a prob­
lem for you for long, though, because there’s usually a nice variety of things 
for sale.)
The site also maintains a design blog worth checking out (https://
creativemarket.com/blog).

S

o you just completed building your infographic. Now what? The possibil­
ities for publishing your graphic depend mostly on the purpose you set 
out with as you worked on your research, your artistic elements, and your 
technological flourishes. The audience for infographics has changed consid­
erably in the past decade. The bad news: Many newspapers and magazines 
that used to publish infographics have gone out of business or shrunk. The 
good news: The web opens up nearly endless possibilities in terms of space 
and interactivity.
By now, your graphic should have been so well thought out that you know 
your desired audience, and your goal is to make sure they see your work. 
Consider your intent in creating an infographic in the first place. If your work 
has a defined audience — say, customers or employees of a certain company — 
then the placement and marketing of your work will be done for you by an 
editor, a publications director, or some sort of project manager. Those folks 
will set your deadlines, make sure your works meets their technical specifica­
tions, and release your infographic according to their schedule.
But hey, this is the Internet age. If you’re working for a print client, you don’t 
really need to worry about publishing your infographic because the news­
paper or magazine does the work. If you’re working for yourself, the respon­
sibility is all yours, and you need to be prepared to capitalize on the traffic 
patterns of the web. The possibilities for publishing your infographic to the 
web are pretty much endless. And after you turn your work loose to the web, 
it may very well go viral, attracting thousands more views, comments, links 
back to your personal website, and potentially more business for you as an 
infographic designer.
Is this what you want? Making this call is key because it will determine what 
your next steps are. Assuming this is what you want, we will spend most of 
this chapter talking about how to publish your high-quality graphics to your

own website, in the hopes of your work going viral. The timing and technical 
details we discuss here can certainly be applied to any client’s work, so bear 
these tips in mind to help your clients get great results from your work, too.
Deciding Where to Publish
The market for online infographics has truly exploded over the last few years. 
See Figure 12-1 for a high-level look into just how popular infographics have 
become. The screen shot was taken from Google Trends (www.google.com/
trends), which is a great tool to see how search volume for various key­
words changes over time. In this case, we used the term infographics. As you 
can see, the popularity of the keyword was pretty flat up until about 2011.
Figure 12-1: Charting a trend of rising interest in infographics.

245
 Chapter 12: Launching Your Infographic
In 2011, awareness and interest in infographics began to take off. Justin can 
personally speak to the validity of these numbers. He started building 
Infographic World in late 2009 and early 2010. At the time, if he walked into 
a room of 100 people, he was often the only person who knew what an info­
graphic was.
As time went on, though, awareness of what infographics are, and the power 
they hold, has risen. In that same room of 100 people, probably 40 percent 
of the people know what infographics are. (Justin is working on the other 
60 percent.)
And even though infographics have absolutely exploded in popularity, we’re 
still only seeing the tip of the iceberg. “Infographics” are not truly household 
names yet. That means that as time goes on, there is still a growing opportu­
nity as far as how big the market can grow. New blogs and websites pop up 
every day. And, to be honest, the human attention span isn’t getting longer. 
The market for clear, compelling information with a powerful visual element 
is huge.
Major blogs and online news outlets are always looking for great content to 
share with their readers. This has always been the case, and will always be 
the case. Sites like Mashable, TechCrunch, and The Huffington Post have 
become as big as they are because they have great content for their readers. 
What happens then is a bit of a trickle-down effect. Content on these big web­
sites gets seen by smaller blogs, who then share the same content on their 
site, assuming it’s relevant to their readers. If a big site like The Huffington 
Post is featuring a piece of content, it’s likely to be high-quality and some­
thing that smaller sites will want to emulate.
Publishing Infographics on the Web
We say “sneezing baby panda,” and you smile at the cuteness. We ask you what 
the fox says, and you’ll almost surely be singing that annoyingly catchy song 
for the next few hours.
These are simple examples of web content gone viral. The term “going viral” 
is probably a bit overused these days, but it’s really what you want for your 
infographic. Essentially, you want to get enough exposure for your infographic 
that it begins to spread around the web in an organic manner. Someone thinks 
it’s so cool that their 12 best friends just have to see it, and then their 12 best 
friends, and so on and so on. (This is obviously more cost-effective than, say, 
paying for ads to generate views for the infographic. It’s a great strategy for 
you as well as any company you’re designing infographics for.)

246

If your goal is create an infographic that will drive traffic back to your web­
site, build valuable links through search engine optimization (more on this in 
a moment) and get general buzz and exposure for your brand, the only real 
option for housing the infographic is your website. If you want to take part in 
the benefits that come with creating such high-quality content, you need to 
make sure you are publishing it in the most advantageous way.
If your personal website doesn’t yet include a blog, we recommend starting 
one right now. These days, blogs are very easy to set up and maintain, and 
after yours is up and running, it’s a great platform for sharing your work. 
The two main blogging platforms, WordPress and Blogger, are tops in terms 
of name recognition, and they’re both easy to use and maintain. If you don’t 
want to set one up yourself, any website developer can add this onto your 
page pretty easily.
	
Make sure that the style of your blog fits with the rest of your website from a 
branding standpoint. One of the fastest growing blogging platforms is Tumblr. 
It’s cool and highly visual — but also the territory of teenage Twilight fans. 
Depending on the image you want to present, it might not be the right plat­
form for your work.
Publishing infographics to the web requires some work on the technical 
details. First, you need to look at the infographic file itself, particularly the 
size of the file.
Determining the right size
If you’re creating an infographic for a print or web client, the client will prob­
ably specify the size. If you’re publishing it yourself, you have the power to 
decide. Still, following some of our guidelines will help optimize the way your 
graphic looks and the likelihood that it will be shared on other websites.
The more complex your infographic, the larger it’s likely to be from a mega­
byte or kilobyte standpoint. Features such as animation and high-resolution 
photos make for awesome graphics but can quickly drive up the size of the 
files. At a certain point, that creates diminishing returns: You’ll drive view­
ers away if your graphic is so big that it doesn’t load easily. You might have a 
stunning, entertaining, and informative graphic, but if all the bells and whis­
tles have driven it up to 7MB, it will load so slowly you’ll think you’re back 
in the dial-up modem days. You know what happens when something loads 
slowly on a page? The reader leaves. Simple as that.
In a 2009 survey, Forrester Consulting discovered that 47 percent of the popula­
tion expects web pages to load in two seconds or less. An earlier Google report 
showed that when load times increased from 0.4 seconds to 0.9 seconds, traffic 
and ad revenues dropped by 20 percent. Well, that was almost a decade ago, 
and attention spans have only shrunk since then.

247
 Chapter 12: Launching Your Infographic
These days, you have merely seconds to grab someone’s attention and to keep 
them on your website. Too many other things compete for your reader’s 
attention online.
	
Keep your graphic as close to 1MB as possible. You can get away with it being 
a bit larger than that, but try not to go too much larger than that.
Another option is investing in a content delivery network (CDN) to take the 
bandwidth burden off of your own servers. Many companies offer this ser­
vice. I recommend speaking with your IT group or doing a Google search for 
CDN, speak with a few companies, and explain what you’re trying to accom­
plish. This can be a smart option if you are routinely working with large files.
Creating filenames that generate traffic
What’s in a name? When it comes to your infographic, choosing the right 
name can also help drive traffic to your work. You want anyone seeing the 
post to know within one to two seconds what the post is about.
Learning how to name your graphic well requires a basic understanding of 
search engine optimization (SEO). As you may already know, SEO is a process 
of using words and terms in such a way that Internet search engines find your 
material quickly, and give it a prominent place in search results. It’s an impor­
tant part of creating any form of content for the web. Why should you care 
about SEO? Well, everyone who contributes content to the web should care 
about it. When the technology is at its best, it doesn’t just generate readers — 
it gets you exactly the audience you want. (Read about SEO in depth in Search 
Engine Optimization For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Peter Kent.)
So, how you name your infographic has a direct impact when it comes to SEO 
implications. Google search bots routinely crawl the web looking for more 
and better information. At some point, it will find your infographic on your 
website, and in turn decide (based on an ever-changing algorithm) where 
your graphic will show up in search results. The more explicitly your graphic 
uses relevant keywords, the greater the chances it will pop up on the first 
page of Google search results. Obviously, the possibilities are endless; you 
just need to consider what basic terms a reader might seek when they’re 
looking for information online.
Good news: The process of SEO really isn’t a mystery. Even the mighty Google 
wants readers to find the information they seek, and Google constantly refines 
the process to make that happen.
	
The Google algorithm is always changing. From the time of writing this book 
to the time you’re reading it, the algorithm has undoubtedly changed several 
times. Stay on top of things to keep up with how Google reads and evaluates 
content.

248
Part IV: Ready to Distribute 
A few tips on how to keep current:
	
✓	Check out the Google Webmaster Tools page. Google maintains a web­
masters guide, which does a very good job of explaining a lot of seem­
ingly complex things about web searches. You can read about Google’s 
“crawling” process, how Google indexes things, and tips you definitely 
should keep in mind. Remember that Google wants the most relevant 
content possible showing up. See
https://support.google.com/webmasters/
	
✓	Follow Matt Cutts, who is the Head of Search at Google. (Hopefully he 
will still be so by the time you’re reading this. If not, search for “Google 
Head of Search” to find out who the new person is. Yes, we see the irony.) 
Matt frequently speaks and writes about best practices and updates and 
what to keep in mind, and how things may change in the future. Very 
brilliant guy. (Hey, Matt, if you’re reading this by some miracle, I hear 
Infographic World should be #1 for every infographic keyword on the 
planet. Just sayin’.)
	
✓	Check out Moz (http://moz.com; formerly SEOmoz). This company 
was founded as an SEO consulting company and has recently broadened 
its focus to all manners of Internet marketing. They are SEO wizards over 
there, and have a great blog at http://moz.com/blog that’s always 
current with what’s going on in the SEO world. Aside from their paid 
consulting work, Moz offers amazing tips on SEO and all sorts of content 
marketing.
	
✓	Set a Google Alert for the phrase “Google algorithm update”. You’ll get 
e-mails everyday with articles relevant to that phrase.
Using appropriate keywords
After you get the general idea of how to integrate SEO terms into your work, 
use them wisely. What you don’t want to do is cram your infographic so full 
of keywords that the search engines read it as spam. Google will see right 
through people trying to “over-SEO,” so to speak.
What you want to do is use keywords in the name of the file that are important 
to you from an SEO standpoint. Imagine that you’re working for Canine Cuisine, 
a company that sells dog food. You created a thorough, well-researched, infor­
mative infographic guide for dog diets. Now you want to embed keywords rel­
evant to your infographic within the filename itself.
	
Your graphic is most likely to be picked up by Google’s “crawl” if the content 
looks natural, real, and relevant. One way to do this is to create a filename so 
it reads as a natural statement, not just a collection of keywords.

249
 Chapter 12: Launching Your Infographic
So, for our dog food graphic, one effective way to name the file would be
A consumer’s guide to healthy dog diets and dog food. Healthy Dog food.
Simple. Straightforward. And you didn’t stuff the filename with a ton of key­
words that are repetitive and blatant about their intention.
By contrast, here’s an example of what not to do:
Canine Cuisine. Dog food. Bestselling dog food. Healthiest dog food.
See what we mean by spammy and obvious? Don’t laugh; people really do this.
Introducing readers to the infographic
You know that quote that says, “Every problem is an opportunity in disguise”?
We think they wrote it about infographics.
Of the millions of people surfing the web every day, thousands probably don’t 
know what an infographic is. They’ve certainly seen them, but they might not 
recognize them as their own unique form of information.
Is that a problem? Nope. With a simple naming strategy, an infographic is an 
opportunity to catch a reader’s eye and introduce him to this unique way of 
presenting information. Your readers may not think they know what an info­
graphic is, but with the visual appeal of your graphic enhancing information 
they’re looking for anyway, they may very likely be intrigued and want to see 
what the content is all about.
Getting back to the wonderful dog food example, imagine that you’re prepar­
ing to post that infographic to a blog. Here are a couple ways to signal to 
readers that the content is an infographic:
	
✓	Put the word “infographic” in the title. One possible title for your post 
can be “Keeping Your Dog Healthy. Five Ways To Ensure That Your Dog 
Has a Long Healthy Life (infographic).” Putting the word “infographic” in 
parentheses at the end signals to your website readers that this piece of 
content is different from the others. It’s not a story, not a photo — it’s an 
infographic!
	
✓	Include an introductory paragraph for the infographic. This introduc­
tion is a lead-up for your readers, to give them an idea of what they are 
about to read. You should get them interested and excited to read the 
infographic, so maybe pull an interesting fact or two from the infographic 
and mention it here. You don’t want to give it all away, but give the reader 
just enough to want to read more.

250
Part IV: Ready to Distribute 
	
Including an intro paragraph also helps search engines validate your blog post 
and qualify it as meaningful content. Google and its rival search engines are 
wary of blog posts that contain only images because “blog bots” are notorious 
for auto-publishing images without written content. Also, search engines are 
better at crawling the sentences in your blog post than the images, thus help­
ing boost your SEO value.
Making the most of your space
Another thing to keep in mind with posting an infographic to your site has to 
do with the available space you have to put it up. Every web page has a width 
to it, measured in pixels. On any given page, all that matters for our purposes 
is the available space to put the infographic. Say your web page has 1,000 pixels 
of width from left to right. On this page, though, a certain amount of width 
(250 pixels) is taken on the left or right side of the site — say, by advertisements 
or links to other areas of your website. (See Figure 12-2.)
Figure 12-2: Size graphics to allow for other features on a web page.
That means you only have 750 pixels of width available for your infographic. 
Therefore, you want to make sure that when you build your infographic, you 
have your software (whether it’s Photoshop or Illustrator) set to a width of 
750 pixels so that when you put the infographic on the web page, it’s sized 
properly, and everything can be read easily.

251
 Chapter 12: Launching Your Infographic
Sharing Your Work
After you decided that your infographic will be placed on the web and shared 
to a wider audience, you’ll be able to take advantage of some easy tools that 
make it easy to share content. Because social media is always changing, do 
your best to stay on top of new developments in social media. In this section, 
however, we briefly discuss implementing social sharing buttons and embed 
codes to get you started sharing your content with the wider world.
	
The key element behind every sharing button and embed code is this: Content 
is king. Make sure to generate the highest quality content in your infographic. 
Use your resources and time wisely as you promote it, and you’ll be in a good 
position to get exposure for your infographic and your brand.
Providing social share buttons on the page
When you see content on the web that you find funny, insightful, or just inter­
esting in general, you probably want to share that content with others in your 
social network. Maybe it’s a fascinating news story or a hilarious YouTube 
video. If the content has social sharing buttons, all you need to do is click the 
right button, and everyone in your network can see what you’re seeing.
This is the mindset you need to have when posting your infographic to your 
website. Think about what social networks your readers are likely to use, 
and then have a button on the page that allows them to easily share the 
infographic.
The best place for these social network sharing buttons is right above the 
infographic image, below the title and introduction paragraph. You can also 
get away with putting the same buttons again right after the infographic. Some 
websites put the buttons to the left of the infographic, which is fine, too.
	
Don’t overload the page with every social networking button out there. Keep 
things simple. Our recommendation is to consider six major buttons:
	
✓	Facebook Like/Share
	
✓	Twitter retweet
	
✓	Google+
	
✓	LinkedIn
	
✓	Pinterest
	
✓	Reddit

252
Part IV: Ready to Distribute 
Ignore the other buttons. Having too many will simply overwhelm the reader 
and make them disinterested. You could place the sharing buttons at the top 
of or below your infographic. Or, consider stacking them and having them 
scroll with the user while reading. (See Figure 12-3.)
Figure 12-3: Preparing to share your graphic on social media.
Getting the buttons on the page is a snap. For example, just search online 
for “Facebook share button,” and you’ll get step-by-step instructions on how 
to get the button onto your page, which involves simply copy and pasting a 
code that Facebook provides into the back end of your website. The other 
platforms offer similarly simple methods.
	
Keep your audience in mind. For example, Pinterest is heavily used by women, 
so if the content of your infographic appeals mostly to women, Pinterest is a 
must. If the content is male-oriented, perhaps you’ll skip that button.
Audience, audience, audience
In Chapter 6, we talk about how to mine your 
research to create an infographic for various 
audiences. Considering the audience is really 
important when deciding where to publish, too.
The topic and the tone of your infographic 
should match the channels where you’re 
trying to publish it. So, a detailed explanation 
of political strife in Ukraine is not Pinterest 
material. It may be a terrific tweet, and will 
elicit hundreds of smart comments and thou­
sands of retweets, so perhaps you’ll spend 
most or all of your time getting the graphic 
ready to travel via Twitter.
By contrast, an infographic that shows a back-
to-school checklist and tips for starting a new 
school year is tailor-made for Pinterest. Sending 
your work out to the most relevant channels 
isn’t limiting; it’s just smart.

253
 Chapter 12: Launching Your Infographic
Giving out an embed code
Embed codes have become an important part of infographics. They enable 
your audience to easily share your infographic on their website or blog. Embed 
codes can simply be copied and pasted directly into HTML or blogging plat­
forms like WordPress.
Embed codes are an essential part of the infographic landing page. The more 
easily your infographic can be shared, the more links and traffic will come 
back to your infographic.
Creating an embed code
The easiest way to created an embed code is to use an online tool. Many 
embed code generators are available online, but one of the best ones is by 
Siege Media:
www.siegemedia.com/embed-code-generator
This embed code generator offers you enough control without being overly 
complicated.
Testing your embed code
Test your embed code before you use it. A simple mistake can really hurt your 
entire infographic marketing campaign. Use a real-time CSS and HTML editor 
like Scratchpad (http://scratchpad.io) to test your embed code before 
using it.

t’s go time. All the hard work of building your infographic is done, and 
it’s time to promote your infographic to the world. A lot rides on how the 
next phase goes. After all, no one wants to invest the resources, time, and 
money into building an infographic and then have it go nowhere. So, how can 
you make sure that you’re putting your infographic in the best possible posi­
tion to succeed? Bottom line: No one will know about your infographic if you 
don’t tell them about it.
In writing this, we can’t help but think about an old IBM commercial that goes 
something like this: Workers are sitting around in a conference room while the 
boss is asking questions to everyone in the room about a new website they 
built. He’s asking about how the technology is working, the design of the site, 
the messaging, the servers, and so on. Everyone in the room is very proudly 
answering every question to the boss’s satisfaction.
The boss then asks how many customers have come to the website. Every 
face goes blank, and someone meekly says, “Zero”. It was something no one 
even thought about. They spent all of this time building this amazing website, 
but none of their efforts went toward getting people to actually come to the 
website.
Infographics — and Internet content in general — are not like the Field of 
Dreams, where if you build it, users and traffic will come. At least when 
you’re beginning, you need to market your work. We’ve learned some great 
strategies for reaching the right readers at the times they’re most likely to 
pay attention. We’ve also figured out how to use technology to help us target 
our work and make it look great as it travels through cyberspace. In this 
chapter, we’ll share some of the lessons we’ve learned.

Collecting Influencers
The first step in any promotion is the preparation phase. In the case of pro­
moting an infographic, this is all about collecting influencers — those people 
who already have a media presence and can help you share your content and 
get noticed.
One of the original influencers is Guy Kawasaki. He formerly held the title of 
“evangelist” at Apple, building brand loyalty and constant buzz for Apple’s prod­
ucts. He’s now with Google and is clearly a major influencer, with 1.4 million (and 
counting) Twitter followers. If you can get him to tweet out your infographic, you 
have 1.4 million potential viewers for your work. Any or all of them could poten­
tially retweet the infographic to their respective networks, jumpstarting the viral 
process.
An influencer like Guy Kawasaki or a blogger at Mashable would be interested 
in your content because these influencers are in a constant quest for fresh con­
tent. Today’s media brokers thrive on aggregating content — pulling together 
interesting stories, quotes, GIFs, photos — and yes, infographics — from a 
wide variety of sources. Your hope is that your piece of content falls in line 
with something they might be interested in sharing.
	
So how do you know what key influencers may be interested in sharing? 
Check out what they’ve shared before. Say you admire a certain blogger at 
The Huffington Post. It’s very easy to see his content by simply going to the 
website, searching for his name, and clicking it. In doing so, you can see all 
the articles he has written and content he has shared. Look for certain topics 
he tends to be interested in. If your work overlaps, you may want to consider 
this person as a potential influencer. The same concept applies for Twitter 
influencers. Just look at the links they’ve shared. Hint: This exercise will be 
more time consuming because a major Twitter user is going to post a lot 
more content than a web blogger.
Getting prepared to go viral
In the end, your goal is to get your content to “go viral.” That phrase is most 
certainly overused at this point, and people have different definitions for it. 
Our definition of “going viral” is simply giving something enough of a push 
out the door where it then begins to spread around the web on its own.
	
Creating viral content is very difficult. We often recommend that clients 
create a series of infographics or plan for ongoing content creation. That way, 
all your eggs are not in one basket, with everything relying on the success of 
just one infographic.

257
 Chapter 13: Promoting Your Infographic
In most cases, having something go viral is not an accident. A lot of hard 
work and planning — and most importantly, execution— lies behind a piece 
of content becoming that successful. In Figure 13-1, you’ll see some of the 
steps you should take to set the stage for your graphic to go viral.
Figure 13-1: Preparing your work to go viral.
Building a list of influencers
It’s time to make a list and check it twice. Actually, check it more than twice. 
Identifying the right influencers is one of the most important things you can 
do in the entire process. You need to find the right people to reach out to as 
you encourage them to become ambassadors of your content. This list can 
make or break your promotion.
	
A common mistake people make here is that they think that every website 
would love nothing more than to feature their infographic. They end up pitching 
their work to every major website and setting themselves up for failure. The 
reality is that only a small percentage of infographics created are going to get 
featured on major websites like The Huffington Post, Mashable, or Buzzfeed. 
Having said that, keep reaching out to reporters and bloggers on those sites.

258
Part IV: Ready to Distribute 
	
A better tactic, however, is to first home in on the media outlets that are most 
likely to be interested in your content. You find the right media outlets by 
knowing your audience. If your infographic is about dogs, for example, a web­
site that is very tech-focused like Mashable may not be the right site for you. 
Instead, in this instance, you should be researching the top dog blogs and 
then make those sites your first targets.
Timing is everything
When Steve Jobs passed away in 2011, the 
Infographic World team embarked on a wild 
24-hour period of building a great infographic 
looking back on his life while simultaneously 
preparing our plan to market the infographic. 
Our homework paid off: We were able to get 
the infographic featured on Mashable, and it 
became the number one story on that site for 
a few weeks. That led to it getting picked up 
and featured on thousands of other websites, 
with hundreds of thousands of social shares 
and millions of page views. This was the living, 
breathing definition of something going viral. 
At one point, I got an angry call from our web­
site developer, wondering why I hadn’t warned 
him about all the traffic that was coming to the 
website. We were getting so many hits that our 
server was close to crashing!
This is the kind of phone call you want to get. 
You want your work to generate so much inter­
est that your website servers are holding on for 
dear life. The servers will survive. You’ll thrive.

259
 Chapter 13: Promoting Your Infographic
In this section, we show you which tools — Google, Technorati, Twitter, and 
Pinterest, to name a few — to use to help you target the right outlet and audi­
ence for your infographic. You can read about using Facebook in the upcoming 
section, “Using social media.”
Google
A straightforward and easy way to start identifying the right websites and 
blogs to target is to search Google for the topic in mind. Say you created an 
infographic on dogs, which you’ve titled “The History of Dog Breeding in the 
World.”
Type something like dog breeding history into Google. (Read more about 
searching online in Chapter 5.) You’ll get a mix of results, as shown in 
Figure 13-2, including Wikipedia pages, news stories related to dog breeding, 
and websites about dog breeding. You’ll want to dig through the search results 
and locate the ones that come from blogs dedicated to dogs and dog breeding.
Figure 13-2: Using Google searches to find an audience for your work.
Now, this actually is a measurable science. By copying and pasting the URL 
of the site into sites like Compete (www.compete.com) and Alexa Internet 
(www.alexa.com), you can see how much traffic the websites receive. Sites 
like these measure traffic on a daily (or weekly, monthly, yearly, and so on) 
basis — and such information is important because you want your infographic 
featured on the platforms that get plenty of traffic.

260
Part IV: Ready to Distribute 
After you target some good potential websites and blogs, take a look at the 
posts that have been published. See how many social shares the posts tend 
to get. Take a look at how many readers tend to comment. You want to find 
websites that have active and engaged readers. With an engaged readership, 
many posts make their way to Twitter, Facebook, and the other main social 
sites.
In the digital media landscape, posts that receive a lot of comments and a 
lot of shares are the gold standard. The nature of comments matters, too 
because those websites and blogs that provoke smart, engaged conversation 
are the ones you want to target. Even a small or medium-sized site may be 
worth targeting if its comments are relevant and its audience seems excited. 
Naturally, it won’t have the metrics like The Huffington Post, but it may be 
the right audience for you right now.
Technorati
The Technorati Top 100 can help you search for the right websites and 
blogs to add to your list. In the middle of the Technorati page (http://
technorati.com), you can find its overall Top 100 list, which contains the 
usual suspects of largest blogs in the world: The Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, 
Business Insider, and others.
The really valuable element of Technorati is its directory (http://
technorati.com/blogs/directory), shown in Figure 13-3. In this direc­
tory, you can search for the largest blogs on the web by category. So if you 
created an infographic on dogs, you can just click the Pets section to be 
taken to that directory and ranking of largest pet-related blogs on the web. 
Thanks to its focused rankings, you could really just rely on Technorati as the 
main tool to build your list of websites to reach out to during your promotion 
and be just fine.

2.	In the search bar, type in a keyword related to your infographic.
	
	 You’ll get a long list of content related to your keyword. On the left side 
of the screen, you can change the period of time. Use this function to 
see, for example, how recently someone tweeted about your subject.
	
	 Note (on the left side) the Influencers icon. This is who Topsy believes 
are the best influencers on the topic you typed into the search bar. They 
are the most likely to tweet about your infographic topic.
	
3.	Broaden this function by clicking Everything to see all people who 
have shared similar content, not just the top influencers.

261
 Chapter 13: Promoting Your Infographic
	
Here’s another way to use Topsy: Do a Google search for content similar to 
your infographic topic. Find a big story that did very well virally (perhaps it 
got picked up on Mashable or The Huffington Post). Copy and paste that 
story’s URL into the Links section of Topsy to see which influencers shared it. 
You can then add these people to your list of influencers to reach out to.
Klout
Klout (http://klout.com), which is a website and mobile app, can help 
you determine the best influencers. Klout uses an algorithm to measure the 
influence a given person has. Type your infographic topic into Klout, and 
you’ll get a list of all the influencers on those high-level topics. This is a great 
way to locate more influencers, figure out who they are, and be able to reach 
out to them.
Infographic directories
As far as outreach is concerned, one obvious but sometimes overlooked 
approach is reaching out to infographic directories and aggregators. Sites 
like this do nothing but feature infographics, so they naturally have potential. 
However, there are some downsides to this approach.
Figure 13-3: Search for relevant blogs on Technorati.

Part IV: Ready to Distribute 
	
Most infographic directories are general in focus. They feature infographics 
that they like, rather than those dedicated to any specific topic — and that 
won’t help you get your content to people definitely interested in your topic.
Also, there simply aren’t many infographic directories that have enough traf­
fic to be worth your effort. Remember that infographics are relatively new to 
the web, hitting the mainstream Internet media in 2008/2009. As a result, info­
graphic directories really haven’t had much time to build up their followings 
and user base.
Those caveats aside, infographic directories are still a viable and logical 
option as you promote your infographics. Here are a few to consider adding 
to your list (as of the writing of this book).
	
✓	Daily Infographic: http://dailyinfographic.com
	
✓	Alltop Infographics: http://infographics.alltop.com
	
✓	Infographic List: http://infographiclist.com
	
✓	Infographics Archive: www.infographicsarchive.com
	
✓	Best Infographics: www.best-infographics.com
	
✓	Great Infographics: http://greatinfographics.com
	
✓	Chart Porn: http://chartporn.org
You may want to consider searching Google for “infographic blog” and “info­
graphic directories” to look for any new ones.
Twitter
We want to revisit Twitter for a second because it’s a very valuable website 
when it comes to the promotion of infographics. Twitter never turns off, and 
there’s always a desire for fresh content. Heavy-duty tweeters want to be the 
ones to share great, relevant content with their followers. Through offering 
them your content, you may develop a symbiotic relationship: You’re helping 
the influencer share great content with their followers while also naturally 
helping yourself.
In determining the right Twitter users to go after, the easiest approach is to 
go onto Twitter and simply type the topic of your infographic into the search 
bar. This launches a search for people using a hash tag that relates to your 
content. Folks who are active on a hash tag are looking for things to tweet, 
so giving them something educational, newsworthy, or something their audi­
ence will value will make sense for them to tweet out.

263
 Chapter 13: Promoting Your Infographic
Getting back to our History of Dog Breeding in the World infographic example 
from earlier in the chapter, go to Twitter and search (in the search bar) for 
hash tags like #dogbreeding or #historyofdogbreeding. From here, go 
through tweets made using this hash tag and look to see who the users are.
Go person by person to see how active they are, how many followers they 
have, and how often they tweet about this topic. If they’re active, have a good 
following, and use the hash tag fairly frequently, you just identified an influ­
encer that you should add to your list.
Pinterest
Pinterest (www.pinterest.com) has grown at a tremendous pace and could 
be another good place for you to pitch your infographics. The first step is 
finding out which Pinterest boards are named by your topic/infographic 
topic. Here’s a cool trick you can use in Google:
	
1.	Type in the following: site:pinterest.com inurl:dogs.
	
	 Note the space between site:pinterest.com and inurl:dogs.
	
	 See a sample of results in Figure 13-4.
Using Followerwonk to find Twitter influencers
A powerful tool for determining Twitter 
influencers is Followerwonk (http://
followerwonk.com). This site searches 
Twitter bios for whatever keywords you want, 
which will allow you to identify people who 
would be ideal targets to reach out to. On the 
Followerwonk site, click Search Twitter Bios 
and then type the keyword or keywords that 
are related to your infographic or industry. The 
search results that come up will show the fol­
lowing items:
	✓	Tweets: How many tweets the Twitter user 
has sent out, which will show how active 
the user is
	✓	Following: How many people the Twitter 
user is following
	✓	Followers: How big of a following the 
person has, which is a factor in determin­
ing how much of an influencer the person 
or company is
	✓	Days Old: How long the Twitter user has 
been active
	✓	Social Authority: A score created by 
Followerwonk that measures the social 
influence of the user
The free version of Followerwonk lets you do 
everything but download, so it’s a really nice 
tool for finding influencers.

2.	Next, try this one: site:pinterest.com inurl:infographics.
	
	 Each time, you simply just sub in the topic you want to search for after 
inurl:. By doing this, you can see who is making boards about your 
topic.
	
3.	Reach out to those people who run the board and see whether they’ll 
post your infographic.
StumbleUpon
Similar to Pinterest, StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com) is an aggrega­
tor of things that people think are cool. At StumbleUpon, you can search 
by topic, find users and groups that are talking about your topic, and then 
reach out to them individually. Or, you can use the site command approach 
as we explain in the preceding section. Simply put in this: site:stumbleupon.
com inurl:dogs (again, using a space between site:stumbleupon.com and 
inurl:dogs).
LinkedIn
Business networking site LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) can also be valu­
able for promoting an infographic. Keep it in mind if your infographic is about 
business, professional, or industry topics.

265
 Chapter 13: Promoting Your Infographic
To find a potential home for your infographic on LinkedIn, search LinkedIn 
for groups that are related to your infographic topic. Then you can create a 
new discussion and share the infographic there. Personally, we don’t love 
tactics like this. Most users are pretty savvy, and they recognize that you 
are plainly trying to promote content for your own benefit. That said, it’s not 
very time consuming, and may be worth a shot because LinkedIn is full of key 
influencers.
Google+
Pay attention to Google+ (https://plus.google.com) as well. Go into 
Google+ and search by the topic of your infographic. Then look for a search 
result that has a lot of + signs and activity. From there, click the drop-down 
arrow on the top right and then click View Ripples. You can see how your 
search result has been shared and who was sharing it. You can list the people 
who shared it and then reach out to them.
There is also a big community element to Google+. You can join a community 
relevant to your infographic and then share the infographic there within the 
community. On top, next to Everything, click More to see Communities to find 
which are the big communities on the topic and also how many posts there 
have been.
	
Don’t spam your new contacts. Just be honest and say you created an info­
graphic that’s relevant to their community, and you wanted to share it with 
them. If your infographic is really relevant and of interest to those people, 
they just might send it out for you.
Organizing your list of influencers
After you find some influencers and outlets to target, keep them organized as 
you plan your pitch. One simple approach is to create an Excel spreadsheet, 
as shown in Figure 13-5.
Figure 13-5: Keeping your contacts organized in a spreadsheet.

266
Part IV: Ready to Distribute 
You can build a spreadsheet that lists very simple things, such as
	
✓	Blog name
	
✓	Name of the reporter, blogger, or Twitter influencer
	
✓	Contact information of blogger
	
✓	Twitter handle (and perhaps the number of followers they have)
	
✓	Date of initial outreach to blogger
	
✓	Date of follow-up e-mail to blogger
	
	If they don’t respond after two tries, it might be time to move on.
	
✓	Featured infographic
On a spreadsheet like this, use several tabs to keep things organized. For 
example, use a different tab for every industry you’re targeting. So, back to 
our dog infographic. When planning a pitch for that infographic, we would set 
up the following tabs:
	
✓	Dog enthusiast blogs
	
✓	Pet blogs
	
✓	General animal enthusiast blogs
	
✓	General-interest websites that have been known to feature infographics 
(like The Huffington Post or Buzzfeed)
	
✓	Infographic websites and directories
Within each tab, list the relevant information for every website and influencer 
you want to reach out to for your promotion.
Putting Your Plan in Place
After you make your list of key influencers to go after, with the hope that some 
of these websites and people will be interested enough in your infographic 
that they will want to share it with their followers, now comes the time to 
implement your plan. You’ll need to take the time to reach out to these poten­
tial influencers individually and find a way to interest them in featuring your 
content.

267
 Chapter 13: Promoting Your Infographic
Building relationships
In an ideal world, if you’re responsible for creating content and marketing 
it within a particular niche, you may already have relationships with your 
potential markets. If you don’t, now is the time to start building a relationship 
with these people. This will likely not be the last infographic you ever create 
within this space. Even if it is, you’ll still be creating other kinds of content 
that will also need an audience. You need to have contacts and relationships 
that you can tap into to get exposure for your website or content.
Here are a few overarching tips as you get started:
	
✓	Reach out individually. No one wants to receive an e-mail pitch that 
was blatantly blasted out to hundreds or thousands of people. You want 
to make it personal, especially when you contact someone for the first 
time.
	
✓	Keep it simple. Tell them who you are and why the content is relevant to 
them and their readers. Perhaps hook them with a few interesting facts 
from the infographic.
	
✓	Clarify how the relationship benefits them. Give a suggestion or two on 
how they can tailor the infographic for their audience. If you’re reaching 
out to a Twitter influencer, it might make sense to even include a few 
suggested tweets they could send out.
	
✓	Don’t be too pushy or presumptuous. Remember that this person 
doesn’t know you, and you’re essentially asking a favor. You want to be 
humble here, without demanding anything or assuming that they will 
even be willing to help.
After you e-mail your prospects, the waiting game begins. Plenty of people 
will simply ignore your e-mail or may never even see it because it ends up in 
their spam folder.
	
Wait several days after sending out your initial e-mail before reaching out 
again. If you still don’t hear back several days after that, it might be time to 
move on.
	
Here’s why that Excel spreadsheet (which we discuss creating in “Organizing 
your list of influencers”) will continue to be valuable. Use this tool to help 
you remain organized: If you’re lucky, you may have to juggle a lot of conver­
sations at once. For instance, you might get some nibbles from folks who are 
interested but have follow-up questions and requests. Other potential influ­
encers might ask whether you can send them things like an embed code (if 
one exists; see Chapter 12 for more about embed codes). You could also be 
asked to send a piece of the infographic that they can put up on their site and 
then link back to your site.

Offering exclusives
If there is some lead time between when the infographic is complete and 
when it needs to go live, offer some of the major websites an exclusive of the 
infographic. At Infographic World, we’ve done this with great success. Here’s 
how it works:
	
1.	Identify a top tier of websites that you would love to see publish your 
infographic.
	
2.	Pin down your list to just a few prime candidates.
	
3.	Offer them the chance to be the first website to feature the 
­infographic — even before you put it up on your own website.
	
	 This exclusivity can be very enticing to websites because they all want 
to be the first to feature something great. Dangling this carrot could be a 
way to get a big site interested in featuring your infographic.
	
4.	If you get an exclusive, negotiate with the editor or other person-in-
charge the day and time of publication.
	
5.	After they post your infographic, you can then put your infographic 
live on your own website, perhaps linking back to the site that first 
published it.
We’ve developed a lot of great relationships with major bloggers through 
the use of exclusives. If your work gets them a great response with lots of 
social sharing and traffic, the blogger may begin to consider you a reliable 
source for great content. And guess what? You just opened the door to future 
projects.
Using social media
Reaching out to potential influencers and pitching your work is all external 
effort. You’ll need to plan an internal phase of publication, too. This involves 
placing the infographic on all your social channels.
Sizing your work for Facebook
Start with Facebook (www.facebook.com). From an infographics perspec­
tive, your most important duty is sizing your infographic to fit properly on 
there. Facebook does allow for easy sharing, but there are some potential 
pitfalls. Online infographics tend to be pretty big files, and very rarely will the 
full infographic be readable on Facebook.
One approach is simply to take a thumbnail of the infographic and upload 
that within your post. Another is to pull from the infographic the most inter­
esting section, or perhaps just the top portion that shows the title and a 
small portion of the top of the infographic. Save this small image. Then create 
a Facebook post, upload that image to the post, and include a link to your 
website, where readers can find the full-sized infographic.

269
 Chapter 13: Promoting Your Infographic
Using meta tags
Another approach is to use Open Graph (https://developers.facebook.
com/docs/opengraph) meta tags. Open Graph is a programming interface 
that affects how Facebook displays and promotes your material. Any time you 
go to share content from your website on Facebook, Facebook automatically 
searches through the page to find a visual to add to your post. Sometimes, 
Facebook seems to pick an image at random to be the visual that accom­
panies the post. In other instances, it pulls a bunch of images that you can 
choose from to be the visual that accompanies the post. What you want to 
do here is work with Facebook and make it easy to find the images that best 
represent the infographic.
Open Graph allows you to make sure that Facebook is pulling the right 
images to showcase your work. For example, an infographic on your website 
that’s 1,000 pixels wide is way too big to fit within the Facebook dimensions. 
So, try creating a second image on the blog post page that’s not visible, but is 
rather just in the meta tag itself.
When Facebook comes along, the meta tag lets Facebook know that this ver­
sion (the smaller hidden one) is made just for it. Now, thanks to the meta 
tag, when someone shares your infographic on Facebook, it will only show 
the image you want them to. For more information on using this technology, 
check out
http://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-featured-image-and-open-graph-meta-tags/
Looking for Facebook groups
You’ll also want to consider looking for groups and pages on Facebook that 
relate to your infographic topic. These can be very valuable for reaching out. 
After you identify these communities, you can reach out to the people run­
ning the groups to see whether they have any interest in the infographic you 
created.
Using hash tags on Twitter and Pinterest
To take advantage of Twitter, you’ll need to build up some skill with hash 
tags. It’s very important in the tweet you send out about your infographic 
that you’re including the right kinds of hashtags. A powerful tool to consider 
is Hashtags.org (www.hashtags.org), which is a search engine of hash tags. 
There, you can find how many people are using the hash tag you have in 
mind. You’ll naturally want to use hash tags that people commonly search for, 
thus increasing the chance of your tweet and infographic getting exposure.
You can also search for your infographic subject on Twitter to see what hash 
tags people are commonly using when they talk about it. When you write your 
tweet, use only one or two hash tags in your headline. We’ve all seen the end­
less chains of hash tags that some people attach to their tweets. These look 

270
Part IV: Ready to Distribute 
like spam, gibberish, or both, and they turn people off and make them less 
likely to retweet your tweet. Say you’re publishing an infographic on ski jump­
ing, timed to the Olympics. You could add #olympics and #skijumping and 
call it a day.
Also, when sharing on Twitter, always add an image. There is a button that 
makes this easy. Adding a visual element to your tweet gives your infographic 
a better chance of being seen and shared.
For Pinterest, post the infographic to one or two of your own boards, making 
sure to use relevant hash tags. If you do an infographic on the revived popu­
larity of knitting, you could simply add the hash tags #knitting or #crafts. 
As with all social sites, make sure that your hash tags dovetail with those 
heavily used on the site.
Determining When to Pitch
Timing is everything. A cliché, true — but this cliché has serious implications 
when it comes to promoting your infographic. Choosing the wrong time can 
make or break your promotion.
Targeting influencers at the best time
When it comes to launching your infographic at just the right time, we have a 
few tips to offer you:
	
✓	Never launch your infographic promotion on a Friday. If you start reach­
ing out to people on a Friday, you’re running head first into the weekend, 
when people aren’t checking their e-mails, and Internet traffic drops dra­
matically. If you launch on a Friday and get lucky enough to have a major 
website feature your infographic that same day, that’s great news! However, 
you’re not giving the infographic a chance to gain momentum and get 
shared and picked up by other websites. Instead, you’ll get a decent 
amount of exposure on Friday, which will likely dwindle over the weekend 
and be forgotten by the time Monday rolls around.
	
✓	Launch and promote your infographic on Mondays and Tuesdays 
whenever possible. This gives you the entire week for people to see 
your infographic on your site and for bloggers and influencers to see 
your e-mail outreach to them and consider featuring your content.
	
✓	Noon Eastern Standard Time is often the best time to launch. At that 
time, everyone on the East Coast is deep into their day, while those on 
the West Coast are starting their days. Traffic levels tend to be strongest 
for many sites in the 12 p.m.–1 p.m. EST range. This is not the case for 
all websites, but it provides a good starting point.

271
 Chapter 13: Promoting Your Infographic
In general, you want to time your promotion to when people are most likely 
to be in front of their computers. For many people, that is during work hours. 
Yes, you are taking away from their productivity, but hey — some sacrifices 
have to be made.
Timing your social media shares
Timing is also of the essence when it comes to sharing your work on social 
media. When using Twitter, people often tweet out their infographic once, 
then just hope for the best. Twitter allows you to post many times in a week, 
however, and you should take advantage of this.
	
The inherent nature of Twitter means that people’s feeds move very quickly 
and become very crowded. Therefore, promoting your work in several tweets 
reduces the chances that your work will be overlooked. A much more effec­
tive approach is to follow these steps:
	
1.	Queue up three or four key facts from your infographic.
	
2.	Tweet them out over the course of a week, each time linking to the 
infographic.
	
3.	Send a follow-up tweet a week or so later.
With Facebook, share your work in one post on Monday, and then another 
post on Friday. For each one, use a different visual image to catch readers’ 
eyes. Facebook is very different from Twitter when it comes to this, and you 
should not do too many posts. Make your posts high-quality; then let them 
stand on their own.

Ten Infographics Trends to Follow
P

art of the beauty of design is that it’s always changing. Artists and 
designers weave in elements of fashion, pop culture, color theory, and 
even psychology as they create work that’s beautiful, interesting, and appeal­
ing to an audience.
Because design is always in flux, it can fall prey to trends. An infographic 
recently published in The New York Times will look vastly different from one 
published in 1985. Font size, font style, colors, and simplicity versus complex­
ity are just a few infographic design elements that have been influenced by 
trends over the years.
	
Trends can be a loaded term. The desire to capitalize on a trend has opened 
the door to some notorious failures (Milli Vanilli and powder-blue blazers). 
But with a judicious eye and a careful hand, you can use trends to keep your 
infographics current, beautiful, and intriguing to your audience.
This chapter shows you ten emerging trends in infographic design. Have a look 
at how to incorporate the best of the trends without creating a graphic as 
dated as your grandpa’s plaid pants. You’ll want to embrace at least some of 
these in your upcoming projects.
Adding Interactive Features to Your Graphics
Without a doubt, interactivity is the hottest trend in infographics. The rise of 
online sources of news and entertainment content has made us all curators. 
We choose the websites we want to visit, the links we want to click, and the 
information we want to share.
So, it’s only natural that when we’re given the chance to play around with our 
information, to dive into a sea of data and make it work for our own purposes, 
we love it. You don’t need to be a programmer to add interactive features; a 
working knowledge of Adobe Flash Player is enough to get you started.
But you can’t rest there. Even as we go to print, web-design languages like 
HTML and CSS are threatening to overtake Flash in the field of interactive 
graphic design. If you want to make sure your graphics read well on mobile 
devices, start working on adding HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to your pro­
gramming language toolbox.

276
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Interactive graphics promise a depth that an ordinary print graphic could 
never convey. The possibilities are endless and often fascinating to readers. 
Here we briefly describe two ways how infographics designers are making 
their work more  interactive.
Placing information on different pages
When print media was the most common platform for infographics, the entire 
graphic had to be viewed as a unit. Whether the graphic took up a single 
column in a newspaper or a two-page spread in a magazine, design rules called 
for the entire graphic to be self-contained.
No more. In an online platform, you can present a simple block of informa­
tion in an opening page. To move on to your next block of information, you 
could create a vertical design, allowing your reader to scroll down the page 
to move on to the new information.
Or, you could place your second block of information on an entirely new page, 
with a link encouraging the reader to click for more information. Add another 
graphic element, place it on a third page, again with a call-to-action link.
This approach may be tremendously appealing for clients who use page views 
to determine advertising rates and overall popularity. The downside of a click-
through graphic: Your reader may not stick with you through the whole thing.
Letting the reader choose
Say you created an infographic to show the percentage of the population in 
each U.S. state that holds a college degree. Simple, right? You probably made 
a map of the United States, with a percentage figure in tiny type in each state.
Interactivity allows you to take many other approaches. You could skip the num­
bers entirely. For example, start by color-coding your states. Perhaps states with 
less than 50 percent of the population having a college degree are light green; 
50 to 65 percent is medium green; and 65 percent or more is a forest green.
You can then embed your data, using HTML5, so that a reader could hover 
the computer mouse over a single state, and see the exact percentage. You 
can add plenty of data this way. Perhaps you’ll break out the percentages of 
men and women who hold college degrees, or you could use a slider bar to 
change the data according to decade.
Using Video or Animation in Graphics
If interactivity is the hottest trend in infographic creations, video and animation 
is in second place, surging toward the lead. In general, video is used more and 
more to present information, and with that is a serious rise in the creation of 
video and animation infographics.

277
 Chapter 14: Ten Infographics Trends to Follow
Two particular video approaches that are becoming especially popular are 
whiteboard animations and explainer videos. Most people know what a white­
board animation is because of the UPS commercials featuring a man drawing 
on a whiteboard. Many companies are beginning to embrace the idea of telling 
a story through the use of whiteboard animation, whether it’s about their com­
pany, their product, or something industry-related. Explainer videos are becom­
ing a go-to approach for telling the story about products and initiatives. Both of 
these approaches, along with animated infographics in general, are becoming 
more and more popular as people want to watch more videos while online.
Initially, Flash technology drove most animated infographics. However, Flash 
is falling out of favor because it doesn’t always work when readers view info­
graphics on mobile devices. Now, the Adobe After Effects software is a popu­
lar way to add animated features.
Designing for Tablets
With the astronomical rise in tablet use, it’s only natural that there has been 
a rise in the creation of content designed specifically for them. Infographics 
World has created a good amount of work that has been used exclusively on 
tablets, and we foresee this trend becoming more of a go-to approach. From 
the designer’s perspective, tablets are a great medium because scrolling 
downward through a graphic allows readers to take in much more informa­
tion than they could in a fixed-size graphic.
Using Data to Drive Your Project
Data is big. Really big. In fact, the term “big data” has become a popular buzz­
word. In today’s world, we have so much information, about so many topics, 
from so many sources, that it can all be a bit overwhelming.
This is great news for infographics. After all, infographics designers have 
been mining statistics and presenting them clearly and artistically for decades. 
If the torrent of data threatens to overwhelm readers, corporate executives, 
media types, marketing gurus . . . well, that’s where you come in as an info­
graphics designer. Your clear, concise graphic can help the reader distill the 
information they want and need from a sea of numbers.
An increasing emphasis on data has given rise to some new names for info­
graphic designers. You may justifiably call yourself a data journalist, a data 
visualization expert, or a data-driven journalist. The terms don’t really change 
the work you do.
Prospects appear bright for this sort of infographic work. In fact, in November 
2013, The New York Times announced the creation of a new website empha­
sizing data-driven journalism. We anticipate that this publication will use 
graphics to enhance its work.

Developing Graphics for Market Research
Lately, we’ve had a lot of clients ask us to help them communicate their 
market research in a more visual and appealing manner. We would even go 
so far as to say that about 25 percent of our work these days is taking market 
research that clients have done and turning it into infographics. It’s really a 
perfect fit: Market research consists of tons of statistics and data points about 
various items within your industry. When you go to communicate these find­
ings, which would you rather do — put a bunch of stats in a PDF document, 
or have an infographic created that shows the same points but in a visually 
compelling manner? Pretty simple decision if you ask us.
Using Graphics to Bridge Cultures
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 382 languages are spoken in American 
households. You probably aren’t surprised to learn that English and Spanish 
are the most common, accounting for a strong majority of household languages. 
But that leaves 380 languages that may not always have a ready translator.
That’s where infographics come in.
Every time you buy an appliance, you’ve probably noticed that the direc­
tions come in multiple languages. And there’s no possible way to translate 
information into some less common tongues. Clear, graphical representations 
of information can be an important way to reach people across cultural and 
language barriers. The furniture company IKEA is famous for its reliance on 
visual cues rather than words. Figure 14-1 shows the universal symbol for ele­
vator; one of dozens of established symbols that cut across language barriers.

symbol for elevator.

Not only instruction manuals will be important as the world becomes more 
intertwined. Say, for example, you work for a nonprofit group focused on 
breast health. A clear, simple diagram of how to examine one’s breasts could 
provide life-saving information to a woman who may not understand written 
text or even a doctor’s verbal advice.
The DIY Graphics Movement
Here are some words that may strike fear into the hearts of professional info­
graphic designers: Anyone can make an infographic.
You’re probably thinking that if anyone can make an infographic, who would 
ever hire you to create one?
It’s a valid question, but look at it this way: The quantity of published info­
graphics has risen astronomically. Along the way, the quality has improved, 
too. With the help of this book, you can learn the importance of great research, 
a well-designed plan, and awesome technical skills to create graphics that 
beautifully bridge the worlds of data and design.
	
Attention spans keep getting shorter! The global marketplace has an insatia­
ble need to present information that works across language and cultural lines. 
You should be able to find plenty of work.
And there’s plenty of room for people who are not designers to play around 
with the form. Some cool things we’ve seen: 
	
✓	Tableau Public (a division of Tableau Software www.tableausoftware.
com) allows a user to submit raw data, which Tableau’s programming 
language turns into “data visualizations.” The finished products are 
shared to the general public, and can also be uploaded to the user’s 
website, blog, or other platform. Some major media outlets are using 
Tableau, but it’s free to anyone.
	
✓	IBM runs a program called Many Eyes (http://www-958.ibm.com/
software/analytics/manyeyes/) that allows users to create free 
infographics based on data sets. The program lets users try out more 
than a dozen different treatments of their information, from pie chart 
to bar graph to flow chart. Finished products are publicly available and 
ready for review by other Many Eyes users.
	
✓	In 2012, Stanford professor and social-media maven Drake Martinet’s 
proposal to girlfriend Stacy Green took the form of an infographic. 
Martinet used statistics and female icons to prove that Stacy was the one 
perfect woman for him. This is a classic case of knowing your audience: 
Green is the chief marketing officer for online news site Mashable.

✓	Some intrepid job seekers are creating infographic résumé. This is a 
bit of a gamble. Getting a job is serious business; especially in traditional 
industries, you don’t want to appear too whimsical. In creative fields, 
though, a résumé in the form of an infographic might just help you stand 
out and show your prospective boss just how creatively you can think. 
Perhaps your career history is shown on a subtly illustrated timeline. 
You could place your most relevant skills in bubbles, perhaps overlap­
ping with key terms from the job description. Former employers could 
be shown, not listed, with small icons based on their corporate logos. An 
infographic résumé would also provide an easy way to link to your previ­
ous work. Figure 14-2 shows how one young job seeker put his résumé in 
graphic form.

Infographics for Presentations
These days, if you’re conducting a presentation for work or school and would 
like to put your viewers to sleep, we would recommend going with the stan­
dard PowerPoint presentation.
Perhaps we’re exaggerating, but we’re not far off. Many an audience has 
glazed over while presenters click through text-heavy PowerPoint slides. By 
turning some of your information into attractive charts, graphs, and illustra­
tions, you can keep your audience engaged. Keep your information clear, 
your text light, and your style consistent with the company or project you’re 
representing.
Make a List, Check It Twice
Social media is chock full of lists these days: anything from “25 things people 
from upstate New York love” to “The 9 types of people who show up for 
Thanksgiving dinner” to “23 reasons why trying to be cute on the Internet is a 
terrible idea.” There’s even a brand-new buzzword to describe these stories: 
“listicles.”
We highly doubt that this type of story is around for the long haul. But they’re 
fun, easy to share, and tailor-made for reading on devices, such as smartphones 
and tablets. They also lend themselves very well to graphic treatment; many 
already use GIFs (graphics interchange format; a type of graphic file) to add 
visual appeal.
A list-oriented infographic also allows you to ask the reader to click through 
multiple pages, which is good news for clients looking to increase their 
number of page views. Check out Buzzfeed (www.buzzfeed.com) and 
Mashable (http://mashable.com) for some good examples of listicles as 
well as some inspiration for turning your list into an infographic.
Keeping It Small
Throughout this book, we talk about every cool feature, program, and design 
trend there is. We show you how to make complex, multisection graphics for 
print or online publications.
Well, don’t forget the small stuff. Once in a while, try bucking the trend 
toward big graphics with all the bells and whistles. In the age of interactivity 
and the wide-open spaces of the Internet, adding more and more features and 
details to your infographic can be tempting. Sometimes a simple, clear chart 
or map is all that’s needed. Do your research, make your plan, and keep your 
basic design skills up to speed. Sometimes, the small ones are sweeter.

Ten Future Infographic Uses 
to Tr y Today
T

he world of infographics is changing so quickly that it’s imperative to 
stay on top of new developments in the content, use, design, and tech­
nology that drives them. Whether you’re creating infographics for one client 
or many, for profit or an altruistic cause, you always want to stay true to the 
infographic’s ultimate aim: Make a complex idea simple and use attractive 
design to present a clear message.
We at Infographic World, along with some leading figures in the infographics 
industry, are always looking ahead to see how we can be prepared to create 
the next wave of infographics. Here are ten ways we think infographics will be 
used in the future.
Education
Today’s students are wired from birth, and by the time they reach school age, 
they’re accustomed to colorful, graphic, entertaining presentations. Enter the 
infographic. We foresee several ways that infographics will play a stronger 
role in education in the next decade and beyond:
	
✓	To explain complicated concepts: We’ve all struggled through something 
in school. Whether it’s the circulatory system of a frog or the causes of 
Middle East tension, an infinite number of topics can just be tough to 
understand. 
	
	Infographics could be the answer. Maybe you can improve upon the frog 
diagrams in a biology book with an interactive graphic that more clearly 
explains the topic. Maybe the social studies book publisher will pick up 
your timeline of major events in the Middle East.
	
✓	To fill in gaps left by cash-strapped school districts: Say a teacher is 
saddled with a textbook from 1985. By creating an up-to-date infographic 
on her topic or finding one online, a teacher can bring her students the 
most relevant information. And even if schools are still using textbooks, 
expect more and more schools to switch over to online course materials. 
Those, too, will certainly become a forum for infographic presentation.

284
Part V: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	To help teach technology skills: From kindergarten through college, stu­
dents are using technology more frequently. Even very young students 
are sharing iPads and working on smart boards, interactive boards that 
allow teachers to show video, access the Internet, and entice students 
to participate. These are a great match for infographics. Teachers could 
show the very latest infographics, perhaps even interacting with the 
material with the push of a button or the click of a mouse.
	
✓	To encourage student creativity: Students may also be asked to create 
their own infographics. The younger generation is swamped by data, 
and learning how to carefully mine it and synthesize it into a coherent 
message is a valuable life skill. Do-it-yourself websites like those dis­
cussed elsewhere in the book make it easy for teachers to assign info­
graphic projects to their students.
	
✓	To aid in online learning: Online learning is likely to become even 
hotter, with cyber charter schools and “massive open online courses” 
continuing to gain popularity. When students are learning online, they 
are primed to take advantage of the visual appeal and quick impact of a 
good infographic.
Digital Interactivity
There’s no limit in sight for the possibilities of interactive graphics. Recently, 
academic research has begun to confirm what some infographic designers 
already believed: If a static infographic is good, an interactive one should be 
even better.
In 2012, researchers from Stanford University and the University of Maryland 
wrote, “A single image . . . typically provides answers to, at best, a handful of 
questions. . . . Meaningful analysis consists of repeated explorations as users 
develop insights about significant relationships, domain-specific contextual 
influences, and causal patterns.”
Repeated explorations: Those two words encapsulate the power of interac­
tive infographics. You want to make your interactives so compelling that the 
reader will explore them at great length. By offering multiple ways to explore 
your infographic, you encourage readers to find the patterns and relation­
ships relevant to their lives.
	
Interactive infographics give the reader choices. So when planning your proj­
ect, make choices obvious and interesting as well as easy to navigate (by click­
ing, dragging an icon, or hovering the mouse). Some companies are bringing 
interactive technology to print documents; this could be very interesting terri­
tory for infographic designers. Also make sure the graphic makes sense 
whether the reader peruses every word of it or just a small portion.

285
 Chapter 15: Ten Future Infographic Uses to Try Today
Sound Medium
Infographics are, of course, a visual medium, but adding sound can add a 
whole new dimension to your infographic project. In coming years, we believe 
sound will become a more common feature, increasing the interactive appeal 
of some graphics.
Sound in infographics can be as simple as a background audio file of instru­
mental music.
	
Do not simply upload any old song into your infographic! You don’t want to 
violate any copyright laws. Seek out stock audio services, akin to stock photo 
services, that supply safely usable files. If you plan on releasing your sound 
infographic to the public, buy yourself a copyright-free audio file. Here are a 
few sites to check out:
www.istockphoto.com/audio
www.productiontrax.com
www.stockmusicsite.com
Adding sound also opens the door to some really creative treatments. For 
example, you could have a highlight feature that highlights text as the voice 
reads it. You could also tailor the sound specifically to the information you’re 
showcasing. For example, say you’re creating a graphic on the ten countries 
with the highest bread consumption. You could record, “Pass the bread, 
please” in ten languages. When readers hover a mouse over say, Italy, they 
would hear that phrase in Italian.
Sound does create a few potential complications. Remember that some people 
might be reading your infographic in a public place and won’t want to run the 
sound file. Adding features also requires you to be extra careful about techno­
logical compatibility.
Multicultural Uses
Some of the world’s most pressing concerns could benefit from an infographic 
treatment. Take, for example, the availability of potable water. The United 
Nations estimates that by 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population won’t 
have sufficient access to clean water. The shortage is expected to be most 
severe in impoverished countries.
CNN recently did a great infographic that showed the percentages of urban 
residents with access to safe drinking water. In the United States, 97 percent of 
residents have it. In Kenya, the number drops to 47 percent; in Haiti, 21 percent, 

286
Part V: The Part of Tens 
and in Uganda, just 11 percent. CNN showed these and several other percent­
ages in an elegant bar graph designed to look like water flowing from a tap. The 
message is abundantly clear to speakers of any language.
	
One fundamental role of an infographic is to incite a “call to action.” Going 
forward, we anticipate that more organizations will turn to infographics to 
present their message in ways that cut across cultural and language barriers. 
This is a potentially life-changing way to call people to action.
Viral Topics
Earlier in the book, we talk about the exciting possibilities for graphics to go 
viral. To date, many of the graphics that have swept the web originated from 
a newspaper, an online news site, or a blog.
Well, what if you jumped right around the middle man? The days of artists and 
writers relying on a certain publication or periodical to present content are 
done. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. With an established publication, 
the goal is mass distribution of content that appeals to a general audience. 
Working on your own, you can target your work however you like — which 
can potentially free you up to jump on topics that you know will intrigue read­
ers. In the most recent Winter Olympics, slopestyle skiing emerged as the 
hottest new sport, with various tricks to challenge the athletes and amaze the 
audience. An infographic breaking down the tricks would have undoubtedly 
gone viral during the Olympic season. You should be prepared to seize on 
topics like this. It’s probably a more practical way to get published these days 
than waiting for an editor to say “yes.” It just takes one reader, sparked by 
your information, to forward your infographic and light a blaze of interest.
Demographics
Never in history has information been so readily available. For many readers, 
it’s just too much. Information is much more effective when each member of 
your audience feels that you’re speaking to him personally rather than the 
general masses as a whole.
You need to tap into this as an infographic designer. Earlier in this chapter, we 
use the example of quantifying potable water worldwide. This time, instead 
of putting out your message to the whole world, think about ways to tailor 
that message to various demographic groups. Table 15-1 shows a sampling of 
ways that you could create clean water-related infographics targeted to vari­
ous audiences with a desire or need to know certain facts about that potable 
water. These ideas are really just the tip of the iceberg.

Always consider various target audiences before you start designing your info­
graphics. And with more data available virtually every day, it’s not hard to do.
Social Media
In Chapter 13, we talk about the importance of making your infographics easy 
to share on social media. Going forward, social media could be your main 
calling card as an infographic designer.
Consider Facebook, with its wide and deep top banner. That banner could be 
a magnificent stage for an infographic. We’ve seen infographics in use as wed­
ding information pages and résumé. With a bit of research and a little art, you 
could create a platform for you, your cause, or your business and then use 
that Facebook banner to share it with all your contacts. Of course, Facebook 
also makes sharing content easy, so if one of your readers likes your stuff, he 
can pass it along with a click of the mouse.
Immersive Interactive Graphics
Virtual-reality graphics and educational tools have been around for a while. 
Technology is improving all the time, allowing readers to feel truly immersed 
in their experience.
Video games have been the first frontier of virtual-reality graphics. Going 
forward, some of the technology that has brought virtual-reality video games 
tantalizingly close to consumers will undoubtedly bring infographics to new 

288
Part V: The Part of Tens 
dimensions. Researchers have been working on integrating all five senses 
into virtual reality. Can you imagine reading an infographic on the rainforest 
while feeling dewy humidity on your skin and smelling the intoxicating per­
fume of orchids?
Whether the graphics are meant for education or entertainment, the possi­
bilities are exciting.
Naturally, this type of technology will come with a steep learning curve, and 
will probably be cost-prohibitive for many designers — but there was a time 
people said that about personal computers. Stay tuned.
Print Media
Print isn’t dead, but it’s certainly troubled. Going forward, the best way for 
any media entity to survive will be to strengthen the ties between print, 
online, and even augmented-reality content.
Think about one potential scenario. Imagine that you’ve won an assignment 
from a national news magazine to depict current Army training strategies. 
You design a stunning, well-researched piece that takes up a full page in the 
magazine. Nicely done.
But that’s not enough for the new media landscape. You will probably be 
asked to create a web version of the graphic, too. Perhaps that version will 
add a few interactive features, like a scroll bar that lets the reader travel 
back in time to read about military training in the past. Maybe there’s embed­
ded data that provides information about the military experience in nations 
around the world. Again, nice work.
Using augmented reality, though, you could potentially put the reader in the 
place of a young soldier learning the latest military maneuvers. It’s an experi­
ence that most people won’t ever have, but you could bring it to them in the 
form of an infographic. The media company benefits by linking its content in 
one form to all the other forms, enhancing readers’ experience and enticing 
them to come back for more. Pretty exciting stuff.
Presentation Tools
Have you ever sat through a year-end sales report from an executive who 
droned on and on without a single break, churning out number after number 
without a single visual cue?
We’ve all been there, but infographics can — and should — play an ­increasing 
role in making presentations like that a relic.

289
 Chapter 15: Ten Future Infographic Uses to Try Today
First of all, even the driest oral presentation can usually benefit from graphic 
aids. For example, a bar graph showing a company’s sales figures for the past 
five years is way more effective than a mere recitation of numbers.
Secondly, it’s not too hard to actually put graphics to work in your presen­
tation. Say you’re using presentation software (PowerPoint or Keynote) to 
illustrate those sales figures. As you’re standing in front of your audience pre­
senting your report, why not show the bars of that graph one at a time, with 
a new year’s information in each slide? Each portion of the presentation is a 
piece of the overall infographic.
	
Using basic office presentation software is never effective if it’s used simply 
as a text-driven recitation of fact. Integrating infographics is an effective way 
to capture your audience’s attention, and the applications are endless in busi­
ness, technology, education, and more.

been there for me, and my brother Ryan, a constant source of humor and 
entertainment.
Author’s Acknowledgments
The phrase “team effort” can often be overused. In this instance, however, 
there is truly no other phrase I can think of to describe this book being put 
together. I want to thank the people at John Wiley & Sons, Inc. — Nicole 
Sholly, Brian Walls, Teresa Artman, Amy Fandrei and Steve Hayes. You made 
the process for a first-time author as easy and pain-free as possible. Thank 
you to A.J. Ghergich, the SEO wiz and founder of Ghergich & Co., and Jay 
Willingham, the brilliant owner of Daily Infographic. Thanks to Eileen Glanton 
Loftus who steered the ship and helped everything come together. Marc Bain 
got us going with the foundation of the book. And Tonia Cowan, thank you for 
your amazing insight and the awesome illustrations throughout various sec­
tions of the book.
