PREFACE
There are plenty of books written for academic courses about the areas
of electromagnetics, radio technology or radio communications. In these
books all the basic and more of the advanced mathematical and technical
engineering principles about the theory of electromagnetics—reflections,
diffractions, scattering, coupling-antennas and radio propagation—are
explained. There are also many books concerned only radio
communications and especially mobile communication systems. These
books explain theoretical aspects of mobile communication systems in
more detail but do not focus on the connections between different
technical details. System level engineering is thus not addressed because it
is typically thought only to be a practical issue. However, this system
level understanding is a critical issue in today’s mobile communications
systems in order to achieve cost efficient and high quality radio
engineering in mobile systems’ radio interface. It is not enough to
understand just technical details because these are connected to other
technical aspects and these can all be combined in many different ways.
These 
various 
technical 
combinations 
within 
this 
mobile
communications branch can be demotivating, particularly to newcomers—
new RF engineers—who already know all the basics of radio technology
because they have read all the basic books. Moreover, new engineers are
often confused with all the different solutions for the different problems
when they start learning the mobile communications principles and they
can easily feel frustration because system level planning is a new and
quite poorly documented topic. Hence, a simple and clear handbook about
the radio planning principles and their connections in mobile
communications systems is required to explain this system level planning.
This book is a part of the solution to understanding detailed technical
radio engineering principles for mobile communication systems where all
the details have a straight connection with each other. This book tries to
bind very detailed pieces of technical information to the system level of
thinking and thus to show the correct path at the junction. Mobile
communication is full of these junctures because almost all the products
are new, and technical development work is only just started. This
handbook has been produced mainly with examples from the Global
System for Mobile Telecommunication (GSM) because it is one of the
most “global” standards (implemented over 80 countries). There are also
many technical topics to be developed for the GSM during the next
Team LRN

xiv
decade when GSM as a system is combined together with the Universal
Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) that will be the next GSM
compatible standard. The GSM examples in this book, and most of the
technologies utilized in the GSM, can also thus be applied in the UMTS.
Clear technical differences in the radio system planning between GSM
and UMTS system are be explained and discussed in the concluding
chapters 10 and 11 but otherwise there is no need to explain the variations
between GSM and UMTS in technical detail here because this is covered
in several other books. The main purpose of this handbook is to explain
the radio interface system planning in the GSM (including GPRS) and to
give the main instructions to continue the same work in the UMTS.
The content of this book is based on the radio system planning process
that contains different phases that are explained in Chapters 3–9. Before
these detailed planning phases Chapter 1 gives an introduction to the radio
propagation environment in order to convey the influence of the
environment on the radio system planning principles. The whole radio
system planning process is also explained separately in Chapter 2 and
Chapters 3–9 following the content of Chapter 2 at a detailed level. Radio
system planning starts from configuration planning (Chapter 3) and
continues with coverage planning (Chapters 4 and 5), capacity planning
(Chapter 6), frequency planning (Chapter 7) and optimisation and
monitoring (Chapters 8 and 9). Chapter 3 considers the definitions of the
power budget calculations; the coverage planning done in Chapters 4 and
5 is based on the defined power budget from Chapter 3. Chapter 6
considers the capacity of the radio interface and Chapter 7 contains the
frequency planning aspects. Chapters 8 and 9 give instructions on
observing the performance of the planned radio system/network. Finally,
Chapters 10 and 11 explain the detailed radio planning differences of the
speech orientated GSM radio network and the packet transferred data
GPRS/EDGE and the third generation UMTS radio networks.

INTRODUCTION—
RADIO PROPAGATION ENVIRONMENT
1.1 
Definition of the radio network system
The objective of this handbook is to present an efficient radio planning
process for cellular radio networks and to discuss different solutions for
detailed planning activities in order to achieve the most cost-efficient high
quality radio network. The planning activities presented are based on the
Pan-European GSM (Global System for Mobile Telecommunication)
network requirements but most of them can also be adapted for the radio
planning of WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) that
was selected as the air interface technology for the third generation UMTS
(Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) network architecture. The
basic radio planning is very similar for different radio systems, thus the
digital GSM radio network is used as a reference system in this book and
the detailed radio planning differences for the GPRS and UMTS are
explained separately.
The GSM mobile network has three main subsystems, which are called
a network subsystem (NSS), network management system (NMS) and a
base station subsystem (BSS) all of which are illustrated in Figure 1.1.
Team LRN

Introduction —Radio Propagation Environment 
3
The network subsystem contains a switching part of the GSM system
as a mobile switching centre (MSC) and gateway switches (G-MSC) that
are the connection points between the GSM mobile networks and for
example PSTN (public switch transmission network) networks. The
network management system contains equipment for the mobile network
operation and maintenance as an operation and maintenance centre
(OMC). Finally, the base station subsystem contains the equipment to
manage the radio interface between the mobile station and cellular radio
network. The base station controller (BSC) found between a base
transceiver station (BTS) (also called a base station, BS) and a MSC
controls the main functions of the mobiles (called also mobile station,
MS) and base stations. The base stations have a radio connection with the
mobile stations and they represent a physical radio interface of the mobile
network as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Thus, the base station has to be
capable of communicating with the mobile stations over a certain
coverage area and to offer enough capacity (traffic channels) for this
communication (including the signalling and data transfer that can be
speech or data transmission). It has to be noted that the base station as a
term means originally the base station equipment itself that may typically
manage 1–6 independent coverage areas which each contain an
independent group of transceivers (otherwise frequencies). These
coverage areas can be provided by using omnidirectional or directional
antennas for transmission and reception and they can also be called cells.
Figure 1.2 introduces a base station site with one cell (omnidirectional
transmission and receiver antenna), with two cells called 2-sector (wide
beam directional antennas), and with three cells called 3-sector (narrow
beam directional antennas).

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Base station as a term is inadequate to describe all related issues and
therefore this books adopts the following terminology and terms in order
to speak accurately of the correct items:
Base station site 
= the physical location of the base station
and the total configuration of the base
station equipment and antenna lines at
that location
Base station equipment 
= the equipment without antenna line
(hardware plus software)
Cell or sector 
= the physical coverage area of one base
station antenna direction.
Thus the configurations in Figure 1.2 all represent a base station site
that only has different configurations of the base station equipment and
antenna line.
Omnidirectional cells are usually not implemented because their
coverage and capacity properties are the worst. The 2-sector base station
is typically used for road coverage and 3-sector configuration for both
urban and rural areas as it provides the largest coverage areas (because of
the high gain property of the directional antennas) and also the highest
capacity (from the directional antennas).
1.1.1 
Coverage terminology and definitions
The main function of a base station is to transmit and receive voice or
data messages to and from mobile stations (MS) by using the radio
interface. In order to have a continuous connection between the BTS and
MS the maximum distance between them have to be defined. This
definition is based on the minimum possible signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)
at both receiving ends and also on the maximum transmission power at
both transmission ends. Both receiving and transmission levels can be
improved by using different technologies such as low noise amplifiers
(reception), diversity reception (reception, transmission), high gain
directional antennas (reception, transmission) and power amplifiers
(transmission).
The difference of the maximum transmission and minimum receiving
levels between the BTS and MS antenna elements is called the maximum
path loss. It defines the maximum allowed attenuation between the BTS
Team LRN

Introduction —Radio Propagation Environment

and MS and vice versa. The maximum distance between BTS and MS can
then be defined when the radio propagation (attenuation versus distance,
typical unit is dB/dec) is known in a certain propagation environment.
The attenuation is higher in a built-up environment compared to a rural
environment (with no man-made obstructing constructions). The slope of
the radio wave attenuation as a function of distance is called a radio
propagation slope and that has a strong effect on the maximum distance
between the BTS and MS. The propagation slope depends heavily on the
propagation environment and also on antenna height which is thus a
critical parameter for coverage planning.
1.1.2 
Capacity terminology and definitions
The number of connections (otherwise calls) between the base station
and mobile stations is an essential parameter when the mobile network
configuration is designed. The main target in radio network infrastructure
planning is to minimise the number of base station sites in order to
minimise their construction, operational and maintenance costs. The
number of base stations is minimised by maximising the number of
connections per base station which brings enormous cost savings. The
number of connections between the BTS and MS depends on the number
of frequencies and how often these frequencies can be reused in a certain
area and between base stations. The maximum number of frequencies in
the GSM900 (GSM at 900 MHz band) system is 125 in the uplink
and downlink 
directions. Each frequency is also
called a channel and thus there are a maximum of 125 channels available
for both directions. Each of these channels can be reused at some distance
from the base station. This distance describes the number of neighbouring
base stations where some other frequency has to be assigned. This group
of base stations forms a cluster structure as depicted in Figure 1.3.
Team LRN

6          RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Twelve different frequencies or frequency groups in Figure 1.3 have to
be used in order to avoid interference. This value of twelve is also called a
frequency reuse factor or number because it defines the period of the
frequency reuse. Minimum frequency reuse factor can be calculated by
analysing the co-channel carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I)—the higher
the minimum C/I the lower the frequency reuse factor. Moreover, the
minimum C/I value depends mostly on the radio propagation
environment. If the maximum configuration was applied and all 125
frequencies were available, 125/12 = 10.4 frequencies on average at each
cell could be used. This is also the maximum configuration or maximum
capacity of each cell and the total capacity of the whole network depends
on the number of cells. The maximum average number of BTS–MS
connections at each cell can then be calculated by multiplying
10.4*8 = 83.2. The multiplication by 8 is based on the GSM being a time
division multiple access (TDMA) based system where 8 BTS–MS
connections (otherwise time slots) can be provided by using the same
frequency because these connections alternate, as can be seen in Figure
1.4.[1] Each of these time slots is called a traffic channel because a full
data or voice call can be performed on any of these channels.
It has been noted that the antenna height defines the base station
coverage area and also the capacity requirements for each base station via
the number of base stations required to cover the planning area. If the
coverage and capacity requirements can be combined and the optimised
values for the base station antenna heights can be defined in the radio
planning over several years, a cost-efficient radio network infrastructure
can definitely be achieved.
1.2 
Cellular radio network
1.2.1 
Cellular concept
The radio interface in mobile cellular networks is based on a cellular
approach because frequencies are required to be reused due to a limited
amount of frequency resources and the large number of users sharing
Team LRN

Introduction —Radio Propagation Environment

these resources. The cellular infrastructure in a suburban area is depicted
in Figure 1.5. Each cell contains the base station equipment, which
transmits and receives voice and/or data traffic by using an antenna array
and a certain group of frequencies. All frequencies are reused after a
sufficient required distance to avoid too high interference levels (Figure
1.5). The minimum distance between the same frequencies is determined by
the environment—hills, trees, buildings, etc.—effecting radio propagation.
1.2.2 
Capacity, coverage and quality of service
In addition to the propagation environment radio propagation also
strongly depends on the type of base station antenna array used and on its
effective height with respect to the ground and surrounding environment.
If the base station antenna array position is too high (e.g. clearly above the
average building height in an urban area), radio waves propagate too far
causing interference and the cellular network will be easily capacity
limited because these frequencies can not be reused in the same area due
to the interference. Thus, the radio propagation environment and the base
station antenna array configuration determine the maximum frequency
reuse over a network coverage area. Furthermore, the maximum
Team LRN

8             RADIO INTERFACE  SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS 
frequency reuse specifies the maximum capacity and the minimum
number of required base stations over a cellular network service area from
a capacity point of view.
However, capacity requirements alone do not determine the Quality of
Service (QOS) in the mobile networks. Quality of Service also involves
location probability at a base station coverage area. Location probability
determines the likelihood of exceeding a certain threshold power or field
strength level over a base station coverage area in indoor or outdoor
locations depending on the operator’s requirements. Location probability
depends again on the base station antenna array height—the higher the
antenna array position the higher the location probability at the same base
station coverage area.
1.2.3 
Optimal solution
Having introduced the links between base station antenna height and
coverage and capacity, it has been noted that the link between the antenna
height and radio propagation is a key element when coverage and capacity
are designed for cellular network infrastructures. Radio propagation is
environment-dependent and the performance of different coverage and
capacity solutions are thus related to factors like morphography type and
topography or building height. The influence of these environmental
aspects has to be emphasised when radio planning applications are
considered. The optimal solution for coverage is not necessarily the
optimal solution for capacity and interference, and vice versa, but the
optimal solution is something where coverage, capacity and interference
solutions are combined.
Cellular radio planning is always an optimisation task where both
coverage and capacity have to be maximized and interference has to be
minimised. As in all optimisation tasks the biggest question is where to
start the process. Traditionally it is defined that radio planning has to be
started from the coverage predictions in order to estimate the number of
base stations over a certain coverage area. Next follows an evaluation of
additional base stations needed for capacity. However, this approach fails
to prioritise the antenna height definition process in Figure 1.6. Antenna
height is to be prioritised more than the other parameters, as it has a
significant effect on coverage predictions and it is also a major parameter
when capacity and interference are optimised. Thus, the antenna height
Team LRN

         9
definition is an optimised starting point for radio network system
planning, see Figure 1.6.
As is shown in Figure 1.6, the antenna height defines the base station
coverage area—the higher the antenna position the larger the base station
coverage area—and it also defines the capacity—the lower the antenna
position the more often frequencies can be reused—thus optimised
antenna height gives both required coverage and capacity.
1.3 
Radio propagation environment
Radio propagation (and thus coverage and capacity) depends on the
propagation environment which is typically divided into three major
classes—urban, suburban and rural—and into two special classes—
microcellular and indoor. Area types—urban, suburban and rural—refer
to constructed (e.g. buildings) or natural (e.g. trees) obstacles, which vary
in size and density around the base station and mobile station antennas. In
the major classes the environment is called macrocellular when the base
station antenna arrays are above the average rooftop level and the radio
propagation environment is called microcellular when the base station
antenna array is implemented below the average rooftop level (see
Figure 1.7).
Team LRN

 RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Thus, microcellular environments only exist in urban areas where there
are buildings higher than three or four floors. Micro base stations (a base
station in a microcellular environment) are specifically required in high
capacity areas where frequencies have to be reused several times. When
antenna arrays are below the rooftops, surrounding buildings prevent
propagation, base station coverage area is small and frequencies can be
reused more often. Moreover, macrocellular, microcellular and indoor
environments 
each 
have 
individual 
radio 
propagation 
channel
characteristics. Thus, the radio wave propagation in each environment has
to be studied separately.
1.3.1 
Radio propagation parameters related to the environment
It can be concluded that the radio propagation environment is specified
by the base station and mobile station antenna environments based on the:
• 
Morphography type (urban, suburban, rural)
• 
Antenna location above or below the average rooftop level
(macrocellular, microcellular)
• 
Mobile station location (outdoor or indoor).
Team LRN

Introduction—Radio Propagation Environment  
 
 
 
    11
In each of these environments the radio wave propagation can be
described by the following parameters:
• 
Angular spread
• 
Delay spread
• 
Fast and slow fading properties
• 
Propagation slope.
These parameters define the characteristics of radio wave propagation
in the different environments and also for different systems (for example
GSM and UMTS). Moreover, these parameters have a significant effect
on the base station coverage and capacity planning in all environments
and they define the optimised coverage and capacity solutions in all
different environments. Each propagation environment can thus be
categorised based on the radio propagation parameters listed above and
each of these parameters have nominal values in each propagation
environment.
1.3.1.1 Angular spread
Angular spread describes the deviation of the signal incident angle.
Usually we are interested in the signal coming to the base station antenna.
Angular spread can be calculated based on the incident angle of the
received power in the horizontal and vertical planes:[2]
where 
is the mean angle, 
is the angular power distribution and
is the total power.
It has to be noted that the angular spread can be calculated in two
planes—either horizontal or vertical. The received power from the
horizontal plane is still the most important because of obstructing
constructions: most of the reflecting surfaces are related to the horizontal
propagation and thus multiple BTS–MS propagation paths exist more in
the horizontal plane. The horizontal angular spread is around 5–10° in
macro cells and very wide in microcellular and indoor environments
because the reflecting surfaces surround the base station antenna. The
angular spread has a significant effect on antenna installation direction
and on the selection and implementation of traditional space diversity
Team LRN

12          RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
reception. Vertical angular spread additionally influences, for example the
base station antenna array tilting angle when the co-channel interference is
reduced. The angular spread is also a key parameter when the
performance of the adaptive antennas is discussed because the
optimisation of the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) depends strongly on
the incident angles of the carrier and the interference signals. Thus, the
performance of the adaptive antennas is lower or more difficult to achieve
in the microcellular environments than in the macrocellular environments.
1.3.1.2 Multipath propagation and delay spread
The signal propagates between BTS and MS via multiple different
paths due to reflections, diffractions and scattering. This is called
multipath propagation (Figure 1.8).
These multiple paths have different propagation lengths and thus the
accurate reception time of the different multipath signals varies. The
amount of this time variation can be measured as delay spread. The delay
spread     can be calculated from the power-delay profile of the radio
channel 
which is the received power as a function of delay.[3]
Team LRN

Introduction—Radio Propagation Environment 
13
where 
is the average delay and 
is the total received power.
Multipath propagation is typically not harmful for GSM receiver
performance because the GSM standard requires receivers to be equipped
with an equaliser which can equalise for path delay differences up to 16
This corresponds to the 4.5 km path length difference. If the path
delay difference is larger than 
(typically reflections from hills in a
rural area) the delayed signals cause co-channel interference I. The
amount of co-channel interference depends on the strength of the long
reflections.
The equaliser of the GSM receiver also makes it possible to build-up
so-called distributed antenna systems (DAS). This is especially useful for
indoor locations where base station coverage area is provided by N base
station antenna arrays that all transmit and receive the same data as
illustrated in Figure 1.9.
The values of delay spread are related to the environment and the
largest values in a macrocellular environment can be found in hilly rural
areas where the reflecting surfaces can be very far away. In the
macrocellular urban environment typical values are less than in hilly rural
Team LRN

14        RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
areas. The smallest values of delay spread have been measured in special
environments like microcellular and indoor. These different delay spread
values in the different environments do not cause any problems in basic
GSM coverage or capacity planning. However in detailed coverage and
capacity planning, when different radio planning concepts, methods, and
technologies are required to achieve coverage and capacity in excess, the
multipath propagation has to be addressed more carefully.
The delay spread has a strong effect for example on the performance
of frequency hopping because the required separation of the frequencies to
provide uncorrelated signals—called coherence bandwidth 
a
function of the delay spread.[4]
The coherence bandwidth depends on the environment and it should be
noticed that a very wide and impractical frequency separation is required
in microcellular and indoor locations and thus the applicability (and the
performance) of the frequency hopping is limited in these environments.
1.3.1.3 Fast fading
The mobile station or base station receives in one moment the same
signal arriving via different radio paths as mentioned in the previous
section. The total received signal is a contribution of all the arrived signal
multipath components based on the superposition principle. The different
signal components, arriving via different radio paths, have different
amplitude and phase due to the different lengths of the radio path and
different reflection and diffraction properties. Thus, the sum of the
received signals can be constructive or a destructive depending on the
phases of the multipath components.
The amplitude and especially the phase of the multipath components
change very quickly when the mobile station moves. A movement
over distance of one signal wavelength (30 cm at 900 MHz) causes a
phase change 
of up to 
depending on the direction of the
movement in respect to the direction of the incoming multipath
component 
(Equation 1.4).
Team LRN
www.allitebooks.com

Introduction —Radio Propagation Environment  
15
Because of these fast changes in the phases of the multipath
components, the phase and amplitude of the total signal also changes
rapidly when the receiver moves. This is called  fast  fading. When all of
the components have random uniformly distributed phase 
 the
amplitude of the total signal is Rayleigh distributed [4] (fast fading is also
called Rayleigh fading). This occurs when there is no single dominating
signal path, for example no-line-of-sight component (NLOS). In a
Rayleigh fading situation the signal amplitude variations can be very
large, see Figure 1.10.
The Rayleigh distribution can be described by the cumulative density
function (CDF). This is shown in Equation 1.5.
where r is the envelope of the fading signal and 
is the mean square
value of the fading signal.
Team LRN

16       RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
When a signal in one incoming direction has a higher amplitude than
the others, as in the case of line-of-sight (LOS), the total signal amplitude
is no longer Rayleigh but Rician distributed and the fading is called Rician
fading. Rician fading happens specifically in micro base stations where
the mobile station is close to the base station antenna array and one
signal path (the LOS component) is clearly better than the others. The
cumulative density function of Rician distribution is shown in
Equation 1.6.
where
The variable a is the amplitude of the direct (dominating) signal. A
special case of Rician distribution is Rayleigh, in which case the direct
signal amplitude is zero (a = 0).
Fast fading distribution varies depending on the BTS–MS connection
(LOS or NLOS situations). In addition, the environment has an effect on
the received power distribution especially in microcellular and rural
situations. In a microcellular propagation channel, as well as in rural
situations, there may be several major signal components and thus field
strength distribution is not constant for different situations.
The amplitude of the signal at the receiver via two different radio
channels is shown in Figure 1.11. When these signals are combined
together at the receiver an additional 4–5 dB improvement can be
achieved. This multiple reception is called diversity or diversity reception
and it is based on the availability of uncorrelated signals at the receiving
Team LRN

Introduction —Radio Propagation Environment
17
end. These uncorrelated signals (as in Figure 1.11) can mainly be
provided by the base station antenna configuration (antenna diversity), or
by frequency or time separation of the signals.
1.3.1.4 Slow fading
Slow fading or log-normal fading is the variation of the local mean
signal level over a wider area, and has been observed by Young.[4] The
local mean is the mean value of the Rayleigh or Rician fading signal
amplitude. This log-normal fading is caused by the obstacles (buildings,
trees, etc.) that change the average received signal level and thus bring
about shadowing. The variation of the signal amplitude local mean value
over the wider area is log-normally distributed and thus it is called log-
normal fading.
Normally in cellular radio planning, cell range and area are predicted
with a target location probability factor (for example 95 percent area
probability) indicating the statistical properties of the signal strength over
the cell area. In order to achieve the required location probability level
some margin has to be taken into account in the planning. Moreover, these
Team LRN

18          RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
margins are usually applied for macro base station coverage planning but
the slow fading margin requirements for micro base station coverage
planning should be considered separately; the majority of BTS–MS
connections in micro base stations are in LOS situations or NLOS only
from around the corner (as seen in Figure 1.7). Thus, the mobile stations
are so close to the base station that no typical shadowing arising from
obstacles occurs and therefore the shadowing margin for the micro base
stations’ coverage is basically not needed.
1.3.1.5 Propagation slope
Radio wave attenuation in free space is proportional to the square of
the distance r (in dB scale 20 dB/dec).[5] In communication links between
the base station and mobile station in a macrocellular environment the
signal levels typically decrease 25–50 dB/decade (that is, the propagation
slope is 25–50 dB/dec) depending on the terrain type (morphography and
topography), as in Table 1.1.[5]
The propagation slope has a strong effect on the path loss which is the
attenuation between the transmission and receiving ends, see Figure 1.12.
Team LRN

Introduction—Radio Propagation Environment 
 19
The path loss can also be determined with path loss exponent by using
the equation
where L is path loss, 
is the path loss at the reference point, d is the
distance between the BTS and MS and exp is the path loss exponent
which equals the propagation slope divided by 10 (exp = slope/10). Notice
however that the propagation slope is not constant over the BTS–MS link
even if the propagation environment is constant. Close to the base station
the propagation slope follows the inverse square law according to the two-
ray equation, excluding fading dips. Thus, the propagation slope near the
transmitting antenna is lower than the propagation slope at greater
distances. The distance of the propagation slope change is called the
“breakpoint distance” and it can be calculated by using the equation [5]
where 
is the height of antenna 1 (BTS) and 
is the height of the
other antenna (MS).
The existence of the propagation slope breakpoint is an important
element that should be taken into account in cellular radio network
planning. The idea is to plan the radio network in such a way that a mobile
station (MS) connected to a certain BTS experiences a lower propagation
slope to the serving BTS and a greater propagation slope to any interfering
BTS. Hence, this leads to good coverage and a low level of interference at
the same time. Of course, a realisation of this idea in an actual cellular
radio network is not very easy in practice. In Figure 1.13 the breakpoint
distances at different frequencies are given as a function of the BTS
antenna height when the MS antenna height is 1.5 m.
Team LRN

20       RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
It can be observed from Figure 1.13 that the breakpoint distances at
900 MHz are quite short and therefore it is difficult to benefit the
phenomenon of a lower propagation slope at closer distances at this
frequency. Whereas at the 1800MHz frequency band the breakpoint
distance can be increased quite rapidly by increasing the BTS antenna
height. This makes it possible to select the BTS antenna height in order
that lower path loss in desired areas may actually be reached.
The propagation slope and breakpoint distance have to be engaged in a
macrocellular propagation environment and it is especially important in
urban areas where coverage should be maximized together with capacity.
1.3.2 
Characteristics of radio propagation environments
The 
typical 
values 
for 
the 
different 
environments 
of 
the
aforementioned radio channel characteristics are gathered in Table 1.2 at
900 MHz.
The figures in Table 1.2 show the critical issues that have to be taken
into account in radio system planning. In the microcellular and indoor
environments there are many LOS connections and there are often several
predominant paths between BTS and MS and thus the fast fading statistics
vary.
Team LRN

Introduction —Radio Propagation Environment 
21
Second, the propagation slope shows that the attenuation varies
strongly in different environments. This variation is still more for the
macrocellular area type comparison (urban/suburban/rural) because the
propagation slope is not required so much in microcellular and indoor
planning. In a microcellular environment the propagation slope is
typically around 20 dB/dec and street “canyons” are of special concern.
Tunnels are a special case because the propagation slope depends on the
tunnel shape (rectangular or arched) and on the polarisation (vertical or
horizontal). [8] Hence, radio coverage planning and the propagation
characteristics have to be considered carefully in tunnel applications.
Finally the influence of the angular spread and delay spread on the
different propagation environments has to be understood. These
parameters have the strongest effect on radio system planning because
they define the application of frequency hopping and adaptive antenna
concepts and the antenna configurations of the diversity reception. Figures
of the angular spread show that the microcellular and indoor areas are
totally different environments compared to the macrocellular. It can be
concluded that the microcellular and indoor environments are the most
difficult ones to improve the system efficiency or to reduce the
interference level, for example by using adaptive antennas. Moreover, the
advantage of the wide angular spread in a microcellular environment can
be seen in the space diversity reception which can be implemented by
using a very compact antenna configuration.
Team LRN

22        RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The same microcellular and indoor locations cause problems because
the delay spread is so short. The short delay spread means that frequency
separation in the frequency hopping has to be wide and therefore this
method is impractical to use to combat fast fading in microcellular and
indoor locations. Hence, diversity reception is needed to improve and
balance the reception level in these environments.
1.4 
Network evolution path
A radio network has to be extended throughout its evolution because
of the increase in traffic (capacity extensions) and demands of better
indoor and outdoor coverage (coverage extensions). Radio network
evolution can be divided into different phases, using four main categories:
1. Basic coverage deployment
2. The first capacity extensions and coverage enhancement
deployment (indoor coverage)
3. Intelligent capacity enhancement deployment with strong
indoor coverage improvement
4. Base station coverage area splitting/microcellular/dual
band deployment.
These different radio network evolution phases are also related to the
different radio propagation environments. In the early phases base
stations are more of a macrocellular type but after base station splitting the
base station antennas should be installed in lower and lower positions in
order to avoid too large a coverage areas, simultaneously the propagation
environment also changes towards microcellular. The use of low antenna
positions improves the capacity but simultaneously the coverage is
significantly reduced and more and more base stations are needed to fill
the new coverage holes. Thus, the key point in radio network evolution is
to keep the antennas high by utilising initially all possible coverage and
capacity related functions. Simultaneously, the coverage and capacity
limitations of each radio propagation environment have to be understood
(based on the radio environment characteristics in Table 1.2) in order to
be able to optimise the base station coverage and capacity at each
environment.
Team LRN

Introduction—Radio Propagation Environment 
 23
Radio network evolution phases are thus always related to a specific
radio network configuration that includes;
• 
A specified average base station antenna height (macro or
micro base stations)
• 
Required capacity and quality related hardware and software
features.
The different evolution phases always occur in succession which is
called a radio network evolution path (Figure 1.14).
Figure 1.14 shows that in the beginning the coverage has to be good
enough which defines the minimum number of base stations for a certain
area—the radio network is coverage limited. After the coverage
requirements have been exceeded by the capacity requirements, it starts to
influence the radio network configuration—the radio network is capacity
limited.
First the different capacity related hardware and software features are
utilised and finally more cells are implemented (first by splitting the
macro base stations and finally the micro base stations). The utilisation of
the new frequency band—implementation of the dual band network—is
one of the last items to be covered in the capacity enhancement process as
it is difficult to acquire new frequencies and also because this causes some
difficulties in planning. Figure 1.14 shows when different propagation
channel characteristics (related to the different environments and different
evolution phases) are to be concerned. When there are enough base
stations in the radio network the capacity related functions can be utilised
Team LRN

24         RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
again and thus the radio network evolution process continues in a new
environment with new radio propagation characteristics in a similar way
as at the beginning.

Conclusions
Having introduced the GSM system and terminology for radio
interface, the philosophy of the cellular radio network and the key links
between the base station antenna height, radio propagation and radio
propagation environments were defined. These definitions formed the
basis for discussion about radio propagation environments and their
different characteristics and influence on radio system planning. Table 1.3
reviews the conclusion that can be made: that traffic demand from the
radio network and the average base station antenna height are the
parameters that have to be optimised in order to maximise the overall
radio quality called Quality of Service (the coverage, capacity,
interference level and cost efficiency). Hence, an optimised radio network
configuration can be provided by taking into account the characteristics of
radio wave propagation in different environments.

RADIO SYSTEM PLANNING PROCESS
2.1 
Radio system planning phases
The main parameters—antenna type, antenna height, area type—that
effect radio system planning also define the radio propagation
environment that specifies the characteristics of the radio propagation
which furthermore has a significant effect on the coverage and capacity in
the radio network. Radio system planning is a process that defines the
stages—visits in the area, measurements, planning, documentation—
required to provide a desired radio network plan for a certain
geographical area. Moreover, the radio system planning process has to be
defined carefully and carried out in different phases in order to manage
the strong influences between
• 
coverage
•
capacity
• 
quality (interference probability).
These three areas must all be optimised in order to achieve a cost-efficient
and overall high Quality of Service (containing inter alia good speech
quality, minimum radio network congestion, minimum number of drop
calls or handover failures) radio network. In coverage planning the aim is
to maximise the base station coverage areas and thus minimise the
required infrastructure. Correspondingly, the base station need has to be
minimised in the capacity planning by reusing the frequencies as often as
possible. These two topics have different applications: base station
coverage area can be maximised by maximising the base station antenna
height and the base station capacity can be maximised by maximising the
frequency reuse that can be reached by minimising the base station
antenna height. Furthermore, quality is not a real planning topic but is a
very important “issue” and refers to primarily interference that can be
connected to capacity and frequency planning that depend on coverage
issues like the base station antenna heights. Quality connects radio
network coverage and capacity planning and is related to frequency
planning. This illustrates that any of these “topics” can not be maximised
but that they all have to be optimised (otherwise, system planning) in
order to achieve a cost-efficient and high Quality of Service radio
network.
Team LRN

Radio System Planning Process 
 29
In order to plan good coverage simultaneously optimising capacity and
maximising quality, the radio system planning process and key parameters
for this process have to be clearly defined. Figure 2.1 presents the radio
system planning process and its different phases which can be adapted to
radio networks from commencement of deployment to their radio
evolutionary extension. The same phases and studies are required time
after time to deploy new and maintain existing networks. Three major
radio system planning phases:
• 
dimensioning
• 
detailed radio system planning
• 
optimisation
can be identified and each of these has a specific purpose. First,
dimensioning is required to “generally” analyse the network configuration
and to decide the radio network deployment strategy. Next, the radio
network is accurately designed in the detailed radio system planning
phase and finally the radio network evolution requirements are considered
in the optimisation and monitoring phase.
Figure 2.1 shows that the three major radio system planning phases
contain specified key parameters. Two of the parameters traffic and
coverage threshold have a strong influence on the coverage, capacity and
quality in the radio network and can thus be called “global.” These
parameters define the basic required configuration that is related to base
station antenna heights in the radio network.
Traffic together with the available frequency band defines the number
of base stations over a certain coverage area as shown already in Figure 1.6.
Correspondingly, the coverage threshold defines the required number of
base stations to cover the same area. By comparing these two results it can
be shown whether the radio network planning is coverage or capacity
driven or limited. When the theoretical base station quantity is studied the
average base station antenna height and thus also the average base station
coverage area for the radio network can be defined. The average base
station antenna height could be the third “global” parameter because it
Team LRN

30           RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
has the strongest individual influence on the base station coverage area
and furthermore the strongest influence on the frequency reuse. Hence,
traffic, coverage threshold and antenna height must be considered during
network evolution.
2.1.1 
Dimensioning
Dimensioning is the first phase of the radio system planning process
and its purpose is to initially draft the radio network configuration and
deployment strategy for the long-term. This work could also be called a
strategy of radio system planning because the aim is to define the essential
radio parameter values and technologies in order to deploy the network. If
the radio network is new there have to be several scenarios on how to
exceed the coverage thresholds in different traffic situations. If an existing
network is extended, the traffic history over the area has to be utilised to
identify traffic increases during the next 1–3 years. The better the traffic
forecasts the better the configuration (antenna heights and capacity) can
be optimised for network evolution.
In order to study the coverage and capacity requirements for a specific
area several more detailed parameters need factoring into the
dimensioning, specifically knowledge of the:
• 
size of the covered area
• 
coverage threshold
• 
frequency band (for the radio propagation, 900/1800/2100
MHz)
• 
path loss between the BTS and MS (from the power budget
calculations).
And for the coverage analysis and for the capacity analysis the:
• 
total traffic over the coverage area
• 
targeted maximum blocking
• 
frequency band (the number of the frequencies)
• 
frequency reuse (the maximum number of the frequencies at
the base station).
The base station coverage area can be estimated by utilising the above
mentioned coverage parameters, and the required number of base stations
can be tuned by changing the base station antenna height to correspond to
the number accordingly based on traffic requirements for the coverage
area. Because traffic is increasing year after year, this analysis has to be
Team LRN

Radio System Planning Process 
  
 
                                 31
done based on differing traffic demands, with the final network
configuration and deployment strategy dependent on this long-term
analysis. If this long-term analysis is not done the base station antennas
will not be located correctly and the radio network configuration will not
be cost-efficient due to overcapacity or load and will require continuous
reconfigurations. Note that reconfigurations can not be avoided, but they
can be minimised. Steadily increasing demands upon coverage (for
example increased data traffic and data service) cause changes, as in
coverage thresholds, and these changes have to be taken into account at
the dimensioning stage because they strongly influence base station site
locations.
2.1.2 
Detailed radio planning
Detailed radio planning is the second phase in the radio system
planning process. After defining the average base station antenna height in
the dimensioning phase (based on the traffic and coverage threshold
requirements) the required radio network has finally to be designed
and implemented. Detailed radio planning—coverage, capacity and
frequency planning—has to be done and documented. These three
different planning phases are typically presented in discussion about the
radio planning process. Noting the connection between coverage and
capacity planning and the influence on base station configurations, the
detailed planning process phases are (see also Figure 2.2):
• 
configuration planning
• 
coverage planning
• 
capacity and frequency planning
• 
parameter planning.
Each of these phases are utilising dimensioning results with the aim of
designing a cost-efficient and high Quality of Service radio network in
practise.

that traffic and coverage thresholds are exceeded. The area definition also
needs to use as constant a base station site configuration (e.g. macro sites
and coverage driven configuration) as possible in the radio interface.
These constant configurations make it easier to achieve the high quality
radio network and they also help, for example in logistics. Configuration
planning is thus needed prior to coverage and capacity planning to analyse
all available coverage and capacity related hardware and software features
and single-, multi band equipment, to define which features are required at
which base station sites in different environments. Configuration planning
analyses the capacity related system features and their influence on
performance regarding the maximum number of frequencies at base
stations. These capacity features and frequency assignments have a direct
effect on the base station site equipment (e.g. narrowband or wideband
combiners) which typically cause losses at the base station and in the
antenna line. Moreover, some features like frequency hopping may also
provide improvement for the path loss between the base station and
mobile station. The base station site has to be configured based on both
coverage and capacity requirements; the required capacity features define
the capacity related base station site elements (combiners, etc.) and the
required coverage or dominance area defines the need for other coverage
related equipment (e.g. antenna gain, low noise amplifier (LNA), power
amplifier (PA), diversity reception). The optimised base station
configuration can finally be analysed by calculating the power budget for
the BTS–MS connection for the uplink and downlink directions. The
above mentioned capacity and coverage related equipment specifications
can be taken into account in this power budget calculation and both
coverage as well as capacity can be optimised. The above mentioned
issues related to single band and multi band planning bring about new
equipment (like multi band antennas, cables, LNAs, boosters and
diplexers) and questions arising from their need at different base station
sites. Multi band base station equipment—as with all base station
equipment—and its performance, has to be clearly understood in detail in
order to be able to decide and define the base station site configurations
for different environments, during this configuration planning phase.

Radio System Planning Process

As a result of configuration planning the
• 
base station site type (macro, micro, indoor)
• 
base station antenna line (antenna height, single-, multi band)
• 
base station coverage/dominance (in other words service)
area and capacity
for different areas and environments have to be defined. These three
configuration areas define the total base station site configuration that is to
be used for a specific area in order to maximise the radio network cost-
efficiency and QOS. As only the final base station site locations may yet
amend these configurations these can be clarified and confirmed in the
detailed coverage planning.
2.1.2.2 Coverage planning
Configuration planning defines the base station site equipment for
different environments (for coverage or capacity purposes). Coverage
planning ultimately defines the radio network configuration. The aim of
coverage planning is to utilise the dimensioning results (the average base
station antenna height) and the configurations defined in the configuration
planning (based on the power budget calculations) to minimise the
number of base station sites. Thus, coverage planning has to be done over
a certain area in order to be able to optimise the base station site locations
and thus to utilise the base station configurations. The different phases of
the coverage planning process are presented also in Figure 2.2 that shows
the importance of the radio propagation measurements during radio
coverage planning. Coverage planning begins with an open-minded
coverage area survey which considers environmental limitations such as
high buildings, hills or other obstacles. This survey indicates potential
propagation problem areas and may already suggest some requirements
for base station site locations. In this way this survey initially defines the
critical base station site locations and suggests strategies to cover the area.
Note at this stage that in certain areas it is more cost efficient to use, for
example one base station site in addition to minimum base station
configuration than one site less with the maximum configuration because
of the environment. After this definition of the overall configuration for a
certain area the propagation measurements need to be analysed—unless
and only if there are measurements available about the area already. These
measurements are required to tune the radio propagation prediction model
which is extremely important when considering capacity and frequency
planning along with the functions of the radio network.
Team LRN

34         RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
When the coverage area and radio propagation environment have been
studied and the measurements have been taken then follows the tuning of
the prediction model. The measured sites are tuned and these results are
utilised over the coverage planning area. This model tuning provides the
accuracy for the radio coverage prediction. After prediction model tuning
the candidate base station site locations are defined. The site locations are
called candidate because there are no rental contracts yet for the sites and
thus hypothetical site locations have to be used based on the site survey,
measurement and propagation prediction results. Note that site contract
negotiations and site construction take on average 4–6 months and thus
the measurements and candidate site selections and the whole coverage
planning process have to be started approximately twelve months before
the launch of the planned sites. Moreover, the process has to be initiated
with the measurements because only they can ensure accurate coverage
planning.
The candidate sites are selected as if they were the final sites and they
are planned as accurately as the final sites; this phase really is detailed
coverage planning even though the candidates are to be confirmed. From
Figure 2.2 candidate site selection goes beyond the coverage planning and
is actually dealt in the same way as if it were final coverage planning.
Actual coverage planning contains the radio parameter input, radio
prediction model set-up and coverage area calculation for each base
station. Parameter input includes all the required parameters (calculated in
the power budget) to define either the optimised downlink or uplink
transmission power from the base station or mobile station antenna. Radio
coverage planning is traditionally calculated in planning systems
(advanced software programs) in the downlink direction from the base
station transmitter to the mobile station antenna by defining the
• 
base station transmission power
• 
base station equipment and antenna line losses (combiner
loss, cable loss)
• 
base station antenna height, direction, gain, and tilting if it is
used.
The radio propagation prediction model is then checked once more and
tuned, and finally the base station coverage area is calculated by using the
input parameters, prediction model and digital maps. Typically all these
coverage planning phases are done in the radio planning tool, which
provides a radio planning platform where the measurements can be

imported, prediction models can be tuned and the coverage, capacity and
frequency planning can be done.
The last phase in coverage planning is to define the final coverage
thresholds and the coverage areas where these certain thresholds have to
be exceeded. The coverage planning thresholds can be defined based on
the power budget and the coverage planning margins. These thresholds
also finally define the average maximum distance between two base
station sites.
2.1.2.3 Capacity and frequency planning
Capacity and frequency planning are very operative and radio
planning-tool based processes because the radio network configuration—
as the number of frequencies used at each base station—is already decided
in the dimensioning phase and the aim is only to provide the best possible
result by using the required configuration. Capacity and frequency
planning starts (or they have to be taken into account) when the base
station sites are selected. The base station locations should be selected by
trying to achieve equal base station coverage areas (and enough
overlapping) and thus try to minimise interference in the radio network.
Capacity and frequency planning starts by defining the planning
thresholds, which depend on the hardware and software features used in
the radio network. When the thresholds have been defined the rest of the
capacity and frequency planning process is planning-tool based work at
the onset of the radio network deployment. When the question is about the
extension of a radio network a more detailed analysis is required to
understand the actual capacity needs in the radio network. This analysis
again has to be done over an area and based on the traffic measurements
from the radio network. The total traffic has to be gathered from the
specific area and the number of frequencies have to be calculated and
compared to the actual configuration.
Team LRN

36        RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
2.1.2.4 Parameter planning
Parameter planning is actually a very short phase before the launch of
the radio network because the radio network parameter values are
typically fixed and because their values are based on the measurements
from the other networks and thus on precedence. Typically parameters are
divided into subgroups like:
• 
signalling
• 
radio resource management
• 
mobility management
• 
neighbour base station measurements
• 
handover and power control.
These parameters all concern and handle one type of function in the
radio network. The parameter values are also quite fixed for the different
environments but some small changes can be utilised, e.g. for outdoor and
indoor locations. Some special cases—like the dual band radio network
and the traffic distribution between the frequency layers—need more
detailed radio parameter analysis. The parameters themselves and the
special cases are explained later because a detailed parameter planning is
more connected to the optimisation process. The radio network parameters
are also very powerful because they can be used for example for the
prioritisation of the base stations—traffic can be distributed to a certain
base station first and then others. After parameter planning the radio
network is ready for operational mode and also ready to restart the same
process—dimensioning and detailed planning—from the beginning due to
radio network evolution. However, some statistics (from monitoring) are
required from the network and some corrections (towards optimisation)
can be done with the radio network before the radio network extensions
need to start.
2.1.3 
Optimisation and monitoring
The actual radio system planning process contained dimensioning,
coverage, capacity and frequency planning and it would be perfect if the
number of mobile stations and their locations were constant and already
established in the radio planning phase. Unfortunately, neither the number
of mobile stations nor their location is constant and thus there is no exact
information about the configuration needs of the radio network before the
network is up and running and some statistical data is gathered
(monitoring). This statistical data indicates the final traffic in a certain
Team LRN

Radio System Planning Process 
 37
area and it shows whether the radio network has overcapacity or
congestion. The monitoring results (statistical data) are also a very
important input for the dimensioning phase (for the network extensions)
and thus a starting point for the network evolution. The optimisation
process fits the designed radio network to the actual coverage demands
and traffic. The first target is to verify the coverage and to analyse
whether it is good enough. Next, the traffic over a certain area is studied
and if the base station coverage area is overloaded (base stations are
congested) it has to be analysed whether:
• 
the traffic has to be balanced between the base stations or
• 
more frequencies have to be assigned or
• 
more base stations have to be implemented.
The optimisation phase is an adjustment process based on real life
changes that were not taken into account in the original radio system
planning, which was based on the coverage threshold requirements and
traffic forecasts. Thus, both coverage and traffic verifications may trigger
changes which influence back upon them. Moreover, the radio system
planning process has to be repeated in the optimisation (optimisation =
replanning) phase using the real information about coverage and traffic.
When the actual coverage and capacity have been measured the
optimisation work starts with an analysis of required base stations for
traffic and continues with the coverage analysis, as in dimensioning.
When the radio network configuration is defined, based on these real
parameters, operational optimisation can be started. In this operational
phase coverage may be improved by
• 
maximising the base station site configurations
• 
moving the base station sites.
Base station site capacities are directed at corresponding to the
requirements by
• 
defining the actual need for frequencies at each base station
location
• 
balancing the frequency assignments at each base station
• 
defining the required capacity-related software features to
improve capacity.
When the base station coverage areas are satisfactory and the base
station dominance areas correspond to the capacity requirements the radio
network is balanced.

2.1.4 
Radio system planning process documentation
The different radio system planning phases (as introduced) create a
radio system planning process where there are
• 
a strategic system planning part (dimensioning)
• 
an operative system planning part (detailed radio planning)
• 
a system planning monitoring part (optimisation and
monitoring).
All of which can be managed and controlled by having good input and
output documents. These input and output documents are critical in the
whole radio planning process because the common planning criteria
(needed in order to achieve constant quality in the radio network) can only
be applied if it is documented exactly (input documentation). Moreover,
knowledge of the radio network configuration can only be upgraded if the
output documentation is accurately and correctly organised. Thus, exact
documentation is needed to control the radio system planning process, to
guarantee the high quality and cost efficient radio network infrastructure
and to manage the radio network in the long-term.
Figure 2.3 introduces the radio system planning folder which is a
documentation database whose function is to guide the radio system
planning process. The planning folder can be implemented in the planning
system or it can be managed by a separate software application or the
common directory trees can be used (as in Figure 2.3).The planning folder
needs to be located in a common area (for example in a shared drive on an
operator’s local network) such that the whole radio planning organisation
has open access to it.
The planning folder includes input documents (open reading access)
and output documents (open reading and writing access). The input
documents are in the planning and R&D (research and development)
directories and the output documents are in the site folder directory
(highlighted). The input documents contain the information that has to be
controlled and accepted by a planning manager and the output documents
contain data that is related to the radio network configuration.
Team LRN

Radio System Planning Process 
39
Input documents
The input documents include the data in the planning and R&D
directories. The planning
directory has two subdirectories called
planning_criteria and planning_thresholds. The planning_criteria directory
contains the technical information about the technologies, methods and
concepts that are used in radio system planning and deployment. These
items should be documented in the radio network supplier based radio
network planning (RNP) manual that defines and specifies the radio
system planning criteria. The radio network planning manual should be as
complete a description as possible regarding radio system planning
because it is the only guarantee that common rules are used in radio
system planning throughout radio network evolution. Additionally it can
be efficiently used for training and as an introduction to new radio
planners.
The second input subdirectory is planning_thresholds; based on its
contents. As this suggests, the directory contains the final radio system
planning thresholds such as:
• 
planning strategy (dual band, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS)
• 
planning platform (tools, interfaces, etc.)
• 
the available base station 
site equipment and their
performance
• 
coverage thresholds
Team LRN

40         RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
• 
frequency band (available frequencies, maximum number of
transceivers at the base stations, etc.)
• 
quality criteria (maximum blocking, drop calls, handover
failures, etc.)
• 
the features used and functions in the radio network
(frequency hopping, etc.)
• 
default radio parameter settings (e.g. dual band parameters)
• 
monitoring principles (key performance indicators (KPI)).
These documents are the final guidelines for the radio planning engineers
to follow and they also define the targeted QOS in the radio network. It is
also critical to have a good document about the planning platform in order
to define exactly all of the planning tools and interfaces for the different
radio system planning phases.
The last input (and also output when accepted by the planning
manager) directory is R&D, which is required to provide a common forum
for all the trial and test reports and studies. This directory is a database for
all technical documents which are related to radio system planning and
which are not defined in the planning_criteria and planning_thresholds
directories. These documents are typically reports which support the
planning criteria and which can be used to give a wider understanding of
the radio planning topics.
Output documents
The output documents are in the site_folder directory which contains
subdirectories for each radio planning area, which in turn contain two
databases (base station site folder and KPI-monitoring) and subdirectories
for each base station sites. These documents have information required
about the radio network configuration and its performance at each
moment.
The documentation of the radio network configuration is based on the
base station site folder (database) and on the base station site directories.
Each base station site directory contains a document called base station
site data which contains all the required information to build a certain base
station site. This base station site data document is used to approve the
radio planning for each base station site. The base station site data
document is also copied to the base station site folder in order to be able
to monitor the whole radio network infrastructure (the site folder should
Team LRN

Radio System Planning Process 
               41
include all the base station site equipment and parameters). Note that the
same information that is in the base station site data and in the base station
site folder is also in the radio planning system in order to draw up a radio
plan.
Thus, the same data is documented three times for different purposes:
• 
data in the planning system is for the actual planning
• 
the base station site data is for the acceptance of the radio
planning (typically printed and signed by a radio planner)
• 
the base station site folder is for the monitoring.
The other type of output documentation is the radio network monitoring
that can be done by using key performance indicators. The importance of
these KPI values is to build up a history, e.g. about traffic increase in
different geographical areas. By recording the KPI values, say at least
once a month, the long-term development and evolution that is required
from all radio planning areas builds up.
The input and defined output documents are necessary for successful
radio system planning in the operational phase but of course other
documents are needed e.g. from dimensioning. However, these documents
in the site folder control the radio system planning process and
automatically take care of the quality. The different radio system planning
phases and output documents (or documentation) are thus linked such that
the base station site data is always documented first when the coverage
plan is made (from site search to site selection). When the radio plan for
the selected site is accepted, implementation can be started. When the site
has been built the radio parameters have to be assigned and, for example
base station identifications, location areas and designated frequencies
have to be added to the base station site document. When the site is finally
in operation the site folder has to be upgraded and the monitoring of the
site started. These output documentation phases happen time after time
during an evolution of the radio network and some changes are needed for
both output and input documents due to radio network extensions and the
introduction of new technologies.

Conclusions
The radio system planning process is carried out in phases and has to
be carefully documented in order to maximise the cost efficient radio
network configuration. The critical planning phases for long-term success
(see Table 2.1) are dimensioning and monitoring; as they define the radio
network deployment strategy. The other planning phases are driven more
by technical details which, of course, have a great effect on the final radio
network configuration. However, the whole planning process can be
optimised when the documentation is done correctly and the input and
output documents guide the radio system planning procedures.

CONFIGURATION PLANNING AND POWER
BUDGET
3.1 
General power budget
Base station site configuration defines the maximum allowed path loss
and includes the base station equipment and antenna line configurations
as illustrated in Figure 3.1.
Base station equipment and antenna line configurations can be
designed for different purposes by solving the path loss in the power
budget. They also include both general and accessory elements and
parameters. The equipment configuration elements and parameters are
• 
sensitivity (uplink)
• 
transmitting power (downlink)
• 
combiner loss (downlink)
and the antenna line configuration elements and parameters are
• 
receiving (RX) and transmitting (TX) antenna gains (uplink,
downlink)
• 
cable loss (uplink, downlink).
Team LRN
www.allitebooks.com

Configuration Planning and Power Budget

These elements are needed to build up a basic base station that
transmits and receives a radio signal.
The basic configuration and power budget can be improved by
introducing features and accessory elements which are
• 
frequency hopping (uplink, downlink)
for equipment configuration, and
•
diversity reception (uplink)
•
low noise amplifier (LNA, uplink)
•
booster or power amplifier (downlink)
•
duplex filter (uplink, downlink)
•
diplex filter (uplink, downlink)
for the antenna line configuration. The technical performance of these
elements is manufacture related. These elements are also configuration
related. The equipment configuration therefore has a link to the antenna
line configuration and vice versa. Note also that the performance of
certain parameters like diversity reception and frequency hopping are
strongly related to the radio propagation environment and thus urban,
suburban and rural areas require different corrections in their power
budgets.
The technical parameters of a mobile station (MS) have to be defined
before the power budget calculations can be done. The mobile station
parameters
•
transmitting power (uplink)
• 
sensitivity (downlink)
• 
transmitting (TX) and receiving (RX) antenna gains (uplink,
downlink)
•
cable loss (uplink, downlink)
have to be included in the power budget. Remember that mobile stations
are standardised consumer products and thus typical technical values have
to be known because they cannot be configured separately.
In order to calculate the maximum allowed path loss between the base
station and the mobile station and to select the optimised base station site
configuration all these parameters have to be collated in the power budget
(Figure 3.2).
Team LRN

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The two main areas of Figure 3.2 represent the uplink (MS
transmitting and BTS receiving) and downlink (BTS transmitting and MS
receiving) directions. The aim is to balance and maximise the allowed
isotropic path loss by maximising the transmitting power of the base
station.
All elements thus have a direct effect on the base station transmitting
power. The parameter values for the mobile stations have to be constant
and typically the value 0 dB is used for antenna gain and cable loss if no
external antennas and cables are used. As equipment configuration
parameters are fixed when the base station supplier is selected it is the

   47
base station antenna line parameters that have the strongest effect on the
final path loss.
Figure 3.2 shows the allowed path loss in the uplink direction is 8.5 dB
less than in the downlink when the base station transmitting power is
30 W (= 45 dBm). This 8.5 dB difference means that the base station
coverage area in the downlink direction is greater than in the uplink
direction. The power budget can be balanced either by reducing the BTS
transmitting power (thus reducing downlink coverage) or by using
accessory elements for the uplink (while retaining downlink coverage).
3.1.1 
Base station and mobile station transmission power
GSM specification 05.05 says that the BTS transmission RF peak
power can, for example, be 20–40 W (TRX power class 5) at the
900 MHz frequency band. The GSM manufacturers typically have a few
macro BTS types with maximum power (typically in the power class 5)
and also some special BTS types for transmitting lower peak powers. As
different suppliers have different BTS types with transmission power from
1.0 to 50 W, the nominal peak power of each BTS type has to be carefully
checked. Note that transmission peak powers can vary between the
frequency bands 900/1800/1900 MHz.
There are five different mobile classes for the GSM900 system (see
Table 3.1). Classes 1–3 are vehicle mounted and are something of a rarity,
whereas handhelds, the mobile classes 4 and 5, are the mainstay of the
GSM system, specifically the handheld with 2 W transmission peak
power. Handhelds of 0.8 W have been discussed but they are not widely
supported at present.
Team LRN

48        RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
GSM specification 05.05 states that mobile station class 4 peak power
at 900 MHz has to be 
Manufacturers utilised this
margin in the early 1990s and typically delivered mobile stations with
around 1.5 W transmission peak power. This lower transmission power
saved the mobile battery, one of the key topics when performance was
discussed. In the late 1990s mobile battery development had improved to
the extent that it ceased to be an issue and suppliers started to develop
mobiles closer to the 2 W peak transmission power criteria. Competition
between mobile suppliers has led to improved transmission power (and
therefore coverage area) at the expense of battery life. In the near future
we may expect to see nominal power transmitted at
3.1.2 
Base station and mobile station sensitivities
GSM specification 05.05 defines the base-line minimum reception
levels (without diversity reception), as – 104 dBm and – 102 dBm
(900 MHz) for the BTS and MS, respectively. However, manufacturers
have started to improve base station sensitivity levels and to indicate
values lower than – 104 dBm, even as low as – 108 dBm. The
environment for these values is not revealed, nor is whether diversity
reception was applied. When sensitivity levels are discussed, the
environment and the number of reception branches should be indicated so
as to confirm the base-line.
3.1.2.1 Types of environment
In GSM specification 05.05 there are five different area types defined
for the GSM900 system:
•   static,
• 
typical urban 50 km/h 
(TU50)
• 
hilly terrain 100 km/h 
(HT100)
• 
rural 250 km/h 
(RA250).
In these areas the radio propagation fading conditions are different and
thus base station sensitivity also differs. Therefore, accurate sensitivity
values must be used in different environments or else the poorest value
must be used over the whole network in order to avoid pockets of quality
reduction.
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
              49
3.1.2.2 Base station sensitivity and diversity reception
Diversity reception is also sometimes connected to BTS sensitivity and
leads to discussion about receiving system sensitivity. Depending on the
diversity technique and environment the typical two branch diversity
reception gain is 3–6 dB. Therefore, BTS sensitivity is also 3–6 dB better
if the diversity reception is included in the sensitivity values. Sensitivity
measurements are typically simulated in an optimum condition using zero
correlation for the different reception branches. In reality the signal
correlations of the different receiving branches are not even close to the
zero and the signal levels are not equal.
The actual parameter ranges have to be taken into account when BTS
sensitivity and diversity reception is determined.
3.1.2.3 Mobile station sensitivity
Mobile station sensitivity covers the same parameters as the base
station but diversity reception is not typically used at the mobile station
receiving end. Mobile station suppliers have also improved sensitivity: the
value of – 104 dBm, or better, has been frequently recorded. However,
nominal values of different mobile station types have to be measured in
different environments. Typically values from – 102 dBm to – 105 dBm
have been safely used in radio planning.
3.1.3 
Combiner and receiving multicoupler losses
Combiners in the downlink direction and receiving multicouplers in
the uplink direction are needed in the base stations if more than one
tranceivers are assigned to the same antenna line. The combiners merge
the frequencies to the same antenna line in the downlink direction and
simultaneously cause attenuation. The receiving multicouplers separate
the frequencies in the uplink direction but their attenuation is negligible.
Combiner attenuation is related to the combiners’ performance.
Combiners can be narrowband and thus tuned to a certain frequency band
so the attenuation can be minimised. Wideband combiners (of higher
attenuation) are typically needed if frequency hopping is used and
frequencies are far away from each other. Table 3.2 gives an idea of the
different combiner types and attenuations. Wideband combiners are, of
course, meant for capacity areas where a maximum number of tranceivers
are required over each coverage area. In these capacity areas many base
Team LRN

50
 RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
stations are needed, coverage is limited and thus minor higher combiner
loss does not cause any serious difficulty (however indoor coverage is
reduced). Correspondingly, frequency band selective combiners are used
in the areas where maximum coverage is required and thus combiner loss
is also minimised. Combiner loss can be minimised when it is by-passed
but then only one frequency can be assigned to the antenna line (a new
antenna line is required if capacity is needed in the future for a second
frequency).
3.1.4 
Base station antennas
“Antenna” typically describes an entire radiating element, connected
via a line to the base station equipment (see Figure 3.1). Specifically
“antenna” can be a short piece of metal wire (a wire antenna, as in a
dipole antenna) or a metal plate (patch antenna). These examples are
based only on one element and therefore “antenna” is often combined
with some other word, as in “antenna element.” When two or more of
these elements are connected they form an “antenna array.” Antenna
arrays achieve direction (also called gain) for the radiation.
Base station antennas, depending on their application, comprise either
one antenna element (small size, low gain and multi band antennas
without diversity) for indoor applications, or an antenna array (high gain
and directional) for macro cell applications.
The essential base station antenna parameters are:
• 
Gain (low/medium/high)
• 
Beamwidth (horizontal and vertical)
• 
Size
• 
Polarisation
• 
Diversity technique
• 
Frequency band
• 
Tilting properties.
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
 51
Environmental aspects together with coverage and capacity related
issues determine the system level requirements for the whole base station
antenna line, including the antenna itself.
Antenna gain, size and beamwidth need to be considered
simultaneously as they have strong links to each other. Macro base
stations (antennas above the average rooftop level) in urban and rural
areas typically have to cover as large an area as possible. A high gain base
station antenna (e.g., 18 dBi at 900 MHz) is one of the best means of
achieving high coverage in this environment. However as the height of a
high gain antenna is between 1500–2500 mm it will require careful
planning—awareness of visual impact—and sensitive installation. The
antenna beamwidth parameter provides some assistance when flexibility
is needed in the antenna gain and size.[2] The typical pattern for the
antenna horizontal half power radiation, for macro base stations, is
60–120°, achieving maximum gain and coverage area but also maximum
capacity in the radio network. Note, base station antenna strongly
influences capacity (see Chapter 6). A small variation in the horizontal
beamwidth can be achieved by the antenna size and vertical beamwidth.
Commercial high gain antennas (e.g., 18 dBi at 900 MHz) typically have a
horizontal beamwidth of 65° and vertical beamwidth of 7–9°. This vertical
beamwidth is at a bare minimum, with no reserve. In macro base stations
a narrow vertical beamwidth is an advantage, as transmission power can
be directed to a certain area (known as tilting, also see Chapter 6).
Moreover, when base station antennas are installed below the rooftop
level—on outdoor walls in micro base stations and on inside walls in
indoor base stations—antenna size is the most critical parameter. In
outdoor locations antenna gain should be maximized to increase indoor
coverage and therefore a narrow horizontal beamwidth is not too critical
as buildings neighbouring the antenna will alter it anyway. The vertical
beamwidth can, in an outdoor micro base station, be quite wide (up to
45°) in order to maximise coverage to the upper floors of high-rise
buildings. Vertical beamwidth should be selected by taking into account
the need for antenna gain for indoor coverage and building heights
(constant 4–5 floor buildings or tower blocks). Correspondingly, in indoor
locations the base station antenna should be, of course, very small (one
element antenna). Thus, antenna gain can also be quite small (the
coverage is needed only for indoor locations), the horizontal beamwidth
can be omnidirectional or direction-specific depending on the shape of the
building and the vertical beamwidth can be flexible.
Team LRN

52        RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Vertical polarisation is primarily applied in mobile communication
systems as it has better propagation properties in urban outdoor locations
than horizontal polarisation.[3] Vertical polarisation has lower losses than
the horizontal due to diffraction and reflections caused by buildings and
other obstacles. There are also many more vertical surfaces for reflections
than horizontal ones. Therefore, vertical polarisation is primarily used and
recommended for outdoor and indoor locations. The exception to this
recommendation is a tunnel environment, where polarisation is selected
mainly based on the tunnel shape.[4]
Diversity reception is also utilised widely in mobile communication
systems in order to improve the power budget and thus to improve the
quality at the base (and/or mobile) station receiving end. Traditionally
space diversity was used with two base station antennas which were
physically separated (creating a large antenna configuration). Nowadays
polarisation and other diversity techniques are more commonly used and
studied because they require no physical separation and thus only one
base station antenna location is needed. These different diversity reception
techniques improve the macro and micro coverage areas. In indoor base
stations diversity is not required as the systems typically provide a high
enough received field strength level to achieve good quality. Diversity is
also very expensive for indoor systems as the cabling should be doubled.
Antennas are designed to function in a single frequency band, dual
band or multi band. Single band antennas are, of course, easier to
manufacture whereas dual/multi band antennas are produced for specific
purposes. The need for single or multi band antennas can be assessed by
understanding the radio propagation in different environments. In urban
and rural macro base stations, the coverage area differs between 450 MHz
(GSM), 900MHz (GSM), 1800MHz (GSM) and 2100MHz (UMTS)
frequency bands and thus, the same antenna location is not necessarily the
optimum solution to deploy the multi band radio network. Therefore,
single band antennas are primarily used in macro base stations and multi
band antennas are utilised when necessary. Multi band antennas provide
an economical solution in macro and micro base stations and in indoor
applications as only one antenna and cable has to be installed.
The last antenna related parameter is tilting, required in order to
decrease interference in high capacity areas where base station coverage
has to be limited and focused. Tilting directs the vertical main beam,
typically between 5–20° (depending on the vertical beamwidth) from the
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
   53
horizon towards the earth’s surface. Tilting can be done manually but the
use of electrical tilting is usually recommended. As tilting is typically
necessary for urban macro base stations (in a high capacity area) it is
critical to have quite a narrow vertical beamwidth in the base stations in
order to achieve maximum flexibility in tilting (if the vertical beamwidth
is close to 15°, a huge tilt is required to obtain any results). Downtilting is
a standard solution but in some special cases uptilting may be required, as
in hilly areas. In micro base stations and indoor applications tilting is
usually not needed (as a wide beamwidth is recommended here).
In addition to the system level requirements at 900 MHz (see Table
3.3), other frequency bands’ data are similar, with the exception of
antenna gains (that can vary).
3.1.5 
Base station antenna installations
When a base station antenna location is selected various issues have to
be taken into account:
• 
Height
• 
Obstacles next to the antenna
• 
Backlobe
• 
Coupling.
These factors have a direct influence on radio propagation and thus on the
quality of the radio network. Antenna height is a very critical parameter as
it has the strongest influence on the coverage prediction results which
Team LRN

54        RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
furthermore influence frequency planning. The antenna height also
influences the coverage prediction models which typically function either
in the macrocellular or in the microcellular propagation environment.
Moreover, the area around the antenna should be free of obstacles (at least
for 50–100 m) in order to be able to use the radio propagation prediction
models and to trust the prediction results. The actual antenna height
should always be measured and documented carefully. All of a base
stations antennas should also be installed at a consistent height, as far as
possible, as this influences the radio propagation and also has an effect on
the frequency reuse and therefore on the maximum capacity in the radio
network (see Chapters 6 and 7).
In planning, antenna backlobes can be avoided by installing antennas
to exterior building walls and by using tilting, especially in urban areas
where the base stations interfere with each other. Antenna coupling should
also be considered if polarisation diversity or duplex filters are not applied
and more than one base station antenna is used (for example, space
diversity in rural areas). Transmitting and receiving antennas cannot be
installed too close to each other in order to get sufficient attenuation. It is
very important to get updated installation instructions from the base
station antenna suppliers because these installation instructions vary
significantly depending on the antenna elements (dipoles or patches) and
the separation may vary, e.g. from 0.lm to 1.5m in the horizontal
direction (less typical in the vertical direction) in order to achieve for
example 30 dB isolation. Polarisation diversity and duplex filters are
typically manufactured with an isolation of 30 dB between the
transmitting and receiving branches that is sufficient for GSM.
3.1.6 
Mobile station antennas
Mobile station antennas are typically omnidirectional or 180° (not
radiating towards a head) in the horizontal plane and very wide in the
vertical plane. Antenna gain is assumed to be 0 dBi because mobile
antennas are very small and because the power budget has to be calculated
by taking into account all antennas in the field. If some external antennas
are used, as in vehicle installations, antenna gain could be included if
needed.

3.1.7 
Base station cables and connectors
The base station antenna line also includes cables and connectors
between the antenna and base station. Cables can be thin (jumpers) with a
high attenuation loss, or thick (1 5/8") with quite a low attenuation. The
attenuation of typical cables 1/2" or 7/8" at 100m (at 900 MHz and
1800 MHz) are presented in Table 3.4, and Table 3.5 presents losses more
precisely at 900 MHz.
The number of cables can be reduced by connecting the transmitting
and receiving branches by using a duplex filter and in multi band cases the
frequency bands can be connected by using diplexers. Both duplexers and
Team LRN

56          RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
diplexers cause less than 1.0 dB loss, including connector loss in both
directions.
3.1.8 
Mobile station cables and connectors
Mobile station cable and connector losses are typically assumed to be
0 dB. If some external antennas and cables are used, as in vehicle
installations, some cable loss could be included in the power budget if
needed.
3.2 
Power budget and accessory elements
3.2.1 
Power budget balance
The power budget in Figure 3.2 was not balanced and permitted
accessory elements are needed for the uplink direction to increase the path
loss. When the low noise amplifier (LNA) and diversity reception are
added to the power budget the result can be seen in Figure 3.3. The
depolarisation loss is also included in the power budget in order to take
into account the possibility to use polarisation diversity. Figure 3.3 shows
that the uplink direction is a little better than the downlink direction if the
values 4 dB and 5 dB are used for the diversity reception and low noise
amplifier, respectively. It has to be remembered that diversity gain
depends on the radio propagation environment and base station antenna
configuration.
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
57
3.2.1.1 Low noise amplifiers
Cable losses may cause limitations in the power budgets in the uplink
direction, especially if cables longer than 75 m are used (as can be seen in
Table 3.5). This is common in rural areas where 100–120 m masts are
needed to maximise the coverage area. The uplink direction can be
improved by introducing a low noise amplifier (LNA, also called a mast
head pre-amplifier MHPA, or tower-mounted pre-amplifier TMPA, or
Team LRN

58         RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
tower top amplifier TTA) next to the receiving antenna. The LNA has to
have a low noise figure in order to improve the received field strength
level at the base station receiving end. The improvement at reception can
be studied by using the formula for calculating the noise figures for the
whole antenna line from the receiving antenna to the BTS receiver (see
Figure 3.4).
The formula for cascade amplifiers can be written as:[5]
where        is the LNA’s noise figure and                     are the noise figures of
the other antenna line elements and correspondingly 
is the LNA’s gain
and 
are the gains of the other antenna line elements. It can be
seen that the LNA’s noise figure and gain are important parameters when
analysing the LNA’s performance. Regarding the optimised values for
noise figure and gain, Equation 3.1 clearly shows that the lower the
LNA’s noise figure the lower the system’s noise figure. Thus, the first
target is to have as low a noise figure for the amplifier as possible: typical
values are around 1.5dB, which is almost the minimum value. If, for
example, an extra cooling system is introduced it is even possible to have
values below 1.0 dB. When the LNA’s and BTS’s noise figures are known
it is also possible to calculate the maximum improvement that LNA can
provide for the antenna line. This improvement can be written as
max improvement = cable loss + (BTS noise figure – LNA noise figure)
where max improvement gives the maximal improvement that can be
gained and depends, not surprisingly, on the LNA’s gain.
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
  59
We can calculate the optimised gain for the LNA:
• 
Assume LNA has the noise figure = 1.5 dB and the gain is 14 dB or
21 dB;
• 
additionally, the BTS noise figure is 5.0 dB,
• 
thus, the maximum extra gain after the cable loss reduction is
5.0 –1.5 = 3.5 dB.
Equation 3.1 gives the improvements of the system noise figure (the
noise figure for the whole antenna line) and the results are presented in
Table 3.6.
Table 3.6 shows the benefit of the different LNA types when the BTS
noise figure is 5 dB. It can be noted that the gain of 14 dB is enough to
almost achieve the maximum advantage when typical cable loss 2–4 dB is
considered. The LNA of 21 dB gain and 1.5 dB noise figure gives more
than 1.0 dB extra gain if the cable loss is more than 5,0 dB. However, in
radio planning such a high cable loss should be avoided and in
extraordinary situations (as these) a downlink booster is often required.
The LNA also has an effect on the performance of diversity reception
because it depends on the received signal levels of the main and diversity
branches. The signals of the main and diversity branches should be
received at an equal level and thus the LNA should be installed to both
receiving branches (if used with the diversity reception).
3.2.1.2 Diversity reception at the base station receiving end
Diversity or multiple reception is required at the base station end
because of the signal level, location probability and grade-of-service
(GOS) deterioration in a radio propagation channel due to fast fading (see
Figure 1.11). The fast fading contains fading dips of up to 30 dB
Team LRN

60          RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
corresponding to Rayleigh distribution in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal
paths.[6-7] Moreover, the received signal level is Rice distributed, in a
line-of-sight (LOS) path. The fast fading dips can be reduced by receiving
multiple uncorrelated signals (diversity reception) at the same or delayed
time at the base (and/or mobile) station receiving end. When the better
received signal level is chosen, the average received signal level (see
Figure 1.11), location probability and base station service area can be
increased.
Different diversity reception schemes are based on a technique to
provide uncorrelated signals. Traditionally, the base station receiving
antenna arrays are spatially separated in the horizontal, vertical or
compound direction and this technique is called a space diversity scheme.
The base station antenna array separation causes different multipath
lengths between the mobile station and base station and thus it provides a
phase difference at the base station receiving end to obtain uncorrelated
signals. These uncorrelated signals can also be provided by separating
only two antenna elements. In the polarisation diversity technique the
signals are received by using two orthogonal polarisations (e.g. horizontal
and vertical, or 
slanted polarisations) at reception. Beam diversity
techniques—jitter, switched pattern and multi state phase diversities—are
based on the modified antenna radiation patterns.
Moreover, the
uncorrelated signals can also be provided by using different frequencies or
by receiving the signals at different times (delaying the diversity
reception). It can be concluded that each diversity scheme contains a
different technique to provide uncorrelated signals;
• 
receiving antenna array separation
• 
orthogonal polarisations
• 
individual radiation patterns
• 
frequency difference
• 
time delay.
In addition, all these diversity techniques can be applied either at the
base station or at the mobile station end. However, only space,
polarisation and beam diversities at the base station receiving end are the
primarily diversity schemes because these diversity techniques have no
primary system requirements (minimum frequency band, maximum time
delay at the base station end).

3.2.1.3 Diversity reception and radio propagation environment
The performance, that is, the improvement of the signal (or actually
bit-error-rate at a certain field strength level) of different diversity
techniques, depends finally on the environment (three major classes)—
urban, suburban and rural—and two special classes—microcellular and
indoor. 
The 
different 
propagation 
environments 
have 
different
propagation characteristics thus the performance of the diversity reception
differs. Moreover, the performance of the diversity reception is actually
equivalent in all environments if uncorrelated signals can be provided.
The problem is that a large antenna configuration is required in order to
obtain uncorrelated signals, for example, in the space diversity in rural
areas.
3.2.1.4 Performance of deployed diversity techniques
Space diversity schemes
The performance of the space diversity scheme depends strongly on
the separation of the receiving antennas in the different environments. If
the separation is sufficient uncorrelated signals can be provided and the
diversity gain of 5 dB can be obtained in all environments. The required
separation 
is 
very small 
in 
indoor 
and 
microcellular
environments, [8] and thus a very compact antenna configuration can be
utilised to provide 5 dB gain. In urban and suburban macro base stations
separation of 
is enough to provide the equal gain.[9] The problem
environment is the rural, where more than 
separation is needed,
which is too large an antenna configuration. However, if two space
diversity antennas are used next to each other in the rural environment, the
“combining gain” of 3 dB can be guaranteed if the maximal ratio
combining is used. The combining gain means that the signal is received
twice at the same phase and at the same level. This is the case in the space
diversity scheme if the same antennas are used at both receiving branches
and these antennas are close to each other.
Polarisation diversity schemes
Cross polarisation discrimination (XPD) depends strongly on the
environment and determines the final polarisation diversity gain as the
signal cross-correlation of the different polarisation diversity schemes are
always clearly less than 0.5 in LOS and NLOS environments.[8] Low
Team LRN

62          RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
XPD values (< 7 dB) can be achieved in the NLOS path in urban,
suburban, microcellular and indoor environments where there are multiple
reflections from different surfaces. In the rural area and in LOS paths one
polarisation easily dominates and XPD values are 10–15 dB, thus
reducing the diversity gain. The maximum diversity gains of 5–6 dB at
900 MHz and 1800 MHz have been measured in urban, suburban,
microcellular and indoor areas when 
slanted polarisations are used
at the base station end. [8] This polarisation diversity scheme performs
equally with the horizontal space diversity scheme of 
separation
between the receiving antennas. When the horizontal and vertical
polarisations are applied at the base station end at 900 MHz and
1800MHz, the diversity gain is approximately 1 dB worse than the
horizontal space diversity of 
separation.[8] Thus, a good
performance in NLOS built-up areas can be achieved by applying
polarisations at reception. The polarisation diversity gain is also
approximately 1 dB lower at 900 MHz compared with the results at
1800MHz. The results of the diversity measurement campaigns,[8] are
gathered in Table 3.7. Finally, it has to be remembered that a
depolarisation loss in the uplink direction is included in the power budget
in Figure 3.3. This depolarisation loss refers to the attenuation whether the
vertical or slanted linear polarisation is used.
3.2.2 
Power budget maximizing
The power budget in Figure 3.3 was balanced by using a low noise
amplifier (LNA) and diversity reception. Now we turn to maximise the
allowed path loss and include the required margins to the power budget.
Figure 3.5 shows an example of the maximum power budget for the
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
 
 
 
 
     63
GSM900 system when all available equipment are utilised. The path loss
in Figure 3.5 is 11 dB better compared to the path loss in the basic power
budget in Figure 3.2. The path loss is improved in Figure 3.5 by using a
power amplifier (PA) in the downlink direction (a higher transmission
power could also be used at the base station) and by using a minimum
value for the base station sensitivity level.
3.2.2.1 Downlink boosters and power amplifiers
In the early days of the GSM the radio link budget was typically limited
by the uplink direction because the base station sensitivities were quite
poor, compared to current products, and low noise amplifiers had high
noise figures. Nowadays, new base station, diversity antenna and low noise
amplifier products have shifted the radio link imbalance to the downlink
direction. Thus, operators and equipment manufacturers have also started
to focus on improving the downlink transmission power which can be done
by increasing the base station transmission power or by reducing all the
losses prior to the transmission antenna. In this context the first
configuration is called an actual “booster” and it is co-located with the base
station (the booster is typically implemented before the combiner) as
shown in Figure 3.6. Moreover, the second configuration is called a
“power amplifier” (PA) because this type of amplifier is installed next to
the transmission antenna (see Figure 3.6). In the booster configuration the
maximum output power is limited by the size of the booster. Base station
equipment cannot be too large or take up too much space, due to site rental
and installation costs and difficulties. Thus, the maximum power following
the booster is a practical consideration and if the cable and other losses are
not too high this booster configuration is satisfactory. However, the power
amplifier gives flexibility in the downlink direction because even very high
cable losses can be reduced in the downlink direction. Figure 3.6 shows
that the power amplifier improves the downlink direction if the cable loss
is larger than 3 dB (45–42 dBm, Figure 3.6) even if the booster is applied.
It has to be noted that the utilisation of the power amplifier depends
strongly on the base station configuration and on the cable length. If the
power amplifier is used the booster is not needed.
Team LRN

64       RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
In order to realise the actual need for both these booster types a critical
analyse of the power budget is needed, by taking into account the
environment and establishing the configurations where boosters can
improve the path loss. Figure 3.5 presented the power budget where the
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget                                     65
uplink direction is very good but also realistic and valid. This power
budget shows that the booster is required in order to balance the path loss.
It also has to be noted that only 3 dB cable loss is used in this calculation
that means an additional 3 dB improvement by a power amplifier can be
achieved in the downlink direction if the cable loss increases from 3 dB to
6 dB.
3.2.2.2 Frequency hopping and power budget
Frequency hopping is a function that enables the use of a pool of
frequencies which are used in turn to decrease the co-channel interference
and to improve the carrier-to-noise (C/N) or carrier-to-interference (C/I)
ratio. Frequency hopping is thus used to decrease interference that
corresponds to an increase of frequency reuse and that is called
interference diversity (a capacity related function, see Chapter 6.3.2.2).
Frequency hopping is also used to improve the received signal level
against fading in a radio propagation channel, called frequency diversity.
At least two different frequency channels are required to be assigned to
one base station in order to apply frequency diversity. The frequency
diversity related improvement at the base station receiving end is called
frequency diversity gain and it depends on the separation between two
different frequency channels. This separation is called a coherence
bandwidth and occurs when two different frequency channels provide
uncorrelated signals (recall Chapter 1). The required coherence bandwidth
is related to the environment: frequencies can be closer to each other in
macrocellular environments than in microcellular or indoor environments
to provide equal low correlation. The separation of 5–10MHz,[10] is
required in indoor locations to obtain signals of 0.7 correlation. These
results are based on the measured values and tell that frequency diversity
Team LRN

66         RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
is available but the applicability is very low in indoor and microcellular
locations because such a high frequency band is required to achieve the
gain. Mobile operators have, typically, approximately 10 MHz frequency
band at their disposal and thus this frequency diversity would be very
difficult to realise. However, other studies have also been done and it is
reported, for example,[11] that a reasonable improvement in an urban
macrocellular environment can be achieved when the adjacent channels
are already used. These results are based on GSM channel simulation
application. These simulated results are, of course, only for the theoretical
observation because the adjacent channels cannot be used in the same
cells in the GSM system.
A final example of how frequency diversity is quite different
compared to the other diversity methods; speed. After 
the
frequency diversity disappears because the hopping rate in the GSM is not
fast enough to achieve some diversity gain.[12] Moreover, when the
mobile station is not moving, frequency hopping makes the radio
propagation channel appear to move and it could be said that in the case of
frequency hopping the mobile station is always moving—either truly or
virtually.
3.2.2.3 Single and multi band antenna line configurations
An understanding of the radio propagation and power budget is the key
to having a successful, cost-efficient and high quality single or multi band
base station antenna line configuration. The configuration work starts
from the analysis of the radio propagation which has a direct influence on
the base station coverage area. It was previously mentioned and will later
be explained in detail (in Chapter 4), that coverage areas are totally
different in macro base stations at 450 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800MHz and
2100 MHz frequency bands. Thus, there are two possible aims:
• 
to have equal coverage areas for all the frequency bands
• 
to have a continuous coverage area for one frequency band
with only hot spot coverage areas for the other frequency
bands (see Figure 3.7).
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
   67
In the continuous coverage case, first, the base station sites for these
different frequency bands should not necessarily be co-located in order to
optimise coverage. Second, the base station antennas should be installed
at different heights if the equal coverage area is required for all frequency
bands and if these different frequency bands are used at the same base
station site and they all have almost equal path loss in the power budget
(as is typical in GSM). The path losses for the different frequency bands
can also be modified so that the coverage areas are equal when using the
same antenna height for all frequencies. However, the coverage area
defines whether the same antenna height and location can be utilised for
the different frequency bands. If the coverage areas can be different for
the different frequency bands then co-located multi band antennas can be
considered.
When the coverage areas for the different frequency bands are agreed,
the power calculations have to be checked next in order to decide the
antenna line configuration. The single band antenna line is always similar
and the power budget calculations only define which equipment is
implemented. The maximally equipped single band antenna line for the
downlink and uplink directions is finally presented in Figure 3.8.
Team LRN

68           RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
In the multi band configurations there are more alternatives to select
and thus more detailed configuration planning is required. Equipment like
diplexers, low noise amplifiers and diversity reception defines the
integration of these different elements. Figure 3.9 shows equipment
typically used in the downlink and uplink directions. It can be seen that
diplexers are installed after the low noise amplifiers, excluding the usage
of integrated dual band antennas and diplexers. Correspondingly, if the
low noise amplifiers are not required at 900/1800 MHz the diplexer could
be installed next to the antenna. Moreover, if the low noise amplifier is
needed only at one frequency band (900 MHz or 1800MHz) the
configuration does not change because the frequencies cannot be
combined before the amplifier. This analysis recommends the use of
integrated elements containing multi band and dual polarised antennas and
low noise amplifiers as well as diplexers, if possible. Thus, the main
concern in the antenna line is to understand that the diplexer location
depends on the low noise amplifier. When power amplifier is needed in
the downlink direction the configuration will be more complex.
3.2.2.4 Duplex and diplex filter losses
Duplex  filters are used just before the base station antenna connector to
combine the main transmitting (TX) and receiving (RX) branches in order
to connect the base station and the base station antenna by using only one
cable. Thus, one cable, one antenna and the installation can be saved.
Duplexers typically cause less than 1.0 dB additional loss together with
the connectors in the uplink and downlink directions.
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
69
Diplex filters are used just before the base station antenna connector
and base station antenna (see Figure 3.9) to combine two transmitting
(TX), receiving (RX) or combined TX/RX branches at different frequency
bands in order to connect the base station and the base station antenna by
using only one cable for each of them. Thus, one cable, one antenna, one
diplexer and the installation is required for the dual/multi band TX, RX or
TX/RX. Diplexers also typically cause less than 1.0 dB additional loss
together with the connectors in the uplink and downlink directions.
3.2.2.5 Power budget margins
The power budget in Figure 3.5 contains one margin called
interference degradation margin which is not the only margin in the radio
coverage planning. In the power budget calculations the maximum
allowed path loss is determined based on the base station transmitting
peak power that is one parameter for the actual coverage prediction. The
coverage prediction is made by using the software tools and the coverage
area can be solved when the coverage threshold is determined. The
coverage threshold can be determined by starting from the MS sensitivity
(when the coverage prediction is done in the downlink direction) and by
adding different margins to this value
Coverage threshold downlink = MS sensitivity + margins.
Thus, the final allowed path loss between base station and mobile station
is much lower when all other margins are taken into account.
Team LRN

70         RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The value of 3 dB for the uplink and downlink for this interference
degradation margin is recommended. [13] However, the explanation as to
why this value is used is more or less inadequate. After several
discussions with very experienced GSM engineers there can be several
different and inaccurate explanations found for this margin. Two of these
explanations are presented for consideration, though they may not be the
right ones they are logical and intelligible.
It has been explained that the interference degrade margin is required
because of the multiuser interference situations. This means that there are
two different signals which cause interference (I) to the serving carrier (C)
at a certain location, see Figure 3.10. When calculating the total C/I value
the interference components 
and 
have to be added together in order to
get the cumulative interference level 
If the interference
components    and     are received at the same phase and their received
levels are equal the total interference level 
is increased 3 dB.
Thus, the total interference level (I) can be written
and the interference degradation margin value
3 dB is defined based on these two interference case where interfering
signals have the same phase and equal level at reception.
The second explanation is almost the same as the first but only one
interference exists and it is counted with noise (the interference 
 in
Figure 3.10 is replaced by the noise).
As a conclusion it can be noted that this margin is not needed in the
interference free areas (rural and urban areas). If there is still a willingness
Team LRN

Configuration Planning and Power Budget 
  71
to use this margin it could at least be reduced down to 1 dB (as in the
power budget in Figure 3.5) because the 3 dB situation is very theoretical.
3.3 
Coverage and capacity optimized configurations
Having introduced the radio parameters that have a significant effect
on the path loss between the base station and mobile station, it is still to be
concluded which of these parameters are really required in the coverage
and capacity driven configurations in order to manage calculation of the
correct path loss for the coverage or capacity base stations. Table 3.8
shows the coverage maximized (only 1 frequency) and capacity
maximized
base station site configurations.
It can be noted that the base station configurations are quite different
for the coverage and capacity needs. Hence, good configuration planning
must be made for each area and for each purpose.
In this configuration planning the network evolution also has to be
remembered because the power budget can be maximized, for example,
by using power amplifiers. Recall that power amplifiers are frequency
selective (only one frequency can be transmitted) and thus the capacity
cannot be easily increased. However, the base station can be extended
from the one TRX configuration to two TRX by using polarisation
diversity antenna and transmitting the first TRX by using the first
polarisation and transmitting the second TRX by using the second
polarisation (different transmission polarisations represent different actual
antenna lines). Power amplifiers can also be utilised (one per TRX) and
the coverage area can be maximized. This is evolution planning that is
really needed for long term cost efficient configurations.

Conclusions
Configuration planning and power budget has a great effect on
coverage planning and many links to capacity and frequency planning.
These links between the configuration planning and capacity/frequency
planning influence the total radio network configuration. Capacity related
issues like capacity functionality (frequency hopping) or the base station
configuration (number of TRXs versus need of combiner) have a direct
influence on the base station site configuration and thus on the base
station coverage radius. Table 3.9 reviews configuration planning for
maximising base station coverage area at a minimum cost.

COVERAGE PLANNING CRITERIA
4.1 
Location probabilities and fading margins
The characteristics of a radio path, the environment, the behaviour of
the users, the weather, etc. cause uncertainty when receiving radio signal.
In commercial radio networks the aim is not usually to achieve the
maximum performance but to guarantee a certain quality of service with
high probability. The objective in commercial radio networks is to
optimise performance from the end-user’s point of view and the revenue
of the network. This means that time and location probabilities for the
network must be high enough to ensure customer satisfaction.
Quality of radio coverage in a mobile network is usually measured as
location probability and time probability. Location probability defines the
probability in which the field strength is above a sensitivity level in the
target area. A location probability of 50 percent corresponds to the
situation in which the average field strength equals the sensitivity of a
receiver over a certain geographical area. Of course, the desired
probability is usually higher than 50 percent, that is, the field strength
should be higher than the sensitivity of a receiver. Time probability is
defined over a longer period to account for phenomena in which field
strength is not constant. For example, leaves in trees can lower field
strength at street level during summer time and when winter comes the
average field strength increases. Also, weather (for example rain) can
cause a fluctuation in field strength and these changes can be quite
remarkable. Because time probability is even more difficult to measure
and predict than location probability it is usually taken into account by
choosing tighter thresholds; sometimes it is not considered at all.
However, location and time probabilities are among of the most important
variables in coverage planning.
4.1.1 
Slow (log-normal) fading and standard deviation
When trying to build good coverage in built-up areas the challenge is
the fact that mobile antennas are usually well below the height of
surrounding buildings, and there is no line of sight path between the base
station and the mobile station. This means that propagation happens

mainly by reflections from the surfaces of the buildings and by diffraction
over and around them. Figure 4.1 illustrates some possible mechanisms of
propagation in an urban area.
Slow fading, often called shadowing, is caused by the mobile moving
into the shadow of hills, trees or buildings. There is no satisfactory model
for slow fading, but according to various measurements the mean path
loss closely follows a log-normal distribution. Therefore slow fading is
sometimes called log-normal fading.[1]
The slow fading describes the variations of the average signal strength
due to obstacles on the signal path. Of course, the term “average signal
strength” is used here with a special meaning. The correct term would be
“sliding average of signal.” The fast fading component in a signal can be
extracted by using an average window of thirty-two wave length.[1] If
using the sliding average window, the result is a signal not having a fast
fading component but including the shadowing effect. It is reported that a
signal where fast fading is filtered follows log-normal distribution. If the
slow fading signal is expressed in decibels the distribution of the signal
follows normal distribution. Therefore, the slow fading signal can be
presented with a normal distribution as shown in the following equation.
In Equation 4.1 x is the random variable (here the slow fading signal),
is the mean value of x and    is the standard deviation of x. The value of
standard deviation 
depends on the environment close to the receiver.
Team LRN

78         RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The standard deviation for the log-normal fading in urban areas is stated
to be around 8 dB.[1]
When measuring the signal strength without fast fading (averaged
signal) at the given distance, the values are concentrated close to the mean
value 
Values follow log-normal distribution. Following the definition
for standard deviation approximately 68 percent of samples fall between
The following example is a representation of the idea.
Example 1
The average field strength at the given distance is –82 dBm. Let
us assume that 
 is 8 dB.
Approximately 68 percent of samples fall between –90 dBm and
–74 dBm.
Example 1 indicates that 68 percent of the signal strength samples fall
in the range between 
around the mean value 
Of course, if field
strength is measured in a certain area 
and 
can be determined.
4.1.2 
Slow fading margin
When the distribution of field strength is defined the next step is to
determine the slow fading margin. When planning coverage for a mobile
network, one quality target is location probability of coverage. This means
that field strength must be better than the given threshold with some
probability. As discussed earlier field strength fluctuates due to the
shadowing effect—sometimes a signal level is above average but
sometimes below the average. To guarantee a certain minimum signal
level in a radio network we have to introduce a margin against slow
fading. This margin is called a slow fading margin. We will continue
Example 1 to determine a slow fading margin.
Team LRN

Coverage Planning Criteria 
 79
Example 2
In Example 1 the following situation was presented. The mean
value of the signal is –82 dBm. If the standard deviation of the
signal is 8 dB, approximately 68 percent of the samples fall
between –90 dBm and –74 dBm.
If the sensitivity of a mobile phone is –100 dBm we can calculate
the probability for the situation in which the field strength is
below -100 dBm.
As it can been seen in the equation above the probability for the
situation in which the received power is below –100 dBm is
approximately 1.2 percent or the location probability at the given
distance is 98.8 percent (100 percent - 1.2 percent).
Slow fading margin can be seen as a way to improve probability of
having a high enough signal level. If we accept that there is a 50 percent
probability that the signal level is below the sensitivity level, that is, there
is no need for a slow fading margin, then the average signal level can
remain at –100 dBm. Of course, 50 percent probability in a commercial
network is far too low. In Example 2 we have increased the probability
from 50 percent to 99 percent by introducing a slow fading margin of
18 dB. Slow fading margin depends on the location probability as shown
in Figure 4.2.
Team LRN

80         RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
In Figure 4.2, the slow fading margin:
• 
is negative if location probability is below 50 percent,
• 
grows towards infinity when location probability grows close
to 100 percent,
• 
is 0 dB if location probability is 50 percent.
The previous calculation applies for the locations on the cell edge. In
radio networks location probability and slow fading marginal are
calculated over the entire cell. This changes the approach because the
signal level usually becomes stronger closer to the transmitter, requiring
clarification of the relationship between area location probability and
point location probability.
4.1.3 
Point location probability
Having shown that the slow fading margin is 0 dB when the point
location probability is 50 percent. If better better location probability is
required a higher slow fading margin is applied. This is described in
Figure 4.3 where the smaller circle is decreased cell size due to a slow
fading margin of 5.1 dB.
Team LRN

Coverage Planning Criteria 
 81
If point location probability on cell edge, 
increases from 50 percent
to 74 percent then slow fading margin increases from 0 dB to 5.1 dB
(when 
is 8 dB) and therefore the cell range gets shorter.
4.1.3.1 Area location probability
Outdoor location probability is a parameter that describes the
probability that the received signal strength exceeds the minimum needed
signal strength at the receiver in order to make a successful phone call
outdoors. Point location probability can be converted to area location
probability which means that probability of coverage is calculated over
the cell.

by Equation 4.4 probability 
can be presented as

area can be calculated. The difference between location probability on the
cell edge (point location probability) and area location probability can be
seen in Figure 4.4.

Slow fading margins for stardard deviations of 6 dB, 7 dB and 8 dB
are presented in Table 4.1.
Team LRN

84        RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Indoor location probability
Indoor coverage location probability describes the probability that the
received signal strength exceeds the minimum needed signal strength at
the receiver inside buildings. The principle of calculation is very similar to
outdoor. The differences between these two location probability
calculations are
• 
when calculating indoor location
probability standard
deviation is replaced by standard deviation of signal measured
indoors,
• 
average building penetration loss is added to the calculated
slow fading margin.
Because standard deviation of signal indoors is higher than standard
deviation outdoors the slow fading margin is higher. Indoor building
penetration loss should also be added which results in much higher slow
fading margins.
4.1.4 
Multiple server location probability
A radio network consists of several base stations. In some locations
there may be more than one server that can provide good coverage. For
the previous calculations the key assumption was a single, isolated cell.
However, if there are several cells providing coverage in an area the
probability for having high enough field strength increases. The situation
is illustrated in Figure 4.5.
Team LRN

Coverage Planning Criteria 
  85
Assuming there are two cells providing coverage in the target area, at
the cell edge both cells are providing 50 percent location probability (50
percent probability that field strength is above or below the given
threshold). Furthermore, if assuming that the signal from the cells are
uncorrelated a joint probability could be calculated as:
In Equation 4.9 A is point location probability of cell a and B is the
point location probabilities of cell b. For example if point location
probability is 50 percent for both cells (slow fading margin is 0 dB) the
two-server coverage location probability at the cell edges is
As Equation 4.10 shows the location probability increases from 50
percent to 75 percent if there are two servers having an equal signal level
at the point under study and the signals from the cells are uncorrelated.
The method presented shows the principle of multiple server location
probability. Calculation of location probability over the network is quite
complicated. First, propagation should be known, as the slope affects the
location probability. Second, network layout partly determines how
smooth coverage is. Finally, real radio environments make calculation
almost impossible. Although, it is nearly impossible to calculate multiple
server location probability in a live network it can be calculated for
theoretical cases. In Figure 4.6 point location probability is calculated as a
function of single cell location probability for two-server and three-server
cases. Note that it is assumed that correlations between the signals from
the neighbours are zero. This assumption may be difficult to fulfill in live
radio networks.
Team LRN

86            RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
As can be seen from Figure 4.6 the multiple server coverage location
probability approaches the value of 100 percent logarithmically as the
single cell area location probability increases. In GSM the full benefit of
multiple servers cannot be utilised due to slow handover procedures
through some gain can be expected. In CDMA soft handover enables
utilisation of the full gain.
4.2 
Building and vehicle penetration
Building penetration loss is loss due to roofs, walls and floors.
Building penetration loss varies according to building type. When indoor
coverage is important, the average building penetration loss and standard
deviation indoors should be known to calculate corresponding slow fading
margins. If measurement results are not available the values can be
estimated, for example, according to the ETSI GSM recommendation
03.30 in which building penetration loss in urban areas is estimated to be
15–18 dB and in rural areas 10 dB depending on the frequency used. [4]
For standard deviation indoors default values of 9–11 dB can be used. It
should be noted that some studies have shown that the average penetration
loss for some types of building decrease when the frequency is increased,
e.g. from 900 MHz to 1800 MHz.
Team LRN

Coverage Planning Criteria 
87
Building penetration loss varies due to the effect of the following
conditions:
• 
Different types of outside wall construction
• 
Changes in floor elevation
• 
Propagation environment near the building
• 
Different percentage of window areas in the outside walls
• 
Different building orientations with respect to the direction of
antenna illumination
• 
Different types of window treatment used to reflect sunlight
and heat.
Building penetration loss can be verified with a measurement
campaign. However, to get statistically reliable results the number of
measured building should be remarkable. Of course buildings can be
classified according to size, material, usage, etc. and measurements can be
concentrated to the most predominant ones.
To avoid fast fading the measurement locations should be planned so
that at least thirty-two samples can be collected within 
A local
average with thirty-two samples is used to eliminate the fast fading effect
due to multipath propagation. To obtain a reference signal level for
building penetration loss, measurements along the outside perimeter of the
buildings should be made at street level (MS antenna height 1.5m).
Building penetration loss for a given floor area is defined to be the decibel
difference between the average of the indoor measurements and the
average of measurements measured at street level (see Table 4.2).
In practical radio planning, building penetration loss is an important
parameter in predicting radio coverage. This parameter is used to
determine the coverage threshold and the indoor coverage cell range with
a certain probability. If the aim is to have very good coverage in lower
Team LRN

88 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
floors the planning threshold must be higher than when compared to cases
where the important floors are higher.
Vehicle penetration is similar to building penetration in radio network
planning. The margin car penetration loss is needed to compensate the
loss due to the bodywork of a car. The loss depends on the materials used
in its manufacture. The smallest losses are achieved if the body is made of
plastic. Car penetration losses vary typically between 5 to 15 dB.
4.3 
Other losses and margins
In addition to the slow fading margin and building penetration losses
there are several margins that are used to ensure proper coverage. The
usage of these margins must be considered case by case;
• 
body loss
• 
antenna orientation loss
• 
polarisation loss
• 
additional fast fading margin
• 
interference degradation margin.
Body loss or body proximity loss affects both uplink and downlink. A
human body near the mobile antenna affects the radiation pattern of the
MS antenna. The loss measured against the best direction depends on the
MS antenna type, location of the antenna and frequency. For planning
purposes the loss of 4–6 dB could be used. However, in the worst
direction the loss can be well over 10 dB.
In GSM sensitivity is measured in static, TU50, HT100 and RA250
fading profiles (900 MHz).[5] If planning cells for other environments it is
possible to optimise sensitivity figures. Usually only done for a
microcellular environment, where the speed of a mobile is slow and
propagation suffers from fast fading. This can be taken into account by
introducing an additional fast fading margin to correct the sensitivity
figure determined from GSM recommendations.
An 
interference degradation 
margin 
is 
mentioned 
in 
GSM
recommendations, and is used in cases where interference starts to
increase above background noise and thus reduces the coverage area of
cells. Sometimes this margin is also used for man-made interference.

4.4 
Radio planning parameters in a network planning
system
Radio link power budget deals mainly with the performance of radio
hardware but includes some aspects of environment. Common
environment related parameters are sensitivity and diversity gain (recall
Chapter 3).
4.4.1 
Power budget parameters
When planning coverage all of the details in a radio link power budget
can be covered by two factors
• 
equivalent isotropic radiation power (EIRP)
• 
radiation pattern of base station antenna.
All common propagation models work in the downlink direction which
means that a base station has a certain EIRP and transmitting antenna. If
uplink is much weaker than downlink this method may lead to a situation
in which downlink is fulfilling the planning criteria but uplink is suffering
bad quality. To avoid this the downlink direction must be adjusted
according to uplink performance. This is called balancing.
When entering data into a planning system only the downlink values
are normally used. There are two important tasks in entering values. First,
the antenna must be selected correctly. If the wrong radiation pattern is
used, coverage prediction will give the wrong results and this causes
problems in capacity planning, frequency planning, etc. After selecting the
antenna the EIRP of the base station has to be set. This can be done by
setting TX power, gains and losses in a way that the EIRP is achieved.
4.4.2 
Thresholds
Coverage thresholds in network planning systems are usually
presented with different colours. These thresholds are calculated based on
slow fading margins, building penetration losses and vehicle penetration
losses. Table 4.3 shows how planning thresholds are defined for different
coverage targets. In indoor cases both building penetration loss (15 dB)
and slow fading margin are added to sensitivity (–100 dBm in this
example). The difference between indoor and outdoor thresholds is
18.3 dB if the target is 90 percent location probability. The difference is
greater than building penetration loss 15 dB because standard deviation in
Team LRN

90 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
the indoor case is higher (10 dB > 7 dB). This causes the increase in the
slow fading margin.
When plotting coverage in planning systems colours or grey scale
shading can be used to present different coverage areas (thresholds from
Table 4.3.) as shown in the Figure 4.7.

4.5 
Conclusions
This chapter examined coverage planning criteria. First, location
probability and slow fading margins were discussed. Usually coverage
probability is expressed with location probability; a way to improve
location probability is to introduce a margin that reduces cell range but at
the same time improves the average field strength over the cell area. This
margin is called “slow fading” because deviation of field strength is
“slow.” Second, indoor and in-car coverage were discussed and building
penetration loss was introduced. Finally, the coverage planning thresholds
were determined. Table 4.4 gathers the topics of the coverage planning
criteria.

RADIO PROPAGATION PREDICTION
Radio propagation prediction is one of the fundaments for radio
network planning. If network planning is carried out with the help of
a network planning system then coverage planning, frequency planning,
capacity planning, interference analysis, dominance analysis, handover
analysis, etc. rely on the propagation predictions. It is thus vital that radio
propagation predictions are as accurate as possible taking into account the
practical limitations. Sometimes radio propagation predictions are seen as
a necessary phase in network planning but the importance of predictions
and their influence in other phases are not well recognised.
5.1 
Elementary propagation fundamentals
There are three mutually independent propagation phenomena. Fast
fading causes rapid fluctuations in phase and amplitude of a signal if a
transmitter or receiver is moving or there are changes in the radio
environment (e.g. car passing by). If a transmitter or receiver is moving,
the fluctuations occur within a few wave lengths. Because of its short
distance fast fading is considered as small-scale fading.
Slow fading occurs due to the geometry of the path profile. This leads
to the situation in which the signal gradually gets weaker or stronger. For
example, a building near the base station causes shadowing in a relatively
small area. The diameter of the area can be tens or, to a maximum, several
hundreds of meters. Because there is fast fading on top of slow fading, a
slow faded signal is usually measured over 
This averages fast fading
and gives a slow-faded local-mean value for the signal.[1]
Large-scale attenuation depends on the path profile of the radio link.
Usually the loss is expressed as a function of antenna height, frequency
and the distance between the transmitter and receiver. Static propagation
models do not usually take into account the attenuation caused by terrain
but they express the loss. Of course, propagation models can be more
accurate if terrain data is used in prediction. The mechanisms in large-
scale attenuation are free space loss, groundwave propagation and
diffraction.
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
95
In free space, the energy of radio waves diverges over an area
proportional to the square of the propagation distance. Thus the free space
loss can be expressed as in Equation 5.1.
Equation 5.1 gives the loss in decibels. In Equation 5.1 d is distance to the
transmitter.
5.1.1 
Reflections, diffractions, absorptions
When radio waves travel over land they interact with the earth’s
surface. The received signal is a complex sum of all its components.
Equation 5.2 presents the sum of the components.
In Equation 5.2 E is the received signal, 
is theoretical field strength
for propagation in free space, 
is the reflection coefficient, 
the
complex surface wave attenuation, 
 is the phase difference between the
reflected and the direct wave and i is the imaginary number 
Equation
5.2 can be simplified if used in high frequencies because 
is
valid for most situations. This assumption can be made if using a typical
antenna height in transmitting and receiving ends. The simplified equation
is
and path loss of the presented signal is

In most cases 
where 
is height of transmitter antenna
and 
is the height of receiving antenna), the phase difference 
 can be
approximated by Equation 5.5.
Also, the reflection coefficient can be approximated by assuming that
This assumption is valid for most terrain types. If studying
propagation further from the transmitter, it can be assumed that
Then the total path loss for Equation 5.2 can be
approximated by
Equation 5.6 shows that field strength diminishes proportionately with
the inverse of the fourth power of the distance. According to experiences
in a real network the result is correct. Closer to the transmitter the direct
signal dominates the path loss and thus the slope of the signal is smaller
i.e. the decrease with the signal is less rapid.
If the direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver is
obstructed, radio waves attenuate due to diffraction. Diffraction is studied
and modelled by assuming a knife-edge obstacle is located perpendicular
to the line of sight in free space (see Figure 5.1).[2]
When calculating diffraction loss a diffraction parameter v is needed.

In Equation

terminal distances from the obstacle. The diffraction loss 
can be
approximated by
The total radio path loss where a knife-edge obstacle exists is the sum
of free space loss and diffraction loss i.e. 
Single
edge approximation is not very accurate in 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 1900
MHz bands. To improve accuracy multiple knife-edge diffraction
calculation is applied. For example, the Deygout method can be used for
up to three edges (see Figure 5.2). The procedure goes as follows.[3]
• 
Find the obstacle giving highest loss
• 
Find the other obstacles (up to two) of each sub-path and
calculate losses
• 
Calculate the total loss as a sum of all the calculated losses.
Depending on the geometry of terrain even Deygout may not give
reasonable results. In such cases some other methods must be considered.

Macro level models
The propagation models which are commonly used for macro cells are
Okumura–Hata [4] and Juul–Nyholm.[5] These models are developed by
combining propagation theory and extensive measurement campaigns.
The models take several parameters like effective antenna height, terrain
type (morphology), and terrain height (topography), frequency, EIRP, etc.
These two models are macro cell models which have limitations in terms
of frequency, calculation ranges, and base station antenna height.

The Okumura–Hata model gives loss between transmitter and
receivers by Equation 5.9.

The Okumura–Hata model has several limitations as shown;
• 
Frequency range 150–1000 MHz and 1500–2000 MHz
• 
Transmitter antenna height between 30 and 200 meters. (This
limitation is often given. However, the Okumura–Hata model
does not work well if the average building height is close or
higher than the base station antenna height.)

Juul–Nyholm
The Juul–Nyholm model predicts field strength in 
instead of
path loss in decibels. Equation 5.11 presents the propagation formula.[5]
Equation 5.11
In Equation 5.11 the following notations are used
F 
Field strength
P 
Equivalent radiated power (ERP) (W)
Coefficient (see Table 5.2)
Base station antenna height (m)
d 
Distance between mobile and base station (km).
The limitations of Juul–Nyholm are
• 
Frequency range 800–1000 MHz and 1700–2000 MHz,
• 
Transmitter antenna height between 30 and 150 m,
• 
Calculation range 1–100 km.
Juul–Nyholm is a useful model for large cells having a cell radius of
over 10 km. Contrary to the Okumara–Hata model the Juul–Nyholm
model can be tuned to predict accurately for close proximity to the base
station as well from a distance, with the help of the coefficients
There are two remarks that must be made concerning the coefficients.
First, the coefficients must be tuned separately for 1–20 km and 20–
100 km cell ranges. Second, the coefficients are frequency dependent i.e.
the coefficients must be tuned as the frequency band is changed.

5.2.3 
Antenna height
In cell range calculations the definition of the antenna height may
substantially improve the accuracy of the results. There are at least three
methods to define the effective antenna height of a base station. If the
terrain is flat then the effective antenna height is the same as the antenna
height from the ground. However, if the terrain is undulating, the selection
of the calculation method may have an impact on the results.
It is also possible to define the base station effective antenna height as
a antenna height from the ground without taking into account the terrain
height or the location of the mobile.
The method suggested by CCIR defines the effective antenna height as
a sum of the height of the base station antenna and the height difference of
the ground between the base station and the mobile station. The difference
is added only if it is positive (see Figure 5.3).[6]
Team LRN

102 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The alternative method is based on the mean height of the ray line
above the ground. The effective antenna height is twice the area between
the ray and ground profile divided by the distance. In case there are
obstructions, a straight is replaced by a series of connected rays touching
the obstructions (see Figure 5.4).[7]
5.3 
Propagation measurements and model tuning
Earlier propagation predictions were made based on static propagation
models or sets of propagation curves, and terrain data, that is morphology
or topology, were not used very effectively. Nowadays it is possible to use
computers and digital maps to enhance the predictions.
Before the digital maps and advanced propagation prediction tools can
be used, the propagation model should be tuned.
Team LRN

5.3.1 
Model tuning measurements
The outcome of model tuning measurements is data that can be used in
propagation model tuning. Usually propagation measurements are only
carried out when starting to plan a new network, if there is an area with
changes in the propagation environment, due to new buildings or roads or
if a new frequency band is taken into a use.
Model tuning measurements require a good measurement system, a
well-prepared measurement plan, and a lot of experience. The amount of
measurements depends on the resolution of the digital map and the size of
the target area. If the resolution of the digital map is very high or the
target area is large, more measurements should be carried out. An
example of measurement equipment is presented in Figure 5.5.
A laptop computer controls the measurement system, collects the
measurements and stores the results. The RF receiver collects samples of
the measured signal. The receiver should be accurate enough for the
measurements (accuracy can be improved by calibrating the receiver and
following the instructions provided by the manufacturer). Typically the
accuracy of a professional receiver is around 
. The use of mobiles
in the measurements should be considered carefully as the accuracy of a
mobile station is typically 
but with calibration the accuracy can
be improved to 
A GPS receiver is used to collect location
information. The accuracy of GPS is approximately 200–300 m due to
selective availability (SA). Recently SA was switched off and the
accuracy of GPS improved dramatically. A speed detector and compass
are used to improve accuracy in the areas where GPS is not available, as
typically with urban shadowing it is possible to lose the GPS signal, at
Team LRN

104 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
which time the speed detector and compass will help in tracking the route
until GPS is available again.
If there are the existing cells available they can be measured for model
tuning if all the relevant parameters are known. Basically this means that
EIRP, antenna type, direction and height must be known. If there are no
existing sites available or the required parameters are not known, a test
transmitter can be used instead. It should be noted that the measurement
bandwidth should be matched with the 3 dB bandwidth of the transmitted
signal. If, for example, the transmitter sends a 25 kHz CW signal, the
measurement bandwidth should be around 10 kHz to 15 kHz. If 200 kHz
signal is used (GSM) the measurement bandwidth could be, for example,
100 kHz. The exact bandwidths are not given because the receiver may
only have a few bandwidth selections available, i.e. the measurement
bandwidth cannot be tuned without steps. A block diagram of the test
transmitter is shown in Figure 5.6.
A measurement system for indoor measurements should at least have a
receiver and a computer to collect the measurement data. There are indoor
measurement systems available that are integrated with a mobile station.
Often the problem with indoor measurement is the lack of location
information. This makes it difficult to locate the measurements in the
analysing phase. The solution can be, for example, infrared transmitters
and an infrared receiver.
5.3.2 
Model tuning process
With the utilisation of a digital map, antenna pattern database and the
propagation models implemented in a planning system, the propagation
models are tuned by matching the predictions with the measured data.
Figure 5.7 presents the main steps in propagation model tuning in a
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
105
planning system. Site and cell data, a digital map and system information
(e.g. frequency) are used.
When using model tuning measurements for tuning the propagation
model, some aspects should be kept in mind. It is important that the
prediction is as accurate as possible. It is also important that the measured
signal is interference-free and the signal is measured in an area that is
neither too close nor too far from the transmitter. To ensure correct
measurements these rules should be followed:
•
measure only interference-free frequencies
•
measure only the main lobe of the transmitting antenna
•
avoid or erase line-of-sight (LOS) measurement points (if
using NLOS propagation model)
•
use differential GPS if possible or match the coordinates with
the map
• 
check coordinate conversion parameters
Team LRN

106 
  RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
• 
measure all the cable losses (both in the transmitting and
receiving end)
• 
measure the output power of the transmitter
• 
check transmitter antenna installation and ensure that there are
no obstacles nearby
• 
document the measurements carefully.
If the measured frequencies are not interference-free the field strength
will be biased; where the required signal is weak due to shadowing or fast
fading and the simultaneously interfering signal is strong. This problem
arises when measuring a live network because the frequencies are used
often. The best solution is to use a dedicated channel for the model tuning
measurements. Unfortunately this can be difficult during daytime and
therefore it may be more convenient to carry out the measurements at
night.
The radiation pattern of an antenna has a main lobe and several side
lobes. The main lobe usually has a smooth form without rapid changes in
gain. Also, in the main direction, the gain of the antenna is accurate. In
dips between the main lobe and side lobes the changes in gain are rapid.
Accuracy of the radiation pattern in these dips is poor and thus may cause
inaccuracy in the predictions. For this reason it is better to avoid
measurements in the areas that are in side lobes or in the back lobe of the
transmitting antenna.
Propagation models such as Okumura–Hata and Juul–Nyholm are
predicting field strength in non-line-of-sight. This means that they cannot
handle situations where there is a line-of-sight. During the measurements
it is often difficult to avoid line-of-sight locations, however line-of-sight
measurements can be removed after recording. Some tools can also be
used to remove line-of-sight measurements with the help of database
applications.
The location of the receiver is measured at the same time as the field
strength of the transmitter is recorded. Almost always a GPS receiver is
used to record the geographical coordinates of the receiver. GPS updates a
location once or twice a second and the coordinates are stored in the
computer. In differential GPS the GPS receiver is using a correction
which tells the receiver how it should correct the error caused by SA. The
correction can be calculated using a differential GPS receiver which is
located, for example, on the roof of a building where the known location
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
107
is entered into the receiver. When a differential GPS receiver gets the
coordinates of its own location, including the error caused by SA, it can
calculate the difference between the correct and the received location. The
difference is a vector that is sent to the GPS receiver connected to the
measurement system. In some countries differential GPS correction is sent
with the help of RDS in FM radio.
Basically all planning systems use an internal orthogonal (or X–Y)
coordinate system. It may be required to convert geographical coordinates
to an orthogonal coordinate system.
For model tuning all the losses, gains and powers must be known. If
these are not known the model tuning will give biased results. Cable
losses and output power must be measured. Antenna gains and radiation
patterns should be correct. Special attention should also be paid to the
installation of the antennae.
The documentation of measurements will help in the future in
analysing the tuning. Model tuning measurements can also be used for
various other purposes in which clear and detailed documentation aids the
usage of the measurements.
5.3.3 
Model tuning in a planning system
Model tuning is a process in which a theoretical propagation model is
tuned with the help of measured values. The models have several
parameters that can be changed according to need. The aim is to get the
predicted field strength as close as possible to the measured field strength.
5.3.3.1 Measurement import
The first task having confirmed the BS parameters is to import model
tuning measurements into the planning system. Depending on the
planning system, the measurements are linked to the existing sites and
cells by using CELL ID, BTS ID or some other identification. Manual
linking is also possible.
Model tuning starts from the selection of the propagation model. For
macro level models there are several choices but in principle almost all the
models follow the same principles. In this chapter the Okumura–Hata
Team LRN

108 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
model is used as an example, however, the process can be applied to other
models, as well.
After importing the results into the planning system the alignment with
the digital map should be checked, observant for GPS SA or inaccuracies
in the coordinate conversion parameters. In Figure 5.8 each square
represents one measurement. The measurement points line should follow
the measured road, though as can be seen, the measurement points have
shifted north.
The problem can be solved by shifting the measurements points, as the
error in GPS within a short time period is almost constant. The same
correction can be used for the entire measurement file.
5.3.3.2 Basic path loss model
Model tuning continues with selecting the model and setting the main
parameters. First, the model is selected and its common parameters are
set. Usually there are several macro level models in planning systems such
as Okumura–Hata, Walfish–Ikegami and Juul–Nyholm. The Walfish–
Ikegami model is often said to be a micro cell model but it is more
suitable for small macro cells. Of the propagation models mentioned,
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
109
there can be several correction methods applied to the basic path loss
model based on morphology, topology, street orientation, etc.
In Okumura–Hata there are several parameters that can be tuned,
however, in some planning systems not all of the parameters may be
tuneable, which may cause difficulties in some situations. Usually, in
Okumura–Hata model, the slope can be tuned by changing factor C. The
effect of C can be seen in Equation 5.12. The first three terms in loss
function are independent on the distance d. Because log(d) has a
coefficient 
by changing C the slope of the model can
be tuned. In the rural environments C is lower and in urban areas it
becomes higher. The city type environment affects the correction that is
made based on the mobile antenna height. If the mobile antenna height is
1.5 m (commonly used in network planning), the selection does not
change the correction (note that in Equation 5.12 the correction term
is left out because with the mobile antenna height 1.5 m, the mobile
antenna height correction is 0 dB). Correction D affects the effect of
antenna height. The Okumura–Hata model is suitable in cells that have
antennae installed well above roof-tops. In those cases the default value of
13.82 dB is suitable. If antennae are installed close to the average roof-top
level by changing parameter D the accuracy of predictions can be
improved even if the basic model is no longer working well.
In the Juul–Nyholm propagation model the parameters are defined
separately for the distances 1–20 km and 20–100 km. The advantage in
Juul–Nyholm is the calculation range and possibility to tune the model for
very large cells. However, when giving parameters 
for 1–20 km
and 20–100 km, it is possible to have a point of discontinuity in the
prediction at the distance of 20 km.
5.3.3.3 Morphology corrections
The correction due to morphology is the best known correction method
for the common propagation models. The result of the basic propagation
model is adjusted according to the terrain types between the mobile
station and the base station. The example shows how the correction is
usually calculated.
Team LRN

110 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Example: Morphology correction
The distance between the base station and the mobile station is 1.5 km.
On the digital map there are 30 pixels (50 m x 50 m) between the base
station and the mobile. Each pixel presents the terrain type within the
50 m x 50 m area.
The morphology correction is calculated as an average of the pixels
between the mobile station and base station. In Figure 5.9 there are 6
urban pixel, 9 suburban pixels, 4 park pixels, 6 open pixels and 5 water
pixels between the mobile and the base station. The average of the
correction factors in this example is –9.4 dB. The basic propagation
model is corrected by adding the calculated correction to the prediction
result (see 
in Equation 5.9).
In the example above there are a few remarks that must be made. The
distance between the base station and mobile was 1.5 km. It is not very
likely that the area close to the base station has a great impact on the
received power of the mobile station; the area close to the mobile are
more important for the prediction, thus there are ways to weight the area
close to the mobile station. First, the calculation distance can be shorter
than the distance between the mobile station and the base station. This
means that only the pixels close to the mobile stations are considered
when calculating the correction. If in the previous example the calculation
distance is changed from 1.5 km down to 500 m the average of the
correction factors is –14 dB. In this case the difference between the
corrections is 4.6 dB which means that the selection of the calculation
distance is important. In the example all the terrain type pixels within the
calculation distance had the same weights but the calculation distance was
changed. In the second example the pixels closer to the mobile station will
have greater impact on the correction made to the prediction because the
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
111
weights for correction factors are introduced. In Figure 5.10 the
calculation distance and weights are presented.
If the correction for the basic propagation model is calculated based on
the ‘1.0–2.0’ weights as shown in Figure 5.10 the result is –12.33 dB and
if the calculation distance is kept as 500 m (see Figure 5.11).
It is possible to adjust the calculation distance automatically cell by
cell based on the average arrival angle of the received signal and Fresnell
Team LRN

112    RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
zones. This method does not always give reliable results because of the
environment, but more often because of the resolution of the digital map.
5.3.3.4 Topographic correction
Topographic corrections in coverage predictions are usually done with
the help of the terrain height model. In many planning systems the
correction can be made even if the terrain height information is not
available by using, for example, Okumura method.[8]
Clearance Angle method can be useful in cases where, for example,
diffraction method is not working well. In clearance angle method the loss
is calculated based on the angle between the horizontal plane and the
direction of the base station antenna.[6]
The definition clearance angle is presented in Figure 5.12.
The correction is calculated based on the clearance angle. An example
of a correction function is presented in Figure 5.13 which shows that the
correction is roughly between –8 dB and 3 dB depending the clearance
angle. In some planning systems the correction curve is predefined, which
limits the usage of the clearance angle method in some cases.
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
113
Diffraction method is the last topography correction method presented
here. To calculate the loss due to diffraction it is possible to use either the
knife-edge method or Deygout method presented in 5.1.1.
5.3.3.5 Street orientation
The last correction method for the basic model is street orientation
correction (see Figure 5.14). This correction was used for the Walfish–
Ikegami model but the same correction can be applied to any other model
as well. The correction function is predefined.[9]
Team LRN

114 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
5.3.3.6 Tuning of morphology correction parameters
When some default values for the basic path loss model and
topographic correction are set it is possible to start tuning morphology
correction factors.
The aim in morphology correction factor tuning is to find such
correction factors for each morphology class that the predicted field
strength differ as little as possible from the measured field strength. There
are two measures to validate the tuning. First, the mean value of the
prediction should be the same as the mean value of the measured values.
Second, the standard deviation of the difference between the measured
and predicted values is calculated. The lower the deviation the better the
model tuning is. In the model tuning both of these measures should be
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
115
considered. If the mean value of the difference is not close to zero there is
one or several systematic errors either in the measurements or in
predictions. If the standard deviation is large the basic path loss model,
topographic correction or the correction factors for morphology correction
are wrong. This should be a sign for the next iteration round.
The goodness of tuning can be monitored in various ways. Figure 5.15
shows the measured and predicted field strengths as two separate curves.
The x axis is the number of measurement points so the window shows, for
example, how the field strength changes during the measurements. In the
example there are a few LOS measurements that should be removed
before the model tuning.
The histogram (Figure 5.16) shows the distribution of the difference
between the predicted and measured field strength. The results are good if
the mean value of the distribution is close to zero and the distribution is as
sharp as possible.
Team LRN

116 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Figure 5.17 shows the lines that are fitted to the measured points and
the predicted points. The line is fitted based on the distance (x) between
the receiver and the transmitter. The form of the line is
where the letter b presents the slope of the line.
The morphology correction is changed either semiautomatically or
manually. The semiautomatic method does not always give realistic
results and thus manual tuning is needed in order to improve the results.
Figure 5.18 shows an example of a semiautomatically tune cell.
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
117
The tuning for this cell is good because the mean value is very close to
zero. The standard deviation of the error between the predicted and
measured field strengths is also quite low. The result could be improved
further by removing the LOS measurement points because the building
database was not in use; thus there is no way to identify LOS
measurement points.
The process of model tuning can be presented with two flow charts.
First, the basic path loss model is tuned according to the process presented
in Figure 5.19.
Team LRN

118 
   RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
As Figure 5.19 shows the process is iterative. Because there are several
parameters to be tuned in the basic path loss model, the tuning takes
usually several rounds. Also, the result of the tuning is compromising
between accuracy and the resources—one can always improve the
prediction by fine-tuning the model but one has to accept some errors in
prediction if the time reserved for tuning is limited.
The process for correction factor tuning is shown in Figure 5.20. The
process flow chart starts from the situation in which the measurement
results are imported into the planning system. Also, the measurement
results are matched with the digital map and line-of-sight locations are
removed.
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
119
If there are only a few pixels of some morphology classes in the target
area it is not practical to tune those classes because the accuracy of the
results will not be very good. A rule of thumb could be that the portion of
the tuned morphology class should be at least 5 percent of the total
amount of the pixels. If there are a very large number of measurement
samples available it is possible to tune morphology classes having a
smaller portion of the total pixels. For each tuneable morphology class
upper and lower limits for the correction factors should be set. By doing
this some unrealistic results can be avoided. It may happen that the
automatic tuner proposes correction factors that are approaching the
limits. If this happens one should check if the limits are reasonable and if
there is a need to change the basic propagation model. Usually correction
factor tuning requires several rounds of tuning and the basic propagation
model may have to be adjusted several time during the process. If
everything is done for the tuning but the results are not good the following
topics should be checked;
• 
base station configurations are correct (antenna line, powers, etc.)
• 
measurement samples are correct, i.e. measurement equipment had
the right parameters and settings, coordinates are correct, etc.
• 
digital map has all the required layers and the accuracy of the map
is high enough.
When the propagation model is tuned it should be applied for the cells
where it can work. Often the same propagation model is used for the
whole network. This is not the optimal situation in most of cases but the
model tuning should be carried out for the regions that differ from each
other. In theory one propagation model could be enough but there are
factors that demand different propagation models for different areas. For
example, the classification of terrain types may not be perfect in the
digital map because of the limitation of the terrain type classes. Also, in
some areas some terrain types may not exist thus the correction factors of
these terrain types cannot be tuned.
5.4 
Digital maps
A digital map is the basic component of a planning system. All the
tasks carried out in a planning system are in some way related to
the digital map(s). Obviously, coverage planning is directly related to the
digital map because the information on the map is needed for the
predictions. Digital maps are also needed in frequency planning, capacity
planning, interference analysis, etc. Because the digital maps are one of
Team LRN

120 
     RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
the basic components in a planning system the selection and the usage of
the maps should be considered carefully.
The data in a digital map is presented either in a raster format or in a
vector format. Typical raster data are topographic and morphographic
data. Other raster data layers can be, for example, building heights and
traffic density. Roads, borders and texts are usually in vector format. Also,
in the new micro cellular models the buildings are vectorised.
5.4.1 
Quality criteria for digital map
Common quality criteria for a digital map are resolution, accuracy, age
of the source material, quality of the digitalisation and quality of
classification. The resolution means the smallest unit on the map that can
be presented. Usually the resolution is expressed as a pixel size. In
Figure 5.21 there are two maps loaded simultaneously. The map above is
with 5 m resolution and the map below is with 50 m resolutions.
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
121
In both maps the accuracy seems to be close to resolution, i.e. both
maps are well produced. It may happen that the map has good resolution
but the resolution is not fully utilized. In Figure 5.22 the area is loaded
with 50 m resolution. If a digital map is produced with lower accuracy
than the resolution, the difference is similar than it is in Figure 5.21 and
Figure 5.22. As can be seen the details are lost in Figure 5.22.
The quality of digitalisation and classification can be seen in Figure
5.22. The map on the lower part of the figure is produced by using older
and less accurate source material. The 5 m map has more accurate
classification even if it is loaded with 50 m resolution. The age of material
becomes important in the areas where new buildings are constructed or
there are other changes.
5.4.2 
Raster data
The raster data is presented with pixels. Each pixel has only one value
that defines the property of the pixel. In the morphographic layer,
different land-usage classes are presented as different terrain-type classes.
An example is presented in Figure 5.23.
Team LRN

122 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Usually 4 to 10 morphographic classes are used to classify the terrain
types. The classification and the number of types needed depends on the
terrain itself. In some cases only a few classes are enough but, for
example, vegetation may require several classes.
Terrain height is presented in raster format in some planning systems.
Each pixel has its own terrain height information as shown in Figure 5.24.
The value is calculated based on the height model. If the resolution of the
map is poor there can be severe errors in the terrain height model.
In Figure 5.25 the height information for pixels 1 and 3 are easy to
determine. Also, the result does not change if the maximum value or
average is used. However, with pixel 2 there is a problem with how to
select the value. The average 58 m is fairly good for radio network
planning but for radio link planning it cannot be used. If the maximum
Team LRN

Radio Propagation Prediction 
123
63 m is selected the predictions will give too pessimistic results because
the peak is not blocking the radio waves totally.
Building heights and traffic density data are expressed in raster format.
Each building is presented with pixels having height information. The
format is similar to the topographic layer. Traffic data shows the relative
traffic within the target area. If all the pixels have the same value the
traffic is evenly distributed. The absolute traffic is calculated by assigning
a value for the basic unit.
5.4.3 
Vector data
In a planning system some of the data is presented in vector format.
Typically roads and borders are presented with vectors. Also, text strings
can be shown as vectors. The vector data is given with coordinates. Also,
some attributes can be defined for the vectors. These attributes can be
fonts, colours, line width, etc.
5.5 
Micro level models
There are several micro cellular models introduced for small cells.
Some models are designed for small cells and some for real micro cells.
For example, the Walfish–Ikegami model is said to be a micro cellular
model but it is better used for small macro cells in urban areas. The real
micro cellular models are not yet in large-scale use.

5.5.1 
Walfish–Ikegami
The COST-231-Walfish–Ikegami prediction model is said to be a
micro cell model. The parameters for the model are building separation in
meters, building average height in meters, roads width in meters and road
orientation angle in degrees. These parameters can be defined manually
for each cell or they can be taken from the digital map having building
height layer.[9]
Building separation is the distance between the centres of two
buildings (b in Figure 5.26) and the building average height is the average
height of all the buildings inside the coverage area of the cell

the mean rooftop level, but becomes less accurate for small grazing angles
and when the antenna is located below the rooftop level. It is useful for

small macro cells in urban areas because other models like the Okumura–
Hata do not work well due to short distances.
5.5.2 
Other microcellular models
A lot of research has been done in the field of propagation in
microcellular environment. Some microcellular models have been
developed but unfortunately they are usually a compromise between
accuracy and calculation time. Currently the models require too much
time if they are used for large-scale microcellular network planning.
5.6 
Coverage  planning parameters
5.6.1 TX parameters
TX parameters are given for each cell separately. These parameters
define the EIRP of a cell, antenna direction and the radiation pattern of an
antenna.
TX power defines the output power of the base station. Depending on
how the value is used together with Losses the TX power can be after or
before the combiner. It may be easier if TX power is defined as an output
power of a base station at the antenna port. Normally there are losses in
the antenna line. Cable losses, power spilter losses, etc., can be added up
and one value, Losses, can be used to present all the losses between the
antenna connector of the base station and the transmitting antenna.
In antenna selection there are three important issues that are
interrelated. Antenna gain, horizontal 3 dB-beamwidth and vertical 3 dB-
beamwidth. The selection of the antenna type depends on the coverage
requirements and interference situation (see Chapter 3). Radiation patterns
for a typical GSM antenna is presented in Figure 5.28.
Team LRN

128 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The gain of the antenna shows how well the radiated power is directed
to the desired directions. The selection of horizontal beamwidth depends
on the area to be covered. Narrow beam antennae are used when the
covered area has a narrow shape. Also, they can be used to limit
interference for the cell to the direction that is not in the main coverage
area. The selection of vertical beamwidth depends on the environment and
the height of the antenna. In rural areas narrow vertical beamwidths are
mainly used to achieve the maximum antenna gain. However, in urban
areas, if downtilting is used, the vertical beamwidth should be quite
narrow, as well. If the vertical beamwidth of the antenna is more than 20°
the downtilting angle should be very large before any benefits are gained.
Additional attenuation in the radiation pattern is used to make
coverage more realistic in the cases where the antenna is installed, for
example, on a wall. In some planning system it is possible to block the
back slope thus the coverage and interence analysis will be more accurate.
In Figure 5.29 the back slope the radiation pattern is blocked by
introducing additional attenuation for the direction between 90° and 270°.
If the antenna is installed on the wall the radiation pattern is not exactly as
the radiation pattern presented in Figure 5.29 but for most of the cases the
presented pattern is accurate enough for coverage and interference
analysis.

Other parameters that have to be given for the antenna are bearing, tilt
angle and height. Bearing indicates the direction of the antenna. However,
in some countries the declination may cause problems if the antennas are
directed with the help of compass because compass course can differ from
the direction shown on the map. With tilting it is possible to improve
coverage in some cases but usually it is used to improve the C/I ratio. The
positive tilting angles present downtilting and uptilting is done with
negative tilt angles.
5.6.2 
Calculation area
Calculation area is very important for coverage calculation but also for
frequency planning, interference analysis, etc. When defining calculation
regions for cells one must make compromises between calculation time
and accuracy. If calculation regions are too large the calculation of
coverage takes a long time. On the other hand, too small a calculation
region cuts the coverage and influence of the results of, for example,
frequency planning. Calculation regions should be selected in such a way
that C/I or C/N ratios will not be affected by too small a calculation
region. But the calculation regions do not have to be any larger than
necessary to fulfil the criteria.
Team LRN

The impact of too small a calculation region to coverage is presented
in Figure 5.30. The coverage areas of the cells are cut in the example. The
coverage areas in this case should be much larger.

The impact of too small a calculation region to frequency planning and
interference analysis is presented in Figure 5.31. Here the calculation
regions are the same as in Figure 5.30. The frequency allocation is done
by using the defined calculation areas. As can been seen there is not much
interference, however the interfered areas are cut, so that there might be
problems outside of the areas.
In Figure 5.32 calculation regions are defined larger but not large
enough. Still, the interference situation is much different compared to
Figure 5.30. On the right the interfered areas are cut which means that
calculation areas are too small.
Figure 5.32 shows that it is very easy to get wrong results in the
planning system if the basic definitions are not correct. The meanings of
the parameters and definitions should be known before starting the
planning. In this way major errors can be avoided.

CAPACITY PLANNING
Capacity planning is typically done for the first time during the
dimensioning phase and a second time in parallel with the coverage
planning. The aim of capacity planning is to define the maximum and
required number of transceivers at each base station or moreover the
maximum and required capacity of the base station or base station site at
each physical location over a certain area. The exact capacity need can be
defined based on the monitoring of the radio network which gives the real
information about traffic in the radio network. Thus the result of capacity
planning is actually a specification for the frequency planning: this
specification defines the required input information—the number of
transceivers and the required base station site configurations to achieve
capacity—for frequency planning at an element level.
Capacity planning is strongly related to the coverage planning process
due to the coverage and capacity related base station site equipment like
base station antenna line configuration (antenna height, beamwidth,
tilting). Capacity and coverage planning are also linked to each other due
to the propagation environment because frequencies can be reused more
efficiently in a microcellular rather than in a macrocellular environment.
Moreover, coverage planning defines the number of base stations required
to cover a certain area and this group of base stations also defines the
maximum radio interface capacity for this area when the maximum
number of transceivers at each base station is specified. This definition of
the maximum number of transceivers derives from capacity planning and
it is based on the frequency reuse number or factor, meaning the number
of base stations before the same frequency can be reused. (Note that
frequency reuse means only how often the frequency is reused.) When the
frequency reuse number is squeezed in an attempt to add transceivers to
the base stations the aim is to avoid new base stations. If it is not possible
to reuse the frequencies any more then new base stations are needed for
the capacity. Thus, radio interface capacity can be extended by trying to
add more transceivers by improving frequency planning or by adding
more base stations. Assuming that more base stations are not required
because of coverage planning, it is thus the most cost-efficient way to
freeze the number of the base stations. The target is therefore to keep the
average antenna height as high as possible and simultaneously to
Team LRN

Capacity Planning 
137
calculate whether the number of the base stations is enough for the
capacity if the number of transceivers is maximised.
The key parameters for coverage, capacity and frequency planning are
the total traffic over a planning area and the average antenna height. The
aim is to divide the traffic homogeneously to all base stations inside the
planning area and thus to use an equal number of transceivers at each base
station. Capacity planning starts by specifying the target traffic (for
example from monitoring results) and the minimum average base station
antenna height to cover the area. The other essential parameter is the
number of available frequencies (operator’s frequency band) which
defines the maximum number of transceivers at each base station.
An example is to be used to highlight the different phases of capacity
planning. These phases are repeated in the different phases of the radio
network evolution path: see Figure 1.14 that showed first that transceivers
are added and then new base stations are implemented and then this
process continues time after time. In radio network evolution it is good to
remember that radio system planning starts from the macrocellular layer
that should be retained as long as possible and only at the end of the
evolution the small/micro base stations are profitable to deploy.
6.1 
Capacity planning over a certain area
In the example, which is pursued throughout this chapter, there is a
very high traffic density area of 
in the urban area and four base
station sites (BTS1 and BTS2 having three sectors and BTS3 and BTS4
having two sectors) of antenna height 25 m are needed to achieve good
enough coverage for this area, see Figure 6.1.
Team LRN

138 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The antennas are implemented at rooftop level and thus the
propagation environment is of a macrocellular type. The traffic need for
this area is as high as 100 Erl per busy hour. The frequency band is
6.0 MHz and this means 30 frequency channels in the GSM when the
channel bandwidth is 200 kHz. The maximum number of transceivers at
each base station depends on the frequency reuse factor that moreover
depends on the propagation environment and the software features. The
value 15 (frequency reuse factor) can be used in this example because it is
a typical value for the radio network where antennas are implemented at
rooftop level or above and when there are no special software features
implemented. When the number of frequency channels and the frequency
reuse factor are known, the maximum number of transceivers at each base
station can be calculated:
Maximum number of transceivers
= frequency channels / frequency reuse factor
= 30/15
= 2.
These two transceivers represent a certain maximum traffic that has to
be calculated in order to be able to define the maximum traffic that can be

provided by the ten base stations (each having two transceivers). The
calculation of the offered traffic by the two transceivers can be done by
using Erlang-B or Erlang-C formulas and tables.[1]
6.2 
Traffic models
Erlang-B (without queuing) or Erlang-C (with queuing) formulas and
tables are based on a traffic theory [2] and the target is to estimate whether
there is a channel available for the transmission (circuit switched speech
or data). One transmission channel represents a unit of 1 Erlang if it is
used over a hour and this hour is called a busy hour. When there are e.g.
seven transmission channels in a common pool, seven transmissions can
be made simultaneously without blocking and the eighth channel request
is congested because of the lack of channels. Moreover, if these seven
transmissions or calls take only 90 seconds each (this is an average value
or a little bit higher for a speech call in GSM) the next new seven calls can
be transmitted after 90 seconds. Thus, over a busy hour (= 1 Erlang) 400
(= 1 Erl / 25 mErl) calls can be transmitted per channel if all these calls
happen exactly in a queue just after each other. However, in real life
mobile users call randomly but while corresponding to the average traffic
load 25 mErl. This random calling in time axis may cause blocking (if
more than seven users are calling at the same time the eighth call is
congested) and Erlang tables link a blocking and the maximum number of
calls over the busy hour. Thus the maximum traffic or capacity at the base
station has to be mentioned in Erlangs together with the blocking like
8 Erl with 1 percent blocking: the maximum traffic is also increased if
higher blocking is allowed. Real speech traffic in radio networks follows
the values of the Erlang tables extremely well but it still has to be
remembered that these Erlang tables are answers only for the circuit
switched traffic and when packet transfer data traffic comes in GSM
(GPRS/EDGE/UMTS) new traffic models are required. The other thing to
be remembered is that Erlang formulas and tables only give an estimate
about radio interface capacity—the final results come from monitoring—
but they are still good tools for capacity planning.
The Erlang formulas and ready-made tables directly tell of the traffic
that can be offered by the different base station configurations. The Erlang
traffic formulas have already been used in fixed mobile communications
and their results can be used with confidence. The Erlang-B formula and
table (the table is only one way to present the results of the formula) do
not take into account the queuing that is typically used in the radio
Team LRN

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
interface. However, the Erlang-B table is typically used in radio interface
planning in GSM and queuing is reserved for extreme high traffic peaks.
Team LRN

Capacity Planning 
141
Part of the Erlang-B table is shown in Table 6.1 by concentrating on
the blocking or so-called Grade-of-Service (GOS) values 1 percent and
2 percent that are generally accepted as a planning criteria for blocking in
GSM.
Next, transceiver capacity (that is, the maximum traffic that the
transceiver can offer) is calculated when the number of transmission
channels also called traffic channels that can be used simultaneously for
different mobiles or connections is defined. The radio interface of the
GSM is based on time division multiple access (TDMA) which means that
there are eight time slots at each frequency as shown in Figure 6.2.
These eight time slots can be used either for traffic (speech or data) or
for signalling between the mobile and base station. Enough time slots
have to be reserved for the signalling and the rest of the time slots can be
used for traffic. Signalling requires one time slot (ts0) to send e.g. system
information messages on the BCCH and paging on the PCH logical
subchannels. This ts0 can also be configured to have 4 SDCCH (the
combined configuration in Figure 6.2) which are needed for call
establishment, location update and to send short messages. If more
SDCCHs are required extra time slots (see the separated configuration in
Figure 6.2) are needed to reserve enough SDCCH capacity. The need of
SDCCH and moreover the need of signalling channels depends on the
number of transceivers: typical planning criteria for the signalling
channels is presented in Table 6.2.
Team LRN

142 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
In Table 6.2 it is assumed that only one time slot is required for
signalling at a base station with two transceivers. This configuration used
to function well when short messages were not used as much as today.
However, the volume of the short message service today needs two
signalling channels for base stations with two transceivers. Thus, there are
14 available time slots for the traffic (speech or data), the total traffic
7.35 Erl (at 1 percent blocking) of these 14 time slots can be observed in
Table 6.1. The Erlang-B formula and table assumes that the traffic
distribution is homogenous over a busy hour and thus does not work in
situations where there are many simultaneous call attempts (the maximum
number of simultaneous calls is now 14), for example after a concert,
train-delay announcement or other occasion.
6.3 
Frequency reuse factor for the macro base stations
The capacity of the individual base station was defined in the previous
chapter and the total capacity of the ten base stations for the planning area
can be extracted by multiplying 7.35 * 10 = 73.5 Erl. This value
corresponds to the situation that all the base stations are equally loaded
and there is a maximum blocking of 1 percent during a busy hour. It can
be noted that this 73.5 Erl is not enough because 100 Erl was required and
some spare capacity should also be available for the future. In order to
expand the capacity more base stations would be required or more
transceivers at each base 
station 
should be implemented. The
implementation of new base stations is the most expensive solution and it
should be avoided and thus one should concentrate on increasing the
Team LRN

Capacity Planning 
143
number of transceivers at the base stations (to reuse frequencies more
often or to squeeze the frequency reuse factor).
6.3.1 
Frequency reuse factor
The value of the frequency reuse factor depends on
• 
the propagation environment (antenna height versus rooftop
levels = macro/micro level radio network, morphography and
topography i.e. propagation slope)
• 
the implemented radio network configuration (especially on
the antenna height and type distribution)
• 
the software  features implemented in the radio network.
All these elements have a significant effect on the frequency reuse
factor and the minimum frequency reuse factor can be obtained when
these facts are known. The antenna height distribution has two effects on
the frequency reuse factor: the lower the antenna height the smaller
frequency reuse factor (due to the propagation environment) and the
smaller deviation in the antenna heights the smaller frequency reuse factor
(due to the implemented radio network). In the first case the man-made
obstacles like buildings prevent radio propagation and this squeezes the
frequency reuse factor values. In a macrocellular environment (base
station antennas are clearly above the average rooftop level) buildings do
not prevent the radio propagation too much and thus the minimum
frequency reuse factor in the homogenous environment (that is, a totally
flat area where the radio propagation properties are equivalent to all
directions) is about 12. This means that the different frequencies have to
be used at the 12 base stations and these frequency clusters (also called
frequency reuse pattern) can then be reused, see Figure 6.3. In
microcellular environments frequencies can be reused after 5–7 base
stations not depending on the antenna heights, topography or
morphography classes (only antennas have to be clearly below the rooftop
levels).
Team LRN

144 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
In 
macro 
cells 
the 
environmental 
classes—topography 
and
morphography—also have an effect on radio wave propagation and
furthermore on the frequency reuse factor. [3] The radio propagation
environment is not homogenous (there are higher and lower altitude
positions, building density areas and several different area types like
building types, parks, water areas) and thus the propagation environment
is not equivalent in all directions. These discontinuous environment types
may have better or worse propagation characteristics and thus the
propagation slope varies and can increase the frequency reuse factor (or
reduce the frequency reuse).
6.3.2 
Frequency reuse factor and co-channel carrier-to-interference
ratio
The frequency reuse factor value 12 (in Figure 6.3) and 15 (in the
example) were introduced for the macrocellular environment. These
frequency reuse factor values are related to the co-channel carrier-to-
interference ratio 
and the reuse factor can be estimated when the
value is known. The reuse numbers and 
values can be connected
by calculating the received field strength levels from the different base
stations and by analysing the required number of base stations before
reusing the same frequency. This analysis can easily be done for the
macrocellular propagation environment where radio propagation follows
well the exponential attenuation
(r equals the radius or distance
from the base station and the slope equals the environment type) and
where it is assumed that the base stations have quite constant coverage
areas as depicted in Figure 6.3.
Team LRN

Capacity Planning 
145
Each base station’s (server and interferer) coverage area and the radius
of the coverage area in the model in Figure 6.3 can be estimated by using
path loss exponent and 
from Equation 6.1 [1,3]
Equation 6.1 shows that all interferers have to be taken into account
in order to be able to calculate the final 
It also can be seen that
Equation 6.1 is only a function of a slope and the horizontal and vertical
(tilting) beamwidth of the base station antenna is naturally needed for the
calculation in order to know the actual transmitted power. More accurate
statistical
analysis requires including fast and slow fading in different
environments. [4]
Tables 6.3 and 6.4,[3] show the calculated 
 values of the frequency
patterns 9 (=9 frequencies) and 12 (=12 frequencies) when 120° and 65°
horizontal beamwidth base station antennas without tilting are used and
when the propagation environment varies from the urban to the rural (the
path slope exponent varies between 2–4.5).
Team LRN

146 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The first parts of Table 6.3 and Table 6.4 represent the influence of the
number of the interferers on the 
when the path slope exponent is
constant and equals 4. The second parts of Tables 6.3 and 6.4 represent
the influence of the path slope exponent (the number of the interferers is
constant at 6). It has to be noted that the number of interferers has a great
effect on the 
values as can be seen in Tables 6.3 and 6.4. Moreover,
the base station antenna type and the propagation slope influence
significantly the 
and thus also the frequency reuse number.
Table 6.3 and Table 6.4 show that a base station antenna of 65° in a
horizontal plane gives better 
values than a 120° antenna and thus a
better (lower) frequency reuse factor can be obtained. Additionally it can
be noted that 
of 12.1 dB and 14.3 dB can be achieved when the reuse
patterns 9 and 12 are utilised and when six interferers are included in the
propagation environment where the path slope exponent is 3 (as in typical
urban). These values exceed the threshold of 12 dB that is a criterion in
the GSM specifications to avoid a co-channel interference in the non-
hopping radio networks. The criteria for the co-channel and adjacent
channel interference in the GSM are gathered in the Table 6.5.
In the capacity planning example the frequency reuse factor value 15
was selected and thus the 
value should be even higher than 14.3 dB
(Table 6.4, path slope exponent 3) if the 65° base station antennas are
used. The value 14.3 dB represents a homogenous propagation
environment where the exponent of the propagation slope is 3.0 and
constant to all propagation directions without fading. The average value of
Team LRN

Capacity Planning
 
 
147
3.0 refers fairly well to the urban or suburban environment but this value
is, of course, not constant in the real environment but varies and have a
certain distribution. The selection of 15 was made because there has to be
an additional margin ([14.3 dB – 12 dB] + 3 more frequencies) to partly
take into account this inhomogeneous propagation environment and fast
and slow fading. The correct margin for the different propagation
environments has to be based on measurements; this value of the
frequency reuse factor 15 is based on these measurements and the long-
term experience of practical frequency planning results. The frequency
reuse factor 15 gives an additional 3–4 dB margin for frequency planning
but whether this is enough depends on the variations of the propagation
environment. Additionally it is assumed in the model in Figure 6.4 and in
Tables 6.3 and 6.4 that all the base station antennas are implemented at an
equal height which is very theoretical. The variation in the base station
antenna heights causes also strong variation in the propagation and thus it
has a strong effect on the 
 and on frequency reuse in practise.
Next the frequency reuse number or factor should try to be squeezed in
order to be able to add more transceivers to the example area and
simultaneously to avoid implementing new base stations. This decreasing
of the frequency reuse factor is called capacity planning or capacity
enhancement. The alternatives to squeezing the frequency reuse number
are
• 
to tilt the vertical beamwidth of the base station antennas
• 
to utilise software features or
• 
to drop the average base station antenna (macro micro).
6.3.2.1 Tilting
Base station antenna tilting is the simplest way to limit the radio wave
propagation in the vertical plane and this tilting, depicted in Figure 6.4,
significantly increases the capability to reuse the frequencies (as the
frequency reuse factor decreases). However, it has to be noted that too
strong tilting also decreases the base station’s coverage area. The amount
of tilting (typically 5–15°) depends significantly on the base station
antenna type. Sufficient tilting is 5–7° for high gain base station antennas
(high gain antenna are equal to 15–18 dBi and vertical halfpower
beamwidth <10° at 900 MHz) and around 10° tilting is required for the
low gain base station antennas (low gain antenna are equal to 10–14 dBi
and vertical halfpower beamwidth 
10° at 900 MHz). Tilting should be
used in macro base stations almost without exception in the GSM in order
Team LRN

148 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
to minimise interference and its meaning is still increasing in the UMTS.
However, improvements in the radio network quality due to tilting have
traditionally not directly be taken into account in capacity or frequency
planning but has been used as an extra margin and to avoid serious
interference areas due to inhomogeneous propagation in certain directions.
6.3.2.2 Software features
The next possibility to squeeze the frequency reuse number is to utilise
different software features for the radio network:
• 
frequency hopping
•     overlay–underlay radio network configurations
•
interference cancellation or adaptive antenna based solutions.
These features all aim to really squeeze the frequency reuse number
such that a new lower reuse value can be used in capacity and frequency
planning.
Frequency hopping is based on the usage of the several frequencies
and thus on the interleaving of the transmitted information (speech or
data) between these different frequencies. Frequency hopping should give
at least 3 dB advantage (interference diversity) for the 
as shown in
Table 6.3 which refers to the values in the GSM specification. Thus, the
frequency reuse factor could approximately be squeezed down to 12
which means a twenty-five percent capacity increase.
The second software related feature is an overlay–underlay concept
that can be utilised in radio network implementation with or without
frequency hopping. This overlay–underlay concept means that a part of
the frequencies (called overlay frequencies) are used over the whole base
station coverage area and a part of the frequencies (underlay frequencies)
Team LRN

Capacity Planning 
149
are only used close to the base station coverage area where there is a high
field strength reception level (in other words a good co-channel carrier-to-
interference ratio). It has to be noted that all the frequencies can be
transmitted by using the same base station site configuration (base station
and base station antenna line equipment) and they have exactly the same
coverage area but the usage of them is limited to the certain areas based
on the 
values. Additionally, it has to be noted that different base
station equipment suppliers have different solutions for this overlay–
underlay concept but basically all these overlay–underlay concepts can be
used in the macrocellular or microcellular propagation environment and
thus the transceivers are not divided into macro or micro transceivers even
if the name of this concept easily does.
The reduction of the frequency reuse factor in these overlay–underlay
solutions is achieved by dividing the transceivers for overlay and underlay
transceivers and by using the normal amount of frequencies for the
overlay transceivers (e.g. a frequency reuse number of 15) and the smaller
amount of frequencies for the underlay transceivers (e.g. a frequency
reuse number of 5). The average frequency reuse number over the radio
network is thus the weighted average of these 15 and 5 (the reuse numbers
of the overlay and underlay). If there is 1 overlay transceiver and 1
underlay transceiver the average frequency reuse number is
This is even lower than in case of frequency hopping but it has to be
noted that these reuse numbers for the overlay and underlay do not tell
enough about the performance of this concept because the underlay can
only be used when the 
is good enough and thus the traffic distribution
has a strong effect on the final performance.
The last software feature for macrocellular capacity enhancement is an
interference cancellation or adaptive antennas in general. Interference
cancellation is provided by the adaptive antennas and the target of this
functionality is to improve the signal-to-noise (S/N) or carrier-to-
interference (C/I) ratio by combining the received signal components of
the individual antenna elements. Correspondingly, the frequency reuse
number could in theory be decreased close to 1.0 if the fully adaptive
antenna concept was used with beamsteering (spatial division multiple
access, SDMA). Thus, the potential of the adaptive antennas for capacity
increase in a macrocellular layer is enormous and clearly the highest
Team LRN

150 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
among all the capacity enhancement software features. However, these
adaptive antennas are not yet commercially available because they are
complicated to manufacture and to adapt to the radio network.
6.4 
Microcellular layer
Having introduced software features and their performances to give an
idea of the capacity increase that these software features can provide for
the macrocellular environment, it can be noted that the available
techniques—frequency 
hopping, 
overlay–underlay 
concepts—may
squeeze the frequency reuse number down to 10–12 and thus increase the
capacity by 20–40 percent in a macrocellular environment. Some
measurements may obtain even smaller values for the frequency reuse
factor like 8–10 but it can still be agreed that the practical limitation for
the reuse factor is around 10. In our example this reuse number 10 would
mean 3 transceivers (= 24 time slots – 2 for signalling = 22 traffic time
slots = 13.7 Erl at 1 percent blocking) at each base station and the total
capacity of 10 base station would be
that would already include 37 Erlang additional capacity for this service
area. However, the traffic demand may exceed this maximum capacity
and then there has to be a new solution to offer higher capacity. The last
alternative is to build new base stations and step by step move from a
macrocellular configuration to a microcellular configuration. This means
new transceivers in new base stations but simultaneously it increases the
radio network capacity because the minimum frequency reuse number (5–
7) is lower in a microcellular environment. It has to be noted that the
reuse factor of 5–7 corresponds to the capacity of 350 Erl in the example
area. Moreover, the software features squeeze the reuse number in a
microcellular environment in the same way as in a macrocellular
environment. The microcellular radio propagation channel is still different
from the macrocellular as explained in Chapter 1 and thus the
performance of the software features is not necessarily equivalent in both
environments. The adaptive antennas for example suffer in a microcellular
environment with wide angular spread that complicates the filtering of
unwanted signal components and this directly influences the performance.

Additional capacity related functions
There are also some individual functionalities in the radio network
which may increase the capacity because they decrease interference. The
power control and discontinuous transmission (DTX) are directly such
features, and handovers could be classified indirectly as such a feature.
Power control and DTX help greatly in the situations where there is major
interference as in LOS connections in high buildings. It is clear that in
these situations the interference level is decreased and it could also be said
that capacity is increased. These improvements still happen only at certain
locations and they cannot be said to be constant over the radio coverage
area. Moreover, the influences of these features on capacity are difficult to
measure and thus they cannot be taken into account in capacity planning
but they could be utilised as an additional capacity reserve.
Handovers and handover parameters are also very important capacity
related issues because the radio network capacity has to be fitted to the
capacity demand on the field. This means that the base station’s service
(dominance) areas have to be well defined based on the traffic demand on
each coverage area. This is called traffic distribution and will be discussed
and explained in detail in Chapter 8 (optimisation) by concerning the even
traffic distribution between the base stations.
Handovers also have an effect on the capacity in the dual band radio
networks when the 1800 MHz layer is typically concerned as a capacity
layer and the 900 MHz layer as a coverage layer. Thus, the target is to
move all the dual band mobile users to the 1800 MHz layer and to use the
900 MHz layer only when there are no coverage in the 1800 MHz layer or
when the 1800 MHz layer is not needed. This traffic distribution from the
900 MHz layer to the 1800 MHz layer happens easily by using C2
criterion in the GSM call set-up and handovers in preferring the 1800
MHz layer in the dedicated mode. Handovers are thus critical in a single
frequency layer or dual band radio networks in order to utilise the
available capacity but still they cannot be taken into account in the
capacity planning.

Conclusions
Radio interface capacity planning and the performance of the main
software features have been examined in a capacity plan for an example
service area by squeezing the reuse factor and adding the third transceiver
to every base station (whereby traffic was increased to 137 Erl). The
future solutions for this area have been based on the micro base stations to
increase capacity up to 350 Erl. The highlights of the capacity planning
are gathered to Table 6.6.

FREQUENCY PLANNING
7.1 
Frequency planning criteria
Frequency
planning is actually an implementation of capacity
planning. Frequency planning together with capacity planning tries to
maximise the information flow (voice or data) over the radio interface and
simultaneously to maximise the efficiency of the radio network
infrastructure. In cellular radio system planning the same frequencies are
reused as often as possible in order to maximise capacity and thus
minimise the radio network investments. The target is to have the
maximum number of transceivers (a transmitter and receiver pair) at each
base station without reducing radio quality. It has already been explained
that frequency planning (together with capacity planning) begins with the
specification of the required frequency channels (transceivers) at each
base station. This work is related to the frequency reuse factor and was
covered in detail in the capacity planning discussion.
When the basic radio network configuration—antenna heights, tilting,
software features—is selected and optimised for the capacity demands, the
minimum frequency reuse factor and the maximum number of the
transceivers at the base station are defined and the frequency planning
target has been defined. Next, this frequency planning target has to be
achieved in frequency planning first by using the radio network
configuration specified in the capacity planning (e.g. tilting, software
features) and second by defining the frequency planning criteria.
Frequency planning criteria include the configuration and frequency
allocation aspects. The configuration aspects consider the
• 
Frequency band splitting between the macrocellular and
microcellular base stations
• 
Frequency band splitting between the BCCH and TCH layers
• 
Frequency band grouping
• 
Different frequency reuse factors for the BCCH and TCH
layers.

All these configuration functions aim to ensure a good radio quality at
least on a certain part of the radio network and to simplify the frequency
planning process in order to avoid fatal errors as much as possible.
First the frequency band can be split between the different base station
types based on the usage of these base stations. A certain frequency band
can be reserved to be used only e.g. in the micro base stations and other
frequencies on the macro base stations. This splitting is typically always
mentioned when there are micro base stations in the radio network but
there is not any good reason for this splitting in the frequency planning
itself and the only reason that supports this splitting is the inaccurate
coverage prediction in a microcellular environment. This coverage
prediction in a microcellular radio propagation channel has been studied
continuously and sufficient accurate prediction methods such as a ray-
tracing prediction are under development (some products are of course
already available). It still takes time before these ray-tracing predictions
are implemented together with the automatic frequency planning
algorithms to the same platform and before there is enough calculation
power in the PCs. When coverage predictions are no longer an issue and
they are accurate and quick enough, further frequency band splitting
between macrocellular and microcellular layers is not necessary. Before
this integrated macro and micro base stations’ planning platform it is
sensible to reserve a frequency band only for the microcellular layer
especially if there are several micro base stations in the radio network.
This splitting decreases the risks of a drop in radio quality crucially in the
operative network due to the fatal errors of the micro base stations’
coverage predictions in the planning tool.
Second a frequency band splitting between the BCCH and TCH layers
(a layer means a group of frequencies which are used for a certain purpose
e.g. only for the transceivers which include the BCCH time slot = BCCH
frequencies) which is typically caused first by the impression that the
BCCH layer requires more frequencies because of the BCCH time slot
should be considered. The simulations show that this impression is not
actually true because the information on the BCCH time slot is interleaved
very widely and thus 
values of 12–13 dB can be used on the BCCH
time slot.[1] Moreover as has been shown, the TCH time slots on the
BCCH frequency require 
of 15–17 dB when frequency hopping is not
utilised. Another reason for frequency splitting between the BCCH and
TCH layers typically mentioned is to ensure a good radio quality on the
BCCH frequency layer continuously and independently of the traffic load.
Team LRN

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
This is really an adequate reason to reserve a certain group of frequencies
for only the BCCH layer and others for the TCH layer but there are still
arguments for not splitting the frequency band at all. These are based on
the idea of maximising the usage of all frequencies (reuse frequencies as
often as possible) by providing a frequency plan as a result of the
advanced and automatic frequency planning (AFP) algorithms and tools.
These frequency planning tools provide, of course, considerably better
plans than a human being because they have huge calculation capacities
but still the risk might be too big to trust totally on the computer’s
intelligence. This risk due to traffic load and its control can be attempted
on other TCH layers but not on the BCCH layer. Hence, it may be better
in practise to reserve a separate frequency group for the BCCH layer and
to use the rest of the frequencies freely on the other transceiver layers.
Next consider the usage of each single frequency as already studied;
the maximum frequency reuse and the total frequency band divided into
subbands. Each frequency can be used together with any other frequency
from the other layer which gives the maximal flexibility for the frequency
allocation but also adds the number of possible solutions and thus
complicates the frequency allocation algorithms. The usage of the
frequencies from the different layers can also be fixed by having certain
frequency pairs or groups that can be used together. This frequency
grouping is a restriction in a frequency allocation but simultaneously it
may help to avoid too complicated calculations and to use e.g. adjacent
frequencies at the adjacent base stations. Figure 7.1 shows a basic
example of this kind of grouping when 15 frequencies are reserved for the
BCCH, second TRX and third TRX layers each (frequency hopping is not
used). When the grouping has been done there are a pool of 3 frequencies
reserved for a certain base station when a frequency group is assigned in
frequency planning. Thus, this grouping defines directly the frequencies
that can be used at the same base station but it also minimises the adjacent
channel frequencies at the adjacent base stations. An additional benefit is
that all the frequencies are used evenly and the adjacent frequencies are
not gathered over the same area, an advantage where frequency hopping
performance depends partly on frequency separation. This frequency
grouping however works well only if the radio network has been planned
based on the coverage and capacity instructions explained thus far and by
targeting to have an approximately equal number of transceivers (e.g. 2–3)
at each base station. If there is 1 transceiver at some base stations and 5 or
6 transceivers at others this frequency grouping can not be used in the

frequency planning but then the radio network configuration is already in
a poor condition.
The last item in the definition of the frequency planning criteria is the
uneven usage of the frequencies for the different layers. More frequencies
can be reserved for the BCCH to ensure at least one interference free
frequency layer at each base station and less frequencies can be reserved
for the other transceiver layers. The frequency grouping can also be done
by using a different number of frequencies for the different layers as for
example 15 for the BCCH, 14 for the second TRX and 13 for the third
TRX. A microcellular layer (an overlay–underlay concept or separate
micro base stations) can also be included and an example of this
configuration can be seen in Figure 7.2. There are reserved 15 frequencies
for the BCCH and second TRX layers and 6 frequencies for both
microcellular layers. In this case the frequency groups have to be selected
such that the adjacent micro layer frequencies are not allocated to the
same base station site. If there are mainly 3-sector sites in the radio
network the frequency groups of micro channels 31 (37), 33 (39) and 35
(41) have to be used in half of the sites and the frequency groups of micro
channels 32 (38), 34 (40) and 36 (42) have to be used in the other half of
the sites.
The first configuration in Figure 7.1 is meant for the radio network
where baseband frequency hopping is utilized and the second
Team LRN

160 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
configuration in Figure 7.2 is for the multilayer networks by utilising the
overlay–underlay implementation strategy. With frequency grouping,
frequency channel separations are considered automatically; when several
frequencies are assigned to the same base station (typically the frequency
separation is 400 to 600 kHz for 1–2 frequencies) or to the same base
station site (adjacent channels are not assigned to the same base station
site). If the frequency grouping is made intelligently and correctly the
intermodulation can also be excluded by selecting the proper frequencies
already in this grouping phase. Otherwise intermodulation has to be taken
into account in the frequency allocation.
This intermodulation originates for example at the base station
antennas because of the poor antenna element junctions which function as
a mixer by producing intermodulation products e.g. 2fl–f2. The
intermodulation source is worse in the downlink direction because the
transmitting power levels are much higher than in the uplink direction.
The intermodulation products are directed to the
• 
same base station’s downlink frequencies (more than 2
frequencies at the same base station,
• 
same base station’s uplink frequencies
• 
adjacent base station’s downlink frequencies (at the base
station’s border areas)
• 
adjacent base station’s uplink frequencies (at the base
station’s border areas)
• 
1800 MHz receiving frequency band from the 900 MHz
transmission frequency band
especially at the dual band antennas
and can cause deterioration in the 
values and thus reduce radio
quality. These intermodulations happen only when the transmission power
is high and are worse when the transmission is reduced (power control) in
the intermodulation product frequency. The GSM specification says that
the co-channel ratio 
has to be 9 dB or better in order to avoid
interference. This means that if the intermodulation products are at the
level of –30 dB and the 
requirement is 9 dB the source frequencies
can have 30 - 9 = 21 dB higher transmission power level. If the maximum
power control is 30 dB in the GSM there is a real possibility of having an
intermodulation interference at the same base station.
This intermodulation interference can be avoided by
• 
ensuring that the quality of the base station site equipment is
high so that intermodulation does not exist

• 
grouping the frequencies such
that the intermodulation
products do not cause interference
• 
allocating the frequencies such that the intermodulation
products do not cause interference
otherwise its complex influence on frequency planning can be made easier
by
• 
preventing the power control
• 
directing the intermodulation products to the BCCH
frequencies (there is no downlink power control on the
BCCH).
Again it has to be noted that frequency grouping at the different
frequency bands before the frequency allocation is the simplest, the fastest
and maybe also the most cost efficient way of avoiding radio quality
problems in the radio network caused by the intermodulation. Hence, the
frequency grouping is maybe the most important planning criteria and also
the most efficient tool for frequency planning.
7.2 
Interference analysis and intereference matrix
The next step in the frequency planning process is to define the
interference relations (co-channel 
and adjacent channel 
between
the different base stations at every locations in the radio network coverage
area. These relations are the basis for the automatic frequency allocation
and thus the definition of these relations have to be made accurately but
simultaneously fast enough. The accuracy depends on the radio
propagation and on the signal behaviour both of which can be calculated
or measured. Calculation is preferred because measurement campaigns are
typically very time consuming and sensitive to errors. Thus, interference
relations are usually solved in the radio planning tool environment by
utilising the radio propagation predictions and the result is the interference
matrix where all the 
and 
connections can be found.
The essential fact for the success of frequency planning is the correct
interference matrix while defining the correct interference matrix requires
accurate coverage predictions and thus the propagation prediction models.
This is the reason why prediction models should always be tuned because
the radio coverage planning is worthless unless its quality is good.
Accurate coverage predictions guarantee accurate frequency planning that
furthermore guarantees good quality for the radio network. (The radio
network can be planned without good coverage predictions and without
Team LRN

162 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
good frequency plans and the radio quality may be reasonable but the
radio network investment costs are typically much higher compared to the
radio network with an accurate radio plan.)
Having discussed radio propagation predictions and emphasising the
requirement for accuracy in order to produce accurate coverage
predictions, the received signal or actually signals (from the different base
stations in the downlink and from the different mobiles in the uplink
directions) that have an effect on the C/I (co-channel or adjacent channel)
predictions must be considered. In coverage planning there is only one
serving signal at each mobile station location and the standard deviation
of this signal has been measured and studied and it is well-known that a
typical value is 7 dB at 900 MHz frequency band. [2,3] In the interference
analysis (and in the real networks) there are multiple co-channel or
adjacent channel signals received by the base station or mobile station and
thus the combination of these received signals no longer has the same
standard deviation as the single signal has.[2] Figure 7.3 shows the
calculated mean and standard deviation (std) values for the N signals of 0,
6, 8.3 and 12 dB standard deviation. If the signal std is 6 dB and only one
signal is received, the mean value of this received signal is 0 dB and the
std of this signal is 6 dB, and correspondingly if there are two signals of
6 dB std, the mean increases to 4.58 dB and the std of the total reception is
4.58 dB.
Note that these two results are quite different and thus the influence on
the frequency allocation should be significant. In addition it should be
noted that these values are valid only when the signals are at an equal
level and this partly reduces the effect of this multiuser interference.
However, there are plenty of locations in the radio network where two co-
channel signals are interfering with the serving channel. The open
Team LRN

Frequency Planning 
163
questions are the total influence of the multiuser interference and whether
these locations should be taken into account in the frequency allocation or
not.
The other issues in the interference analysis and in the creation of the
interference matrix are radio propagation and the base station relations.
The main questions are the radio propagation attenuation (slope) and the
calculation area for the interference analysis. Errors in the radio
propagation slope may cause huge variations in the received power levels
and thus deteriorate the C/I accuracy significantly.
The interference calculation area should be much larger than the base
station dominance area (that is, the area where the base station’s service is
superior) or coverage area (the area where the base station provides
service; the power level that exceeds the defined coverage planning
threshold). Moreover, the calculation time increases enormously at the
same time. In order to reduce the calculation time the interference analysis
is typically done only in the area where the base station coverage
calculation areas overlap. Thus, it is critical to define large enough
calculation areas for all base stations (see Figure 7.4). Even if the power
levels are quite low in the calculation border areas and it seems that these
low power levels are not used, there may still be need to use these for
service in indoor locations and there too interference has to be avoided.
Team LRN

164 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
An interference matrix could also be created by measuring base station
relations from the radio network. This measurement method is very time
consuming process and also sometimes inaccurate because interfering
base stations may be very far away and connected to a base station
controller other than the measured base stations. This measurement
method is still applicable in urban and especially the microcellular
environment where coverage predictions are not accurate and where
interfering base stations are not too distant.
7.3 
Automatic frequency planning (AFP)
Frequency planning and specifically automatic frequency planning
(AFP) is required in order to maximise the frequency reuse and radio
quality in the radio network. Frequency planning can be done manually
without using any frequency planning tool but the result is rarely
optimised because of the limited calculation capacity of a radio planning
engineer. Automatic frequency planning tools can process complicated
calculation algorithms and the result is based mainly on the performance
of allocation algorithms and the computational capacity. The performance
and risk of the frequency allocation can be improved and optimised by
frequency grouping and thus directed to exclude intermodulation and to
automatically reduce the adjacent channels at adjacent base stations.
Frequency planning is also a continuous process in that it has to be
repeated time after time for different areas where as it is not worth making
a new frequency plan for the whole radio network every time. The
frequency plan is only optimised for a short period and subsequently starts
to deteriorate, as presented in Figure 7.5. Typically a frequency plan
upgrade has to be done for a certain area where there are new transceivers
or new base stations launched. Every partial upgrade brings the frequency
plan quality away from the optimised frequency plan, as shown in
Figure 7.5. Moreover, it is expensive and very time-consuming to make a
frequency plan upgrade every time for the whole radio network. Thus, the
number of frequency plan upgrades should be minimised (all the changes
or as many as possible should be made at the same time) and after a
certain period e.g. 6–12 months a new frequency plan should be
introduced. This new plan should concern at least the urban and suburban
areas in order to achieve the performance level of the optimised frequency
plan and thus to maximise frequency reuse in these areas.
Team LRN

Frequency Planning 
165
The aim of frequency planning is to provide an equal interference level
over the whole radio network in order to guarantee even radio quality for
the subscribers. Critical for the equal interference level are the base station
boundary areas and, therefore indoor locations.
Frequency planning or allocation begins with the definition of
restrictions in the use of certain frequencies or frequency groups at the
same base station or at the same base station site. The restriction in the use
of frequencies at the same base station depends on the combiner (that
combines all the frequencies at the base station to the same cable) which
typically can not combine frequencies that have a separation less than
400–600 kHz (2–3 channels separation in the GSM). Thus, for example,
channels 99 and 101 can not be used at the same base station with
channel 100. The other restriction in the use of frequencies at the same
base station site is related to co-channel and adjacent channel interference.
It is not appropriate to use these co-channel or adjacent channel
frequencies at the same base station site in order to avoid continuous
interference. Thereby, if channel 100 is already assigned to the base
station, channels 99 and 101 should be avoided at the same base station
site (including all cells at this site). These frequency channel restrictions
can mainly be avoided again if the frequency grouping is made before the
frequency allocation (as mentioned before) when there are less restrictions
to take into account by the frequency planning tool and thus the
complexity and the risk of frequency allocation is effectively minimised.
Finally, the preliminary preparations have been completed and it is
time to start the actual frequency allocation. The allocation can be made
on one occasion if the frequency band is not split—for example for the
Team LRN

166 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
BCCH and TCH layers or macrocellular and microcellular layers. If the
frequency band is split every layer requires its own allocation. Next
confirm whether all frequencies are taken into account in the allocation or
whether the frequency band is grouped and thus initially allocated. If this
is the case the frequency allocation is better done based on the frequency
groups (for example by using the BCCH frequency as an ID for each
frequency group) in order to minimise the aforementioned complexity and
risks in the frequency allocation.
After defining the frequencies to be included in the allocation based on
frequency band splitting or frequency band grouping the last action is to
define the target values for the frequency allocation and the weights for
the uplink and downlink directions as well as for the different layers (in
the case that all frequencies are used in the same frequency pool and not
grouped). The target values (also called thresholds) are set for the co-
channel and adjacent channel interference and typical values are for
example 3 percent co-channel interference and 5 percent adjacent channel
interference. It can also be noted that these co-channel and adjacent
channel interference can be weighted e.g. by setting the co-channel
interference threshold to 1 percent and the adjacent channel interference to
7 percent. Correspondingly, the uplink or downlink directions and also the
different layers can be weighted which is especially important when all of
the frequency channels are used in all the frequency layers.
7.4 
Additional features in frequency planning
7.4.1 
Frequency hopping
Frequency hopping improves the C/I and frequency reuse factor and
thus adds capacity into the radio network. The final capacity improvement
of frequency hopping depends on the number of channels and the
frequency bandwidth. The implementation of frequency hopping also has
a significant effect on frequency planning which furthermore depends
strongly on the frequency hopping scheme. The baseband and synthetized
frequency hopping schemes are typically utilised for example in the GSM
mobile networks and frequency band limitation or sufficiency, as well as
system limitations, have a significant effect on the selection of these
frequency hopping schemes for different purposes.
Team LRN

Frequency Planning
167
Baseband hopping
Baseband hopping is an elementary feature of the GSM system and its
usage is not typically limited. Baseband hopping means that the call (the
radio connection between the mobile station and base station) is switched
between different transceivers (or frequencies) periodically or randomly
during the connection. This means that the call uses a different transceiver
from the pool of all the transceivers at each time slot. If there are three
transceivers (frequencies f1, f2 and f3) the call proceeds
on different time slots when cyclic hopping is used. Figure 7.6
specifies the baseband hopping sequences,[4] because note that the BCCH
time slot can not be hopped as it has to be sent on the same frequency all
the time. There are two different defined baseband hopping groups which
are the group 1 including all the time slot zeros except the BCCH time slot
and the group 2 which includes all time slots 2–7. If there are four
transceivers/frequencies at the base station in total it means that three of
them are used in the first group and all of them are used in the second
group. The usage of these frequencies can be cyclic as in Figure 7.6 or
pseudorandom. [4] Pseudorandom hopping is preferred because of the
SACCH blocks which are sent by an even period.
Note that the number of frequencies to be utilised in baseband
frequency hopping depends on the number of transceivers (number of
frequencies in baseband hopping equals the number of transceivers).
Because the performance of frequency hopping depends on the
frequencies to be hopped it means that baseband hopping requires quite a
wide frequency band before it is efficient. If the frequency reuse
factor was 12 and three frequencies are required at each base station, 36
(7.2 MHz) frequencies are needed. Frequency diversity is reasonable
when two frequencies are used for baseband hopping,[5] but the
Team LRN

168 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
improvement of interference diversity is significant only when there are at
least three frequencies at the base station.[4]
The requirement of the wide frequency band is the weakness of
baseband hopping and thus it is typically not used in the radio networks of
narrow frequency band. The advantages of baseband hopping are
• 
the usage of the BCCH frequency (except time slot 0)
• 
the improvement in the frequency reuse factor and thus in the
capacity
• 
easy frequency planning.
Because baseband hopping can be utilised on the BCCH traffic time
slots, the frequency reuse factor can easily be reduced down to 12 on the
TCHs of the BCCH frequency and on other frequencies. When we recall
that the 
requirement (which is approximately the same as the
frequency reuse factor) for good radio quality is around 12–13 dB on the
BCCH time slot [1] it can be concluded that baseband hopping makes it
possible to have the same 
for the TCH time slots as for the BCCH
time slot on the BCCH frequency. Thus, the same frequency reuse factor
(for example 12) can be used as a planning criteria for the BCCH as for
the other frequencies.
The frequency planning process with baseband frequency hopping is
equivalent to the normal frequency planning process. The target frequency
reuse factor has to be defined initially in order to know the maximum
number of frequencies at each base station. Because frequency hopping
reduces the frequency reuse factor as a function of the number of
transceivers both the targeted number of transceivers and then the
frequency reuse factor have to be decided. Next, the frequency allocation
has to be done based on the targeted frequency reuse number which can
be transferred to the 
value which moreover has to be used as a target
value in the frequency allocation.
Synthetized hopping
Synthetized frequency hopping differs from baseband hopping such in
that there are both more system requirements and flexibility in Synthetized
hopping. First of all synthetized hopping means that the frequency can be
changed in each transceiver between time slots. Moreover, this means that
the whole frequency band can be reused in each transceiver which means
that a wideband combiner is required to combine the frequencies at the
Team LRN

Frequency Planning
 
169
base station. This wideband combiner typically causes the first limitation
for synthetized hopping namely that the maximum number of transceivers
is restricted. Second, the BCCH frequency can not be included in
synthetized hopping (see the Figure 7.7) because the BCCH time slot has
to be sent at the same frequency all of the time; the BCCH transceiver’s
frequency can not be changed.
Even if the system and radio network elements limit synthetized
hopping there are interesting flexibilities in this hopping scheme because
all of the frequencies can be used in each transceiver which increases the
performance of the synthetized hopping. This method, to use all the
frequencies in all the base stations, is called a 1/1 pattern (frequency reuse
factor), the other commonly mentioned pattern is the 1/3 which means that
the frequency band is divided into three groups. These values describe
only the reuse of the frequencies but the practical and minimised average
frequency reuse factor is still around 7–9 for synthetized hopping before
the radio quality drops (the frequencies are used at all base stations but
not simultaneously and thus some of the transceivers can not be used all
the time: fractional loading). This also means that the number of the
transceivers at each base station has to be dimensioned based on the
average frequency reuse factor in order to maximise the radio network
efficiency. The performance of synthetized hopping is best with the
narrow frequency band when it is not possible to site many transceivers at
each base station and thus baseband hopping can not be used efficiently.
Table 7.1 shows an example of the required frequency reuse factors if the
same frequency band were to be used with baseband and synthetized
hopping. It can be seen that the requirement of the reuse factor of 7 is very
tight even for synthetized hopping.
Team LRN

170 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Finally, baseband hopping specifically, but also synthetized hopping,
influence frequency splitting. In the case of baseband hopping all of the
frequencies are mixed and only the BCCH time slots use one separately
defined frequency. Thus, frequency splitting works only for the BCCH
time slot. Correspondingly, frequency splitting works for the whole
BCCH frequency layer (BCCH and TCH time slots) in synthetized
hopping but the other transceivers can not be easily separated.
7.4.2 
Discontinuous transmission (DTX)
There are at least two features—discontinuous transmission and power
control—in the radio interface which improve frequency efficiency and
furthermore the radio quality but which are typically not utilized in
frequency planning. Discontinuous transmission (DTX) can be used in the
uplink direction in order to decrease interference. A voice detector (VD)
in the mobile phone detects whether the user speaks or not and gives an
indication to the mobile station’s transmission part. When the user is not
speaking the transmission part only sends data in a part of the time slot
and thus the transmission is disconnected and interference is reduced. The
voice detector recognises when speech restarts and simultaneously normal
transmission occurs.
It is obvious that this kind of function reduces interference and thus
improves the quality and frequency band efficiency. However, it is very
difficult to measure the improvement of this discontinuous transmission,
for example in decibel units, in order to be able to take DTX into account
in frequency planning. Moreover, DTX evaluation measurements require
a dense traffic radio network and the improvement has to be
unambiguous. It is globally discussed that the DTX improvement is 3 dB
based on simulations or measurements. This value could be utilised in
frequency planning by reducing the required C/I value but it is not
typically used; this 3 dB is specified as an additional margin to ensure
radio network quality.

7.4.3 
Power control
Power control is a similar function to discontinuous transmission when
concerning frequency planning: it is obvious that it reduces interference
but it is still not to be utilised in frequency planning because its effect on
the planning criteria is unclear. The aim of power control is to minimise
the base station’s and mobile station’s power consumption and thus also
to minimise transmission power and interference. In addition, power
control’s aim is to have a sufficient good and constant field strength level
at the base station’s and mobile station’s reception locations where the
received field strength may be much higher. This means in other words that
all the situations where too much power is used for maintaining the base
station–mobile station connection are noted and this extra power is filtered.
The performance of power control and moreover its influence on the
interference level in the radio network depends strongly on the power
control strategy. Power control works by defining the maximum (upper
limit) and minimum (lower limit) receiving values before starting to
increase or decrease the power, see Figure 7.8. The aim is to have the
received field strength level between these limits and power is increased
or decreased by steps in order to keep the receiving level between these
limits. If there is a huge difference between the limits, the transmission
level can vary and it also takes time to adjust the optimised transmission
level. In this case the interference reduction is also lower and only the
highest interference peaks are filtered. Correspondingly, power control is
very quick and efficient in reducing interference if the window between
the limits is narrow. This strategy causes power control to happen often
(loads the base station controller) and its influence on the handovers has to
be taken into account.
Team LRN

172        RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Even if the power control strategy is well-known it is still difficult to
measure the power control’s performance and even more difficult to
define a power control planning criteria and thus it is better to have power
control improvement as an additional margin for frequency planning.
Moreover, power control is better understood as a feature to avoid the
extreme interference areas in variable environments such as in urban
areas.
7.4.4 
Multilayer radio networks
Frequency band efficiency can be improved by introducing multilayer
radio networks in order to increase capacity in radio interface. The
multilayer radio network means that physically the base station coverage
areas totally overlap as shown in the Figure 7.9 or frequencies
(transceivers) are used only at certain locations at the base station
coverage area. When the coverage areas overlap and different base
stations are used, these base stations are named as macro or micro base
stations based on coverage area size (depending mostly on the antenna
height). When a certain frequency is used inhomogeneously at the base
station’s coverage area, this frequency is named as an overlay (can be
used over the whole coverage area) or underlay (can be used only very
close to the base station when the C/I is good enough, can also be called a
micro layer) frequency.
When micro base stations are introduced in the radio network, the
frequency band is typically split and the frequency assignment for these
Team LRN

Frequency Planning
173
micro base stations is done manually based on the measurements. This
manual assignment has been used because propagation models are not
good enough and they can not model the radio wave propagation. The
micro base stations or frequency band splitting have no major influences
on the frequency planning parameters or frequency planning process.
The overlay–underlay multilayer strategy has a stronger influence on
frequency planning because frequency planning thresholds (C/I target
values) have to be re-defined and frequency grouping has to be done by
taking into account that overlay and underlay frequencies do not interfere
with each other and also to group underlay frequencies at the same base
station site. These micro transceivers (underlay frequencies) have been the
subject of the frequency grouping exercise throughout this chapter.
Having selected 6 frequencies for each underlay transceiver layer in order
to avoid using the same frequencies at the same three base station sites,
these frequency splitting and groupings of the normal frequency planning
process can be carried out using the relevant C/I target values.

Conclusions
Having discussed frequency planning and the key frequency planning
instructions in order to guarantee high capacity and high quality for the
radio network, the meaning of the frequency planning criteria and
especially the meaning of frequency grouping was emphasised, which
offers a solution to avoid interference caused by the intermodulation. The
highlights of this chapter are gathered in Table 7.2.

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
8. OPTIMISATION
The radio system planning process as described in Chapter 2
mentioned that optimisation and monitoring is the last part in radio
network planning. Monitoring was linked to optimisation because they
both partly include the same measurements. Monitoring results are needed
and used during the whole radio planning process and thus optimisation is
actually the real final phase in the radio network planning process. By the
optimisation phase the coverage, capacity and frequency plans have
already been carried out and implemented and the monitoring results can
be measured from the operative network. Hence, the primary purpose of
optimisation is to verify and improve the actual radio plan by taking into
account the radio network evolution as
• 
subscriber growth
• 
radio interface traffic
• 
coverage demands (indoor/outdoor coverage)
• 
radio quality
• 
overall radio network functionality.
Optimisation considers all these individual topics in the different
optimisation phases which can be presented in two main areas called
network assessment and network verification and tuning as shown in
Figure 8.1.
It can be seen in Figure 8.1 that optimisation work mainly concerns the
cost-efficiency and overall quality of the radio network, again.
Optimisation is required because the subscriber requirements, base station
Team LRN

Optimisation 
179
functionalities and available frequency band are continuously changing.
The radio network assessment phase in Figure 8.1 can also be called pre-
optimisation or an analysing phase. In this analysis are gathered the key
performance indicators and performed field measurements from the
specific radio network area in order to find the optimisation areas
(coverage, capacity, interference, functionality) where the radio network
should be improved. The key performance indicators (see Chapter 9)
monitor all the key areas in the radio network and they basically reveal
if the cost-efficiency or quality (coverage, capacity, speech/data
transmission quality; off-set against the interference level) are low in the
radio network.
Next the different planning areas have to be verified in order to find
detailed reasons for coverage, capacity, interference or functionality
problems and this phase is called network verification and tuning. In this
verification and tuning phase the radio network configuration is also
adjusted to achieve radio system planning targets. The network tuning
contains the final problem solving actions like
• 
to change the base station site configurations
• 
to tilt antennas, to turn antenna direction, to change antennas
• 
to change the radio parameters
• 
to build higher or lower antenna masts
• 
to move antenna locations
• 
to move base stations
in order to change the base station coverage or dominance areas to balance
the traffic (to improve the usage) or to improve the quality or handovers
and thus overall call success rate. The required actions have to be
clarified step by step by trying always to avoid moving base stations or
building new base stations which may in the worst case be the only
possible solutions to improve the radio network quality.
8.1 
Optimisation tools
In order to be able to perform successful optimisation work some
essential optimisation tools are needed. These optimisation tools can be
divided into three categories like
• 
database tools
• 
radio planning tools
• 
measurement tools.
Team LRN

180 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Database tools are required to manage the base station site
configurations. The essential radio planning parameters for (for example)
coverage planning are the antenna height, antenna type, antenna
direction, antenna tilt, cable length and type, diversity technique, LNA
parameters, combiner type and BTS transmission RF peak power. These
parameters can not automatically be found from the same database and
there is considerable work ahead in the optimisation phase if these base
station site configurations have not been managed properly.
Radio planning tools are, of course, needed to calculate the base
station coverage or dominance areas and especially for the coverage plan
post-processing to predict interference and to allocate frequencies to the
base station sites. In some cases the advanced radio network simulators
could also be useful if they work properly.
Measurement tools are required to analyse the base station traffic,
coverage, speech quality and handovers to the neighbour base stations in
the downlink and uplink directions. There are several tools on the market
available to fulfil these requirements and a set of these tools have to be
selected based on the available functions. Note that different tools are
typically required for the downlink and uplink measurements. Network
Management System (NMS) typically gathers data in the uplink direction
and the mobile/PC combination is used to measure the downlink direction.
The NMS typically measures the capacity (traffic in Erlangs and
blocking) and the function of the radio network (handovers, handover
failures and drop calls) over a certain area at any time of the day on a base
station basis or area basis. Moreover, coverage and quality can be
measured together in the downlink direction (NMS measures in the uplink
direction) and these measurements have to show
• 
field strength
• 
bit-error-rate (BER) in the radio networks without frequency
hopping
• 
frame-erasure-rate (FER) in the radio networks 
with
frequency hopping
• 
frequency channel
• 
frequency channels of neighbour base stations
• 
measurement location.
Team LRN

  181
These measurements are first used in the network assessment phase
and they are essential when studying the radio network Quality of Service
(coverage, capacity, interference and functionality) in detail.
8.2 
Radio network assessment
In a radio network assessment field measurements of coverage,
capacity and interference can usually be measured simultaneously. First
selected is an optimisation area (for example based on the key
performance indicators) which contains a group of base stations (around
10–20). Next, the base station (coverage or) dominance (serving area)
areas are measured and simultaneously interference (bit-error-rate (BER)
or frame-erasure-rate (FER)) and call and handover success rates which
indicate potential radio channel blocking or handover problems. All these
measurements are done in the downlink direction by using the mobile/PC
combination to determine the radio network performance at exact mobile
station locations. At the same time statistical measurements in the NMS
are gathering information about the uplink field strength levels, quality
and handovers. Moreover, these NMS measurements determine the actual
traffic (by a base station basis or area basis), congestion, dropped calls and
handover failures. After collecting this uplink and downlink information
the actual analysis work is commenced in order to understand which
planning areas (coverage, capacity or interference) require optimisation.
8.2.1 
Coverage assessment
Base station coverage areas are checked and the results are compared
with the radio planning predictions. This comparison should indicate if
there is a huge difference between the planned and operative radio
network. If there are any concerns relating to improvement or requiring
verification of the operative coverage the
• 
coverage limited configuration management, and
• 
radio plan verification
optimisation tasks are started (network verification).
8.2.2 
Capacity assessment
Capacity assessment or analysis often starts from the key performance
indicators because the most important statistical results can be found from
the NMS which shows the total traffic, congestion (or blocking) and drop
calls hour by hour on a base station or area basis. The area values can be
Team LRN

182 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
used to analyse the usage or efficiency of the deployed base station
subsystem (BSS) and the base station values indicate the detailed
functionality of the radio network. These base station traffic, blocking and
drop call values can and have to be linked to the base station coverage and
dominance values before the capacity limited configuration management
work can be started to determine radio network performance
improvements in detail.
8.2.3 
Interference assessment
Interference assessment or analysis is started as bad key performance
indicators and BER or FER measurements are obtained in the uplink or
downlink direction. The purpose of these interference (also called quality)
measurements is to find the possible interference areas in the radio
network. If the NMS or mobile/PC measurements indicate interference the
verification of the whole radio plan has to be started because the
frequency allocation is very sensitive to radio propagation predictions.
When the radio plan has been verified it is time to adjust the frequency
allocation and its result. Because frequencies are typically reused as often
as possible there is often used a so called “top ten strategy” in a frequency
planning assessment. This “top ten strategy” means that, for example
every week the ten worst interfered base stations are solved and some
improvements are performed in the network in order to improve quality in
these base stations. These improvements may cause ten new problem base
stations and thus quality problems are not solved but they are moved to a
new location. This “top ten strategy” has to be used very carefully.
8.2.4 
Functionality assessment
Having established good coverage and enough capacity without
interference, calls may still be dropped because of incorrect radio
parameter settings which have an effect on the radio network
functionality. The radio parameters and neighbouring settings are the last
detailed part of the optimisation process. The radio resource and mobility
management as well as handovers and power control functionalities have
to be analysed by using the OMC and mobile/PC measurement results.
8.3 
Radio network verification and tuning
The configuration management work (see Figure 8.1) is strongly
related to the base station coverage and capacity balance: the larger the
Team LRN

Optimisation 
183
base station dominance area the higher the traffic through the base station
and vice versa. The aim of configuration management is always to
maximise the base station coverage and capacity by taking into account
the cost-efficiency and Quality of Service (key performance indicators). In
order to optimise the cost-efficiency and the QOS the configuration
management have to always be done over a certain area (a group of base
stations) and the coverage and capacity limited situations have to be
separated! In the coverage limited situation the capacity is not an issue at
all—typically only one transceiver is required at the base station—and
only the radio network coverage has to be deployed with minimum costs.
Correspondingly, in the capacity limited situation
2–4
or more
transceivers are needed at each base station and this causes coverage
limitations, e.g. because of the combiners.
8.3.1 
Coverage limited configuration management
The coverage limited radio networks have to be especially planned for
rural areas where continuous coverage is required to have a service and
where capacity is typically very low. In these areas it is critical to study
the coverage over a certain area or coverage over a certain distance, from
point A to B as shown in Figure 8.2.
Radio planning over a certain area or distance is critical because the
aim is to optimise the radio network costs, possible by:
• 
minimising the number of base station sites (= optimising the
base station site configuration)
or
• 
minimising base station site configurations.
Team LRN

184 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The number of required sites over a certain area or distance depends
primarily on the
• 
regulations in the country (the maximum antenna/mast height,
the land purchase/rental conditions)
• 
available base station site locations (with reasonable work and
costs)
• 
topographic environment.
These primary conditions may cause, for example, that 3 base station
site locations (6 cells or sectors) are required to cover the road from point
A to point B in Figure 8.2 because of a very hilly terrain environment and
available base station site locations. If 2 base station site locations with
maximum allowed path loss (a maximum base station configuration) are
not able to cover the road, 6 cells are required but not necessarily any
more with maximum configuration. It may be enough to have 6 cells
without LNA, diversity reception and other base station accessories. Thus,
the cost-efficiency of the radio network can be maximised by optimising
the base station configurations. The other result could be the reduction in
the number of cells down to 4 if new base station site locations could be
established and by applying LNAs, diversity reception and boosters in
order to utilize the maximum allowed BTS–MS path loss. In this case the
cost of each base station site is higher but the overall costs are lower than
in the case of 3 base station site locations (remember; the less base station
sites the less costs). Not that this work has to be done, of course, in
detailed coverage planning but it is also essential during the network
evolution 
when 
new 
technologies 
like 
GPRS/EDGE/UMTS 
are
introduced (a long-term planning strategy).
8.3.2 
Capacity limited configuration management
Capacity limited configuration management has to be done over a
certain area as in the coverage limited case. Configuration management in
the capacity limited high density traffic areas is not yet as simple as in the
coverage limited areas. Coverage and especially indoor coverage has to be
considered in these high density traffic areas together with capacity. Thus,
the base station dominance area has an essential meaning when base
station coverage and capacity are linked. These base station coverage and
dominance areas have to be checked first because it has to be established
whether the base station dominance areas can be changed without losing
indoor coverage. The dominance area sizes have to be modified in order
Team LRN

Optimisation 
185
to acquire the traffic at each base station. The dominance areas can be
changed by
• 
tilting the base station antenna
• 
modifying the base station site configuration
• 
implementing a new base station or base station site.
If all the neighbour base station dominance areas are maximised and
dominance areas can not be changed by configuration management the
traffic can be balanced only by implementing a new base station. This is
the most expensive solution and thus before applying this solution all
other alternatives have to be checked—to rise the antenna height, to move
the base station site. When the base station dominance areas have been
verified the analysis of capacity and traffic load in the base stations inside
the configuration management area can be started; this is demonstrated by
an example.
Example: capacity versus dominance areas
Figure 8.3 shows a part of the GSM radio network in a semi-urban
medium traffic density area. The configuration management area
concerned is between BTS1, BTS2 and BTS3. The base stations’
configurations and traffic loads during the two busiest hours over an
Team LRN

186 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
area (each base station’s busy hour is also indicated) have been
gathered in Table 8.1.
Figure 8.3 and Table 8.1 show the correlation of the dominance area
and the traffic. BTS2 has the largest dominance area and also the highest
traffic. Because BTS1, BTS2 and BTS3 are serving the same area and
because BTS2 is dominating, the traffic is lower in BTS1 and BTS3.
Moreover, only 60 percent (18.5/30.5) of the theoretical capacity of
30.5 Erl is utilised in this area during the area busy hour (at 20:00) and
thus the radio network cost-efficiency is not maximised. Table 8.1 shows
very clearly that the radio network in this area has at least a huge
overcapacity which is caused at least by too many TRXs but also maybe
by too many base stations because the base station dominance areas are
only few hundreds of meters. This conclusion is the end of the
configuration management verification phase and the next phase is tuning.
In the tuning phase it is determined whether
• 
the number of the base stations can be reduced without losing
coverage
• 
the number of the TRXs in this area can be reduced down
to 5
• 
the TRXs/base stations could be balanced in order to make
the frequency planning easier.
For this tuning the field measurements can still be used to define the
coverage requirements and the long-term area based traffic forecasts to
see if the traffic in the area is increasing slowly or rapidly.
8.3.3 
Interference verification and tuning
Interference in the radio interface means problems in the frequency
allocation or frequency management and these problems can be caused by
Team LRN

Optimisation

inaccurate configuration planning (antenna tilting is not used) or
inaccurate propagation models in coverage planning or inaccurate
frequency planning tool. Figure 8.4 shows an example of the dominance
areas of the neighbour base stations and Figure 8.5 shows the actual
coverage area of the BTS 1.
The frequency channel F1 has been reused at both of the depicted base
stations and interference has been measured at the indicated locations in
Figure 8.6.
Team LRN

188 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Interference in Figure 8.6 is due to lack of tilting (BTS1 coverage area
much larger than dominance area) but it could be because of any
inaccuracy in the radio plan like
• 
quality problems in the digital maps
• 
errors in radio propagation predictions.
Hence, the digital maps have to be verified and adjusted for the
different environments and parameters like
• 
digital map accuracy and resolution,
• 
coordination transfer and
• 
topographic and morphographic digitalisation quality
have to be checked.
Correspondingly, the quality reduction in radio propagation
predictions can be caused by
• 
parameter errors between the planned and implemented base
station site configurations
• 
the errors in the implementation (connectors not joined
properly and there is e.g. water in the antenna cables and thus
there is an additional loss in the cable because of the
implementation error) or
• 
the change in the propagation environment (new building(s),
new residential area, new highway(s)).
Team LRN

Optimisation 
189
8.3.4 
Radio network functionality verification and tuning (BSS
radio parameters)
The radio network should function correctly and cost-efficiently only
if the mobility management can be handled. The mobility management
means that a radio connection between the base station and the mobile
station has to be maintained even if the mobile station is moving.
Moreover, this means that the mobile station has to get the radio service
from several base stations because one base station covers only a certain
area. These transfers between base stations are called “handovers” and
they have to be done based on a certain criteria. These handovers and their
criteria are controlled by radio parameters which can be categorised to the
classes of:
• 
signalling
• 
radio resource management
• 
mobility management
• 
measurements
• 
handover and power control.
The radio network related (base station subsystem, BSS) parameters
are defined to control all these radio network functionality related issues
in order to know which base station the mobile station should be
established on (signalling), in order to know where the mobile stations are
moving (mobility management), in order to know which frequency can be
used at different mobile station locations (radio resource management), in
order to know when the base stations should be changed during the
connection (handovers), and in order to know how interference could be
minimised (power control). If these parameter settings are not properly
planned and verified the radio network will not work properly even if the
radio network is planned properly.
The BSS radio parameters can also be divided into two main
categories: 
ETSI 
(European 
Telecommunications 
Standardisation
Institute) specific parameters and base station subsystem supplier specific
parameters. ETSI has specified the general GSM parameters in order to
describe the basic functionality of the GSM radio system. In addition to
this all equipment suppliers can have their own software features and
parameters compatible with the ETSI GSM specifications. The supplier
related parameters are typically innovations to improve signalling,
mobility, radio resource, and handover or power control. These supplier
related features and parameters can not prevent any other basic
Team LRN

190
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
functionality and they typically have to be independent of the mobile
station type in order to have wide applicability. All radio parameters also
typically have “default” values that are average values, based on the long-
term experience of different areas, and radio network parameterisation is
usually commenced with these default values; slightly different parameter
values are required for urban, rural and indoor environments.
Different radio parameters are always related to certain radio network
functionality that is controlled by measuring a specific value (e.g. field
strength level, bit-error-rate, mobile station distance from the base
station). Signalling, mobility and radio resource management parameters,
which are not strongly related to the environment (they do not have a
great influence on the base stations’ dominance areas), are typically quite
constant and their values depend more on the base station configurations
or on the whole radio network configuration that is defined in the detailed
planning phase. When the radio network configuration is confirmed
almost all of these parameter values can be defined and they also can be
frozen or locked. Moreover, handover and power control parameters
depend strongly on the environment and they can be used to optimise the
base station’s dominance area. The aim of radio planning is to use certain
base stations on certain coverage areas and also certain frequencies on
certain areas. The purpose of the handover and power control parameters
is to ensure that the base station’s dominance areas are equal with the
existing plan. An unhomogenous environment—as with buildings, road or
street canyons—may cause extraordinary situations in the field and thus
the handovers from the base station to the other may fail. These handover
failures may be caused, for example by the interference peak at a certain
location, and thus handovers should be made earlier or quicker. By
changing the handover or power control parameters the base station
dominance area borders can be optimised to avoid handover failures and
furthermore drop calls. This is a typical verification and tuning task that is
related to the network functionality and radio parameters in the different
environments.
8.3.4.1 BTS 
MS signalling
Signalling here means the radio interface signalling between the BTS
and the MS in the uplink and downlink directions and it is basically
required to inform the mobile station about the radio network
configuration and to inform the base station about the mobile station
position in the field. In order to manage this discussion both in IDLE
Team LRN

Optimisation 
191
(there is no call) and DEDICATED (there is a call) modes signalling
channels, shown in Table 8.2, are needed.
Note that a “channel” does not have a physical meaning here and these
connections, where information is transferred between the base station and
mobile station, are called channels but are definitely not frequency
channels or time slots (but are a part of time slots). The physical meaning
of the signalling “channel” is explained later.
(IDLE/DEDICATED)
The signalling is required in the downlink direction for mainly
informing the mobile station about the radio network configuration.[1]
The broadcast common channels (BCCH) and common control channels
Team LRN

192
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
(CCCH) are used for this purpose. The BCCH contains information about
the radio network and is thus critical. If the BCCH information can not be
decoded by the mobile station it may lose the information about essential
parameters from the network. The CCCH are used for paging (PCH) and
informing (AGCH) the mobile station which slow dedicated control
channel (SDCCH) the mobile station can use before the traffic channel (if
SDCCH is required in call establishment). Thus, the BCCH is sent in both
idle and dedicated mode and the PCH triggers the dedicated mode when
the question is about mobile terminated calls (MTC). The AGCH is used
in the dedicated mode just after the PCH and the random access channel
(RACH) which corresponds to the PCH in the uplink direction.
The dedicated control channels (DCCH) like the slow associated
control channel (SACCH), fast associated control channel (FACCH) and
slow dedicated control channel (SDCCH) are not used continuously but
only when needed. Power control commands are sent on the SACCH and
there is some space left to send short messages if required. The FACCH is
used for the handover commands and this FACCH is actually a normal
traffic channel (TCH) with a flag which says that a TCH is used for
signalling at that moment. The FACCH is thus as fast as the TCH what
means that it is many times faster than the SACCH. Therefore, there are
no actual delays or delay problems during handovers. The SDCCH is used
primarily for short messages, location updates and the call establishment
process. The channel capacities and their requirements are dealt with later
but it can be noted here that the critical signalling channels in the
downlink direction are the PCH, AGCH and SDCCH due to the capacity
and the BCCH due to the interference.
(IDLE/DEDICATED)
The uplink direction has almost the same channels as can be found in
the downlink direction but the usage of them is slightly different. There is
only one common control channel in the uplink direction called the
random access channel (RACH) which always starts the communication
between the MS and BTS. If the call is mobile originated (mobile user
makes a call) the RACH is sent first in the uplink to indicate a need for a
radio channel. The system responses by sending an AGCH which contains
information which SDCCH (frequency, time slot) the mobile station can
use in the next uplink transmission. On the SDCCH the mobile station
sends a service request (e.g. call establishment (speech/data call), location
update), the authentication and ciphering are done and finally the
Team LRN

Optimisation 
193
connection is ready for the speech or data. If the mobile receives a call (a
mobile terminated call) the procedure is the same except the downlink
paging on the PCH starts the process and then the RACH follows.
In the uplink direction the SACCH is fully occupied (there is no space
for anything else) sending the mobile station’s measurement results (from
the neighbour base stations) to the serving base station. It has to be noted
that these measurement results are reported only in the dedicated mode
and in the idle mode there is no connection between the mobile station
and base station (mobile station only receives information from the
network). The power control as well as handover commands are sent on
the FACCH in the uplink direction because the SACCH is full. Moreover,
the SDCCH is used as in the downlink direction.
Channel structures
How and when these signalling channels are used in the downlink and
uplink directions is found in the channel structure which also indicates the
capacity limitations for each channel. The description of the channel
structure starts from the time division multiple access (TDMA) principle
to explain how the frequencies are used (recall Figure 1.4). Initially, all
frequency channels are divided into 8 blocks (0–7) called time slots which
use the same frequency periodically and which together define a TDMA
frame.
These time slots are used to send either traffic (voice/data) or
signalling (messages/commands) and the signalling time slots are usually
used on the first frequency (called BCCH frequency). The number of
signalling time slots depends on the signalling capacity need and the
remaining time slots can be used for the speech/data applications. The
signalling channel requirements as well as the signalling channel structure
can be divided into two groups: the BCCH/CCCH and SDCCH. Both
these groups (meaning all the signalling channels) can be used on the first
time slot (time slot 0) on the BCCH frequency which means that there is a
limited capacity on the PCH/AGCH/SDCCH but 7 time slots can be used
for the speech/data traffic. If this configuration does not provide enough
signalling capacity, the BCCH/CCCH and SDCCH can be separated to
different time slots and thus these configurations are called combined and
separated (recall Figure 6.2), respectively.
Team LRN

RADIO 1NTERFA CE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
As mentioned the combined configuration provides one more time slot
for the traffic but decreases the signalling capacity and the separated
configuration does the opposite. The required channel configuration
depends typically on the SDCCH and PCH capacity needs which are
studied next by focusing initially on the detailed signalling channel
structure on the time slot zero in the combined and separated
configurations. The signalling channels in the combined signalling
configuration on the time slot zero are shown in Figure 8.7 in the
downlink and uplink direction.
Note that there are only 3 CCCH blocks (a block equals 4 consecutive
time slots which is a full message) and 4 SDCCH blocks in the combined
configuration in the downlink direction which is critical because the
CCCH blocks still have to be divided between the PCH and AGCH.
Figure 8.7 also shows that one time slot (ts0) is used for the several
signalling “channels” and thus the signalling channels are called
signalling logical channels. Each signalling logical channel (a block)
performs the signalling procedures of one mobile station and thus time
slot zero is used for the signalling of several mobile stations. If the
combined configuration is compared to the separated configuration that is
presented in Figure 8.8 and Figure 8.9, it can be seen that the only
difference is in the number of the CCCH and SDCCH blocks (9 CCCH
blocks on the ts0 and 8 SDCCH block on the ts1).

Because it has been mentioned several times that the PCH/AGCH and
SDCCH capacities are in the key role when defining the signalling
parameters it is now time to take examples about these signalling
channels.

Example of Paging CHannel (PCH)
This example concerns
• 
the combined BCCH/SDCCH configuration
• 
because it may limit the paging capacity due to only three
CCCH blocks for the PCH and AGCH purposes. In this
combined configuration
• 
one CCCH block is reserved for the AGCH and 2 blocks for
the PCH and
• 
4 mobile stations can be paged per paging channel block
when the temporarily mobile subscriber identification (TMSI)
is used
• 
and it can be calculated straightforwardly that
• 
4 pages/blocks * 2 blocks = 8 pages every 51-frames
multiframe (235 ms, see Figure 8.7),
• 
and finally ((3600 * 1000) / 235) * 8 > 120000 paged MS per
busy hour.
This means that 120000 mobile stations (or mobile terminated calls) can
be paged during a busy hour at every base station where 2 CCCH blocks
are reserved for the PCH. This figure indicates only that there can be
made approximately 120000 mobile terminated calls (typically around 70
percent of all calls are mobile terminated) during a busy hour. This paging
capacity is required for the whole location area and the maximum location
area size (number of base stations) can finally be estimated when the total
traffic and the ratio of mobile originated and terminated calls in the area
are known. Also some margin have to be left for re-paging.
Example of SDCCH
This SDCCH example considers mostly the influence of the call
establishment and the location updates (note location area borders) on
the SDCCH capacity. The short message load can be studied from the
network and is not included as it can vary a lot. This example shows
that the location updates load the SDCCH excessively and thus the
location area borders have to be planned carefully. The call
establishments load the SDCCH based on the
• 
base station configuration: 2 TRXs / cell 
8.11 Erl / cell
(1 percent blocking probability)
• 
average traffic per subscriber: 1.5 min / subs / BH = 25 mErl /
subs
Team LRN

Optimisation 
197
• 
number of subscribers: 8.11 Erl / cell /25 mErl / subs =
325 subs/cell
• 
authentication and ciphering = 4 s = 1.1 mErl / call (SDCCH
reservation time)
• 
325 calls / cell * 1.1 mErl / call = 0.3575 Erl / cell
(SDCCH)
and correspondingly the location updates (time periodic only) requires
the following SDCCH reservation:
• 
each mobile station makes a location update once in
60 minutes (this is based on the parameter settings)
• 
325 subs / cell
• 
SDCCH reservation time for location update = 4 s = 1.1 mErl
• 
325 calls / cell * 1.1 mErl / call = 0.3575 Erl / cell
(SDCCH)
When these SDCCH reservations (in Erlangs) are calculated together
and studied with the SDCCH channel requirements in Erlang-B table (see
Table 6.1) it can be noted that 4 SDCCHs are needed for this
configuration (each subscriber makes one call per busy hour and one
location update) and thus the combined channel structure is enough and
there is still some space for the short messages. This SDCCH example, as
well as the previous PCH example, shows the capacity limitations of these
signalling channels and indicates the purposes of the signalling
parameters.
8.3.4.2 Radio resource management
Radio resource management concerns the management of the radio
connection between the base station and mobile station. This management
has to be done when the mobile station is in the IDLE or DEDICATED
mode and can be divided into two main parts; IDLE mode control and
DEDICATED mode control. In both these modes the mobile station has to
be informed of the access to use the base stations and about the usage of
the radio resources of the base stations. Simultaneously, the radio system
controls the access and the radio resources that are used by the mobile
station. The access management in both IDLE and DEDICATED modes
contains a group of IDs and a group of parameters to define when the base
stations can be used (the actual “access parameters”). Correspondingly,
the radio resources are controlled by a group of parameters to define the
best radio quality for the BTS–MS connection. Thus, the radio resource
management parameters really control the IDLE mode (first the IDs and
Team LRN

198
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
then the actual access) and DEDICATED mode (the access, the radio
resource allocation and release) and the most important parameters related
to this mobile call process (IDLE mode, BTS access, DEDICATED mode,
radio resource allocation, call release) are explained in this order.
IDs (IDLE mode)
Different IDs are required to separate different radio networks from
each others. Frequencies separate different operators in the same country
but in country border areas the same frequency bands may being used and
thus different IDs are definitely required. Radio network IDs also help the
mobile station to recognise the base stations of the own network which is
critical for billing and in special situations such as emergency calls.
Moreover, radio network IDs can be utilised in the gathering of statistical
data because the results can be connected to the location areas or to
certain base stations. The essential and ETSI specific IDs are presented in
Table 8.3 that shows two main parameterisation items called base station
identity code (BSIC) and location area ID (LAI).
BSIC is actually the combination of the base station colour code
(BCC) and network colour code (NCC) and can be calculated by using
modulo 8 method meaning that the value of the BSIC = 8*NCC + BCC.
This BSIC value is needed to separate the co-channel frequencies from
each other when mobile stations are measuring the received power levels
of the neighbour base stations in the downlink direction (see Figure 8.10).
These measurements are performed on the BCCH frequencies and the
results are used to select the best base station (the best server) in the IDLE
mode and to evaluate and trigger handovers in the DEDICATED mode.
The location area ID (LAI) is another critical group of IDs containing
mobile country code (MCC), mobile network code (MNC) and location
Team LRN

Optimisation 
199
area code (LAC). The MCC and MNC are defined by the MoU
(Memorandum of Understanding between operators) and LACs have to be
defined during the planning process. The same LAC has to be used for the
same location area and thus it is critical to use correct LAC values in order
to avoid unnecessary location areas and location updates. The base station
IDs are not mentioned in Table 8.3 but they are of course also needed for
each base station.
Access (IDLE mode)
When each base station has its own IDs (BTS ID, BSIC, LAI), the
access (or access control) to these base stations at the different mobile
station locations has to be defined. Access definition begins with the
parameters which define whether use of the base station is permitted. It is
critical to know [2]
• 
the frequency
• 
whether the base station is barred or not
• 
whether call re-establishment is allowed or not
• 
whether the emergency calls are permitted or not
• 
whether the specific mobile station classes are not allowed
use at the base station.
Team LRN

200 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Typically, these parameters have the fixed values which are presented
in Table 8.4. The last parameter in Table 8.4, PLMN permitted, controls
the mobile station measurements. The mobile station measures the
frequencies that are required by the system but the mobile station reports
and utilises only the measurement results which have the correct PLMN
permitted value. Thus the PLMN permitted parameter is critical e.g. in the
country border areas. All these above mentioned parameters define the
permission to use the base station and precede the IDLE mode access
parameters, that control the radio link (define the best server).
In the IDLE mode (as in the DEDICATED mode) it is to be defined
whether the base station can be used and which base station is the best
server. First, the parameter rx_level_access_min (see Table 8.5) defines
the minimum level that the base station can be used in the call
establishment. Next, this same parameter and ms_tx_power_max_CCH
(mobile station’s maximum transmission power in call establishment) are
used in the equation C1 to define the best server
C1 = (A – max(B,0))
A 
= averaged receiving level – p1
B 
= p2 – maximum RF output power of the mobile station
p1 
= rx_level_access_min
p2 
= ms_tx_power_max_CCH.
The received power levels from the defined neighbour base stations
are measured by the mobile, C1 values are calculated (by the mobile), C1
values are compared (by the mobile) and the base station with the highest
C1 is selected as the best server every 5 s. If the base station has 1 dB
better C1 value than the others it is the best server excluding the location
area border where hysteresis are used in order to avoid too many location
updates. This hysteresis is defined by the cell_reselect_hysteresis [3]
parameter and it is used when comparing the C1 values between the base
stations from different location areas. The base station from the new
location area is selected as the best server only when it is e.g. 6 dB better.
Team LRN

Optimisation 
201
The more advanced base station selection called C2 can also be
applied for example for multilayer (dual band) networks when one layer is
wanted to be prioritised to have call establishment. The network has to
indicate to the mobile station by parameter cell_reselect_param_ind [3]
whether it has to use C2 procedure. Simultaneously, the network sends the
parameter values to the mobile station to calculate the C2 values, using
the equations:[3]
A basic example of using C2 is to set the parameter penalty_time < >
11111 and temporary offset = 0 dB what means that equation C2 = Cl +
cell_reselect_offset. If the value of the parameter cell_reselect_offset is
for example 10 dB the base station has 10 dB higher C2 value and it is 10
dB more favourable.
Access/IDs (DEDICATED mode)
Base station selection is the last phase in the IDLE mode control
before the mobile originated or mobile terminated call (MOC/MTC)
establishment procedure. When these procedures have started it can be
said that the mobile station is in DEDICATED mode and more control is
required. First of all, the mobile station still needs all the same IDs as in
the IDLE mode and in addition BCCH frequencies of the neighbour base
stations in order to measure the right neighbour base stations. All this
information is sent to the mobile station on the system information
messages on the SACCH signalling channel.
The main concern of the radio resource management in the
DEDICATED mode is to manage the radio resource control as
frequencies and time slots and the IDs are not concerned too much
because they are the same as in the IDLE mode. The key areas in this
radio resource control are the traffic channel allocation and the influence
of the extra features such as frequency hopping. The basic idea of traffic
channel allocation is based on the minimisation of interference in the
downlink and uplink directions. This can be controlled only in the uplink
direction by the base station by measuring the free time slots (time slots
Team LRN

202
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
which have no traffic). When the base station measures the time slot
without traffic the measurement result has to be noise or interference
(from the mobiles using the same channel at another base station) because
there is no traffic. The measured power levels are divided into different
categories by parameter and the time slot with the lowest interference
level can be selected. The frequencies are also selected by using different
algorithms as for example to prefer BCCH frequencies first or to use all
frequencies in turn.
When the frequency and the time slot are selected the base station (and
mobile station) has to know how to use them and this depends on the
applied frequency usage related features as frequency hopping that
contains some more detailed parameters.
8.3.4.3 Mobility management
Signalling takes care of the conversation between the network and the
mobile station and this conversation mainly contains the key information
about the network. Radio resource management mainly contains the usage
of the radio elements, as frequencies and time slots. Correspondingly
measurements and handovers which are strongly related to radio resource
management are considered as separate topics. Mobility management
exists in all these areas and has to be generally understood and highlighted
as key aspect regarding the mobile location in the network in IDLE and
DEDICATED mode.
The mobility management can be considered as the radio resource
management by starting from the IDLE mode, analysing the
DEDICATED mode, and finally concerning the functions related to call
release. In the IDLE mode the network only knows the location area
where the mobile station is and uses this information for paging. This is
the reason why the mobile station has to inform the network every time
it changes location area. Thus the C1 or C2 parameters and the
cell_reselect_hysteresis [3] could also be related to the mobility
management. In addition the time periodic location update is used to
ensure that the mobile station is still in the network and to ensure that the
information about the mobile station in the network is still correct.[l]
When the mobile station makes a call or receives a call it starts the
DEDICATED mode and the network knows the mobile station location in
the base station level because the network (master) controls the radio
resources and the mobile station functions based on the orders coming
Team LRN

Optimisation 
203
from the network (the mobile is slave); for example the network orders the
mobile station to perform a handover to the certain target base station.
Thus, the measurements and handovers and their parameters can be
related to the mobility management (or to the radio resource
management). When the mobile drops or finishes the call, the call drop
(abnormal release) or normal call release occurs. After releasing the
connection the mobile station has to update the location if it has changed
during the call. If the location area is the same as at the beginning of the
call the mobile station starts to analyse the C1 or C2 criteria. In this IDLE
mode there is still the IMSI_attach_detach [2] parameter which controls
whether the mobile station is switched on or off. The mobile station sends
MSI attach or detach automatically (if the function is used) to the
network to inform that it is in the network or not. These are the main
parameters and functions to control the mobile stations movements in the
IDLE or DEDICATED modes.
8.3.4.4 Measurements and measurement processing
Measurements are required to control the radio resource and mobility
management, meaning that the network has to offer the best server (the
best base station equals the best frequency and the best overall quality) for
the mobile station at different locations. If the neighbour base station has
better quality or better power level the handover to that base station has to
be done based on the handover criteria. In addition to these actions the
power levels of the mobile stations and base stations can be controlled in
order to decrease interference. This power controlling is also based on the
measurements done by the base stations and mobile stations.
Measurements are done in the same way in the uplink and downlink
directions and thus it is enough to consider the mobile station
measurements because these contain some limitations which do not
happen in the uplink direction (the base station has enough time and
capacity to do the measurements almost as necessary). The mobile station
reports (sends) the measurement results of the six best neighbour base
stations and the serving base station every 480 ms. During this SACCH
period the mobile station measures the neighbour base stations (maximum
32 neighbours) and decodes the BSICs of these base stations. The
measurement results are not reported to the base station if the BSIC is not
decoded or if the measurement results are coming from the base station
which has an incorrect PLMN permitted value.
Team LRN

204
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
After measuring the uplink and downlink directions the measurement
results are gathered to the base station where the pre-averaging is done if
required. After pre-averaging the base station starts to average the
measurement results or the results are sent to the base station controller
where they are averaged.
The averaging process (for the uplink and downlink directions) is done
for the bit-error-rate (called quality in the GSM) and the received power
level measurements. The parameters p, n and window_size are critical [3]
to achieve the appropriate results. The window_size defines how many
results are averaged and the p and n values how many averaged results (p)
have to exceed e.g. the handover threshold inside a certain window (n).
Figure 8.11 shows the values of the received power and quality
measurements. Note that decibel units are used in the power level
measurements and correspondingly the mean BER values (the values
0.14–18.1) are used when calculating the quality results. The last value
called QUAL is a GSM quality class that is used in handovers and power
controls.
These units have a strong effect on the averaging strategy and the
following example demonstrates the inaccuracy of quality level
measurements. The measured values (GSM quality classes) are
0 (the mean used in the calculation is 0.14), 0, 7 (the mean is 18.1) and 0.
Team LRN

Optimisation 
205
The averaged value is straightforward
(0.14 + 0.14 + 18.1 + 0.14) / 4 = 4.63
which corresponds to the quality class 5 (see Figure 8.11) which
furthermore would cause a handover if a typical handover threshold 4
were used in the network. Hence, only one bad sample (quality class 7)
would maybe cause an unnecessary handover that may deteriorate the
overall quality (functionality) in the network. Thus, the averaging of the
quality samples does not necessarily correspond to the situation in the
field.
8.3.4.5 Handovers
Handovers have to be performed in order to offer the best radio quality
to the mobile stations at the different locations in the network. The
decision to make a handover is made based on the uplink and downlink
power level and quality measurements and final handover triggering
happens by using the handover algorithms in the base station and/or base
station controller which command the mobile station to the new target
base station. The handovers can be divided into a few main groups called
• 
power level handovers (uplink and downlink)
• 
quality handovers (uplink and downlink)
• 
better base station
handovers—power budget and other
supplier based handovers.
All these handovers contain the same process with a few phases which
have to be understood in order to understand the usage of the parameters
for these different phases. The handover process includes
• 
the measurement result and the handover threshold
comparison
• 
the evaluation of the six best neighbour base stations
• 
the target base station selection
phases. The handover process begins after the averaging process with the
measurement result and handover threshold comparison as presented in
Figure 8.12.
Team LRN

206
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The measurement result and the handover threshold comparison
This comparison is made between the serving and the neighbouring
base stations by utilising the supplier based handover algorithms. The first
purpose of this comparison is to solve when the different handovers are
triggered (handover algorithms are required for all types of handover) and
second to solve which neighbour base stations fulfil the conditions of
function as a new serving base station (the evaluation of the six best
neighbour base stations).
The first part of the handover threshold comparison—the handover
triggering—begins by studying which handovers are triggered in the
uplink or downlink directions after each new measurement result (after
each SACCH period). All different handover types can be checked after
each SACCH period and the averaged results are used for this purpose. In
Figure 8.12 the last power level sample of the serving base station in the
downlink direction is 36 (in the GSM units), the averaging window is four
samples and thus the averaged value after the last sample is 39. The
handover threshold for the downlink in this example is 39 for the power
level and thus at this point the power level handover would be triggered if
p = 1 and n = 1. Correspondingly, the last four downlink quality samples
of the serving base station are four, four, five and four (note that
averaging is not used for the quality samples). The quality handover is
Team LRN

Optimisation 
207
triggered after sample value 5 if the typical threshold value four would be
considered with the values p = 3 and n = 4 and if averaging is not used.
The same comparison for the power levels and quality has to be made also
in the uplink direction. Additionally, it has to be remembered that the
better base station handovers like power budget handovers also have to be
checked. If the different handover types are triggered at the same time the
priority of the handover types would define which handover type would
be used as a reason to make a handover. The handover priorities are
typically classified as
• 
uplink/downlink quality
• 
uplink/downlink level
• 
better base station ( power budget and others).
When the thresholds have been compared and the handover type
(reason) has been solved it is time to define which neighbour base stations
fulfil the conditions of being a candidate target base station. This
candidate base station evaluation is done by using the supplier based
handover algorithms.
Neighbour base station evaluation
The neighbour base station evaluation is a process where all the best
neighbour base stations are compared to the serving base station in order
to decide whether each neighbour base station is able to provide better
service (overall quality: coverage, capacity and BER) than the actual
serving base station. This evaluation is done based on the supplier based
handover algorithms and the result is the group of candidate base stations
for the handover target and the final target base station is selected from
this group of candidates.
8.3.4.6 Power control
Power control is the other function that utilises the uplink and
downlink measurement results to control the base station and mobile
station power in order to decrease interference and save power
consumption of the equipment in the radio network. The aim is to make
the power control before the handovers because handovers should always
have higher priority than power controls. It also has to be remembered
that on BCCH frequency the power control can not be used in the
downlink direction because continuous transmission is required.
Team LRN

208
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The principle of power control is to define an upper limit and lower
limit and the received power and quality level should be maintained inside
of this window in order to optimise power consumption and quality in the
radio network. Figure 8.13 shows this principle of power control and
power control parameters in case of the received level. It can be seen in
Figure 8.13 that parameters are needed to define the upper and lower
limits and, of course, the time period when triggering happens.
This window is typically set by 10 dB hysteresis (the difference
between the upper and lower limits) which may be even too high. The
window of 4 dB optimises the received power level more accurately and
may provide even better radio quality but it also loads the system much
more. However, there are no system limitations (e.g. signalling) that
primarily prevent such a fast power control.

Conclusions
The topics of optimisation (of the radio network configuration and a
short explanation of the most important radio parameter areas) led to an
understanding of the optimisation process and the observation of two key
issues of radio network optimisation: configuration management and radio
network functionalities (see Table 8.6).

RADIO NETWORK MONITORING
The last and one of the most essential parts of the radio network
system planning process is monitoring. Monitoring is a key function in
learning about actual radio network performance and in finding correct
radio network assessment areas to be focused in order to improve the
radio interface Quality of Service (QOS). Monitoring has to be done
continuously and it has to be based on radio system planning targets in
order to support the achievement of these targets. Long-term monitoring
results can be used as an input value for dimensioning work (for the radio
network extensions) and short-term results for optimisation work.
Moreover, monitoring can be divided into radio network functionality
and radio network configuration monitoring. Network functionality
monitoring is performed by defining the key performance indicators (KPI)
which tell how efficiently the radio network is used and what the QOS of
the radio interface is. Configuration monitoring concentrates on managing
the radio network infrastructure and finding its essential bottlenecks. Both
of these monitoring types also need software applications in order to be
able to show the possible assessment areas.
9.1 
Radio network functionality
Radio network functionality is the first monitoring part and highlights
a good connection between the mobile station and base station. This
connection means actual good quality of speech or high data transmission
rate both of which can be monitored by using the key performance
indicators.
9.1.1 
Key performance indicators
Key performance indicators (KPI) are needed to measure cost-
efficiency and QOS of the radio network and to show the planning areas
which possibly need assessments. These KPIs are divided into these two
main groups which both include different KPIs to inform the performance
of the radio network. The radio network cost-efficiency can be observed
by measuring the effective usage of the network and frequency bandwidth
and by defining certain KPI values to evaluate these topics. Moreover, a
good radio network QOS requires high call success rate which means that
Team LRN

Radio Network Monitoring
213
the user has a successful call attempt, good voice quality and normal call
release. In order to analyse the radio QOS and to understand the radio
network performance in detail, the KPI values such as call success rate,
handover success rate, drop call rate and blocking have to be measured.
Each of these cost-efficiency and QOS key performance indicators can be
measured in different ways, and thus, a consistent measurement method
has to be defined.
9.1.1.1 Radio network cost-efficiency
Cost-efficiency can be analysed by measuring the usage of the radio
network and frequency bandwidth. Usage of the radio network can be
solved by measuring the total traffic over a certain area (containing a
certain number of the base stations) and comparing this value to the
theoretical capacity that is implemented in the radio network (= the total
traffic that can be offered by the implemented transceivers based on the
Erlang tables). It is important to know the network configuration and the
number of the traffic time slots exactly in order to receive correct
information about the network status. In addition, it is required to measure
the traffic and usage over a certain area, containing several base stations
in order to get an understanding of changes in the total traffic and usage.
If only an individual base station is observed, which does not gather
traffic today and which is congested after six months, it is not possible to
conclude whether this base station is working efficiently.
The aim of radio system planning is the planning of a radio network
with a required capacity for a certain area and simultaneously offering a
required coverage. If coverage is not a problem, approximately 80 percent
of the radio network capacity should be used before capacity extensions
are installed. This is an example about an urban area while differing
monitoring targets have to be defined for a rural area where base stations
are mainly implemented due to lack of coverage. Optimised cost-
efficiency can be achieved in rural areas by increasing antenna heights so
that base stations can cover such an area that contains enough traffic and
that could be served over the next five years while taking into account the
traffic increase forecast. In practice this kind of strategy is typically not
possible because of limitations by the government for maximum antenna
height and lower target value while 35–50 percent for the usage are
typically accepted in rural areas. Antenna heights between 100–120 m
are also avoided by claiming that high antenna positions cause
interference to urban areas which is actually false. Interference can be
Team LRN

214
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
avoided by tilting and increasing antenna height in steps (35 ... 50 ... 75
... 100 m) when moving away from the city.
When measuring the usage of the radio network, the maximum traffic
need has to be found for the measured area. A value that could be called
an area busy hour. The area busy hour usually has to be addressed by
tailor-made functions as commercial database programs do not necessarily
support this kind of analysis. NMS measurements and post-processing
tools are still required in order to gather raw data that can be analysed.
The area based measurement takes into account the short-term daily
changes, when people move for instance between their homes and offices,
and long-term changes, for example, new residential and office buildings.
Short-term changes cause the maximum usage of the 80 percent in urban
areas and thus 20 percent is reserved as a margin for the daily changes in
the urban area. This typical value of 20 percent daily change can be
obtained by calculating the total traffic from a certain area by using
• 
busy hour values from each base station (the highest traffic at
each base station during a day period) and
• 
area busy hour value (the highest traffic over the area over
one hour during a day period).
Typically the area busy hour is 15–20 percent lower value than the
sum of the busy hour traffics if the area contains both business and
residential types. This means that a 20 percent over-capacity is needed in
the radio network because of the short-term daily changes.
The long-term changes represent a clear and continuous traffic
increase over an area busy hour as in the case of a new residential area or
an extension of an existing area. In these cases the busy hour occurs daily
at the same time and the traffic increases incrementally due to new
subscribers. In another example a new office building is built in a
residential area but the area busy hour is still in the evening because
private subscribers are loading the radio network more than the office
building subscribers during the day. In this case new transceivers are not
needed for the base station because people in the office and residential
buildings are not loading the radio network at the same time. Therefore,
the area busy hour value is still constant and there are no long-term
changes.
Team LRN

The calculated K values have to be stored in the file and in the long-
term changes in these K values indicate whether the network investments
are too high or low considering the radio network capacity needs.
Additional KPI values like the radio network costs per air time, can thus
also be easily observed.
An another cost-efficiency related KPI value is the efficient use of
frequency bandwidth which is concerned with whether the radio network
capacity is maximized, or in other words, C/I optimised without having
reduction in speech quality. Frequency bandwidth efficiency can be
evaluated by solving the frequency reuse factor that typically varies
between 10–20 in the different radio networks. The actual value of the
frequency reuse factor (FRF) can be easily calculated:
The calculated value indicates whether the radio network plan is
efficient. More detailed key performance indicators can also be created
when an analysis of the detailed reasons of the low cost-efficiency is
needed because of, for instance, inefficient use of the frequency band. Is
the bad frequency efficiency either network configuration or frequency
planning inaccuracy? When analysing base station coverage areas
variations in base station antenna heights also have to be studied. Antenna
height distribution of the base stations indicates directly whether it is
possible to achieve such a low frequency reuse factors as 12–15 in a
particular area even if the base station antennas are above rooftop levels.

When the area busy hour value is measured and the number of the
implemented transceivers at each base station is solved, the usage of the
network (K) for a certain area can be calculated by using the equation

9.1.1.2 Radio network QOS
A high radio network QOS means that call success rate is high while
call establishment and a call release are also successful. Call
establishment may be unsuccessful if radio network is congested, or if
there is interference in the radio network indicating that base station
congestion or blocking and interference have to be measured. In order to
monitor the call release, the handover reasons, failure rates and drop call
rates have to be measured. Drop call rates show where there are problems
in the radio network, and handovers inform of good or poor functionality.
Call establishment
Base station radio interface blocking (lack of signalling or traffic time
slots for speech or data transmission) has to be measured from the real
network and compared to the Erlang formulas (Erlang-B or Erlang-C) in
order to understand the traffic conditions in the radio network. The Erlang
formulas work well in the normal homogenous traffic conditions but there
are higher blocking values when a large group of mobile users tries to
make call establishments simultaneously for instance during or after big
sporting events. The analysis of base station blocking rates should be
made based on the average over a day or week. The following example
shows the influence of an average. There are 20 hours blocking at a base
station during one week (equals a period of 7 * 24 = 168 hours) of which
18 hours have the blocking value of 1 percent and two hours have a
blocking value 35 percent because of a sport event. If the average
blocking over the week is calculated based on the 168 hours (including
days and nights), the average blocking is
[148 * 0 + (18 * 1 + 2 * 35)] /168 = 0.52 percent
and if the average blocking is calculated based only on the hours when the
blocking exists (20 hours) the value is
(18 * 1 + 2 * 35) / 20 = 4.4 percent.
The values 0.52 percent and 4.4 percent are totally different and are
equivalent to the case that there is the same blocking over the whole week
(18 hours 1 percent and 2 hours 35 percent). This example shows that the
averaging does not necessary give the best view about blocking in the
radio network especially if there are high blocking peaks during the
Team LRN

Radio Network Monitoring 
217
analysing period. Therefore, it is better to analyse the behaviour of the
blocking e.g. to calculate the number of blockings that exceed a certain
threshold value (1 percent is typically used in the GSM). This gives a
better view of whether the blocking is constant or happens only
occasionally due to the special conditions in the radio network service
area. The value of 1.0 percent is also generally accepted as a reference for
good access quality and radio network capacity should be dimensioned
based on this value.
In order to analyse the behaviour of the blocking, the base station’s
highest traffic hours have to be found and the blocking values have to be
gathered from these hours. Blocking may not be at its maximum during
the maximum traffic hours because a large number of simultaneous call
attempts (after events) may cause even higher values. These occasional
peak values are filtered and the blocking values during the highest traffic
hours correlate fairly well with the situation in the radio network. Next,
the continuity of the blocking values during the day and week has to be
studied and define the thresholds when the radio network capacity has to
be extended. Typically the blocking threshold is 1.0 percent and is limited
to exceed this threshold value for a of maximum 4–6 hours during the
week (before extension) by excluding the temporary occurrences such as
sport events.
The lack of signalling or traffic time slots (blocking) is the first
possible problem area to prevent successful call establishment and thus
prevent a successful call. Another reason for unsuccessful call
establishment may be interference—often a reason for dropped calls
during the connection. Interference is measured based on the quality
classes that inform the bit-error-rates (BER) in the uplink and downlink
directions. These BER values can be used as a KPI especially in the
networks without frequency hopping. If frequency hopping is utilized in
the radio network, the frame-erasure-rates (FER) should if possible be
used or a new BER threshold is required for observation. The measured
values of the interference can be averaged, for example over a week,
because there should not be peaks but the interference should increase
evenly with traffic increase. Typically the interference threshold in the
non-hopping networks is defined to be 1.6–3.2 percent (equals the GSM
quality class 4, also a quality handover threshold) to ensure a reasonable
quality in the radio network. The target is to have >97 percent of
connections (time or measured values) better than this GSM quality class 4.
In frequency hopping networks the quality class 7 (BER >12.8 percent)
Team LRN

218 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
has to be observed in case of BER observation and the target is to have the
percentage of this quality class 7 close to zero.
Call release
The second area in the radio network QOS is the normal call release
which includes the monitoring of all other types of problems which may
cause an abnormal call release or dropped call in the radio interface. The
drop call rates generally have to be monitored continuously and drop call
reasons should be specified in detail. Call drops typically occur because of
interference or handover failures. Interference and handover success rates
have to be monitored in order to gain detail about drop call reasons.
Interference is monitored in relation to successful call establishments and
the same results can be used also for the drop call rate analysis. The drop
call rate statistics of individual base stations require the same kind of care
as measurements of radio blocking. If neighbouring base stations are
blocked temporarily because of the high traffic peak, the drop call rate
may also be increased if handovers to this blocked base station are
prevented due to lack of traffic time slots. Hence, the equal measurement
and analysis strategy has to be used for drop call rates as for blocking
rates. The highest drop call rates have to be found first based on the traffic
peak hours and then drop call rate behaviour has to be analysed. Finally,
drop call rates of individual base stations have to be compared to the
thresholds and required actions have to be commenced if the thresholds
are exceeded. If more detailed studies are required the interference and
handover statistics give deeper information about the situation and
possible call success problem areas at an individual base station. The drop
call rate threshold that triggers detailed analysis is typically 2 percent
excess 4–6 times during the same week, as in the case of the radio
blocking.
The handover failure or success rates and specifically handover
reasons, give a detailed picture about the function of the radio network.
The handover success rate is typically used as a KPI for the individual
base stations to inform of probability in maintaining a call (see Table 9.1
for KPI summary). The high value (>98 percent) is expected and the more
detailed information concerns the analysis of the handover reasons which
also indicate whether bad functionality in the radio network arises from
interference, the base station’s configuration (more uplink handovers than
downlink handovers 
an unbalanced power budget) or something else.

9.2 
Radio network configuration
The second part of monitoring is the radio network configuration that
has to be documented carefully in order to minimise errors in the radio
system planning due to incorrect information regarding the radio network
infrastructure. This is a valid concern when the radio network includes
thousands of base station sites and one requires knowledge of an exact
number of certain base station site equipment. The answer for this
configuration monitoring is the database that has to include both radio
network configuration and key performance indicators for the long-term
monitoring (recall radio system planning documentation, Figure 2.3).
9.2.1 
Databases
Radio network databases are important to have and maintain as a
description of network configuration for coverage and capacity evolution;
both
base station
configuration and base station antenna line
configuration. Additionally, all parameters related to the radio network
have to be documented and be available.
The base station site database or base station site folder (that was
mentioned in the radio system planning process documentation) has to
define the base station configuration and base station antenna line
configuration.
Team LRN

220
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
This base station site database has to include all the necessary
information about the base station equipment as
• 
type (indoor, outdoor)
• 
transmission power to the antenna port and receiving
sensitivity
• 
combiner type
• 
ground height and location (x, y)
• 
base station antenna height, antenna directions
and all the essential information about the accessory elements (previously
mentioned: low noise amplifiers, power amplifier, diversity technique,
diplexers and so on). Finally, the essential radio network parameters
• 
frequency channels
• 
neighbouring base stations
have to be described in order to define the radio network functionality
strategy (neighbour relations for the handovers, etc.).
This database gives the final and detailed view about the
implementation of the radio network and the special characteristics of the
radio planning for a certain area can be clarified. Example of the base
station site folder is presented in Table 9.2
The key performance indicators (KPI) have to be stored in order to
understand the evolution of radio network cost-efficiency and QOS. The
area based traffic is one of the main KPI values to be monitored as it tells
of the capacity changes which also effect on the QOS and thus on
frequency planning or on base station configurations. These capacity
changes, coverage distributions, quality issues and handovers should all
be gathered in the KPI database at least every two weeks, statistically
recording results that can also be analysed and mapped into the different
software programs to show e.g. the traffic, blocking or dropped calls over
a certain planning area.
Team LRN

Radio Network Monitoring 
221
9.3 
Software programs for monitoring
The software programs are required for monitoring to visualise the
obtained results from the radio network. The aim of the KPI values is to
identify e.g. the number of the base stations where the blocking or drop
call rate is too high. This information is not enough to show a need for a
new transceiver or a new base station to solve radio interface blocking or
whether optimisation work is required. Hence, monitoring results have to
be presented (on a map) at exact base station locations by showing also
antenna directions (and heights if required) in order to understand whether
the blockings or drop call rates occur in the same location or over the
network. Correspondingly, the base station configurations as base station
types can be presented (on a map) to show where certain base station
types are located. This information may show limitations at base stations
to the use of some software features: older base stations for basic coverage
usage could be located in rural areas and newer base stations for capacity
usage with the latest capacity software features could be used in high
capacity urban areas.
The required software programs for monitoring can be divided into
three categories:
• 
network management system (NMS) is needed to gather the
measurement results from the radio network
• 
A NMS post-processing tool/platform is needed to process the
raw data to the required results in the tables
• 
A graphical presentation tool for the detailed analysis.
The NMS typically comprises radio network elements and is thus
supplier related. The NMS post-processing platform can be delivered by
any capable supplier who has the flexible tools to process raw data and to
have a standard interface to export the results (in order to transfer the results
to the graphical presentation). Finally, the results are transferred to the
graphical presentation tool which has to contain a good enough digital map
in order to be able to locate the problem areas. All these programs can be
delivered by the same (in this case it is typically the BSS supplier) or
different supplier. A good solution is to have an integrated platform (radio
planning tool) which contains the interface to the NMS database
(parameters and monitoring results can be sent between the NMS and the
radio planning tool) and which has the capability to show the monitoring
results on the digital map where the base station sites are also located.

Radio network monitoring is one of the key radio system planning
processes as it informs of the radio network performance and monitoring
results can be utilised as input data in radio network dimensioning and
optimisation work. Table 9.3 gathers the key topics of monitoring.

10. 
GENERAL PACKET RADIO SYSTEM (GPRS)
The objectives of the General Packet Radio System (GPRS) are to
enable the packet transmission (to have a communication “always on” and
to use the radio channel, or to transmit, only when needed) and to enhance
the data rate in the radio interface transmission. The GPRS is defined as a
part of the GSM system and is adapted to the GSM system as depicted in
Figure 10.1.
Figure 10.1 shows that the BSS is connected to the GPRS core
network via the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) which is a key
element when the GPRS functionality is designed and installed. The
SGSN also contains functions concerning subscriber management and
billing but these topics will not be discussed. Other GPRS elements or
interfaces do not have a direct influence on the radio system except the
Gs-interface (between MSC and SGSN) that can be used to combine the
GSM and GPRS paging in order to decrease paging capacity. It was
mentioned that the GPRS is needed to enable an “always on” connection
which is invoiced based only on transmitted data. The other reason to

225
have a GPRS or EDGE connection is to enhance the data transmission
rates which are presented in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1 shows
three different development steps in data
transmission in the GSM system. High Speed Circuit Switched Data
(HSCSD) represents the first step by containing the enhanced data rate up
to 57.6 kbit/s (14.4 kbit/s per time slot and maximum 4 time slots for the
connection). The connection in the HSCSD is still circuit switched and
thus the GPRS is the first “always on” based data transmission. The data
rate in the GPRS depends on the radio interface coding and the number of
the time slots to be used. There are four different coding schemes (CS1–
CS4) for the radio interface and they represent bit rates 9.05–21.4 kbit/s
per time slot.[l] These bit rates depend strongly on the radio channel and
they also include, e.g. headers, and thus the final application data
transmission rate is smaller. The maximum number of time slots that can
be used in the GPRS is defined as 8 [1] and thus the maximum theoretical
data rate values 72.4–171.2 kbit/s can be determined as shown in
Table 10.1. However, the average final data transmission rates in the
GPRS are close to the values in the third column in Table 10.1. These
values take into account the radio propagation environment and typical
radio planning criteria and exclude the required information between the
elements as headers. The GPRS represents the second step in the wireless
mobile data transmission development and the third step contains

type system, the UMTS is like a next generation of the GSM (it requires a
totally new radio system but it is still compatible and integrated to the
GSM) and WLAN is an other standard that could be merged to the GSM
in the future. The EDGE is based on the new modulation in the GSM
radio interface (phase shift keying, PSK) and enables higher bit rates per
time slot and while the maximum theoretical data rate is still based on
transmission by utilising 8 time slots in the radio connection. UMTS has a
new radio interface based on the Wideband Code Division Multiple
Access (WCDMA) which enables the maximum theoretical data rate
around 2 Mbit/s when the 3.840 MHz frequency spectrum is used (in the
future the data rates will be many times higher when more enhanced
modulation techniques are utilised). Correspondingly, the data rates in the
WLAN systems are 10–30 Mbit/s when the Code Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) are used in the radio interface. These “third step”
systems EDGE and UMTS can be used with GPRS and thus they support
the “always on” principle and the WLAN is still not compatible with the
GSM/UMTS or GPRS/EDGE. The influence of these packet transmission
technologies GPRS, EDGE and UMTS on the GSM radio interface and on
the radio system planning is explained in this and the next chapter. First
the GPRS and EDGE are explained in this chapter because they are still
based on the narrowband radio propagation channel (the frequency
channel bandwidth is 200 kHz in the GSM/GPRS/EDGE systems) and
time division multiple access (TDMA). The UMTS is explained
separately in Chapter 11 because the radio interface is changed to the
wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) that influences
significantly radio system planning.
10.1 Introduction to the GPRS radio network
The GPRS service requires some changes in the radio network
elements as in the base station and in the base station controllers. These
changes are mainly software related for the base stations and both
software and hardware related for the base station controller and their
functionalities and limitations have to be concerned when dimensioning
the radio network. The radio interface system planning itself is not
changing too much: the radio propagation environment (chapter 1) is
exactly equivalent to the circuit switched data (speech or e.g. HSCSD)
and also the radio planning process (chapter 2); even the power budget
(chapter 3) is similar for the GPRS radio access planning as for the circuit
switched planning. The radio planning changes happen only in the
detailed planning level when the planning thresholds (coverage and

capacity, chapters 4 and 6) are defined. It has to be noted that the coverage
and capacity planning as well as the Quality of Service (QOS) in the
GPRS are related to the signal-to-noise (S/N) or carrier-to-interference
(C/I) which are starting points when the radio planning criteria is defined
for the circuit switched or GPRS traffic.
These coverage and capacity planning criteria are the main issues
when considering the GPRS radio planning because the radio planning
process is equivalent to the normal circuit switched planning. However, it
has to be mentioned that the documentation and monitoring (Chapter 9),
which are important post-planning functions, have a strong effect on the
radio planning quality in the long-term. In the documentation some new
columns and rows have to be reserved for the time slot allocation
(capacity related) and the GPRS related radio parameters as well as
configurations in the base station controller have to be carefully
documented. Finally, the voice related key performance indicators (KPI)
are not enough for the GPRS data monitoring. The new values like
throughput (kbit/s) have to be observed continuously in order to know
whether the mobile users can be provided with the high quality GPRS
service. As a conclusion it can be noted that coverage prediction (Chapter
5), frequency planning (Chapter 7) and optimisation (Chapter 8) are
equivalent for the GSM circuit switch traffic and GPRS traffic.
10.1.1 BSS related GPRS elements
The BSS related GPRS implementation means changes in the radio
network and the installation of a new element called Serving GPRS
Support Node (SGSN). The base station changes are only software related
for the CS1–CS2 (CS = coding scheme, different coding schemes
correspond to the different level of error coding and thus also different
maximum data rates as shown in Table 10.1). In order to provide the
coding schemes CS3–CS4 some hardware changes are usually required in
the base stations and also in the transmission (16 kbit/s transmission is no
longer enough). Otherwise the GPRS does not have a significant influence
on base station products, only the radio planning criteria will be changed.
The implementation changes are bigger in the BSC where new hardware
is required for the CS1–CS2 schemes. The new item is a Packet Control
Unit (PCU) card (implemented typically in the base station or base station
controller [1]) that manages the GPRS traffic.
Team LRN

Each PCU card has its own limitations:
• 
Maximum number of TRXs
• 
Maximum number of BTSs
• 
Maximum number of transmission lines towards the BSC and
SGSN (Gb-interface, e.g. N * 64 kbit/s)
• 
Maximum number of PDP contexts
• 
Maximum traffic (e.g. N Mbit/s per PCU)
• 
Maximum number of routing areas (RA) or location areas
(LA)
• 
Redundancy.
These limitations define how the PCUs should be used and how the
GPRS should be merged to the existing GSM system. Also note that one
of the above mentioned items is typically a bottleneck for capacity
extensions and also typically defines the GPRS system pricing principle.
The following example demonstrates the priority of the different BSS
elements for the functionality and the costs of the GPRS system.

• 
Why this bottleneck exists, limitation of TRX amount, base

redundancy is very expensive)?
Each supplier may also have limitations in their GPRS solutions to use
e.g. the capacity functionalities like
• 
frequency hopping concepts
• 
overlay–underlay concepts
• 
something else.
This example concerned only the PCU card and the Gb-interface in the
BSC. Thus, the PCU card is very critical for the GPRS capacity and
system configuration but it is not the only element which effects the
GPRS capacity and upon the GPRS system costs. The BSC and PCU are
connected via the Gb-interface to the SGSN.
SGSN
The SGSN can be compared to the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) as
it is like a packet traffic switching centre. The SGSN is also a part of the
connection between the BSS and GPRS core network (SGSN, GGSN,
etc., see Figure 10.1) and therefore an understanding of the SGSN’s
capacity and configuration limitations can ensure the GPRS system
capacity in a radio interface. SGSN again may have different limitations:
• 
Maximum number of transmission lines towards each BSC
• 
Maximum number of PDP contexts (1 – N per subscriber)
• 
Maximum number of subscribers connected to the GPRS
network simultaneously (not transmitting but logged in)
• 
Maximum throughput or traffic in each PAacket Processing
Unit (PAPU),
• 
Maximum number of PAPU units in each SGSN
• 
Maximum number of routing areas (RA) or location areas
(LA) and their combinations between PAPU units (as well as
PCU units)
• 
Redundancy.
Hence, the performance of the SGSN depends on its capacity and
configuration limitations. The SGSN capacity is divided into PDP context
Team LRN

management and throughput which is x Mbit/s by simultaneously having y
thousand subscribers connected to the GPRS network. The critical
question is what throughput (x Mbit/s) is enough for what number of
subscribers (y thousand subscribers) or vice versa. If subscribers develop a
habit of opening the PDP context every morning, like with a computer (or
have the PDP context continuously open 24 h, this is also a GPRS
application pricing question) the SGSN capacity has to be dimensioned
based on the PDP contexts. It also has to be noted that x Mbit/s and y
thousand subscribers correspond to the average traffic that every
subscriber may use in the GPRS network (x Mbit/s/y thousand subs =
z kbit/s) which further corresponds to the total traffic of the busy hour
when multiplied by 3600 s. The forecasts of these data figures x, y, z may
vary significantly because subscriber behaviour in the GPRS networks is a
new and unknown topic.
10.2 
GPRS radio planning
10.2.1 GPRS coverage planning criteria and thresholds
The GPRS coverage planning criteria can be defined by specifying the
minimum required data transmission rate and thus the minimum carrier-
to-interference (C/I) or signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio requirement. The C/I
criteria is needed for high capacity areas/locations where frequencies are
reused often and thus the interference level is increased. Correspondingly,
the S/N criteria is needed for indoor locations where interference is not
limiting the data rate but the key issue is the lack of coverage (rural areas
are also included to this category). If the interference level is well-known
(e.g. it has been measured) and it is clearly above the noise level, it
determines the planning criteria for the maximum data rate at the different
locations. Thus, the GPRS coverage and data throughput rate can be fixed
based on the values in Figure 10.2. These values are simulated and some
measurements are still needed to ensure the correct C/I planning criteria
for the different data rates in the different radio propagation channels in
practise. In this interference limited case in Figure 10.2 the coverage is
already good enough but the interference is limiting the data transmission
rate: interference is already at such a high level that the radio network is
not any more coverage limited.

231
The noise or coverage limited case and the S/N based planning criteria
is more complex because the planning margins should be taken into
account when defining the planning threshold for the GPRS service
(coverage and data transmission rate). The planning threshold definition is
based in general on the downlink direction because the radio network
planning tools are typically developed for the downlink calculation as it
was assumed that the radio link budget is always balanced (the uplink and
downlink have the same maximum allowed path loss). The normal
downlink planning threshold definition for the GSM (the GPRS has not
yet been considered) is started from the sensitivity of the mobile station
that is –102 dBm for the 900 MHz mobiles based on the GSM
specification.[2] However, mobiles typically have much better sensitivity
level and the value –104 dBm can be used. Next, the required planning
margins (slow fading margin, fast fading margin, interference degrade
margin, body loss, mobile antenna orientation, indoor/in-vehicle
penetration loss) are added to the sensitivity level and the typical planning
thresholds are presented in Table 10.2. The threshold values –96 dBm and
–76 dBm correspond to the outdoor and indoor planning thresholds for
Team LRN

232 
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
voice calls in the radio networks where the location probability is 90
percent (slow fading margin = 5 dB).[3]
The GPRS radio planning threshold has to be defined the same way by
starting from the sensitivity level which has to be considered based on the
S/N requirements for the maximum data throughput rate in the GPRS. The
C/I margins in Figure 10.2 can approximately be used as S/N margins for
the noise limited situation because interference and noise are a similar
type of signals (coherent signals). Thus, the C/I criteria in Figure 10.2 can
be utilized as an S/N margin in the noise limited GPRS case and can be
added to the sensitivity level. The sensitivity level of –104 dBm already
corresponds to the S/N = 4–5 dB for speech. Thus, a new sensitivity level
for the GPRS is
– 104
(sensitivity level for the speech)
–     5      (S/N margin for the speech)
+
13            (GPRS C/I, CS2, Figure 10.2)
= –  96 dBm.
The margins from Table 10.2 have to be added for this new sensitivity
value –96 dBm and the new outdoor threshold for the GPRS data
transmission CS2 is – 96 + 3 + 5 = – 88 dBm and for the indoor locations
These aforementioned planning thresholds are for the noise limited
situations and the definition was based on the C/I simulations: it was
assumed that the interference and noise are similar types of signals.
Hence, the S/N based measurements have to be performed to confirm this
theoretical determination and to depict Figure 10.2 again by using the
– 96 + 3 + 5 + 20 = – 68 dBm.

correct S/N instead of C/I. The value 13 for the C/I or S/N is very
important because it almost provides the maximum transmission data rate
when the CS2 coding scheme is used and because the value 13-15 is very
widely used as a frequency planning criteria for the voice calls in the
GSM.
The equal planning thresholds can also be determined for the
interference limited case. The average interference level has to be
measured in the radio network and the planning margin in Figure 10.2 has
to be added to the average interference level in order to ensure the
required data transmission rate. If the interference level is for example
the maximum data rate of the coding scheme 2. Thus, a radio planning
threshold is –110 dBm + 13 dB = –97 dBm (GPRS sensitivity level) + 3
+ 5 = –88 dBm inside the building. This example shows also that the
interference level of –110 dBm and the mobile station sensitivity level of
10.2.2 GPRS capacity planning
The GPRS capacity planning in the base station subsystem (BSS)
includes the radio interface and base station controller capacity planning.
Both radio interface and BSC capacity planning have to take into account
that the GPRS data transmission is a new form of traffic in the GSM radio
network. The GPRS traffic is based on packets and thus its duration is
mostly very short compared to the circuit switched traffic as speech. The
conversation on average takes from 60 s to 120 s (1–2 minutes, sometimes
of course only 15 s and sometimes 1 hour) and Erlang-B formulas and
tables can be used to define the required capacity for the radio network.
The GPRS traffic may also be almost like speech in duration when a large
data amount is transmitted e.g. a transmission of 2 Mbit takes 40 s if the
transmission rate is 50 kbit/s. However, this 2 Mbit transmission is quite
rare and it takes only 40 s (<60–120 s). Typical data transmission may be
around 300 kbit which takes only 6 s time to transmit. This 6 s is quite a
short-term traffic and thus Erlang-B formulas may not be valid any more.
The final capacity of the GPRS depends on the radio network
configuration and on the capacities of the GPRS related elements as the

number of time slots in the radio interface Um

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
• 
number of the Gb-interfaces between the BSC and SGSN
• 
processing power of the PAPU units in the SGSN.
If any of these capacities is a bottleneck, the service level (data rate)
corresponds to the maximum data rate of the bottleneck unit and the QOS
may deteriorate (data rate reduction). The capacity requirements of the
PAPU units in the SGSN and PCU cards in the BSC are easy to define
because the traffic from the various subunits (the traffic from the several
base stations to the PCU card and the traffic from the several BSCs to the
PAPU unit) can easily be monitored and divided between the PAPU and
PCU elements. Thus, the capacity reservations can be done efficiently
based on the observations from the network and by following the average
traffic increase. Thus, the major GPRS capacity problem is in the radio
network because the maximum capacity reservation of 4–8 time slots
corresponds to the capacity over 15–30 percent of the total capacity of a
typical 3 transceiver base station.
Radio interface capacity planning
The radio interface for the GPRS has to be dimensioned based on a
specific traffic model as mentioned. This traffic model can finally be
verified when the GPRS traffic is monitored. The capacity management
can be made easier by having the dedicated circuit switched and GPRS
time slots and a group of time slots for both usage dynamically based on
the traffic requirements. The circuit switched traffic typically always has a
higher priority to use these “hybrid” circuit switched and GPRS time slots.
The “optimistic” way of calculating the maximum available GPRS traffic
at the base station is based on the circuit switched traffic and Erlang-B
formulas presented in the following example.
Example 2. GPRS traffic in Erlangs
2 TRX/base station = 8.1 Erl at 1 percent blocking
(16 time slots = 1 signalling +15 traffic)
15 traffic channels continuously used = 15 Erl
15 Erl – 8.1 Erl = 6.9 Erl for the GPRS
This example is optimistic because it assumes that the GPRS traffic
demand varies and always corresponds to the traffic that all the available
time slots (not used for the circuit switched traffic) can offer: based on
this principle the 2 TRX capacity would be 15 Erl and there is no blocking
Team LRN

General Packet Radio System (GPRS)
235
of GPRS calls at all. This example shows an extra capacity that can be
used for the data transmission if the data throughput rate is not concerned.
Thus, the available traffic (available number of time slots) for the GPRS
varies in this example from zero to N (N is maximum that can be used)
and the minimum throughput that is needed for a certain service like for
the video transmission can not be guaranteed; a good point when
concerning telematic applications (watch dogs) for which it is enough to
send the message for example during the next hour. For these cases the
example can be used because these telematic messages always can be sent
when there is a space in the radio interface. As a conclusion it can be
noted that the GPRS traffic includes applications for which the
transmission rates have to be guaranteed and applications that can be sent
when possible and the maximum traffic over the radio interface is
something between 8.1 and 15 Erl in the example.
Moreover, the capacity of the base station can be analysed by defining
each transceiver (8 time slots = the maximum data rate = 96 kbit/s, CS2)
or smaller set of time slots for the GPRS transmission as an independent
transmission channel. Thus, there would only be 3 “transmission
channels” in the base station in the case of 8 time slot transmission and
3 transceivers, and the capacity “could be estimated” by using Erlang-B
tables.
Example 3. The capacity of the 96 kbit/s data rate in the 3 transceiver
(TRX) base station
3 TRXs = 3 * 96 kbit/s channels = 0.46 Erl at 1 percent blocking
average data transmission 300 kbit 
300 kbit / 96 kbit/s
= 3 s = 0.8 mErl
number of the served subscribers per busy hour = 0.46 Erl / 0.8 mErl
= 575 Subs.
The same 3 TRX capacity can serve over 900 speech subscribers when
each subscriber loads the network 15 mErl. Moreover, first note that the
figures 575 and 900 depend fully on the traffic per subscriber. Second,
note that the figure 0.46 Erl is based on the Erlang-B formula that may not
be accurate for the GPRS traffic. Additionally 1 percent blocking is too
tight a criteria for the data traffic, which could be for example 10 percent.

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
PCU, Gb, SGSN capacity planning
The radio interface is the first bottleneck in the BSS when
dimensioning the GPRS capacity. The second bottleneck is the PCU card
that is typically implemented in the BSC as shown in Figure 10.3. The
PCU card throughput is an essential value that has to be compared to the
maximum number of transceivers and base stations that can be connected
to each PCU card. Moreover, the PCU card is connected to the SGSN (if
the PCU cards are implemented in the BSC) via the Gb-interfaces that
carry on the data and signalling.
The major capacity planning activity is to understand the traffic that is
coming from the radio network via the PCU cards. If the traffic from the
radio network is constant (especially the maximum traffic) the base
stations can be divided into different PCUs and the required number of 64
kbit/s Gb-interfaces can be allocated. The capacity planning rule for the
PCU is that as few PCUs should be used because the trunking effect is the
maximum when the resource pool (Gb-interfaces) is maximised: it is
better to have 8 Gb-interfaces in the 2 PCU cards than to have 2 Gb-
interfaces in the 8 PCU cards. The negative point of this configuration is
that one day PCU cards are overloaded and have to be reconfigured and
the base stations have to be moved to new PCU cards and changes may
also be done in the SGSN. If the traffic is not constant it is not easy to
divide the base stations to the different PCU cards. Additionally, the
redundancy in the Gb-interface has to be done based on the N + 1 or 2N
principle. The 2N requires a lot of extra Gb-interfaces and thus the
64 kbit/s links are easily limited. Finally, recall the maximum capacity of
the SGSN that includes the Mbit/s and number of PDP contexts. It can

also be concluded that the PCU/Gb capacity management is dependent on
the GPRS monitoring.
10.3 GPRS related radio network functionalities
The GPRS contains some new and modified functionalities in the radio
interface compared to the basic GSM specification. These functionalities
are related to the
• 
location/routing area (LA/RA) and paging
• 
mobile management (MM)
• 
radio resource management (RR)
• 
base station re-selection (no handover, network controlled
handover is an option in the GPRS, mobile is master).
Location/routing areas (LA/RA) and paging
The GPRS signalling principles are equal to the circuit switched
signalling principles except the paging that is based on routing areas (RA).
The routing area is a part of the location area or equals the location area
but it is never larger than the location area. The routing area is the most
exact unit that refers to the mobile station location when there is no data
transfer ongoing between the mobile station and base station. All the base
stations are always paged inside the routing area when a new GPRS data
transmission is activated from the network. Paging can be done by using
the circuit switching paging or by using the separate GPRS paging. The
circuit switching paging is enough (the separate GPRS paging is not
needed) if the location areas are small enough: the maximum number of
pages per busy hour that can be transmitted over the radio interface is
around 50000 when only one time slot and two CCCH blocks are used for
the signalling and paging in any of the base stations inside the location
area (the worst case). Thus, paging should not be an issue at the early
stages (during the first 2–4 years) of the GPRS.
Mobility management
Mobility management means that the mobile station location has to be
known with a certain accuracy and includes all the different GPRS serving
states. The mobility management states (in the GSM IDLE and
DEDICATED) in the GPRS are divided into IDLE, STANDBY and
READY.[1] IDLE means that the mobile station is not connected to
the GPRS core network (there is no PDP context activation).
Team LRN

238
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Correspondingly, STANDBY means that the mobile station is connected
to the GPRS core network (PDP context activation has been done) and
READY means that there is a request (mobile originated or mobile
terminated) to transmit data over the radio interface. READY therefore
refers to DEDICATED and STANDBY to IDLE in the GSM.
In IDLE mode the GPRS network does not know anything about the
mobile, and in the STANDBY mode the mobile station’s location is
known at the routing area level. The state is changed from STANDBY to
READY by sending a page from the network—only mobile terminated
GPRS calls—or when the mobile sends a service request in the uplink
direction. In READY mode the GPRS network knows the mobile station
location at the base station level.
Mobility management in the GPRS also includes the base station re-
selection and location update procedures especially at the routing area
boundaries. The location update has to be done every time the mobile
station changes routing area. The routing area boundary is critical and
some hysteresis (the same parameter cell_selection_hysteresis as in the
GSM) is needed in order to prevent continuous location updates if the
mobile station is only in the centre of the base station coverage areas.
Radio resource management
Good radio quality can only be ensured by guaranteeing enough radio
capacity without interference (radio resource management). This radio
capacity includes both the traffic channels and signalling channels. The
traffic channels are typically divided into the “only for the GPRS users =
GPRS” and “for both circuit switched and GPRS users = hybrid
GSM/GPRS” time slots. Additionally, the time slots on the BCCH
transceiver can have for example higher priority for the GPRS usage or
vice versa and in advanced solutions the GPRS capacity can also be
reserved from different frequency layers (900/1800 MHz). Besides these
freedoms there may also be some limitations in the radio interface due to
the capacity features like overlay–underlay concepts or frequency hopping
as already mentioned before.
Signalling happens in the GPRS almost like in the GSM and there are
no extra requirements for the GPRS. The required GPRS paging capacity
amount is often discussed but recall that paging happens only when there
is a mobile terminated (network originated) call and the page is sent only
Team LRN

General Packet Radio System (GPRS)
239
once when the data transmission starts (the mobile station changes the
state STANDBY 
READY). This paging is not a problem if the location
area planning has been done in a sensible way even if the routing areas
are set equivalent to the location areas.
The SDCCH or other signalling channels are not loaded more than in
the GSM either, actually e.g. the handover commands are left out from the
first releases of the GPRS because there are no network controlled
handovers.
Base station re-selection
In order to ensure mobility and good quality (high enough data rate) in
the GPRS the data transmission has to continue even if the mobile station
is handed over to the next base station. This is provided by the base
station re-selection based on the normal C1 or C2 criteria or on optional
GPRS criteria C31 and C32.[4] The mobile station measures the serving
base station and the neighbour base stations every 3–5 s both in the
“READY” (GPRS call is on) and “STANDBY” (no GPRS call but the
PDP context is activated) modes and makes the decision on the new
serving base station based on these measurement results.[3] Thus, the base
station re-selection may happen every 5 s even if the neighbour base
station is only 1 dB better if no hysteresis is used. The hysteresis (=
margin, parameter cell_selection_hysteresis [4]) for the re-selection is
used only at the location and routing area borders and only in the “IDLE”
mode in the GPRS. A new parameter called ready_state_cell_selection
_hysteresis [4] is required to define the base station's re-selection
hysteresis between the base stations within the same routing area in the
GPRS “READY” mode.
10.4 
GPRS parameters
The GPRS related radio parameters can be divided based on the GSM
categories signalling, radio resource management, mobility management,
measurements and handovers and power control. It can be noted that
signalling has to be emphasised because the separate packet transfer
signalling channels are introduced in the GPRS [5] and because the GPRS
cause an extra load on the signalling. Radio resource management
also needs some new radio parameters in order to handle the time
slot reservations for the GPRS transmission. Moreover, the mobility
management and measurements are not changing at all, nor the handovers
Team LRN

240
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
and power control only slightly. Hence, the GPRS does not cause too
much extra work in parameter planning and it is enough to take care the
location and routing area sizes (the easiest way is to have the location
areas equivalent to the routing areas) in order to ensure enough paging
capacity in the signalling and then to make a good strategy for the radio
resource management. In the radio resource management it has to be
decided whether the GPRS time slots are on the BCCH frequency or on
the second or third transceiver or whether the 900 or 1800 MHz frequency
channels are prioritised. Almost all these radio resource management
related parameters are supplier related. After defining the signalling and
radio resource management almost nothing can be done by the network in
order to control the GPRS call because the mobile station decides the cell
re-selection by using the hysteresis parameters in the different operating
modes.
10.5 
GPRS monitoring
The basic GSM monitoring, as explained in Chapter 9, can be used as
a basis for the GPRS monitoring as well. The traffic and blocking KPI
values give a direct and rough indication about the situation at each base
station when concerning the capacity. The basic GSM counters can also
be used efficiently for the evaluation of the GPRS transmission quality,
like throughput rate at each base station. For example the received power
level counters in the NMS can be set to measure the percentage of the
received power level values that exceed the threshold that corresponds to
the maximum throughput rate in the GPRS when using the different
coding schemes. The power level threshold for the maximum throughput
rate can be calculated from the base station’s and mobile station’s
sensitivity values as the planning thresholds. When these power level
measurements are performed from the operative network they represent
the actual situation in the radio network and thus these results can be used
in confidence when evaluating the GPRS coverage. However, some
counters are needed for the GPRS specific monitoring in order to specify
the overall GPRS transmission quality.
The GPRS monitoring is important because the planning thresholds
especially for the capacity are still more or less open. It also has to be
remembered that the whole monitoring is related to the capacity or data
rate observations because all the issues—as lack of coverage or lack of
time slots—have an influence on the data rate: there is actually no such
hard blocking directly in the GPRS as in the GSM when speech is
Team LRN

General Packet Radio System (GPRS)
241
considered. Thus, the critical monitoring item is a throughput or kbit/s.
The deterioration of the data throughput always indicates that there is a
coverage or interference problem in the radio network. The detailed
measurements and analysis are always needed to solve the reason for this
overall quality reduction.
10.6 Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE)
Enhanced Data rates for the GSM Evolution (EDGE) is an improved
packet data transmission technology in the GSM based on the radio
channel using 200 kHz bandwidth. EDGE is based on the phase shift
keying (PSK) modulation which makes it possible to increase the data
throughput per channel higher than 60 kbit/s (see Table 10.1 and thus the
maximum data throughput is more than 500 kbit/s when eight time slots
are used for the transmission.
The GPRS was a new type of technology because the traffic is a packet
type (no longer circuit switched), there are new elements required to
handle the packet type of traffic and the functionality of the radio network
was also changed due to mobile station independence (the mobile station
is not a slave in the GPRS because it controls the base station re-selection
procedure). The radio system planning process in the GPRS is similar to
that of traditional GSM and only some changes are needed in the detailed
level planning for the coverage (new planning thresholds for the noise and
interference limited cases) and capacity issues (new traffic model). The
EDGE does not change anything compared to the GPRS radio planning
except new planning thresholds are required again for the coverage
planning. The traffic is still packet based and thus the same traffic model
(maybe with some slight modification) can still be used in the EDGE as in
the GPRS. Hence, the EDGE does not have a significant effect on radio
system planning in the detailed level but for the long-term strategy it has a
strong influence because the base station locations should be optimally
selected for the GSM, GPRS and EDGE services which have in the worst
case almost 20 dB difference in coverage planning thresholds. This long-
term strategy becomes still more complicated when the wideband UMTS
system at 2100 MHz frequency band is taken into account in the radio
planning process.
Team LRN

242
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
10.7 Conclusions
At a general level it can be concluded that the GPRS or EDGE radio
planning is quite equivalent to the GSM and the GPRS/EDGE planning
challenges arise from capacity planning (and from the coverage planning
for the indoor and rural areas) (see Table 10.3). The GPRS or EDGE
traffic demand (traffic model) from the radio network is a critical
parameter that has to be optimised in order to maximise the radio Quality
of Service (the coverage, capacity, interference level) and cost efficiency.
Additionally, radio network monitoring has to be emphasised in order to
get the information about the behaviour of mobile users.

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
UNIVERSAL MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATION
SYSTEM (UMTS)
11.1 Introduction to UMTS
The objective of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System
(UMTS) is to provide wireless services, which require higher data rates
than can be offered in the GSM/GPRS/EDGE radio networks. The UMTS
is thus an evolution for the GSM because it can offer the voice calls but
also much higher bit rates for the wireless mobile connections. Hence, the
critical improvement in the UMTS is data transmission enhancement
compared to the GSM radio interface. In the future the UMTS may be
used more for data transmission than for voice calls and the GSM will be
used more for speech because it already has good enough voice quality.
Because data transmission is the key issue in UMTS the discussion turns
to the data rates that can be achieved in the UMTS and to the services that
can be provided for mobile users.
These mobile data services can be divided into different classes based
on content (banking, entertainment, etc.) or based on the required “media”
e.g. short messages, pictures or video channel. These different “media”
reserve the radio network in a different way (one short message reserves
only few a percent of the base station total capacity and a video channel
may reserve 10–50 percent of the capacity) and thus the radio network
dimensioning has to be done based on these service and capacity
requirements.
The key issue is to understand the capacity requirements of the
different services and to adapt these services and capacity needs in the
radio networks. Thus, the conversation between the service providers and
the radio network operators has to be continuous and done well in order to
agree the services that can be delivered over the whole or partial radio
network. This discussion needs careful business plans, which again need
an understanding of the service portfolios and also of the radio network
implementations. The key instruments in the UMTS evolution—data,
services and implementation—and the GSM/UMTS integration are seen
in Figure 11.1.

The implementation and implementation strategy have to be planned
carefully because the UMTS is a totally new system. The UMTS operates
in the frequency band of 2100 MHz which is more than double compared
to the 900 MHz and clearly higher than 1800 MHz which are typically
used in the GSM (1900MHz in the USA). These differences in the
operating frequencies mean that the radio propagation is not equivalent
and the old base station coverage areas are not necessarily valid in the
UMTS frequency band. This generates problems in implementation
because the old base station sites would be very cost-efficient to reuse but
simultaneously they are necessarily not the most optimal locations for the
coverage. This selection of the base station site reuse depends heavily on
the implementation strategy (a continuous or discontinuous UMTS
coverage) and on the traffic forecasts: whether the continuous UMTS
radio network will be implemented within 3 years or in 10 years period.
WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) was selected as
the radio interface technology of the UMTS systems. It is totally different
from the technology used in the GSM. Fortunately the basic radio system
planning philosophy does not change but almost all the detailed planning
items concerned, e.g. the power budget, have to be checked and adjusted
to be suited for the WCDMA technology. Also the radio system planning
process has to be modified slightly from the traditional model because the
traffic can vary from the speech to the 2 Mbit/s data and it can be either
circuit switched or packet based. All these detailed differences between

simultaneously explaining the UMTS radio system planning as an
evolutionary step to the GSM radio system planning.
11.2 UMTS radio interface
11.2.1 WCDMA air interface specification
The WCDMA specification has certain key features that are listed
below: [1–5]
• 
DS-CDMA
• 
Chip rate 3.84 Mchip/s
• 
FDD and TDD modes
• 
Channel bandwidth about 5 MHz with center frequency raster
of 200 kHz
• 
Multirate and -service
• 
10 ms frame with 15 time slots.
WCDMA air interface is based on direct sequence code division
multiple access (DS-CDMA) technology. This means that the user data
sequence is multiplied with a so-called spreading sequence (DS), whose
symbol (also called chip) rate is much higher than the user data rate; this
spreads the user data signal to a wider frequency band. The relation between
user data rate and chip rate is called a spreading factor
The chip rate in WCDMA is 3.84 Mchip/s and spreading factors are in the
range of 4 to 512, thus the user net bit rates supported by one code
channel are in the range of 1 to 936 kbit/s in the downlink. Up to 3
parallel codes can be used for one user, giving bit rates up to 2.3 Mbit/s.
In the uplink data rates are half of these figures, because of modulation
differences.
WCDMA standard includes two modes of operation, WCDMA/FDD
and WCDMA/TDD. WCDMA/FDD is a frequency duplex mode, in
which the uplink and downlink signals are at different frequency bands.
WCDMA/TDD is a time domain duplex mode, where the uplink and
downlink signals are at the same frequency but separated to different time
periods. Later in this book WCDMA refers to WCDMA/FDD because this
will most probably be the air interface, which is first deployed and
utilised.
Team LRN

Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) 
249
The nominal channel bandwidth of WCDMA signal is 5 MHz as
illustrated in Figure 11.2. The specification gives the flexibility to define
the exact channel centre frequency at 200 kHz raster, so that the actual
channel separation utilised might be smaller than the nominal 5 MHz
down to the minimum of 4.4 MHz specified. This has to be noted
carefully because it might cause interference in the network.
The aim of UMTS radio interface specification and selection work was
to achieve a system which has the flexibility to support a large range of
different services, some of them not even thought of today. This is
implemented as a support for largely different data rates and different
channel types from circuit switched to shared packet channels. The
WCDMA radio interface also supports multiple simultaneous services via
different channel types offered to one user. [6]
The transmission in WCDMA is split to 10 ms radio frames each of
which consists of 15 pieces of 666 
(2560 chips) timeslots. The bit rate
and, for example, channel coding can be changed every 10 ms frame,
offering very flexible control of the user data rate. Every timeslot has bits
reserved for pilot signal, power control (TPC bits), transport format
indication (TFCI bits) and also if needed closed loop transmit diversity
(FBI bits). The exact signal format and multiplexing is quite different in
uplink and downlink signalling.[6,7] Also the dedicated and shared
channels have several differences in signal format.

11.2.2 Propagation environment
The radio propagation environment was divided in Chapter 1 into
outdoor and indoor classes and the outdoor class further divided into
macrocellular and microcellular propagation environments and moreover
the macrocellular type of environment can still contain different building
densities such as urban, suburban or rural type of area. The grouping of
these different classes is depicted in Figure 11.3. Each of these
propagation environments has special characteristics of the radio
propagation channel.
The radio propagation channel typical to each radio propagation
environment class can be characterised by the following main properties
• 
angular spread
• 
delay spread
• 
fast and slow fading characteristics
• 
propagation slope.
When we want to understand the difference between GSM and UMTS
radio interface performance, the most important property of the channel is
the delay spread. That describes the amount of multipath propagation in
the propagation environment of the radio link. The delay spread can be
calculated from the typical (estimated or measured) power delay profile,
which describes the signal power as a function of the delay. Power delay
profile can be presented also as impulse (power) response of the channel.
Figure 11.4 presents an example of power delay profile based on the
channel model defined in reference [8].
Team LRN

Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
251
The delay spread 
can be calculated from the power delay profile, as
was presented in Chapter 1. Typical values of delay spread for different
environments are presented in Table 11.1.
Power delay profile and delay spread are time domain properties of the
radio channel. The effect of the multipath to the radio channel can also be
described by the frequency domain properties of the radio channel. In the
frequency domain multipath causes frequency selective fading, signals at
different frequencies have different fading (amplitude and phase). The
frequency response of the channel can be calculated as fast fourier
transformation (FFT) of complex impulse response of the channel. Figure
11.5 presents the frequency response of the channel, whose power delay
profile was presented in Figure 11.4.
One frequency domain property of the channel is coherence bandwidth
. It can be calculated from the time domain property delay spread as was
shown in Equation 1.3. Coherence bandwidth is the minimum frequency
separation of two carriers, which have significantly uncorrelated fading.
Table 11.1 shows the calculated coherence bandwidths typical for
different radio propagation environments.

RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Often when different air interface technologies like WCDMA and GSM
are compared one argument is whether the system is narrowband or
wideband, WCDMA is called wideband and GSM narrowband systems for
example. The system is narrowband when the radio signal bandwidth is
much smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the radio channel and
wideband when it is much larger. Thus that system property depends
strongly on the typical propagation environment in which the system is used
and might be different in different environments. This is shown in
Table 11.1. We can see, for example, that in typical urban channel UMTS is
a wideband system and in the GSM neither clearly narrow- or wideband.
But in the typical indoor cell environment both of these systems are
narrowband systems.

Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) 
253
As was mentioned the coherence bandwidth is related to the
correlation of fading between different frequencies in a channel. In a
propagation environment where a system is narrowband the fading is
frequency non-selective or also called flat. In the wideband environment
fading for signal frequencies is uncorrelated and the fading is called
frequency selective. Figure 11.7 shows the UMTS and GSM system
signals in a typical urban [8] channel. We can see that the fading is clearly
frequency selective for the UMTS signal but for GSM the fading is more
flat.
Team LRN

254
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
As explained in Chapter 1, slow fading is caused by buildings or other
structures and natural obstacles attenuating the radio signal. This variation
of signal level does not directly depend on the system used (for example
GSM or UMTS); the only factor, which has to be taken into account, is
the signal carrier frequency. The slow fading characteristics of the radio
channel are different for each signal at different frequencies, but how
exactly they are changed is not well known. Implicitly one could conclude
that the standard deviation of the signal level is higher for higher
frequencies, because the signal is affected more by obstructions.
The same logic that was used for slow fading characteristics applies
also to propagation slope. Thus in practical planning the best way to take
into account possible changes in propagation slope characteristics is to
tune the propagation model that is used.
11.2.3 Receiver performance
The main component of a CDMA receiver is a so called correlator,
which consists of code multiplication and integration units. A code
generator is also required to generate the local replica of the spreading
code used to wipe off the spreading code from the received signal, to de-
spread the signal. This is represented in Figure 11.8.
The spreading code autocorrelation function has a high peak only at
zero code phase difference (Figure 11.9). At larger than 1 chip code phase
difference 
the signal will be attenuated about factor
Team LRN

Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
255
spreading factor). The exact attenuation depends on the exact
autocorrelation function of the spreading code.
Because of the autocorrelation function the code phases of the
incoming signal and local code replica has to match within a fraction of
chip time in order to maximise the received signal level at the output of
the correlator. The chip duration of WCDMA signal is
When we compare the chip duration to the typical urban channel
multipath impulse response, for example the one presented in Figure 11.5,
we can see that the maximum delay difference between the first multipath
component and the last one 
can be much larger than the
WCDMA chip duration (0.26 
One correlator receiver is capable of
receiving the signal power falling within the window of roughly one chip,
the rest of the signal is attenuated by the spreading factor (Figure 11.9).
Optimum performance is achieved when all the multipath components can
be used. This has led to the use of a Rake receiver structure utilising
several parallel correlators (also called fingers). Figure 11.10 shows the
main structure and blocks of a Rake receiver.
Team LRN

256
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
In addition to the correlator, each Rake finger has a phase and
amplitude estimator. The phase estimate is used to equalise the phases of
the fingers before the summation and the amplitude estimate is used to
weight the fingers with their respective amplitudes. This combining
method is called Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC).[9] It is proved to be
the optimum method to combine several signals. One basic property of
MRC is that the fingers with no signal are omitted from the summation to
prevent the increase of noise level.
A channel impulse response estimator is required to allocate the delays
for the Rake fingers. The estimation and allocation process is continuous
as the channel changes continuously when the receiver moves.
The performance of a Rake receiver depends on the radio propagation
channel and its multipath propagation conditions. As mentioned before the
aim of a Rake receiver is to receive and combine the relevant channel
multipath components. The larger the number of multipath components
that can be separated (delay difference is larger than chip time) the better
Team LRN

Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
257
is the performance of the Rake receiver. That number of multipath
components can also be called multipath diversity as each finger can be
seen as a diversity channel.
In Figure 11.11 the impulse response of a typical urban channel [8] is
presented along with one possible allocation of Rake finger delays and
amplitudes. It can be seen that a significant number of Rake fingers can be
allocated in this channel condition. Thus the amount of multipath diversity
is high and the performance of the Rake receiver is good.
In Figure 11.12 an example of an indoor channel impulse response is
shown. All the significant multipath components fall within one chip
interval and the Rake receiver cannot separate them. In conditions like this
the fading is flat and the system is narrowband (Table 11.1), there is no
multipath diversity. The chip rate and signal bandwidth should be much
larger in order to separate the multipath components and to utilise
multipath diversity.

11.3 UMTS radio system planning
The main focus in this section is to describe the differences between
GSM radio system planning and UMTS radio system planning. Often it is
claimed that CDMA planning is much more difficult and complex than
planning of TDMA based systems. Partly the claim is true because many
aspects of planning are more closely tied to each others in UMTS
planning than they are, for example, in GSM planning. However, the
principles of good planning are valid for both UMTS and GSM radio
interface. Differences exist mainly because of the implementation of the
different technologies rather than the planning principles.
11.3.1 UMTS radio system planning process
The UMTS radio system planning process is similar to the GSM
planning process. The phases of the planning process are:
• 
dimensioning
• 
configuration planning
• 
coverage and capacity planning
• 
code planning (and  frequency planning)
• 
parameter planning
• 
optimisation and monitoring.
Team LRN

Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
259
Also, the planning targets are the same as they are in GSM. In general
the aim is to maximise
• 
coverage
• 
capacity
• 
quality.
The major differences in the radio system planning process in the
UMTS happen in the coverage and capacity planning. In the GSM
coverage planning was made separately after dimensioning (the base
station amount is estimated in the dimensioning phase in the GSM and the
base station sites can be planned fairly well without knowing the capacity
requirements), and capacity and frequency planning were made in tandem.
In the UMTS the coverage and capacity planning have to be made
together because of capacity requirement and traffic distribution influence
on coverage. The frequency plan can be made separately, or is not needed
at all.
All the UMTS radio system planning phases include, of course, the
detailed level changes—power budget, antenna line equipment, traffic
model, parameter and monitoring changes—compared to the GSM.
However, the radio system planning process has to be modified only in
the aforementioned part which is depicted in Figure 11.13.
Figure 11.13 shows directly one key issue in the UMTS coverage and
capacity planning namely the influence of traffic data that has to be
emphasised continuously in the UMTS radio planning. The distribution of
the traffic data to the voice and different data calls at each base station
coverage area should be known as accurately as possible. Also the
location of the different mobile users—or actually the power budget of
each mobile user—should be known as exactly as possible. It is of course
Team LRN

260
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
not possible to know these mobile user locations exactly but the more
accurately they can be forecast the better the radio network can be
designed, in theory.
The other—not directly seen—key issue in the WCDMA radio
coverage and capacity planning is the regional traffic distribution or the
existence of traffic hot spots in the radio network coverage area. This
issue is related to the base station site locations which should be selected
such that they are always placed on the traffic hot spots and as such
offering the best power budget for the mobile users served by those base
stations. This base station placement significantly reduces power levels in
the radio network and thus also interference, and furthermore increases
capacity.
In the dimensioning phase a fixed load for all the base stations within
the targeted area is assumed. The value for the load can be the maximum
acceptable load for the cells or it can be the predicted load during the busy
hour. If the highest acceptable load is used the dimensioning is done
according to the worst-case scenario and this may lead to an unnecessary
high number of sites. Thus it is better to use the predicted load because it
will give more realistic results in dimensioning. In the detailed planning
phase the traffic distribution is used to allocate the predicted traffic to the
planned cells. This may lead to situations in which the load between the
cells can vary remarkably—some cells may have a load that is very close
to the maximum acceptable load and some cells may have a fairly low
load. In the detailed planning phase coverage targets are also checked. In
dimensioning it was assumed that traffic is evenly distributed. Also, it was
assumed in dimensioning that propagation is similar for all the cells. Thus
all the cells are identical in dimensioning. In the detailed planning
coverage predictions can be quite different between the cells due to
propagation environment and due to traffic distribution.
11.3.2 WCDMA configuration planning
WCDMA coverage planning is commenced from the configuration
planning (the power budget calculation). The power budget in the
WCDMA as in the GSM takes into account the base station equipment
configuration and the base station antenna line configuration. The
WCDMA power budget also contains some new parameters that were not
used in the GSM power budget. A typical power budget for WCDMA is
presented in Figure 11.14.
Team LRN

Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
261
The power budget is calculated based on the following assumptions:
• 
uplink bit rate is 64 kbps and downlink bit rate is 144 kbps
• 
predicted load in uplink is 30 percent and in downlink
50 percent
• 
1 W output power at the BTS is reserved for a connection.
Team LRN

262
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The presented power budget is divided into five parts, namely
• 
General information
• 
Service information
• 
Receiving end
• 
Transmitting end
• 
Isotropic path loss.
In General information the frequency band, chip rate, temperature and
Boltzman’s constant are given. In Service information the bit rates and
loads for uplink and downlink are defined. Receiving end and
Transmitting end define the radio links in the uplink and downlink
directions. Finally, Isotropic path loss defined the maximum achievable
path loss between the receiver and transmitter.[10]
11.3.2.1 Receiving end parameters
Thermal noise density defines the noise floor due to the thermal noise.
The calculation for the density is given in Equation 11.2. The values used
in the calculations are taken from the Figure 11.14 uplink direction.
where
N 
is thermal noise density
k 
is Boltzman’s constant
T 
is temperature in Kelvin.
When the Receiver noise figure is added to thermal noise density the
results are called the Receiver noise density, (it defines the noise density at
the receiver). Noise power defines the noise power at the receiver within
the channel bandwidth of the receiver [10]
Team LRN

UniversalMobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
263
where
is noise power
F 
is noise figure of the receiver
B 
is chip rate.
In WCDMA there is interference from the original cell and from the
neighbouring cells. The degradation of coverage and capacity is modelled
with an interference margin. This depends on the load as shown in
Equation 11.4.
where 
is interference margin.
The load is always compared to the maximum capacity of the cell
(called pole capacity) so the load is always in between 0 percent and
100 percent. Figure 11.15 shows that the interference margin grows
towards infinity if load increases to 100 percent.
Receiver interference power describes the noise level at the receiver
due to interference i.e. without thermal noise. The calculation is done by
subtracting Noise power from the sum of Noise power and Interference
margin. It must be noted that the calculation is done by using the absolute
values not dBs. Equation 11.5 shows the calculation.
Team LRN

264
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
Total noise is the noise floor including thermal noise, noise generated
by the receiver (noise figure) and the interference.
Processing gain is a gain that is achieved due to spreading. The gain
can be calculated with Equation 11.6.
where
PG is processing gain,
B 
is chip rate and
W is the bit rate of the information (symbol rate).
Required 
that is needed to be able to demodulate the signal
shows ratio between the received energy per bit and noise energy. The
value should be selected based on the service. Usually equipment
manufactures indicate 
values for different services that can be used
for their equipment.
Receiver sensitivity is the signal level that is required at the antenna
port of the receiver to be able to achieve acceptable quality in receiving.
This value is comparable to the sensitivity that is presented in a link
budget for GSM (recall Chapter 3).
The antenna line parameters for a WCDMA cell are very similar to the
parameters for a GSM cell. There are some remarks that must be made:
• 
LNA will be used in almost all cells. It improves uplink
coverage but also uplink capacity.
• 
Soft handover gain is not used in GSM. In UMTS a mobile
can communicate with several base stations at the same time.
This improves the performance of the receiving end.
However, sometimes soft handover gain is included in
Team LRN

UniversalMobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
265
and in this case soft handover gain should not be included in
link budget as a separate item.
• 
Power control headroom is a parameter that is used to reserve
some power for the situations where power control cannot
compensate deep dips (i.e. fast fading). This occurs usually on
the cell edge. The power control headroom reduces cell range
when reserving some power for compensating fast fading.
11.3.2.2 Transmitting end
Transmitting end in the WCDMA power budget is similar to GSM
power budget. There are some differences as listed below.
• 
BTS power is given per user in WCDMA. In GSM one user
gets the full power of a TRX when using the time slot. In
WCDMA the output power of a BTS is shared between the
control channel and all the users in a cell. In power budget
calculations usually the maximum power per connection is
defined to model the downlink direction in a realistic manner.
If a user could use the full power of a WCDMA BTS this
would mean that there cannot be other users in that cell at that
moment.
• 
In WCDMA base stations there are not similar combiner that
are used in GSM thus there are no combiner loss in the power
budget.
11.3.2.3 Isotropic path loss
Isotropic path loss is calculated in the same way as it is for a GSM
cell. In WCDMA power budget there can be remarkable differences in
isotropic path losses between uplink and downlink. The main reasons for
these differences are asymmetry in traffic and different bit rates in the
uplink and downlink. Asymmetry in traffic is expected to happen
especially in packet data. The ratio can be as high as 1:10 (UL:DL) or
even higher. Partly this is reflected to the bit rates in the uplink and
downlink directions.
The isotropic path loss is used for cell range calculations in a similar
way as it is used in GSM. In Figure 11.16 cell range for the urban area is
calculated based on the isotropic path loss, antenna heights and slow
fading margin.
Team LRN

266
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
11.3.3 WCDMA coverage and capacity planning
Coverage and capacity planning in WCDMA are tied closely together.
In low traffic areas planning of WCDMA is quite similar to GSM because
load does not have great impact on coverage. Of course, there are many
details that differ between the systems but the main principles can be
applied to both systems. In high traffic areas planning of GSM is focusing
on frequency planning—the better frequency plan that can be achieved the
higher capacity is obtained. Also, cell splitting in GSM can be considered
as a straight forward process. In WCDMA there is no such clear split
between coverage, interference and capacity.
Team LRN

UniversalMobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
267
11.3.4 WCDMA propagation prediction and coverage planning
The propagation predictions contain in the WCDMA the same
planning phases as in the GSM. First, the base station configuration and
thus the power budget have to be defined. At the same time the
dimensioning exercise has to be done in order to decide the suitable
average effective antenna height over the service area. It has to be
remembered that the antenna height definition has as significant an
influence on the radio network infrastructure as on the base station site
locations or site distances. Also the coverage threshold has to be well
defined in order to exceed the required quality criteria but not to make
extra investments for the radio network elements. Moreover the capacity
targets and forecasts has to be well known at this phase because they have
a strong effect on the base station coverage areas.
When the base station antenna height, coverage threshold and the
capacity requirements are defined and the base station configuration is
clarified in the power budget calculations the actual propagation
prediction process can start. This process begins with the propagation
measurements also called radio propagation verification measurements,
for tuning the prediction model(s). These measurements are used and
needed especially for the prediction models for the design of macro base
stations. In the micro or pico base station environments the measurements
are also required but they are not used as much for the prediction model
verifications (but the measurement results are used without prediction
models). After conducting the measurement campaign over the WCDMA
service area the prediction model has to be tuned. When the prediction
model is tuned the final base station parameters can be used to make the
propagation predictions.
11.3.5 WCDMA planning margins and coverage thresholds
The final coverage planning starts when the coverage prediction
models are tuned and the real base station and base station antenna line
configuration parameters are added to the coverage planning tool. The
evaluation of the optimised base station locations can be done when the
planning criteria—planning threshold is defined. This planning threshold
means that the reasonable QOS level for the different geographical
locations have to be agreed: first major national areas, cities and roads
where coverage has to exist and then sub-areas of them such as urban and
Team LRN

268
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
suburban areas. The planning threshold also concerns whether the service
has to be extended inside vehicles and buildings in different areas.
The planning threshold itself is defined as in the GSM by starting from
the mobile station sensitivity (threshold is for the downlink direction) and
by adding the required planning margins to the sensitivity value. The
required margins are slightly different in the WCDMA and they are
• 
slow fading margin (shadowing)
• 
macro diversity or soft handover gain
• 
power control head room
• 
body loss, antenna orientation loss
• 
in-vehicle or indoor penetration loss
• 
interference margin.
The planning threshold is calculated by adding all these components to
the mobile station sensitivity as shown in Equation 11.7.
In Equation 11.7 it should noted that sometimes macro diversity gain
is included in sensitivity. In that case macrodiversity_gain should not be
used in calculating the planning threshold.
11.3.6 WCDMA capacity planning
WCDMA capacity planning is directly related to the power budget and
thus to the base station coverage area. In the power budget in Figure 11.14
only one type of service (64/144 kbit/s data transmission) was introduced
and thus the base station coverage area is fixed for this service. There is a
possibility of having any type of service between the voice calls and
2 Mbit/s data traffic in the WCDMA base station.
This means that the base station coverage area (a coverage boundary)
is different for different users in the downlink and uplink directions (see
Figure 11.17). The coverage area is reduced in the downlink because of
the increased power requirement for the connection: the minimum energy
per bit at the reception is constant but the bit rate increases.
Correspondingly in the uplink direction the interference increases—or the
base station coverage area reduces—if the transmission rate is larger.
Team LRN

Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
269
Basically the question is about the processing gain, PG, which varies
significantly when comparing the 12.2 kbps voice call (PG = 25 dB) and
2 Mbps data transmission (PG = 2.8 dB) connections.
In the uplink direction the main objective in capacity planning is
to limit interference from the other cells to an acceptable level.
Equation 11.8 gives the load in the uplink direction.
where
i        is interference from other cells
N 
 is total number of active users in a cell
W 
is bandwidth
is user bit rate
is energy of bit
is energy of interference
is activity (e.g. voice activity).
Network planning can affect the uplink load by reducing i. This is
done by avoiding unnecessary overlapping of the cells. This can achieved
Team LRN

270
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
by using buildings, hills, etc., as obstacles blocking the interfering cells.
Also, tilting will be a very useful tool in limiting the interference.
In the downlink directions (Equation 11.9) there are two aspects that
should be considered. First, the interference from the other cells, i, and the
power of the base station. The load equation for the downlink is similar to
the equation for uplink. However, in the downlink equation there is a new
parameter called orthogonality, v. Orthogonality shows the degree in
which the users in the same cell interfere with each other. If orthogonality
is 100 percent the users do not cause interference for other users in the
same cell. [10]
Because the output power of the base station transmitter is shared by
all the users in the cell it is possible that the power of the transmitters
limits the capacity in downlink direction. The required power (P) at the
base station is given in Equation 11.10.[10]
In Equation 11.10 L is an average path loss between the base station and a
mobile.
In the downlink direction network planning can affect interference
from other cells, i, and the average loss between base station and mobile,
L. Interference from other cells can be reduced by designing dominance
areas of the cells as well as possible. The path loss between the base
station and the mobiles can be minimised, for example, by selecting the
right antenna locations. Also, repeaters and indoor solutions will increase
capacity by reducing the path loss.[10]
Team LRN

UniversalMobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)
271
11.3.7 WCDMA code and frequency planning
In the WCDMA code and frequency planning are seen as a simple task
from a network planning point of view. The system takes care of most of
the code allocation. The main task for network planning will be the
allocation of scrambling codes for the downlink. There are 512 set of
scrambling codes available so it can be said that the code reuse for
downlink is 512. This means that code allocation is a pretty simple task.
However, it is recommended that the allocation is done with the help of a
planning system because there is always possibility for an error if the
allocation is done manually.
Frequency planning will have minor importance compared with GSM.
At most the UMTS operators have two or three carriers thus there is not
much to plan. However, there are a few decisions that the operators have
to make,
• 
which carrier(s) is used for macro cells?
• 
which carrier(s) is used for micro cells?
• 
any carrier(s) is reserved for indoor solutions?
When making the decisions the interference aspects should be
considered. The selection of the carriers may have an impact on intra-
operator and inter-operator interference. For example, micro cells can
locally cause quite high interference for operator’s macro cells or another
operator’s macro or micro cells. Many of the potential problems can be
solved by proper network planning and one of the tools to solve these
problems is the selection of frequencies.
11.3.8 WCDMA optimisation and monitoring
The WCDMA like the GSM system needs continuous monitoring
because the mobile users’ location and traffic behaviour varies all the
time. This monitoring requirement is only emphasised in the WCDMA
because the traffic demand can vary strongly and this variation influences
directly the radio network quality. The better and more accurately the
traffic amount and locations can be modelled the better and more
efficiently (cost, quality, etc.) the radio network can be designed and
implemented.
Team LRN

272
RADIO INTERFACE SYSTEM PLANNING FOR GSM/GPRS/UMTS
The indicators that should be monitored are, for example,
•
•
•
•
•
•
traffic
traffic deviation
traffic mix
soft handover
percentage
average TX power
average RX power
•
•
•
•
•
•
drop calls
handovers per call
handovers per cell
inter-system handovers
throughput
BER, BLER, FER
Many of the listed indicators should be collected on a cell and service
basis because it may give some hints on how to optimise the parameters to
enhance the performance of the network.

11.4 Conclusions
The UMTS radio interface system planning has the same basic
philosophy as the GSM but varies in the detail mainly because of the
change of radio propagation channel that is a wideband type. The major
subjects and findings are again gathered, in Table 11.2, to summarise the
major issues concerning radio interface system planning in the UMTS.
